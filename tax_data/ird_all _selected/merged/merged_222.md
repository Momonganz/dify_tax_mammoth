That section repealed ss 226 to 233 of the Income Tax Act and substituted new ss 226 to 233. 1.2 The basic scheme of taxing income derived by trustees either to the trustee or to the benefici- ary is largely unchanged. Income is assessable to the beneficiary (or to the trustee as agent of the beneficiary) if during the income year in which it was derived by the trustee it vests absolutely in interest in the beneficiary or if during that income year or within six months thereafter it is paid or applied to or for the benefit of the beneficiary. This income is referred to as "beneficiary income". All income derived by the trustee which is not benefi- ciary income is assessable to the trustee as trustee income . 1 .3 However, there are three main changes to the taxation of income derived through trusts. The first is that the distinction between specified trusts and non-specified trusts has been removed and income derived by trustees which is not also derived by a beneficiary (ie trustee income) is taxed at the same rate for all trusts. The second is that the test for determining when income is assessable to beneficiaries has been broadened. This has been achieved by replacing the entitled in possession test under the previous trust regime with a vesting absolutely in interest test and by removing limitations on the ability to have income taxed as beneficiary income by paying or applying it to or for the benefit of the beneficiary. 1.4 The distinction between specified trusts and non-specified trusts, and the restrictions on paying or applying income to a beneficiary, were intro- duced in order to limit opportunities for income splitting through trusts. The removal of the speci- fied - non-specified trust distinction, the replace- ment of the entitled in possession test with the vesting absolutely in interest test and the removal of the restrictions on paying or applying income to a beneficiary reflect the fact that income splitting through trusts is not considered to be a matter of concern in view of the flatter personal income tax rates now prevailing. However, the extent to which trusts can be used to have income taxed at a lower rate has been limited by excluding income derived by beneficiaries from the low income rebate calculated under s .50D of the Income Tax Act. 1.5 Thethird major change to the taxation of income derived through trusts is in relation to the treatment of income derivedthrough trusts with non-resident trustees . Under the previous trust regime foreign source income derived by non- resident trustees of a trust settled by a person resident in New Zealand was not liable for income tax as it was derived and it was generally consid- ered that it was not assessable to resident benefici- aries if it was distributed more than six months after the end of the income year in which it was derived by the trustee. These defects are dealt with under the new trust regime in two ways. First, subject to several exceptions it is provided that resident settlors of trusts are liable to income tax on trustee income derived during an income year if no trustee of the trust is resident in New Zealand at all times during the income year. Second, it is provided that beneficiaries of certain trusts (re- ferred to as foreign trusts and non-qualifying trusts in the legislation) are liable for income tax in respect of certain distributions which do not constitute beneficiary income . The combined effect of these two measures is to limit opportunities for using trusts with non-resident trustees to accumu- late and distribute foreign source income free of New Zealand tax. 1 .6 This bulletin provides an explanation of the new trust taxation regime. Part 2 of the bulletin contains a broad overview of the main features of the new regime. It is general in nature and if a more detailed explanation is required the succeed- ing parts of the bulletin, Parts 3 to 15, should be considered. Parts 3 to 15 of the bulletin generally follow the scheme of the legislation, starting with the provision governing the application of the new regime and then proceeding sequentially through the provisions which comprise the new regime. The bulletin does not discuss the taxation treat- ment of superannuation funds in detail. For a de- scription of the new superannuation taxation regime Appendix D to TIB No . 3 should be con- sulted. 1.7 This bulletin represents the Inland Revenue Department's interpretation of the law as it stands at 1 October 1989 . PART 2: OVERVIEW OF TRUST TAXATION REGIME Basic features of the trust taxation regime 2.1 The new trust taxation regime is contained in ss.226 to 233 of the income Tax Act. It applies with respect to income derived in the income year that commenced on 1 April 1988 and in every subsequent income year: s.9 Income Tax Amend- ment Act (No 5) 1988. The only exception to this rule is in respect of distributions of income, capital profits or capital gains that were derived by trustees in income years commencing befor e I 1 April 1988. The proviso to s.9 of the No 5 Amendment Act provides that, generally, the new regime does not apply to distributions of such amounts and that such distributions are not assessable for income tax. 2.2 Themain provisions of the newregime: • define and provide for the taxation of benefici- ary income and trustee income; • define the term "settlor" and provide for the liability of settlors to income tax in respect of trustee income; • classify trusts into qualifying trusts, foreign trusts and non-qualifying trusts for the purpose of determining the treatment of distributions from trusts where the distribution does not constitute beneficiary income to the beneficiary; • provide for the treatment of trusts settled by persons becoming resident in New Zealand; • providefor the treatment of trustssettled by residentson non-resident trusteesbefore 17 December 1987; • require the disclosure of settlements made on trusts where there are no resident trustees. General application of trust regime 2.3 Much of the complexity of the trust regime described in this bulletin arises from the inclusion in the regime of provisions dealing with foreign source income derived through trusts with non- resident trustees. The complexities arise from the need to tax such income as it isderived or to tax it on distribution to a beneficiary. Also, complexities arise from the transitional provisions which apply where income derived by trustees which may not previously have been subject to tax in New Zea- land potentially becomes liable to tax . 2.4 In the case of most trusts established by persons resident in New Zealand the treatment of income derived through the trust has been simpli- fied . This is because the distinction between specified trusts and non-specified trusts and restrictions on passing income through to benefici- aries for taxation in their hands have been re- moved. Under the new regime income derived by a trustee in a particular income year is assessable to the beneficiary as "beneficiary income" if it vests absolutely in interest in the beneficiary during that year or if it is paid or applied to or for the benefit of the beneficiary during or within six months after that year. If income is not beneficiary income it is assessable to the trustee as "trustee income" . 2S The treatment of trust income is at its simplest under the new re gime if th e trust was settled by a person resident in New Zealand on a trustee who is residentin NewZealand and if the trust income is derivedfrom New Zealand. This is illustrated in the following example: Example1 Facts: (i) A, a New Zealandresident individual, settles a New Zealand farm propertyon trust for B (A's spouse), and A's andB's two infantchildren. The trustees are residentin New Zealand.In terms of the trust the trustees, at their discretion, may pay or apply income to or for the benefit of the benefi- ciaries. (ii) During the income year ending 31 March 1990 the trustees derive $40,000 assessable income from the farm . On 30 June 1990 the trustees pass a resolution allocating $20,000 to B and $5,000 to each of the infant beneficiaries. In terms of the trust the amounts thus allocated become abso- lutely the property of the beneficiaries and the allocated amounts, including the $5,000 allocated to each of the infant beneficiaries, are paid to B . B periodically applies the $5,000 allocated to each of the infant beneficiaries to meet expenses incurred on their behalf. Result: (i) B derives beneficiary income of $20,000 because there is a payment of income to B within six months from the end of the income year in which the income was derived by the trustees. The income is assessable at B's normal marginal rates and the trustees are liable to tax in respect of the income as agents for B. (ii) The resolution and the payment of the $5,000 allocated to each of the infant beneficiaries to B constitutes an application of the income for the benefit of the beneficiaries. The infant beneficiaries thus each derive $5,000 beneficiary income. This is the case even though the income is not paid directly to the beneficiary. The important point is that in terms of the trust the income becomes absolutely the property of the beneficiaries. The beneficiaries are assessable on the beneficiary income at their normal rates and the trustees are liable to tax in respect of the income as agents for the beneficiaries. (iii) The remaining $10,000 income derived by the trustees is trustee income. Thetrustees are assess- able for tax on this income at the rate of33 percent. 2 Beneficiaryincomeand trustee incom e 2 .6 Income derived by a trustee is either "bene- ficiary income" or "trustee income" . Income will be beneficiary income if during the income year in which it is derived by the trustee it vests absolutely in interest in the beneficiary or if during that income year or within six months thereafter it is paid or applied to or for the benefit of the benefici- ary. All income derived by a trustee which is not beneficiary income is trustee income . 2.7 Beneficiaries are liable for income tax in respect of beneficiary income, and trustees are liable for income tax in respect of beneficiary income as agents of beneficiaries . The liability to income tax in respect of beneficiary income de- pends upon the residence of the beneficiary and the source of the income . Beneficiaries resident in New Zealand are liable to income tax in respect of beneficiary income derived from both inside and outside New Zealand . Beneficiaries not resident in New Zealand are liable to income tax only in respect of beneficiary income derived from New Zealand . Beneficiary income is assessable for income tax at the beneficiary's normal rates of tax. 2.8 A trustee is liable to income tax in respect of trustee income as if the trustee were an individual beneficially entitled to the income. The trustee is liable to income tax on all trustee income derived from New Zealand . The trustee is also liable to income tax on trustee income derived from outside New Zealand during an income year if a settlor of the trust is resident in New Zealand at any time during that income year, if the trust is a superan- nuation fund as defined in s .2 of the Income Tax Act, or if the trustee is resident in New Zealand at any time during that income year and a settler of the trust died resident in New Zealand . However, notwithstanding these rules there are two situ- ations in which a trustee is not liable to income tax in respect of trustee income derived from outside New Zealand. The first is where the trustee is resident outside New Zealand at all times during the income year and no settlement (as defined in s .226) has been made on the trust since 1717ecem- ber 1987. The second is where the trustee is resi- dent outside New Zealand at all times during the income year and the only settlements ever made on the trust were by settlors who were not resident in New Zealand at the time of settlement and who have never been resident in New Zealand since 17 December 1987. Settlor definitionand liability 2.9 A personis a settlor of a trust if thatperson - (i) makes a dispositionof property (as definedin s.226)to th e trust for less than market value; (ii) makes property available to the trust for less than market value, including the provision of financial assistance for less than market value and the provision of financial assistance where amounts payable in relation to the financial assistance are payable on demand and the right to demand payment is not exercised; (iii) provides any service to thetrust for less than market value; (iv) acquires or obtains the use of any prop- erty of the trust or obtains any service from the trustee for greater than market value; (v) acts or abstains from acting or directly or indirectly enters into a transaction or series of transactions with or in relation to the trust with the effect of defeating the intent and application of the "settlor" definition . 2.10 This definition of "settlor" is extended by rules to the effect that - (vi) where a person (for example, a solicitor or a relative) has made a settlement on a trust as a nominee for another person, or where the settlement is of a nominal amount made at the request of another person, that other person is deemed to be the settlor of the trust rather than the person actually making the settlement; (vii) where a settlementis made by a con- trolledforeign company(CFC), or by a company which would be a CFC if it were a foreigncompany, any person holding a control interest of10 percent or more inthe companyatthe time of settlement is a settlor ofthe trust; (viii) where a trustee of one trust (the first trust) settles a trust or makes a distribu- tion to another trust (the second trust) any person who is a settlor of the first trust is a settlor of the second trust; (ix) where any person acquires any rights or powers in relation to a trustee or settlor of an existing trust, and the acquisition has the purpose or effect of enabling the person to require the trustee to treat the person or any other person nominated by that person as a beneficiary of that trust, the person is deemed to be a settlor of the trust. 3 2.11 The significance of the definition of "settlor" is twofold . First, as indicated above, except in the case of a trust which is a superannuation fund trustee income derived from outside New Zealand during any particular income year is liable to income tax only if a settlor of the trust is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year or if a settlor of the trust at any time died resident in New Zealand and during the income year a trustee is resident at any time in New Zealand . (In the case of a superannuation fund trustee income derived from outside New Zealand is always liable to income tax). 2.12 Second, if a settlement has been made on the trust after 17 December 1987, and the trust is not a charitable trust, any settlor of the trust who is resident in New Zealand during an incomeyear will be liable to tax on trustee income derived during that year unless any one of a number of exceptions applies. A settlor of a trust on which a settlement has been made after 17 December 1987 is not liable to income tax on trustee income derived during an income year if during that incomeyear a trustee of the trust is at all times resident in New Zealand ; if the trust is a superannuation fund; or if the settlor was not resident in New Zealand at the time of any settlement by that settlor or at the time of any settlement made on the trust after 17 Decem- ber 1987. Where a trust was settled before 17 De- cember 1987, and no settlement was made on the trust after that date, the settlor is not liable to tax on trustee income unless the settlor makes an election to pay tax on trustee income. 2.13 In two other situations the liability of a settlor to tax on trustee income is limited. First, a settlor is not liable to tax on trustee income to the extent that the settlor can establish to the satisfac- tion of the Commissioner that the liability of the settlor to income tax exceeds the liability which that settlor should bear by comparison to other persons who have made a settlement on the trust having regard to the settlements made by the settlor and by those other persons. Second, a settlor is not liable to income tax on trustee income to the extent that the trustee income is derived because of the application of s.64B to s.64M of the Income Tax Act to amounts remitted under any financial arrange- ment. Classification of trusts and taxable distributions 2.14 Trusts are classified into three categories for the purpose of determining the treatment of "distri- butions" (as defined) to beneficiaries. The three categories of trust are - (i) Qualifying trusts A trust is a qualifying trust in relation to any income year in which a distribution is made if all trustee income derived by the trustee in income years commencing with the income year in which a settlement was first made on the trust until the income year in which the distribution is made has been liable to New Zealand income tax other than as non-resident withholding income, and the trustee's obligations in relation to that liability have all been satisfied . In determining whether a trust is a qualifying trust the fact that there is no trustee income liable to income tax in a particu- lar income year is ignored if all of the income derived by the trustee in that income year would have been liable to income tax if not for: the fact that no income was derived during any relevant income year; the application in any income year of s.61 of the Income Tax Act; deductions exceeding income derived by the trustee in any relevant income year, or losses carried forward pursuant to s.188, offsetting all of the income derived by the trustee in any incomeyear. (ii) Foreign trust s A trust is a foreign trust in relation to a distri- bution if at all times from the later of 17 December 1987 or the date on which a settle- ment was first made on the terms of the trust until the date of distribution no settlor of the trust was resident in New Zealand. (iii) Non-qualifying trust s A trust is a non-qualifying trust at the time at which a distribution is madeif it isneither a qualifying trust nor a foreign trust. In broad terms, this will be a trust where a settior has been resident in New Zealand after the later of 17 December 1987 or the date on which the trust was first settled but either all of the trustee income derived by the trustee has not been liable to New Zealand income tax, or the trustee income has been liable to income tax but the trustee's obligations in respect of that liability have not been satisfied. 2.15 When a distribution is made from a qualify- ing trust it will not be assessable if it does not constitute beneficiary income. In this situation income accumulated by the trustee has been liable to New Zealand income tax as trustee income and it is not appropriate to tax it again when it is distributed to the beneficiary . When a distribution is made from a foreign trust, and the distribution does not constitute beneficiary income, it may be assessable as a taxable distribution . The distribu- 4 tion will constitute a taxable distribution if it does not constitute beneficiary income and if it does not consist of a distribution of any part of the corpus of the trust or of capital profits or capital gains realised by the trustee (unless the capital profit or gain was realised in a transaction with a person associated with the trustee). 2.16 When a distribution is made from a non- qualifying trust, and the distribution does not constitute beneficiary income, it may be assessable as a taxable distribution . A distribution which does not constitute beneficiary income will be a taxable distribution if it does not represent a distribution of any part of the corpus of the trust . Taxable distributions from non-qualifying trusts are taxable at a rate of 45 percent . This higher rate, and the inclusion of distributions of capital profits or gains within the taxable distribution definition, is because New Zealand income tax has been avoided or deferred through the use of trusts which are now classified as non-qualifying trusts . It is also intended to encourage non-qualifying trusts to be converted to qualifying trusts by an election procedure provided in the legislation . 2.17 The legislation contains ordering rules for determining the constituent elements of distribu- tions from foreign trusts and non-qualifying trusts. These rules override the terms of the trust deed or the terms of the exercise of the trustee's discretion . The rules provide that a distribution from a foreign trust or a non-qualifying trust is deemed to consist of the following elements in the following order - (i) income derived by the trustee in the income year in which the distribution is made; (ii) income derived by the trustee in all previous income years; (iii) capital profits orgainsderived by the trustee inthe income year in which the distribution is made; (iv) capital profits orgainsderived in all previous income years; (v) corpus of the trust. 2.18 The ordering rules do not apply with respect to distributions from the following trusts: (i) qualifying trusts; (ii) non-discretionary trusts • created by will or codicil or by order of Court varying or modifying the provisions of any will or codicil; • createdon any intestacy; or • on which no settlement has been made after17 December 1987; (iii) trustswhich were foreign trusts before a settlor of the trust became resident in New Zealand and in respect of which an election to pay tax on trustee income has beenmade inaccordance with the election procedure provided in the legislation. 2.19 In these circumstances the constituent elements of the distribution are determined in accordance with the terms of the trust or in accor- dance with the exercise of the trustee's discretion . The ordering rules also do not apply where the distribution arises from the disposition or making available of property to the beneficiary, or the provision of services to the beneficiary, at less than market value. These distributions are deemed to be taxable distributions. Trusts settled by persons becoming resident in New Zealand 2.20 A New Zealand resident settlor of a trust on which a settlement has been made after 17 Decem- ber 1987 is not liable to tax on trustee income if the settlor was not resident at the time of any settle- ment by that settlor on the trust, or if the settlor was not resident at the time of any settlement after 17 December 1987 . Also, in these circumstances a trustee who is resident outside New Zealand at all times during the income year is not liable to income tax on trustee income . However, if a settlor of the trust is resident in New Zealand the trust will not be a qualifying trust in relation to any distribution which does not constitute beneficiary income unless all of the trustee income derived by the trustee between the date on which the trust was first settled and the date of the distribution has been liable to New Zealand income tax and the trustee's obligations in respect of that liability have been satisfied . Therefore, to permit a trust to be classified as a qualifying trust where settlements were made on the trust beforethe settlor became resident in New Zealand a procedure has been provided for any settlor, trustee or beneficiary of the trust to elect to pay tax on trustee income. 2.21 The election procedure is available where a settlor of a trust becomes resident in New Zealand and the trust would have been a foreign trust in relation to a distribution made from the trust on the day immediately preceding the day on which the settlor became resident. That is, it must be a trust where no settlor had been resident in New Zealand from the later of 17 December 1987 or the day on which the trust was first settled until the day immediately preceding the day on which the 5 seniorbecame resident in New Zealand. In these circumstances any settlor, trustee orbeneficiary of the trust may elect to pay tax on trustee income within 12 months of the later of 31 May 1989 or the day on which the settlor became resident. If an election is made the person making the elec ti on is liable to income tax in respect of trustee income from the date of the elec tion . 2.22 If an election is made to pay tax on trustee income the trust is deemed to be a foreign trust in relation to distributions of income, capital profits or capital gains derived by the trustee before the election was made, and a qualifying trust in relation to distributions of income, capital profits or capital gains derived after the date on which the election was made . Thus, distributions of income derived before the election was made will be assessable, while distributions of amounts derived after the election was made (except distributions which constitute beneficiary income) will not be assessable because tax has already been paid on the trustee income derived by the trustee. The ordering rules described in paras 2.17 and 2.18 above will not apply in determining the constitu- ent elements of distributions from such trusts. Dis- tributions will thus be deemed to consist of such amounts as reflect the terms of the trust or the terms of the exercise of the trustee's discretion. 2.23 This treatment does not apply where an election is made to pay tax on trustee income but the obligations to pay tax on trustee income are not satisfied. In this situation distributions made in the income year in which the obligations were not satisfied and in succeeding income years are deemed to be from a non-qualifying trust, except to the extent that the distribution is from amounts derived before the election to pay tax on trustee income was made. Moreover, in this situation the ordering rules do apply in determining the con- stituent elements of a distribution. 2.24 If an election is not made to pay tax on trustee income the trust is deemed to be a foreign trust in relation to distributions of income, capital profits or capital gains derived before the date on which the time for making an election expires (ie 12 months from the later of 31 May 1989 or the date on which the settlor became resident), and a non-qualifying trust in relation to distributions of income, capital profits or capital gains derived after the expiry of the time for making an election. The ordering rules apply in determining the constituent elements of a distribution. Trust Settled by Residents on Non-Resident Trustees Before 17 December 1987 2.25 Wherea trustwas settled by a person resident in New Zealand on non-resident trustees before 17 December 1987 the trust will probably be a non-qualifying trust because all of the trustee income will not have been liable to New Zealand income tax. To allow such trusts to be brought within the New Zealand tax system provision was made for any settlor, trustee or beneficiary of the trust to elect to pay tax on trustee income derived in income years commencing on and after 1 April 1988. 2 .26 An election must have been made on or before 31 May 1989. If an election was made all trustee income derived from outside New Zealand in income years commencing before 1 April 1988, or derived from New Zealand in income years commencing before 1 April 1988 where the income was liable to income tax only as non-resident with- holding income, is deemed to have been liable to income tax other than only as non-resident with- holding income and the trustee's obligations to pay tax in respect of that income are deemed to have been satisfied. 2.27 Thus, the effect of an election is that a trust which would be a non-qualifying trust because all of the trustee income derived before the income year commencing on 1 April 1988 was not liable to New Zealand income tax, and because a settlor of the trust was resident after 17 December 1987, may become a qualifying trust because the income derived in income years commencing before 1 April 1988 is deemed to have been liable to income tax and the trustee's obligations in respect of that liability are deemed to have been satisfied. Disclosure of Settlements 2.28 The legislation requires persons who have made settlements on a trust to make a disclosure in relation to the trust in three situations. The first is where a person made a settlement on a trust on or before 31 May 1989, the trust is still in existence on 31 May 1989 and if a distribution were made on 31 May 1989 the trust would be a non-qualifying trust in relation to the distribution. In this case the person was required to disclose to the Commis- sioner by 31 May 1989 the existence of the trust, the name and address of the trustee and benefici- ary of the trust and any further details required by the Commissioner. 2.29 The second situation in which a disclosure is required is where a person resident in New Zea- land made a settlement on a trust on or after 17 December 1987 and at the time of settlement there was no trustee of the trust resident in New Zea- land or, if a trustee of the trust was resident in New Zealand at the time of settlement, there is at any time after the settlement no trustee resident in New Zealand . In this case a disclosure is required within three months of the date of settlement, 6 within three months of the date on which there is no trustee resident in New Zealand or, if later, by 31 May 1989 . The person is required to disclose the fact of the settlement, the name and address of the trustee and beneficiary of the trust and any further details required by the Commissioner . 2 .30 The third situation in which disclosure is required is where a settlement is made on or after 17 December 1987 and the person making a settle- ment does so as a nominee for another person, or the settlement is of a nominal amount made at the request of another person, and at the time of settlement no trustee of the trust is resident in New Zealand . In this situation the person for whom the nominee or nominal settlor acted is deemed to be the settlor of the trust but the nominee or nominal settlor is required to disclose the settlement to the Commissioner, the name and address of the settlor of the trust (ie the person for whom the nominee or nominal settlor acted) and any further details required by the Commissioner. Disclosure is required within three months from the date of the settlement or, if later, by 31 May 1989. PART 3: APPLICATION DAT E Sec ti on 9 Income Tax AmendmentAct (No 5) 1988 3 .1 The new trust taxation regime applies with respect to income derived in the income year commencing on 1 April 1988 and in every subse- quent income year: s.9 Income Tax Amendment Act (No 5) 1988. An exception is provided in relation to distributions of income, capital profits or capital gains derived by the trustees of a trust in income years commencing before 1 April1988.The new regime largely does not apply with respect to these distributions and, with several specific exceptions, it is provided that they are not assess- able to the recipient. Proviso to Section9 Objective 3.2 The exclusion from the new trust regime of distributions of income, capital profits or capital gains derived in income years commencing before 1 April 1988 is contained in the proviso to s.9 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 5) 1988. Under the legislation which previously applied in respect of income derived through trusts it was generally considered that a distribution was not assessable for income tax where it consisted of foreign source income derived by trustees in prior years and where the trustees were not resident in New Zealand. Where income derived bytrustees had been subject to New Zealand tax in the hands of the trustees it was clear that it was not subject to tax again on distribution to the beneficiary: Cof1'v Luttrell \[1949\] NZLR 823. However, the position was less clear in relation to trusts where the income derived by the trustees had not been liable to New Zealand income tax on accumulation. 3 .3 To ensure a smoother transition to the new regime by avoiding arguments as to whether income accumulated tax free by trustees was assessable on distribution, the proviso to s.9 provides that distributions of amounts derived by trustees in income years commencing before 1 April1988 are not assessable for income tax where the distribution is made after 1 April 1988. With respect to amounts derived by trustees in income years commencing after 1 April 1988, it is clear from the new trust regime that amounts accumu- lated by trustees may be liable for tax on distribu- tion if the trust is a "foreign trust" or a "non- qualifying trust" in relation to the distribution (see Part 4 of this bulletin for a discussion of those terms) . Terms of the Proviso 3 .4 The proviso to s.9 states that Part II of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 5) 1988, which enacts the newtrust taxation regime, does not apply with respect to a distribution received from a trust to the extent that the distribution consists of income, capital profits or capital gains derived by the trustee in any incomeyearcommencing before 1 April1988. This rule applies where the amount distributed was not also income derived by a beneficiary enti fled in possession to the receipt of the income in the same year that it was derived by the trustee . In these circumstances the income would have been assessable to the beneficiary under the previous trust regime although it was not actually distributed to the beneficiary. There- fore, as under general principles this income would clearly not be assessable to the beneficiary on distribution it is not necessary to apply the proviso to s.9 to ensure that it is not assessable on distribution. 3 .5 The proviso to s.9 applies to distributionsof capital profits or gains "derived" by the trustee in income years commencing before 1 April 1988. In this context, a capital profit or gain is "derived" if it has been received or if it has become due or receivable . Thus, a capital profit or gain which was accrued before1 April 1988 but which was not realised before that date will not have been re- ceived or become due or receivable before 1 April 1988 and will therefore not have been derived before that date . 3.6 Although the new re gime does not generally applywith respect to distri butions of amounts derived in income years commencing before 7 1 April 1988 there are two stated exceptions . These are the definition of the term "distribution" in s.226 and the provisions of s.230 (s .230 is discussed in Part 13 of this bulletin). Section 230 contains ordering rules for determining the constituent elements of distributions from most trusts which are not "qualifying trusts" . In terms of these rules distributions are deemed to consist first of income derived by the trustees in the income year during which the distribution is made to the extent of such income; second, income derived in prior income years to the extent of that income; third, capital profits or gains derived in the income year of distribution ; fourth, capital profits or gains derived in prior income years ; and fifth, corpus. By applying these rules to distributions of amounts derived in income years commencing both before and after 1 April 1988 it is possible to isolate the taxable and non-taxable components of the distri- bution. As s.230 only applies in relation to "distri- butions", it follows that in order to apply that section it is necessary to apply the "distribution" definition with respect to amounts derived in income years commencing before 1 April 1988. 3 .7 The following example illustrates the interac- tion of the s .9 proviso, s.230 and the "distribution" definition. Example2 Facts : On 1 April 1986 a New Zealand resident individual settled property on a trust with trustees who were all resident in Hong Kong. The property thus settled produces income from sources outside New Zealand . The value of the property at the time of settlement was NZ $100,000 . It is assumed that the trust is a "non-qualifying trust" (see Part 4 of this bulletin for a discussion of this expression) in relation to any distributions made from the trust . A distribution of $6,000 is made from the trust in the income year ending 31 March 1988 . A further distribution of $45,000 is made on 31 March 1990. It is assumed that the beneficiary is resident in New Zealand on this date. The amounts derived by the trustees and the distributions made are as follows: Year EndingIncome $Capital Profits $Distributions$ 31/03/8710,000 31/03/8811,0005,0006,000 31/03189 10,000 31/03/905,00010,00045,000 Result: (i) The $6,000 distributed in the income year ending 31 March 1988 is deemed to have been made from the income derived in that income year, leaving a balance of $5,000 income derived during that income year available for distribution. The treatment of the distribution is deter- mined under the previous trust regime. (ii) Thus, the amounts available for distribu- tion on 31 March 1990 may be represented as follows: Year Ending Income $Capital Profits $ Corpus$ 31/03/8710,000100,000 31/03/885,000 5,000 31/03/89 10,000 31/03/905,00010,000 (iii) Applying s.230, the $45,000 distribution is deemed to consist of: • first, the $5,000 income derived in the income year ending 31 March 1990; • second, the $25,000 income derived in the previous income years which is available for distribution ; • third, the capital gain derived in the income year ending 31 March 1990; • fourth, the capital gain derived in the income year ending 31 March 1988. (iv) The tax status of each portion of the distribution is determined by analysing it separately: • first, the portion representing the $5,000 income derived in the income year ending 31 March 1990 will be assessable to the beneficiary on distri- bution as beneficiary income. This income was paid to the beneficiary in the sameyearin which it was derived by the trustees and therefore consti- tutes "beneficiary income" as defined in s.226. • second, the portion representing the $25,000 income derived in the prior income years will be assessable on distribution to the extent of $10,000 and non-assessable to the extent of $15,000. The $10,000 constitutes a taxable distribution, assessable under s.227, because it is a distribution of an amount other than beneficiary income from a non-qualifying trust. The $15,000 is non-assessable by virtue of the proviso to s.9 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 5) 1988 because it represents a distribution of income 8 derivedby the trustees in income years which commenced be fore 1April 1988. • third, the portion representing the capital gain of $10,000 de rived in the income year ending 31 March 1990 is assessable on distri bu ti on because distributi ons of capital gains from non-qualifying trusts a re assessable as taxable distribu ti ons(see Part4 of this bulletin for a discussion of the expression "taxable distri bution"). • fou rth, the port ion representing the capital gain of $5,000 de rived in the income year ending 31 March 1988 is not assessable on dist ribution by virtue of the proviso to s .9 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 5) 1988 because the distributed gain was derived in an income year commenc- ing before 1April 1988. (iv) Of the total distribution of $45,000 the amount which is assessable is $25,000. Of this, $5,000 is assessable at normal rates as beneficiary income and the re- mainder is assessable at 45 percent as a taxable distribution from a non- qualifying trust (s.227(4)). Resettlement of pre-1989 income yearamounts 3 .8 If amounts derived by trustees in income years commencing before 1 April 1988 are distrib- uted directly to beneficiaries the effect of the proviso to s .9 is that the distribution is not assess- able . Where such amounts are settled on another trust, and then later distributed from that other trust, the result is the same . In these circumstances the amount settled will not constitute a "distribu- tion" to the second trust from the first trust. Paragraph (d) of the definition of "distribution" provides that where a settlement is made by one trust on another trust the settlement constitutes a distribution to the extent that the amounts in- cluded in the settlement would have constituted income if distributed to a resident beneficiary . This provision will not apply where the settlement includes amounts derived before the income year commencing on 1 April 1988 because if those amounts had been distributed to a resident benefi- ciary, instead of being settled on the second trust, they would not have been assessable by virtue of the s.9 proviso. As the resettlement does not constitute a distribution to the second trust it will not be a taxable distribution to that trust. Thus, the resettlement will not give rise to income in the accounts of the second trust . Moreover, the amount resettled will constitute "corpus" in the accounts of the second trust which is available for tax-free distribution . In specie distribution s 3.9 Where a trustee distributes a trust asset to a beneficiary (fe an "in specie" distribution) the question arises as to the treatment of the distribu- tion where the asset was purchased with income or gains derived before the income year commencing on 1 April 1988 or with corpus. 3 .10 Distributions in specie are treated in the same manner as any other distribution. Such distributions are included within the s.226(1) definition of "distribution" as "property of the trust" which vests absolutely in interest in or is paid or applied to or for the benefit of the benefici- ary or which is disposed of to the beneficiary at below market value . Where the distribution is made from a "foreign trust" or a "non-qualifying trust" (these terms are discussed in Part 4 of this bulletin) the ordering rules in s .230(1) apply, subject to any exceptions in s .230(2), to establish the extent to which the distribution is a "taxable distribution" (this term is also discussed in Part 4 of this bulletin) . 3 .11 In applying s.230(1) the income and gains derived before the income year commencing on 1 April 1988 and the trust corpus used to acquire the asset that is distributed are available to determine the extent to which the distribution is an assessable taxable distribution. However, s.230(1) deems distributions to be made from income derived in the year of distribution before income derived in prior years and then from current year capital profits and gains before capital profits and gains realised in prior years and before corpus. Thus, although the distributed asset may have been acquired with income and gains derived before the income year commencing on 1 April 1988, or with trust corpus, the s.230(1) ordering rules may deem the distribution to have been made from income and gains derived in income years commencing on and after 1 April 1988. If this is the case the distri- bution may be assessable as a taxable distribution . However, the income and gains derived in income years commencing before 1 April 1988 and the trust corpus would remain available to character- ise any subsequent distributions to the beneficiary. 3 .12 In some cases an asset acquired before the income year commencing on 1 April 1988 may have appreciated in value prior to its distribution after 1 April 1988. In these circumstances the capital profit or gain accrued in respect of the asset prior to the income year commencing on 1 April 1988 will not not constitute a capital profit or gain "derived" by the trustee before that date . Conse- quently, the proviso to s.9 would not apply to 9 exclude that portion of the capital profit or gain from the assessable income of the beneficiary on distribution. Exception to the proviso 3.13 The s.9 proviso was amended by s.78 of the Income Tax Amendment Act 1989 to exclude from its ambit distributions which constitute dividends for the purpose of the Income Tax Act and distri- butions made from superannuation schemes. The amendment applied with respect to the tax on income derived in the income year which com- menced on 1 April 1988 and in every subsequent year. 3 .14 The exclusion of distributions which consti- tute dividends from the operation of the s .9 pro- viso ensures that distributions from certain catego- ries of trust which were previously assessable as dividends will remain assessable . Distributions from unit trusts (assessable as dividends under s.4, subject to any relevant exceptions in s.4A), from Maori Authorities (assessable as dividends under s.236) and from group investment funds (assess- able as dividends in some cases under s.211A) fall into this category. 3.15 Distributions from superannuation schemes are excluded from the application of the proviso to ensure that distributions from such schemes which were previously taxable will remain taxable during the transitional period of the superannuation regime enacted by the Income Tax Amendment Act 1989. PART 4: INTERPRETATION AND DEFINITION S Overview of s.226 4 .1 Section 226(1) contairis definitionsof terms used in sections 226 to 233. Included within s.226(1) are definitions of the terms "beneficiary income" and "trustee income". These terms, which are relevant in determining whether income derived by a trustee is assessable to the trustee or to the beneficiary, are discussed in Part 5 of this bulletin. Section 226(2) contains the general defini- tion of the term "settlor". This definition is central to the new regime, and the general definition is buttressed by specific rules contained in s .226(3), (4), (5), and (7) which deem persons to be settlors in certain circumstances. The "settlor" definition, the definitions contained in s .226(1) which are relevant to that definition and the specific deeming provisions contained in the subsections referred to in the preceding sentence are discussed separately in Part 6 of this bulletin. 4.2 Section 226(8) and (9) define the term "chari- table trust", s.226(10) excludes unit trusts fromth e ambit of the trust regime, and s.226(11) contains a rule which is designed to p revent the artificial creation of capital gains in relation to foreign trusts . Section 226(12) contains a rule excluding from the sett lor de finition certainemployers who establish trusts for the purpose of providing retirementbenefits foremployees. Thisspecial rule is discussed in Part 6 of this bulletin. Definitions: s.226(1) Arrangement 4.3 The term "arrangement" is relevant for the purpose of the anti-avoidance rule contained in s.227(5). That provision strikes down arrangements involving transactions with persons other than beneficiaries where the effect is to defeat the intent and application of s.227. This provision is dis- cussed in Part 8 of this bulletin. 4.4 An "arrangement" is defined as meaning any contract, agreement, plan or understanding, whether enforceable or unenforceable, including all steps and transactions by which it is carried into effect. It is significant that the contract, agreement, plan or understanding need not be enforceable . Thus, for the purposes of the "arrangement" definition it is not necessary that each party has the ability to force the other party to carry out their part of the bargain. Beneficiary income 4.5 This term is discussed in Part 5 of this bulletin. Controlled foreign company 4.6 The expression "controlled foreign com- pany" is relevant in relation to s.226(4). That provision, discussed in Part 6 of this bulletin, contains rules dealing with settlements made through closely held companies. The expression "controlled foreign company" has the meaning attributed to it by s.245C. That provision will be considered in detail in a later bulletin on the controlled foreign company legislation contained in Part WA of the Income Tax Act . Corpus (a) Significanc e 4 .7 The definition of "corpus" is relevant in relation to the definition of the expression "taxable distribution" contained in s .226 and in relation to the ordering rules contained in s.230. 10 4 .8 Distributions from non-qualifying trusts and foreign trusts (other than non-qualifying and foreign trusts which are superannuation funds) of amounts other than beneficiary income are assess- able as taxable distributions except to the extent that they constitute distributions of capital gains or corpus in the case of foreign trusts or distributions of corpus in the case of non-qualifying trusts . The "corpus" definition is therefore important in establishing the extent to which distributions from non-qualifying and foreign trusts are assessable for income tax. 4.9 The "taxable distribution" definition must be read in conjunction with the ordering rules con- tained in s .230 (s.230 is discussed in Part 13 of this bulletin). These determine the constituent elements of distributions from most non-qualifying and foreign trusts, thus permitting the taxable compo- nent of a distribution to be isolated. The rules require income and capital gains derived by the trustees to be exhausted before corpus can be distributed. 4.10 The term "corpus" is not relevant in deter- mining the treatment of distributions from "quali- fying trusts" . In the case of qualifying trusts it is clear that only distributions which constitute beneficiary income are assessable . Distributions of other amounts, whether of income which has been taxed to the trustees, of capital profits or gains or of property settled on the trust, are non-assessable by virtue of s .227(6) and by virtue of the general principles established inCofT v Luttrell \[1949\] NZLR 823. (b) Amounts included in corpu s 4 .11 "Corpus" is defined as meaning an amount equal to the market value, at the date of settlement, of any property settled on the trust. The meaning of the expression "market value" is considered in greater detail in Part 6 of this bulletin. However, in broad terms it means the amount at which a reasonable and willing vendor would sell the property to a willing, well informed and prudent purchaser. 4.12 The value of the corpus is determined at the time of the settlement . Post-settlement revaluations or devaluations of the settled property are there- fore not taken into account. (c) Amounts excluded from corpus 4.13 Property settled ontrustdoes not qualify as corpus in four situations: (i) Paragraph (a) of the "corpus" definition 4.14 Property settled on trust does not qualify as corpus where it is settled by the trustees of another trust and, if that property had been distributed to a resident beneficiary, it would have constituted beneficiary income or a taxable distribution in the hands of that beneficiary. The objective of this exception is to prevent the creation of corpus by resettling amounts accumulated in one trust on the terms of another trust. In the absence of this provision it would be possible to avoid tax on distributions of amounts accumulated in foreign and non-qualifying trusts simply by settling those amounts on other trusts and then distributing them from those other trusts as tax free corpus . 4.15 The rule applies only to the extent that the property settled would have constituted income to a resident beneficiary if distributed to such a beneficiary at the time of settlement . Thus, if the property settled would not have been assessable if distributed to a resident beneficiary, because it constituted corpus in relation to the trust from which the settlement was made or because the trust from which the settlement was made was a foreign trust and the amount settled represented a capital profit or gain, paragraph (a) of the "corpus" definition will not exclude the property settled from constituting corpus in relation to the trust on which the settlement was made. 4.16 In determining whether the settled property would have constituted beneficiary income or a taxable distribution to a resident beneficiary if distributed at the time of settlement it is necessary, first, to categorise the trust which is making the settlement and, second, to establish the sources from which the settlement was made . The first step is necessary because trust categorisation is relevant in determining the extent to which distributions from trusts are taxable. If the trust making the settlement is a foreign trust distributions of current and accumulated income only wouldbeassessable on distribution to resident beneficiaries . Therefore, the paragraph (a) exception would apply only to the extent that the amount settled is drawn from current and accumulated income . However, if the trust making the settlement is a non-qualifying trust distributions of current and accumulated income and capital gains would be assessable on distribution to a resident beneficiary. Conse- quently, the paragraph (a) exception would apply to the extent that the amount settled is drawn from current and accumulated income and capital gains . 4 .17 Having established which components of distnbutions from the trust making the settlement would be assessable it is necessary to determine the extent to which the amount settled would have been assessable if distributed to a resident benefi- ciary. This determination is made by discovering 11 the character of the amount comprising the settle- ment. This is achieved by applying s.230 on the basis of the settlement constituting a distribution (s .230 is discussed in Part 13 of this bulletin). In these circumstances the settlement constitutes a distribution by virtue of paragraph (d) of the definition of "distribution". 4.18 The following example illustrates the opera- tion of paragraph (a) of the "corpus" definition in conjunction with the s.230 ordering rules and the proviso to s.9 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 5) 1988 (s.9 is discussed in Part 3 of this bulletin) . Example3 Facts: (i) Trust A is a non-qualifying trust which was established on 1 April 1987 by a settlement of property to the value of $100,000. The following table records the amounts accumulated by the trustees as at 31 March 1990: Year Ending Income $ Capital Profits $Corpus$ 31/03/888,000 5.000 100,000 31/03/8912,0005,000 31/03/905,000 (ii) On1 April 1990 the trusteesof Trust A establish a new trust, Trust B, and settle the $25,000 income and $10,000 capital gains accumulatedby the trustees of Trust A, and the $100,000 corpus settled originally onTrustA, on the terms of Trust B. Result: (i) Trust A is a non-qualifying trust. There- fore, any distribution made to a resident beneficiary on 1 April 1990 would have been assessable, either as beneficiary income or as a taxable distribution, to the extent that it consisted of a distribution of income, capital profits or captial gains . (ii) By virtue of the proviso to s .9 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 5) 1988, the $8,000 income and the $5,000 capital gains derived by the trustees in the income year ending 31 March 1988 would not be assessable if distributed to a resident beneficiary. Therefore, these amounts do not fall within paragraph (a) of the "corpus" definition because they would not be beneficiary income or a taxable distribu- tion in relation to a resident beneficiary if distributed to such a beneficiary at the time of settlement. These amounts are treated as corpus in relation to Trust B. (iii) If the $17,000 income and the $5,000 capital gains derived in the income years ending 31 March 1989 and 1990 were dis- tributed to a resident beneficiary on 1 April 1990 they would be assessable to that beneficiary . Therefore, these amounts fall within paragraph (a) of the exceptions to the "corpus" definition, and they do not qualify as corpus in relation to Trust B. (iv) Of the total settlement from Trust A to Trust B of $135,000, $113,000 is character- ised as corpus in relation to Trust B: i.e., $135,000 - ($17,000 + $5,000). The remain- ing $22,000 is not treated as corpus in relation to Trust B and therefore is not available for tax free distribution from Trust B. 4.19 For paragraph (a) of the "corpus" definition to apply it is not necessary to identify a beneficiary of the trust making the settlement who is resident in New Zealand. Rather, in applying paragraph (a) it is assumed that there is a hypothetical resident beneficiary and that a hypothetical distribution is made to that beneficiary. (ii) Paragraph (b) of the "corpus" definition 4.20 Property settled on trust by a disposition of property is not corpus where, but for the disposi- tion, the property would have constituted assess- able income of the settlor or would have consti- tuted assessable income if the settlor were a person resident in New Zealand. 4 .21 The objective of this exception is to prevent income being converted into corpus by a transfer of the income to a trust . For example, in the ab- sence of this rule a resident deriving foreign source income could assign the income to a trust and the income could be distributed tax free to a resident beneficiary as corpus. The same opportunity would arise if the settlor was non-resident. Rather than assigning the income to a resident directly, the non-resident could assign the income to a trust with the trustees later distributing it to a resident as a distnbution of corpus. 4.22 The settlement in question must have been made by way of a "disposition of property". This is a defined term and is discussed in Part 6 of this bulletin. (iii) Paragraph (c) of the "corpus" definition 12 4.23 Property settled on trust by a disposition of property does not constitute corpus where, but for the disposition, the property would have consti- tuted a dividend in respect of which the settlor would have been liable to deduct an amount by way of a dividend withholding payment or, where the settlor is non-resident, the settlor would have been liable to deduct such an amount if the settlor was resident in New Zealand. 4.24 The intention of this provision is to ensure that dividends which would otherwise be derived by a company are not converted into corpus by the transfer to a trust of an amount which would have constituted a dividend if distributed to the com- pany. Paragraph (b) would not apply with respect to such a transfer because dividends do not consti- tute assessable income to companies . Instead, such dividends are subject to the dividend withholding payment regime contained in Part XIIB of the Income Tax Act. Consequently, paragraph (c) is targeted at schemes which are designed to allow companies deriving dividends to avoid the divi- dend withholding payment regime by deriving corpus distributions in lieu of dividends which would otherwise be derived. (iv) Paragraph( d) of the "corpus" definition 4.25 Propertyse ttled on trust by a disposition of property doesnot constitute corpus when the settlor claims a deduction in respect of the disposi- tion in calculating the settlor's assessable income for New Zealand tax purposes . The intention here is to ensure that where a deduction is claimed in relationto propertysettled on a trust a further benefit cannot beobtained in the form of a taxfree repat ri ation of corpus . Disposition of oronert v 4.26 The expression "disposition of property" is relevant primarily in relation to the definition of settlor in s .226(2) and it is discussed in Part 6 of this bulletin. Distributio n (a) Significance 4.27 The definition of "distribution" is of signifi- cance in two contexts . First, it is relevant in relation to the definition of "taxable distribution" and in relation to the s.230 ordering rules which deter- mine the extent to which a distribution constitutes a taxable distribution . Thus, the term "distribu- tion" defines a broad class of transactions involv- ing trusts which may constitute taxable distribu- tions depending upon the category of the trust in relation to the distribution and the nature of the distribution. 4.28 Second, the "distribution" definition is relevant in relation to the rule contained in s.227(6) which ensures that beneficiaries are not assessable on distributions from qualifying trusts other than distributions which constitute beneficiary income . Although taxable distributions can only be derived with respect to foreign and non-qualifying trusts, distributions can be derived with respect to all categories of trust. However, in the case of distri- butions from qualifying trusts s .227(6) makes it clear that only distributions which constitute beneficiary income are assessable. Thus, if the trustees of a qualifying trust made trust property available to a beneficiary at below market value there would be a distribution to the extent that the property was made available for less than market value (paragraph (a) of the "distribution" defini- tion). However, the distribution would not consti- tute beneficiary income because the distribution does not constitute income which has been derived by the trustees. Consequently, s.227(6) applies to render the distribution non-assessable. For the same reason distributions of capital gains from a qualifying trust are not assessable to the benefici- ary. (b) Amounts vestingin orpaidto orapplied for a beneficiary 4.29 The term "distribution" is defined as mean- ing any property of the trust which vests absolutely in interest in a beneficiary or which is paid to or applied for the benefit of a beneficiary. 4.30 The expressions "vests absolutely in inter- est" and "paid or applied" are also used in the definition of "beneficiary income" and are consid- ered in Part 5 of this bulletin in the context of the discussion of the "beneficiary income" definition. However, the application of the vests absolutely in interest test and the paid or applied test differs as between the "distribution" definition and the "beneficiaryincome" de finition as follows: (i) For the purposes of the "distribution" definition the question is whether "prop- erty" of the trust vests in, or is paid to or applied for, the beneficiary. In the case of the beneficiary income definition the question is whether "income" derived by the trustees vests in, or is paid or applied to, the beneficiary. (ii) For the vests absolutely in interest test to apply in the context of the "beneficiary income"definition the income must vest absolutely in interest in the beneficiary during the income year in which it is derived by the trustee . In the case of the "distribution" definition there is no time 13 period within which the property must have been acquired by the trustee. (iii) In the case of the "beneficiary income" definition the paid or applied test is satisfied if income derived by a trustee during an income year is paid or applied to or for the benefit of a beneficiary during the income year or within six months after the end of the income year (the six month rule is discussed in Part 5 of this bulletin) . However, in the case of the distribution definition there is no six month rule and property which is paid or applied during an income year is treated as a distribution for that income year. 4.31 Property of a trust may be "applied" for the benefit of a beneficiary in a wide range of circum- stances . A resolution of the type considered inCIR v Ward \[1970\] NZLR 1, where income was appro- priated to beneficiaries in the trust accounts, would constitute an application of trust property for the benefit of the beneficiary where the result is that the beneficiary acquires an absolute interest in the property. There would also be an application of trust property for the benefit of a beneficiary if the trustee paid for services to be provided to a beneficiary or if the trustee discharged a debt owing by the beneficiary . In both cases the benefi- ciary clearly benefits because his or her material situation has been improved : that is, if the trustee did not pay for the services or discharge the debt the beneficiary would have paid for the services or discharged the debt out of his or her own pocket. 4 .32 There may also bean application of trust property where the trustee makes a payment to a family member and the effect of the payment is to relieve the beneficiary of an expense which he or she would otherwise have incurred . For example, the payment of school or university fees of a child of a beneficiary may constitute an application of trust property for the benefit of the beneficiary, the benefit to the beneficiary being that he or she does not personally have to meet those payments . This would also be the case where the trustee pur- chased an asset and gave it to a member of the beneficiary's family. 4 .33 In some cases it maybe difficult to establish that a payment or application by the trustee constitutes an application for the benefit of a beneficiary . In these circumstances s.227(5) may apply to deem the payment or application to have been made to the beneficiary . That provision applies where pursuant to an arrangement prop- erty or services or other benefits are provided to a person other than a beneficiary and the effect is to defeat the intent and application of s.227 . The intent and application of s.227 will be defeated in cases where the beneficiary derives an economic advantage from the arrangement but in technical terms there is no beneficiary income or taxable distribution to the beneficiary. Secton 227(5) is discussed in Part 8 of this bulletin. 4 .34 Where property of a trust vests absolutely in interest in a beneficiary or is paid to or applied for the benefit of a beneficiary the s .230 ordering rules apply, subject to any exceptions in s .230(2), in determining the extent to which the property thus vested or paid or applied is beneficiary income or a taxable distribution. 4.35 Example4 illustrates the interaction of the "distribution" definition and the s .230 ordering rules (s.230 is discussed in Part 13 of this bulletin): Example 4 Facts: (i) The amounts accumulated, and derived, by the trustees of a non-qualifying trust as at 31 March 1990 are as follows: Year EndingIncome $Capital Gains $ 31/03/89 31/03/90 10,000 10,000 5,000 5,000 (ii) On 31 March 1990 the trustees passed a resolution allocating $22,000 absolutely to the beneficiary of the trust. Result: (i) The resolution allocating $22,000 to the beneficiary constitutes a distribution because it effects an application of trust property for the benefit of the beneficiary. (ii) Applying the ordering rules in s.230, the $22,000 distribution is deemed to consist of $10,000 income derived in the income year ending 31 March 1990, $10,000 income derived in the income year ending 31 March 1989, and $2,000 capital gains derived in the income year ending 31 March 1990. (iii) The portion of the distribution which consists of the $10,000 income derived by the trustees in the income year ending 31 March 1990 is beneficiary income of the beneficiary because it constitutes income derived by the trustees in the income year ending 31 March 1990 whic h 14 is applied for the benefit of a beneficiary during that income year. (iv) The remaining portion of the distribution (the $10,000 income derived in the income year ending 31 March 1989 and the $2,000 capital gain derived in the income year ending 31March 1990) constitutes a taxable distribution derived by the beneficiary. 4.36 In terms of the "beneficiary income" defini- tion, discussed in Part 5 of this bulletin, amounts vested in or paid to or applied for a beneficiary do not constitute beneficiary income unless they constitute income which was first derived by the trustee. Therefore, in Example 4 the portion of the distribution which consists of the $2,000 capital gain derived by the trustees in the income year ending 31 March 1990 does not constitute benefici- ary income because it is not income which is derived by the trustee. Current year capital gain • distributions may constitute taxable distributions but they cannot constitute beneficiary income. In this context, the capital gains referred to are capital gains other than those which are included in assessable income under the Income Tax Act. Capital gains which are assessable as income, for example in terms of s .67 of the Income Tax Act, may be assessable as beneficiary income if the requirements of the beneficiary income definition are satisfied . (c) Propertydisposed of or made available to the beneficiary 4.37 Paragraph (a) of the definition of "distribu- tion" provides that any property of a trust which has been disposed of or made available to the beneficiary constitutes a distribution to the extent that the property was made available or disposed of to the beneficiary for less than market value. 4.38 Transactions of this type are included within the definition because they are an obvious means of transferring benefits to a beneficiary . To exclude such transactions from taxation in the context of foreign and non-qualifying trusts would create opportunities for benefits to be transferred to resident beneficiaries in a tax free form. The trustees may be better able to make such benefits available because the trustee income derived by the trustees was accumulated free of tax. 4.39 Property may also be made available or disposed of to beneficiaries of qualifyingtrusts at below market value. In the case of qualifying trusts distributions of this type will be assessable only if theyconstitutebeneficiary income . To constitute beneficiary income the distribution must represent income derived by the trustee which vests absolutely in interest in the benefici- ary or which is paid or applied to or for the benefit of the beneficiary. This could occur, for example, where the trustee uses income derived during an income year to purchase property for distribution to the beneficiary during that income year or within six months thereafter and the beneficiary does not provide a market value consideration for the property. However, there would not be benefi- ciary income where the trustee simply made property available to the beneficiary because the distribution would not represent income derived by the trustee. 4.40 The concept of "market value" is discussed in Part 6 of this bulletin. In broad terms, the market value of property is the amount at which a reason- able and willing vendor would sell the property or make it available to a willing, well informed and prudent purchaser or lessee. 4.41 By s.230(2)(c), the ordering rules do not apply with respect to distributions of thetype described in paragraph (a) of the "distribution" definition and such distributions are deemed to be taxable distributions. The ordering rules do not apply because there may be no income derived by the trustees which corresponds to the distribution. For example, if in a particular income year the trustees derive income of $5,000 and make prop- erty available to the beneficiary for an annual rental of $10,000 where the market rental is $15,000, the distribution of $5,000 which arises because the property is made available at below market rates does not constitute a distribution of the $5,000 income derived by the trustees. That $5,000 of income remains available for distribution and its treatment is unaffected by the paragraph (a) distribution . In this case the amount which is treated as a distribution reflects the income which the trustees would otherwise have derived in rela- tion to the property; it does not reflect income actually derived by the trustees . 4 .42 Section 230(2) further provides that distribu- tions of the type described in paragraph (a) of the "distribution" definition are taxable distributions. However, this rule applies only where the order- ing rules do not apply to a distribution by virtue of s.230(2)(c). In the case of qualifying trusts s.230(2)(c) does not operate to prevent the ordering rules from applying to distributions from the trust because the ordering rules are already prevented from applying by virtue of s.230(2)(a) . Therefore, where a distribution from a qualifying trust is of a type described in paragraph (a) of the "distribu- tion" definition s.230(2)(c) and the concluding language of s.230(2) do not operate to treat the distribution as a taxable distribution. 15 (d) Services provided to the beneficiary 4.43 Paragraph (b) of the "distribution" defini- tion provides that where services are provided by trusteesto a beneficiary at below market value the difference between themarketvalue of the services and the value provided by the beneficiary consti- tutes adistribution. 4.44 Transactions of this nature are treated as distributions because, as with transactions of the type described in paragraph (a) of the "distribu- tion" definition, they would otherwise provide opportunities for providing benefits to beneficiar- ies on a tax free basis. For example, if the trustee provides services to a beneficiary which have a market value of $10,000 and the beneficiary does not pay for the services, the transaction is equiva- lent to the trustees distributing $10,000 to the beneficiary and the beneficiary then paying for the services. 4.45 Section 230(2)(c) provides that the s.230(1) ordering rules do not apply to distributions of the type described in paragraph (b) of the "distribu- tion" definition and the concluding language of s.230(2) provides that such distributions are taxable distributions . However, this rule applies only where the ordering rules do not apply to a distribution by virtue of s.230(2)(c). In the case of qualifying trusts s.230(2)(c) does not operate to prevent the ordering rules from applying to distributions from the trust because the ordering rules are already prevented from applying by virtue of s.230(2)(a). Therefore, where a distribu- tion from a qualifying trust is of a type described in paragraph (b) of the "distribution" definition s.230(2)(c) and the concluding language of s.230(2) do not operate to treat the distribution as a taxable distribution. 4 .46 Paragraph (b) applies where the trustee provides services to the beneficiary. That is, the trustee must be actually providing the services. Paragraph (b) does not apply where the trustee pays another person to provide services to the beneficiary. In these circumstances the payment to the person providing the services will constitute a payment or application of property of the trust for the benefit of the beneficiary in terms of the intro- ductory words of the "distribution" definition. (e) Beneficiarydisposingof property, or providing services, to thetrustees. 4.47 By paragraph (c) of the "distribution" definition, the following transactions constitute distributions: (i) the dispositionof property by the beneficiaryto the trust for an amount which is greaterthan the market value ofthe property. The transaction gives rise to a distribution to the extent that the valueprovided by the trustee exceeds the marketvalue of the property. (ii) the making available of property by the beneficiary to the trust for an amount which is greater than the market value of the services. The distribution is the difference between the value provided by the trustee for the use of the property and the market value of the use of such property. (iii) the provision of services by the beneficiary to the trustees for an amount which is greater than the market value of those services. The distribution is the difference between the value provided by the trustee for the services and the market value of the services . 4.48 These transactions are treated as distribu- tions because they involve a transfer of amounts from a trustee to a beneficiary. For example, if a beneficiary sells to a trustee an asset with a market value of $1,000 for consideration of $10,000 the trustee has effectively distributed $9,000 to the beneficiary. 4.49 The ordering rules apply to distributions in this categorywhich are made from non-qualifying and foreign trusts. Thus, in the example given in the preceding paragraph the $9,000 distribution would consist ofbeneficiaryincome, a taxable distribution or non-assessable amounts according to the classification ar ri ved at on application of s.230(s.230 is discussedin Part13 of this bulle ti n). (f) Settlements by trustees on other trusts 4.50 Paragraph (d) of the "distribution" defini- tion provides that amounts settled by the trustees of one trust to or for the benefit of or on the terms of another trust are distributions to the extent that the amounts constituting the settlement would have constituted beneficiary income or a taxable distribution if, at the time of settlement, those amounts had been distributed to a resident benefi- ciary of the trust making the settlement. 4.51 The objective of this provision is to ensure that amounts accumulated or derived by the trusteesof a trust which would be assessable on dist ri bution to a residentbeneficiarycannot be convertedinto a non-assessable distribution by 16 settlement on another trust.This is achieved by treating the settlement of such amounts as a distribu ti onfrom thetrust making the se tt lement to the trust on which the settlement is made, and by providingthat proper ty contained in the settlement does not constitute corpus in relation to the truston which these tt lement is made (para- graph(a) "corpus"defini ti on). 4.52 Where amounts are settled by the trustee of one trust on the terms of another trust (referred to below as "the second trust") the legislation oper- ates as follows: (i) Paragraph (d) of the "distribution" defi- nition treats the sums, amounts or property settled by the trustees as a dis- tribution only to the extent that these would have constituted beneficiary income or a taxable distribution to a resident beneficiary if distributed at the time of settlement. Therefore, it is neces- sary to categorise the trust from which the settlement is made and then to apply s.230 to determine what the hypothetical distribution to a resident beneficiary from that trust would have consisted of. This is the same process as that under- taken for the purpose of paragraph (a) of the "corpus" definition . Thus, amounts which, by virtue of paragraph (d) of the "distribution" definition, are treated as a distribution to the second trust will at the same time be prevented from constitut- ing corpus of that trust by virtue of paragraph (a) of the "corpus" definition . (ii) The second trust is a beneficiary of the trust making the settlement (this is clear from the introductory language of the "distribution" definition). Therefore, to the extent that the amounts settled on the second trust constitute a distribution they will be income derived by the second trust. This is because the distribu- tion will constitute either beneficiary income or a taxable distribution to the second trust. (iii) To the extent that the settlement consti- tutes a distribution to the second trust, and therefore constitutes income derived by the second trust, the pool of income available in the second trust for charac- terising distributions from that trust is increased . 4.53 In order to apply paragraph (d) of the "distribution" definition it is not necessary that there actually be a resident beneficiary of the trust making the settlement . The provision is applied by assuming that there is such a beneficiary and by determining what the treatment would be if a distribution were made to such a beneficiary . 4.54 The following example demonstrates the effect of paragraph (d) of the "distribution" definition: Example5 Facts: (i) Trust A is a non-qualifying trust which was established on 1 April1987 bya settlement of property to the value of $100,000. The following table records the amounts accumulated by the trustees as at 31 March 1990: Year EndingIncome $Capital gains $Corpus$ 31/03/888,0005,000100,000 31/03/8912,0005,000 31103/905,000 Totals25,00010,000100,000 (ii) On 1 April 1990 the trustees of Trust A establish a new trust, Trust B, and settle the $25,000 income and $10,000 capital gains accumulated in Trust A, and the $100,000 corpus settled originally on Trust A, on the terms of Trust B. (iii) On 2 April1990 the trustees of Trust B distribute $135,000 to abeneficiaryof thattrust who is resident in New Zealand. Result: (i) Trust A is a non-qualifying trust. Therefore, any distribution on 1 April 1990 to a beneficiary who was resident in New Zealandwould have been assessable to the extent that it consisted of a distribution of income or capital gains. (ii) By virtue of the proviso to s.9 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 5) 1988, the $8,000 income and the $5,000 capital gains derived by the trustees in the income year ending 31 March 1988 would not be assessable if distributed to a resident beneficiary. These amounts do not fall within para- graph (a) of the "corpus" definition or paragraph (d) of the "distribution" definition because they would not be beneficiary income or a taxable distribu- tion in relation to a resident beneficiary i f 17 distributed to such a beneficiary at the time of settlement. Therefore, together with the $100,000 corpus originally settled on Trust A, these amounts do not constitute a distribution from Trust A to Trust B and are treated as corpus in relation to Trust B. (iii) If the $22,000 income and capital gains derived in the income years ending 31 March 1989 and 31 March 1990 were dis- tributed to a resident beneficiary on 1 April 1990 they would be assessable to that beneficiary . Therefore, these amounts fall within paragraph (d) of the "distribution" definition and there is a distribution of $22,000 from Trust A to Trust B. This distribution constitutes income derived by Trust B: $5,000 consti- tutes beneficiary income because it represents a payment or application of the $5,000 income derived by the trustees of Trust A in the income year ending 31 March 1990; and the remaining $17,000 constitutes a taxable distribution. Further, no portion of the $22,000 distri- bution constitutes corpus because the entire amount falls within the terms of paragraph (a) of the "corpus" definition. (iv) The distribution to the beneficiary of Trust B constitutes corpus to the extent of $113,000: ie the sum of the $100,000 corpus originally settled on Trust A and the $8,000 income and $5,000 capital gains derived by the trustees of Trust A in the income year ending 31 March 1988. The remaining $22,000 constitutes benefi- ciary income in the hands of the benefici- ary because it constitutes income derived by the trustee during the income year ending 31 March 1991 which is paid to the beneficiary during that income year. (g) Value and beneficiaries 4.55 The concluding language of the "distribu- tion" definition provides that the fact that a benefi- ciary is or will become a beneficiary under the terms of a trust does not constitute the giving or receiving of any value. In the absence of this provision a beneficiary could argue that the beneficiary's claim on trust property is of value and that where this claim is given up in considera- tion for the transfer of trust property from the trustee there is no distribution from the trust because the value provided by the beneficiary in giving up the claim is equivalent to the value of the property transferred by the trustee . The con- cluding language of the "distribution" definition leaves no scope for this argument by providing that the beneficiary's claim on the trust has no value in determining whether a transaction results in a distribution. (h) In specie distributions 4S6 The definition of "distribution" encom- passes distributions of trust assets (these are commonly referred to as "in specie" distributions). The introductory language of the "distribution" definition treats as a distribution "any property" of the trust which vests absolutely in interest in a beneficiary or which is paid to or applied for the benefit of a beneficiary. Where the "property" of the trust vested in or paid or applied to or for the benefit of the beneficiary constitutes an asset the distribution will be the market value of the asset. Paragraph (a) of the "distribution" definition provides that where "property" of the trust is disposed of to a beneficiary at below market value there is a distribution to the extent that the market value of the property exceeds the value provided by the beneficiary. 4 .57 If an asset of a qualifying trust is distributed to a beneficiarythedistributionwill notbeassess- able to the beneficiaryunless the distribution constitutesbeneficiary income: s.227(6). A distri- bution of an asset may giverise tobeneficiary income if, for example, the trustee used income derived inan income year to purchase an asset to distributeto a beneficiaryduring or within six months after that income year . In these circum- stances the distribution will constitute beneficiary income if the asset is convertible into cash, if the beneficiaryis entitled to distributions of income from the trust and if the distribution is in satisfac- tion of that entitlement. 4.58 If an asset of a foreign trust or a non-qualify- ing trust is distributed to a be neficiarys.230(1) is applied, subject to s.230(2),to determine the constituent elements of the dist ribution . Where the asset has appreciated in value since acquisition by the trustee the accrued increase in value will be "realised" on distributionof the asset. The capital profit or gain thus realised will beavailable to characterise the distribution in accordance with s.230(1). Thedistributionto thebeneficiary"real- ises" the accrued capital profit or gain in the asset because it satisfies any claim of thebeneficiary against the trust. Foreign trust (a) Significance 4.59 The definition of "foreign trust" is relevant in determining the treatment of distribu tions to beneficiaries. Broadly, distributionsof income accumulated by trustees of foreign trusts are 18 assessable to residentbeneficiaries but distribu- tions of capital gains and corpus arenot. The rationale for thistreatment is discussed in para. 4 .96 below. (b) Definition 4.60 A trust is a foreign trust in relation to a distribution where no settlor of the trust has been resident in New Zealand at any time from the later of 17 December 1987 or the date on which a settle- ment was first made on the terms of the trust until the date of the distribution. 4.61 Thus, if the trust was settled before 17 December 1987 it will be a foreign trust in relation to a distribution if no settlor was resident in New Zealand at any time between 17 December 1987 and the date of the distribution. A trust settled by a New Zealand resident before 17 December 1987 may therefore be a foreign trust in relation to a distribution, but only if the settlor was not resident at any time between 17 December 1987 and the date of distribution. 4.62 If the trust was first settled on or after 17 December 1987 it will be a foreign trust in relation to a distribution if from the date of first settlement no settlor has been resident in New Zealand. Thus, a trust will be a foreign trust in relation to a distri- bution if: (i) it was settled after 17 December 1987 by a person who has never been resident in New Zealand between the date of settlement and the date of distribution; or (ii) it was settled after17 December 1987 by a person who has been resident in New Zealand but not be tween the date on which a settlement was first made on the trust and the date of distribu tion . 4.63 Also, a trust will be a foreign trust if a settlor had been resident in New Zealand after the later of 17 December 1987 or the date of first settlement of the trust but the settlor was not a settlor of the trust while he or she was resident in New Zealand. For example, if A, a resident of Australia, settles a trust on 1 June 1989 while B is resident in New Zealand, and if B, after ceasing toberesident in New Zealand, settles property on the trust on 1 October 1989, the trust will be a foreign trust in relation to distributions because B was not a settlor of the trust while B was resident in New Zealand . 4.64 Wherea trust was first settled before 17 December 1987and the settlor died resident in New Zealand before 17 December 1987 the trust may technically be a foreigntrust.However, if the trust also satisfiesthe definition of a "qualifying trust" it will be treated as a qualifying trust rather than as a foreign trust. If a settlor of a testamentary trust dies resident in New Zealand after 17 Decem- ber 1987 the deceased is treated as a settlor of the trust and the trust will not be a foreign trust because there will have been a resident settlor of the trust after 17 December 1987. It is clear from s.228(3)(b) and from the concluding language to the "disposition of property" definition that persons who create trusts on their death are treated as settlors whose residence status must be determined at death. 4 .65 The significance of 17 December 1987 in the context of the "foreign trust" definition is that residents were placed on notice in the Government's Consultative Document on Interna- tional Tax Reform, released on 17 December 1987, that they would be liable for tax on trustee income if they settled trusts with non-resident trustees after that date. Therefore, it was appropriate to ensure that the relatively favorable treatment afforded in respect of foreign trusts was not available where a settlor of a trust settled before 17 December 1987 was resident in New Zealand after that date, or where a trust was settled after 17 December 1987 and the settlor was resident at any time after the settlement. General I?gwerof appointment 4.66 This expression is used in the definition of "disposition of property". That expression is discussed in Part 6 of this bulletin and for ease of reference the expression "general power of ap- pointment" is also discussed in Part 6 . Non-qualif ng trust (a) Significanc e 4 .67 As with the definition of "foreign trust", the definition of "non-qualifying trust" is relevant in determining the treatment of distributions. 4.68 Broadly, distributions of income and capital gains, but not of corpus, are assessable to benefici- aries of non-qualifying trusts either as beneficiary income or as taxable distributions. Except to the extent that such distributions constitute benefici- ary income, they are taxed at a rate of 45 percent : s .227(4). (b) Definition 4.69 Non-qualifyingtrusts a re all trusts other than qualifying trusts and foreign trusts . Thus, the following trustswill not be non-qualifying trusts in relation to a distribution: (i) trusts where no settlor has been resident in New Zealand between the 19 later of 17 December 1987 or the date on which a settlement was first made on thetrustand the date of distribution. These are foreign trusts. (ii) trusts where all of the trustee income derived by the trustees from the income year in which the trust was first settled until the income year in which the distribution is made has been liable to New Zealand income tax other than as non-resident with- holding income and the trustee's obli- gations in relation to this liability have been satisfied. These are qualifying trusts. 4.70 In broad terms, this means that non-qualify- ing trusts are those where there has been a settlor resident in New Zealand since the later of 17 December 1987 or the date of first settlement of the trust and either: (i) any portion of the trustee income derived by the trustees from the income year in which the trust was first settled untilthe income year in which the distri- bution is made has not been liable to New Zealand tax (except where the trustee income was not liable to income tax in one of the circumstances listed in paras (a) to (c) of the definition of "quali fying trust") or has only been liable to New Zealand income tax as non-resident withholding income; or (ii) any portion of the trustee income derived by the trustees from the income year in which the trust was first settled until the income year in which the distri- bution is made has been liable to tax but the trustee's obligations in respect of that liability have not been satisfied . 4.71 The followingare examples of trusts which may fall into the firstcategory (ie those where not all of thetrustee income has been liable to New Zealand income tax) : (i) Trusts which have been settled by a person resident in New Zealand before 17 December 1987 on trustees resident outside New Zealand where the settlor has been resident in New Zealand since 17 December 1987. These trusts are likely to be non-qualifying trusts (unless an election to pay tax on trustee income was made under s.227A before 31 May 1989) because all foreign source trustee income will not have been liable to New Zealand income tax and New Zealand source trustee income may have been liable to New Zealand income tax only as non- resident withholding income . (ii) Trusts which have been settled by a person who was non-resident at the time of settlement or, if resident at the time of settlement, who has been non-resident since 17 December 1987, and in both cases the settlor subsequently became resident and no election to pay tax on trustee income has been made in accor- dance with s.226A. These trusts will be non-qualifying trusts in relation to distri- butions of income and capital profits or gains derived after the date for making a s.226A election expires : s .226A(3) (s.226A is discussed in Part 7 of this bulletin). (iii) Trusts which have been settled by a person resident in New Zealand who later ceases to be resident in New Zealand and no election to pay tax on trustee income is made in accordance with s .228(7) . In these circumstances the trustee income derived from outside New Zealand will cease to be liable to New Zealand income tax, unless there is another settlor of the trust resident in New Zealand. Also, if the trustee is resident outside New Zealand any trustee income derived from New Zealand may be liable to New Zealand income tax only as non-resident with- holding income. Consequently, the trust may become a non-qualifying trust in relation to distributions made after the settlor ceases to be resident in New Zealand because there will have been a resident settlor of the trust (ie the trust will not be a foreign trust) and not all of the trustee income will have been liable to New Zealand income tax other than as non-resident withholding income (ie the trust will not be a qualifying trust). Qualifying trust (a) Significance 4.72 "Qualifying trusts" constitute the third category of trust which is relevant for the purpose of determining the treatment of distributions from trusts, the other two categories being foreign trusts and non-qualifying trusts . 4 .73 Broadly, distributions from qualifying trusts of amounts other than beneficiary income are not assessable to beneficiaries: s.227(6) . This contrasts with the position in relation to foreign trusts and non-qualifying trusts where distributions of amounts other than beneficiar y 20 income may be assessable. The reason for this different treatment is that in the case of qualifying trusts trustee income has already been liable to New Zealand tax in the hands of the trustee. Therefore, given that trustees pay tax as represen- tatives for beneficiaries it is not appropriate to tax the income a second time in the hands of the beneficiary . By contrast, in the case of foreign trusts and non-qualifying trusts the trustee income may not all have been liable to New Zealand income tax . Consequently, it is appropriate to tax the income when it is ultimately distributed to a resident beneficiary. (b) Requirements 4.74 Atrustwill be a qualifying trust in relation to a distribution if tworequirementsare satisfied: (i) from the income year during which a settlement was first made on the terms of the trust until the income year in which the distribution is made all trustee income derived by the trustees has been liable to New Zealand income tax other than only as non-resident withholding income ; an d (ii) the tr ustee's obligations in respect of that liability havebeen satisfied. 4 .75 It is anticipated that most trusts established by resident settlors where the trustees are resident in New Zealand will satisfy these requirements . For example, if a resident individual settles income producing property on the terms of a trust and resident trustees are appointed, the trust will most likely be a qualifying trust because the trustee income will have been liable to tax from the date on which the settlement was first made . Conse- quently, in the case of such trusts distributions of amounts other than of beneficiary income will not be assessable: s.227(6). (c) Liabilityfor income tax 4.76 The definition of "qualifying trust" requires that all of the trustee income derived by the trus- tees from the income year in which a settlement was first made on the trust until the income year in which the distribution is made has been liable to New Zealand income tax. The liability must have existed in relation to the "trustee income" derived by the trustees. This is the income derived by the trustees which is not also beneficiary income (see Part 5 of this bulletin for a discussion of the "bene- ficiary income" and "trustee income" definitions) . The definition is applied by considering the liability for tax in relation to income which was not assessable to beneficiaries in all income years from the income year in which the trust was first settled until the income year in which the distribu- tion was made. This includes income years falling before the 1989 income year (ie the income year from which the new trust regime applied). 4.77 Wi th respect to income years commencing on and after 1 April 1988 th e ques tion of whether the trustee income is liable to New Zealand in- come tax is determined in accordance with s .228 . Wi th respect to earlier years the question is deter- mined in accordance withthe provisions con- tained in th e previous trust regime . Inland Reve- nue considers that trustee income derived from New Zealand and from outside New Zealand would have been liable to New Zealand income tax underthe previous trust regime if a trustee of the trust was resident in New Zealand. The deci- sion of the Australian High Court in Union Fidelity TrusteeCompanyof Australia Ltd v FCT (1969) 119 CLR 117 thatincome from foreign sources is not assessable on the basis of the residence of the trustee did not apply in the context of the previous New Zealand tr ust regime because the Australian legislation on which the decision was based was d i fferent in significant respects from the New Zealand legislation. For example, under the New Zealand legislation trustees were assessable on trustee income as if they were "beneficially en- titled" tothe income . This language was not used inthe Australian legislation . 4.78 The trustee income must have been liable to New Zealand income tax other than only as non- resident withholding income . Thus, a trust will not be a qualifying trust if any or all of the trustee income was liable to tax only as non-resident withholding income (as defined in s.310 of the Income Tax Act) . (d) Satisfaction of trustee's obligations 4.79 The definition of "qualifying trust" requires the satisfaction of the trustee's obligations rather than actual payment of all income tax for which the trustees are liable . This ensures that a trust may still be a qualifying trust where the trustees have entered into deferred payment arrangements with the Commissioner. 4 .80 If all of the trustee income has been liable to tax but the trustee's obligations have not been satisfied it will be possible to convert the trust into a qualifying trust by satisfying the trustee's obliga- tions. For example, if the trustees had failed to declare income from a particular source for several years the trust would be a qualifying trust if the trustees furnished amended returns declaring the income and satisfied their obligations in respect of that income. 21 (e) Situations where the trustee income would have been liable to income tax 4.81 In some cases it may not be possible to satisfy the requirement that all of the trustee income has been liable to New Zealand income tax because during one or more of the income years falling between the income year in which the trust was first settled and the income year in which the distribution is made there may have been no trustee income, or there may have been trustee income but it may have been exempt from income tax . In these circumstances it is necessary to ensure that the fact that no trustee income was derived in a particular income year, or if income was derived the fact that such income was exempt from tax, does not prevent the trust from being a qualifying trust. The definition achieves this result by provid- ing that where during any income year - (i) no income was de ri ved by thetrustees (paragraph ( a) of the "qualifying trust" definition); or (ii) the trustee income was exempt from income tax by virtue of s.61(paragraph (b) ofthe "qualifying trust" definition); or (iii) allowable deductions exceeded income derived by the trustees, or losses carried foward exceeded income derived by the trustees (paragraph (c) of the "qualifying trust" definition) ; - the "qualifying trust" definition is applied by determining whether trustee income would have been liable to New Zealand income tax other than as non-resident withholding income if not for the fact that during that income year no income was derived by the trustees, the trustee income was exempt by virtue of s.61, or allowable deductions or losses carried over exceeded income derived by the trustees. 4.82 The trustees may derive no income in terms of the trustee income definition in two situations . First, they may have derived no income at all because the trust was dormant or their invest- ments yielded no income during the income year. Second, they may have derived income but there was no trustee income because all of the income was beneficiary income. In both situations the "qualifying trust" definition is applied on the basis of whether there would have been a liability to income tax if there had been trustee income. Where all of the income derived by the trustee is beneficiary income it is consistent with the pur- pose of the "qualifying trust" definition to ensure that the fact that there is no trustee income does not prevent the trust from being a qualifying trust. In cases where the trustee passes all of the income through to the beneficiaries there is no deferral of tax with respect to any New Zealand resident beneficiaries. Thus, if the trustee income would have been liable to New Zealand income tax in a particular incomeyearif the income had not all been passed through to the beneficiaries it is ap- propriate to treat the requirements of the "qualify- ing trust" definition as having been satisfiedfor that income year. 4.83 Paragraph (b) of the "qualifying trust" definition would apply in relation to a charitable trust the income of which is exempt from income tax under s.61 of the income Tax Act. Thus, where the income of a charitable trust is exempt from income tax under s .61 any distribution from the trust which does not constitute beneficiary income will be a non-assessable distribution from a quali- fying trust: s.227(6). Where a distribution from a charitable trust constitutes beneficiary income it will be exempt from tax if it satisfies s.61(25), s.61(26) or s .61(27). Subject to several limitations, those provisions operate to exempt the income derived in trust for charitable purposes, whether the income is trustee income or beneficiary in- come. 4.84 Paragraphs(a) to (c) of the "qualifying trust" definition merely ensure that if the circum- stances specified in those paragraphs occur du ri ng any income year that does not necessarily preclude the trust frombe ing a qualifying trust. Tobe classified as a qualifying trust it is necessa ry that thetrust sati sfy the requirements of the de fi ni ti on in relation to other income years duri ng which the trust was in existence. For example, if in year one the expenses incurredby thetrustees exceeded the income derived by them to the extent of $5,000 and this amount was car ri ed foward to year two and offset against income of $10,000 derived by the trustees in that year, and if a distribution of $5,000 wasmadeinyearthree, Lhe trust would be a qualifying trust in relation to the distribution only if - (i) during year one the trustees would have been liable for New Zealand income tax on trustee income other than only as non-resident withholding income if trustee income had been derived; (n) during years two and three the trustees are liable to New Zealand income tax on the trustee income other than only as non-resident withholding income; and (iii) 22 thetrustees' obligations in respect of their liability to NewZealand income tax on the tr ustee income have been satis- fied. MQualifying trusts resulting from elections 4.85 In some cases a trust which would not otherwise satisfy the requirements of the qualify- ing trust definition may nevertheless be a qualify- ing trust by reason of a settlor, trustee or benefici- ary of the trust making an election to pay tax on trustee income under s.228(7). The circumstances in which a s .228(7) election may allow a trust which would not otherwisebea qualifying trust to become a qualifying trust are specified in ss.226A and 227A. Those provisions are discussed in Parts 7 and 9 of this bulletin respectively. (g) Superannuation regime 4.86 Income derived by "superannuation funds" (as defined in s.2 of the Income Tax Act) is assess- able as trustee income under the provisions of the trust regime . The normal treatment of income derived through trusts is modified in the case of superannuation funds. These modifications are discussed in Appendix D to TIB No. 3. 4.87 Superannuation funds are specifically precluded from being qualifying trusts in relation to distributions. However, a proviso to the qualify- ing trust definition was inserted by the Income Tax Amendment Act 1989 to the effect that all superan- nuation funds are qualifying trusts from 1 April 1990. Also, the concluding language to the benefi- ciary income definition provides that income derived by trustees of superannuation funds does not constitute beneficiary income. The effect of these provisions is that distributions from superan- nuation funds will not be beneficiary income but until 1 April 1990 s.227(6) will not prevent the dis- tributions from being assessable under other provi- sions of the Income Tax Act. After that date super- annuation funds will be qualifying trusts and by s.227(6) distributions from superannuation funds will not be assessable. Taxable distribution (a) Significance 4.88 The general scheme of the taxation of in- come derived through trusts, both under the previous and new trust taxation regimes, is that trustees derive income in a representative capacity for the ultimate owners of the income, the benefici- aries. Therefore, when the trustees have paid New Zealand tax on income which they derive in one year, and that income is subsequently distributed in another year, tax is not imposed on the benefici- ary on that subsequent distribution because tax has already been paid on that income on the benefici- ary's behalf:CofT vLuttrell \[1949\] NZLR 823. 4.89 Under the previous trust taxation regime, one consequence of the fact that there is only one trust income was that it was generally considered that a distribution to a beneficiary was not assess- able if it consisted of income derived from outside New Zealand which was accumulated by a non- resident trustee and which was paid out more than six months after the income year in which it was derived by the trustee. It was argued that to tax the beneficiary would amount to double taxation in theLuttrellsense or that because the income was derived on behalf of the beneficiary in one year it could not be derived by the beneficiary in a later year when it was paid to the beneficiary. This ar- gument is no longer available in relation to distri- butions from foreign trusts and non-qualifying trusts of amounts which do not constitute benefici- ary income. Distributions of accumulated income - in the case of foreign trusts - and of accumulated income and current and accumulated capital gains - in the case of non-qualifying trusts - are now clearly assessable to resident beneficiaries as taxable distributions. This is the case whether or not any portion of the accumulated income was derived from New Zealand sources and was subject to tax in New Zealand. (b) Definition 4.90 In broad terms a taxable dist ributi on is a distribu ti on from a non-qualifying trust or a foreign trust(but not from a superannuation fund as defined in s.2 of the Income TaxAct) which: (i) does not constitutebeneficiaryincome; (ii) in the case of a foreign trust does not consist of a distribution of capital profits or gains or a distribution of corpus ; (iii) inthe case of a non-qualifying trust does not consist of a distribution of corpus. 4.91 Therefore, there are three questions to consider in determining whether a beneficiary has derived a taxable distribution: (i) has the beneficiary derived a distribution? (ii) is the trust a foreign trust or a non-quali- fying trust, but not a superannuation fund, in relation to any such distribution? (iii) what are the component parts of any such distribution as determined by s.230(1) or, whe rethat provision does not apply, by the termsof the trust or the terms of the exercise of the trustee's discretion ? 23 4.92 The first question has been discussed above in relation to the definition of "distribution". The second question turns upon the definitions of "foreign trust", "non-qualifying trust" and "super- annuation fund". The first two expressions are discussed above. "Superannuation fund" is de- fined in s.2 as superannuation category 1 and 2 schemes and superannuation schemes registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. Superannuation schemes constituted outside New Zealand and classified by the Government Actuary under the Superannuation Schemes Regulations 1983 are excluded from the "superannuation fund" definition . Superannuation funds will be non- qualifying trusts until 1 April 1990 because they are expressly excluded from the "qualifying trust" definition until that date. The objective of this exclusion is to ensure that distributions from superannuation funds remain assessable under the general provisions of the Income Tax Act until 1 April 1990 (although such distributions will not be assessable as beneficiary income by virtue of the concluding language of the "beneficiary income" definition). However, it is intended that these distributions will be assessable at the recipient's normal rates rather than at the higher rate apply- ing in relation to distributions from non-qualifying trusts. Thus, distributions from superannuation funds are excluded from the definition of "taxable distribution" . 4.93 The third question, applying s.230 to deter- mine the constituent elements of the distribution, finally establishes the extent to which the distribu- tion is assessable to the beneficiary. The applica- tion of s.230 is discussed in Part 13 of this bulletin. 4 .94 The exception to the "taxable distribution" definition applies in respect of "a distribution of (or a payment or transaction which represents a distribution of)J.The language in brackets recognises that because of the operation of s .230 the distribution may not actually consist of corpus or a capital gain or profit but rather it may be deemed to consist of such amounts while actually consisting of something else. (c) Taxable distributions and foreign trusts 4.95 Distributions from foreign trusts are taxable distributions to the extent that they consist of income other than beneficiary income. Essentially, this ensures that distributions of income accumu- lated by the trustees of foreign trusts are assessable to resident beneficiaries . Distributions of profits made on the realisation of a capital asset or of other capital profits or capital gains realised by the trustee and distributions of corpus are not taxable distributions (subject to the application of s.226(11) discussed below). 4.96 Taxable distributions are therefore more narrowly defined in respect of foreign trusts than in respect of non-qualifying trusts. This is because New Zealand income tax has been avoided or deferred by accumulating income in trusts which are classified as "non-qualifying trusts". The wider definition of taxable distribution and the higher rate of tax on such distributions reflects this and is intended to encourage such trusts to be wound up or brought within the new regime. In the case of foreign trusts it is appropriate to tax distributions of accumulated income to ensure that resident beneficiaries do not obtain a tax advantage through income being converted into a non- income form through a simple accumulation by the trustees. However, it is not appropriate to tax a beneficiary of a foreign trust on distributions of capital profits or gains because the trust is not con- nected to New Zealand by a resident settlor. Thus, New Zealand income tax will not have been avoided or deferred to the extent that it will have been avoided or deferred in the case of a non- qualifying trust. 4.97 The exclusion, in relation to foreign trusts, of distributions of capital profits from the "taxable distribution" definition is contained in paragraph (b) of the definition. The amounts excluded are distributions of, or payments or transactions which represent a distribution of, profits derived from the realisation of a capital asset or of any other capital profit or capital gain realised by the trustee less any capital loss incurred by the trustee in the income year during which the profit or gain was realised . The capital profit or gain must be realised by the trustee. 'Realised" in this context indicates that there must be a gain which has been received or which is receivable by the trustee. Capital losses are offset against the capital profits or gains where they are incurred on the realisation of a capital asset or where they are otherwise incurred. The use of "incurred" indicates that the losses in question are not accrued losses. 4.98 The exclusion of capital profits or gains applies subject to s.226(11). That provision rechar- acterises as income any capital profits or gains realised by the trustee of a foreign trust where the gain was realised in a transaction with a person associated with the trustee. This is intended to ensure that, for distribution purposes, capital profits or gains cannot be created artificially by trustees in transactions with associated persons. 4.99 Paragraph (b) of the "taxable distribution" definition does not apply to amounts which are "required to be taken into account under this Act for the purpose of assessing income tax". Thus, capital gains of the type which are assessable income under the Income Tax Act are treated as 24 income for distribution purposes. For example, if the trustees realised a gain on the realisation of a piece of land, and the gain was of a type specified in s.67, that gain would be treated as income in calculating the taxable distribution derived by a beneficiary from the trust. (d) Taxable distributions and non-qualifying trusts 4.100 Distributions from non-qualifying trusts are taxable distributions to the extent that the distribu- tion does not constitute beneficiary income or does not consist of corpus . (e) Taxable distributions and distributions between trusts 4.101 Where a distribution is made from a foreign trust or a non-qualifying trust to another trust the distribution may constitute a distribution to a resident beneficiary of the foreign trust or non- qualifying trust if it amounts to a payment or application of property of the trust to or for the benefit of the beneficiary. The paid or applied limb of the beneficiary income definition is discussed in Part 5 of this bulletin and the comments there are relevant in relation to the question of whether a transaction constitutes a distribution to a benefici- ary by virtue of being a payment or application of trust property to or for the benefit of a beneficiary. If the distribution by the foreign trust or non- qualifying trust to the other trust does constitute a distribution to a resident beneficiary of the foreign trust or non-qualifying trust it may constitute a taxable distribution, depending upon the constitu- ent elements of the distribution and the category of trust from which the distribution was made. 4.102 If a distribution from a foreign trust or non- qualifying trust to a second trust does not consti- tute a taxable distribution to a resident beneficiary of the foreign trust or non-qualifying trust it may constitute income derived by the trustee of the second trust. If so, it will constitute beneficiary income or trustee income in relation to the second trust . Where the distribution vests absolutely in interest in the beneficiary during the income year in which it was derived or is paid or applied to a beneficiary during or within 6 months after that income year it will be beneficiary income in rela- tion to the second trust. The treatment of distribu- tions between trusts is discussed above in relation to para (d) of the definition of "distribution". (f) Indirect taxable distributions 4.103 The definition of "taxable distribution" does not refer specifically to "indirect" taxable distribu- tions. However, the definition of "distribution", and thus the definition of "taxable distribution", encompasses indirect distributions because where trust property is "applied" for the benefit of a beneficiary there is a distribution to the beneficiary and, as discussed in relation to the "beneficiary income" definition in Part 5 of this bulletin, amounts can be applied for the benefit of a benefi- ciary without being directly paid or distributed to the beneficiary. 4.104 Two specific rules are also relevant. First, s.227(5) provides that where an arrangement has been entered into in relation to any trust and any beneficiary pursuant to which property is trans- ferred, or services or other benefits are provided to a person other than the beneficiary, then if the effect is to defeat the intent and application of s.227 the property, services or benefits are deemed to be provided to the beneficiary . The intent and appli- cation of s.227 will be defeated where the effect of the arrangement is to provide a direct or indirect benefit to the beneficiary which benefit does not constitute beneficiary income or a taxable distribu- tion . Section 227(5) is discussed in Part 8 of this bulletin. 4 .105 Second, where a taxable distribution is derived by a controlled foreign company (CFC) from a non-qualifying trust that distribution is excluded from the branch equivalent income calculated in relation to the CFC (s.245\](24)) and it is attributed separately to any person resident in New Zealand who has an "income interest of 10 percent or greater" (as defined in s.245A) in the CFC. The amount thus attributed is liable to tax at the higher rate applying to taxable distributions from non-qualifying trusts. This ensures that taxable distributions which are liable for tax at the higher rate of 45 percent cannot be converted to attributed foreign income which is taxable at normal rates. The treatment of taxable distribu- tions derived by CFCs is discussed in Part 8 of this bulletin. Trustee income 4 .106 The "trustee income" definition is discussed in Part 5 of this bulletin. Settlor definition : s .226(2) to (7) 4.107 These subsections are relevant to the definition of a "settlor" and are considered in Part 6 of this bulletin. Charitabletrusts: s.226(8) and (9) Effect of charitabletrust status 4.108 If a trust is a charitable trust in terms of s.226(8) or s.226(9) any person who is a settlor of that trust will not be liable for tax on the trustee 25 income derived by the trustees: s .228(4). The intention of this exemption is to ensure that residents who make donations to charitable trusts which have non-resident trustees are not liable to tax on the income derived by those trustees. 4.109 The legislation does not operate by deem- ing a settlor of a charitable trust not to be a settler. Rather, it exempts such a settler from liability to tax on trustee income. It follows that if there is a resident settler of a charitable trust the trustees will be liable for tax on the trustee income: ss .228(2), 228(3). However, ss.61(25) and 61(27) may operate to exempt the trustees from tax on the trustee income. 4.110 A charitable trust may be a qualifying trust in relation to distributions: paragraph (b) "qualifying trust" definition. If so, distributions which do not constitute beneficiary income will not be assessable: s.227(6). Further, where the income derived by the trustees of the charitable trust is exempt by virtue of s.61 distributions to beneficiaries which constitute beneficiary income will also be exempt by virtue of s.61. General definition: s .226(8) 4.111 Section 226(8) provides that a trust is a charitable trust for the purposes of ss.226 to 233 if in any income year the income derived by the trustees in that income year, and the income derived in previous income years but not distrib- uted, is held in trust solely for charitable pur- poses . The expression "charitable purpose" is defined in s.2 as "including any charitable pur- pose, whether it relates to the relief of poverty, the advancement of education or religion, or any other matter beneficial to the community". 4.112 In determining whether a trust has a charitable purpose it is necessary to decide whether "the real fundamental purpose of \[the\] trust is charitable" : CIR vCarey's (Petone and Mirimar) Ltd\[1963\] NZLR 450, 456;Cowey Mills& Co Ltd v CIR (1982) 5 NZTC 61,172. This is an important point in the context of s226(8) because trusts which are purportedly charitable are com- monly used in schemes involving tax havens . Although such trusts may appear charitable in essence they will often be non-charitable, for example because there is a power to appoint additional non-charitable beneficiaries. 4.113 Where a trust has charitable and non- charitable objects charitable status will not be lost where the non-charitable object is merely ancil- lary, secondary, subordinate or incidental to the charitable purposes of the trust:CIR v New Zealand Council of LawReporting(1981) NZTC 61,053; CIR vCarey's (Petone and Mirimar) Ltd (above). The non-charitable object will be ancil- lary, subordinate or incidental to the charitable objects if there is "no diversion of... income into non-charitable channels" (CIR vCarey's (Petone and Mirimar Ltd)p 455) . However, where income is diverted to non-charitable objects, or where there is the potential for such diversion, the non- charitable objects will not be merely ancillary, subordinate or incidental. Thus, if the trustee has the power to appoint non-charitable beneficiaries this power will be treated as an independent object, rather than as an ancillary, subordinate or incidental object, because it makes provision for the alteration of the very basis of the trust and for the diversion of income to non-charitable objects. Consequently, the trust will not be a charitable trust. 4.114 Section 226(8) is applied on a year by year basis. To satisfy the test in any income year the income derived by the trustees in any income year, and any income derived in prior years but not distributed, must be held in trust solely for charitable purposes. Business carried on by or on behalf of trustees: s.226(9) (a) Effect 4 .115 Section 226(8) applies subject to s.226(9). In broad terms s.226(9) provides that a trust which would otherwise be charitable in terms of s.226(8) is not charitable for the purpose of ss.226 to 233 if a business is carried on by or on behalf of the trustees and any benefit or advantage or any income is able to be derived by a person associ- ated with the charity and that person is able to determine or materially influence the nature or amount of the benefit, advantage or income. (b) Requirements 4.116 The provision applies where the benefit, advantage or income is able to be afforded to or received, gained, achieved or derived by any person who - (i) is a settlerortr ustee of the tr ustby which the business is carried on: in this context the broad definitionof "settlor"contained in s .226 applies; (ii) is a shareholder or directorof the company by which thebusiness is carried on; (iii) is a settloror trustee of a trustthat is a shareholder of the company by which the business is carried on; 26 (iv) is associated in terms of ss .8 or 245B with any such settlor, trustee, shareholder or director . 4 .117 For this requirement to be satisfied it is only necessary that a benefit or advantage or income be able to be afforded to or received, gained, achieved or derived by such a person : it is not necessary that a benefit or advantage or income actually be afforded, received, gained, achieved or derived. 4 .118 The provision applies where the person to whom the benefit, advantage or income is able to be afforded or who is able to receive, gain, achieve or derive such benefit, advantage or income is by virtue of that person's capacity as settlor, trustee, shareholder, director or associated person able to determine or materially influence the nature or the amount of the benefit, advantage or income or the circumstances in which it is to be received. In some cases where trusts have been settled with non- resident trustees "protectors" may be appointed to ensure that the trustees administer the trust in accordance with the wishes of the settlor. Influ- ence exercised through the medium of such protectors, or through the medium of any other person performing the same function as a protec- tor, will be relevant in establishing whether material influence is able tobeexercised by the settlor. (c) Retention of interest in, or reversion of, asset 4.119 By paragraph (e) of s .226(9), any person who disposes of an asset to the trust which is used in the business carried on by or on behalf of the trust is deemed to be a settlor and to gain a benefit or advantage in the carrying on of the business where that person retains or reserves an interest in the asset or where that asset will revert to that person. This operates as an extension to the settlor definition for the purpose of s .226(9). The material influence requirement must still be satisfied before the trust fails as a charitable trust . (d) Deemed business in relation to use of assets 4.120 By paragraph (f) of s.226(9), where a person described in paragraphs (a) to (d) of s .226(9) disposes of an asset to the trustees of the trust and that asset is used by the trustees to derive rent, fines, premiums or other revenues the trustees are deemed to be carrying on business if the person retains or reserves an interest in the asset or if the asset will revert to the person . 4 .121 In the absence of this provision the deriva- tion of rents, fines, premiums or other revenues by the trustees may not constitute the carrying on of a business. Paragraph (f) deems the trustees to be carrying on a business, however the material influence requirement must be satisfied before the trust fails as a charitable trust. (e) Interest at commercial rates 4.122 By paragraph (g) of s.226(9), income is deemed not to be derived by a person described in paragraphs (a) to (d) of s.226(9) if the income consists of interest on money lent where, in the opinion of the Commissioner, the interest is payable at a rate which does not exceed a com- mercial rate. The provision of a loan to trustees at a rate not exceeding commercial rates will therefore not of itself result in the trust failing as a chari- table trust . (f) Rendering of professional services 4 .123 By paragraph (h) of s .226(9), where a person renders professional services to a trust or to a company by which a business is carried on, and those services are rendered in the ordinary course of the carrying on of a business of a profes- sional public practice by the person, then that person is not merely by reason of rendering those services considered to be able to determine or to materially influence the determination or nature or amount of the benefit, advantage or income which is to be afforded, received, gained, achieved or derived . This does not mean that a trust can never fail as charitable when services are provided by a person carrying on a professional public practice . Rather, it only ensures that the mere provision of such services cannot result in the trust failing as charitable. Unit trusts: s.226(10 ) Exclusion from trust regime 4 .124 Section 226(10) provides that ss.226 to 233 do not apply to any trust which is a unit trust. The tax treatment of unit trusts is determined under s.211, and the tax treatment of distributions from and interests in unit trusts is determined under s.4 and s.4A and under s.245R. Unit trusts 4.125 By s .211, a "unit trust" is defined as a scheme or arrangement whereby facilities are provided for subscribers, purchasers or contribu- tors to participate as beneficiaries under a trust in income and gains arising from the investments of the trust . The essential feature is that persons who subscribe to, purchase interests in, or contribute to the trust fund are thereby able to participate as beneficiaries in the income and gains earned from the trust's investments. 27 4.126 Several categories of trust are specifically excluded from the definition. These include super- annuation funds. By s.2, a superannuation fund is defined as a superannuation category 1 or a superannuation category 2 scheme and a superan- nuation scheme which is registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. Schemes which are constituted outside New Zealand and which are classified by the Government Actuary under the Superannuation Schemes Regulations 1983 are excluded from the superannuation fund definition . Superannuation funds fall outside the scope of s.211 and the tax treatment of their income is governed by the trust regime (subject to a number of modifications: see Appendix D to TIB No. 3). 4.127 A unit trust is deemed to be a company and the interests of the unit holders are deemed to be shares in the company. The unit holders are deemed to be shareholders and the income derived by the trustees is deemed to be income derived by the unit trust. If pursuant to s.241(6) the unit trust is resident in New Zealand it will be liable to tax on income derived from within and outside New Zealand . If the unit trust is not resident in New Zealand it will be liable for tax only on income derived from New Zealand. Distributions derived by unit holders are treated as dividends to the extent that they constitute income of the unit trust distributed to the unit holder and other payments or transactions with a unit holder which would be a dividend if made to or with a shareholder: s .4(1)(j). The treatment of distributions from unit trusts as dividends is subject to any relevant exceptions contained in s.4A. Foreign investment funds 4.128 The foreign investment fund (FIF) regime contained in s.245R applies to residents who have an interest in a "foreign entity" or who have an "interest in a foreign personal savings scheme". An interest in a foreign personal savings scheme includes an entitlement to benefit under a "foreign superannuation scheme". That expression is defined as meaning a foreign entity established principally for the purpose of providing retire- ment benefits to beneficiaries. A foreign entity includes a "foreign unit trust", and a foreign unit trust is essentially a unit trust which is non- resident in terms of s.241(6). If none of the excep- tions contained in paragraphs (c) to (h) of s.245R(2) apply, any resident holding an interest in the foreign entity will have an interest in a FIF. Briefly, an interest in a foreign entity will not be an interest in a FIF if any one of the following exceptions is satisfied: (i) the foreign entity is resident in a country specified in the Fifteenth Schedule to the Act: i.e., Australia, Canada, France, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States and West Germany; (ii) the fo re ignentitydistributes as dividends duri ng its accounting pe ri od more than 60 percent of the aggregate of its income, capital profits and capital gains; (iii) as at the end of its accounting period less than 40 percent by market value of the assets of the foreign entity are interests in companies which, if the company were a controlled foreign company, would constitute income interests of less than 25 percent; rights as a beneficiaryin relation to a trust; rights as a partner in relation to a partnership; interests in FIFs; financial arrangements, other than financial arrangements where the foreign entity is engaged principally in the business of issuing or holding financial arrangements; annuities; land acquired or held for the purpose of deriving rent, except where the foreign entityis engaged principally in the business of renting land; certain rights or forbearances which are treated as royalties under the Income Tax Act; rights or options to dispose of any of the above; (iv) the aggregate of the income tax and tax on capital profits paid by or on behalf of the foreign entity is not less than 20 percent of the income, capital profits and capital gains derived by the entity ; (v) the Commissioner has issued a determina- tion under s.245S that interests in the foreign entity do not constitute interests in aFIF; (vi) theperson's interest in the foreign entity constitutes an income interest of 10 percent or greater in a controlled foreign company. 28 4.129 By s.245R(2)(j) these exceptions, except for the rule excluding interests of 10 percent or greater in controlled foreign companies, do not apply where the foreign entity is specified in Part B of the Sixteenth Schedule to the Income Tax Act or where the Commissioner has determined under s.245S that interests in the foreign entity constitute interests in a foreign investment fund. 4.130 If a person is required to calculate FIF income under s.245R, any consideration derived by the person in relation to that interest which is required to be taken into account under s.245R is not taken into account in calculating the person's assessable income under s.65: s.245R(3). Further, such amounts are excluded from the dividend definition by s.4A(1)(m). Thus, if the person derives amounts from the FIF which would normally be assessable as dividends these amounts are taken into account in calculating FIF income instead of being assessable as dividends. Summaryoftreatment of trusts and interests in trusts 4.131 In summarising the treatment of interests in trusts other than trusts which constitute super- annuation funds it is convenient to distinguish between trusts in relation to which the beneficiary is a subscriber, purchaser or contributor and other trusts. For convenience, the first category of trust can be referred to as "contributory" and the others as "non-contributory". The treatment of income derived by the trustees of trusts other than super- annuation funds and of distributions from such trusts can be summarised as follows: Non-contributory (i) Income derived by trustees: - assessable as trustee income if not beneficiary income and: • if derived from New Zealand (s.228(2)); • if derived from outside New Zealand and a settlor of the trust is resident in New Zealand or a trustee is resident in New Zealand and a settlor of the trust at any time died resident in New Zealand (s.228(3)). subject to several exceptions, resident settlors of trusts settled after 17 December 1987 are liable to tax on trustee income (s.228(4),(5)). in the circumstancesset outin s .228(6) (discussed in Part 10 of this bulletin) non- resident trustees are not liable to tax on foreign source trustee income . (ii) Incomederived by beneficiaries: assessable as beneficiaryincome(s.227(1)); treatment of distributions of amounts other than beneficiary income depends upon whether the trust is a qualifying trust, foreign trust or non-qualifying trust in relation to the distribution: • qualifying trust :distribution non-assessable (s.227(6)); • foreign trust: distributions of accumu- lated income assessable as a taxable distribution to the extent that the dis- tribution does not consist of income derived by the trustees in income years commencing before 1 April 1988 (s.226(1) "taxable distribution" definition, proviso to s .9 Income Tax Amendment Act (No 5) 1988, s .227(1)); • non-qualifying trust : distributions of accumulated income and current or accumulated capital gains assessable as a taxable distribution to the extent that the distribution does not consist of income or capital gains derived in income years commencing before 1 April 1988 (s.226(1) "taxable distribu- tion" definition, proviso to s .9 Income Tax Amendment Act (No 5) 1988, s .227(1)). Contributory (i) Income derived by trustees : - trustis a unit trust and liable for tax as a company (s.211) ; - foreign and New Zealand source income assessable if unit trust is resident in New Zealand, otherwise only New Zealand source income assessable (s.242). (ii) Income derived by beneficiaries: if unit trust is resident, or is non-resident but is not a foreign investment fund (FIF), distributions from theunittrust are divi - dends to the extent that they consist of dis- tributions of income of the unit trust or of a payment or other transaction to or with the unit holder which would constitute a dividend if made to or with a shareholder 29 of a company (s .4(1)(j)). Any relevant ex - ceptions to the "dividend" definition con- tained in s .4A apply in determining whether the distribution is a dividend . if unit trust is not resident in New Zealand and is a FIF income is attributed to the tax- payer annuallyunderthe FIF regime (s .245R(3), s.65(2)(eb)); Associated persons tr ansactions and foreign trusts: s.226(11) 4 .132 Distributions of capital gains from foreign trusts are not treated as taxable distributions . Consequently, there is an incentive for trustees of foreign trusts to create capital gains in transactions with associated persons. Section226(11)is in- tended to limit opportunities for capital gains to be created in this manner . 4 .133 Section 226(11) applies to transactions be- tween the trustee and any person associated with the trustee . The associated person rules which apply in this context are those contained in s.8 and in s.245B . These rules will be discussed in detail in a later bulletin on the controlled foreign company legislation contained in Part IVA of the Income Tax Act. 4 .134 If s.226(11) applies the profit or gain realised in the transaction between the trustee and the associated person is treated as income, other than beneficiary income, derived by the trustee. The profit or gain is treated as an amount derived otherwise than as beneficiary income to ensure that it is available as part of the pool of current and accumulated income which is used in charac- terising distributions under s .230. Settlements by employers:s.226(12) 4.135 This provision is relevant in relation to the settlor definition and is considered in Part 6 of this bulletin. PART 5 : BENEFICIARY INCOME AND TRUSTEE INCOME Overvie w 5 .1 Under the previous trust taxation regime income derived by a trustee was taxed either to the trustee or to the beneficiary . Income derived by a trustee was taxed to the beneficiary (and to the trustee as agent for the beneficiary) if it was also income derived by a beneficiary entitled in possession, or who was deemed to be entitled in possession, to the receipt thereof. If there was no beneficiary entitled in possession to the income, or who was deemed to be entitled in possession to the income, it was assessable to the trustee. 5 .2 This general pattern of taxation is pre- served in the new trust taxation regime. Income derived by a trustee is assessable to the benefici- ary, and to the trustee as agent of the beneficiary, if it constitutes "beneficiary income" and to the trustee if it constitutes "trustee income" . The income which is assessable to beneficiaries is more broadly defined than under the previous trust regime and there is a new category of income assessable to the beneficiary, referred to as a "taxable distribution", which was generally con- sidered not to be assessable under the previous regime . However, the general pattern of taxing income to trustees or to beneficiaries remains the same. Beneficiary Income Significance and background 5.3 Under the previous trust regime there was no definition of "beneficiary income". Instead, it was provided that income which was derived in trust for a beneficiary who was "entitled in posses- sion" to the income during the income year in which it was derived by the trustee was taxable to that beneficiary. Also, it was provided in the case of discretionary trusts that where a payment or application of income was made to or for the benefit of a specified beneficiary during or within 6 months of the end of the income year, the benefi- ciary was deemed to be entitled in possession to that income within the income year. This deeming provision was restricted in application to the circumstances where the payment or application was a bona fide transaction which placed the whole or part of the income beyond the posses- sion and control of the trustee in the trustee's capacity as trustee. 5.4 The paid or applied rule was further limited in relation to infant beneficiaries of "speci- fied trusts" (i.e., those created on or after 19 July 1968 other than by will). In such cases income was deemed not to have been paid or applied to or for the benefit of the beneficiary if it came within the possession or under the control of the trustees or was used for the purpose of a business carried on by the trustees. In the case of infant beneficiaries of non-discretionary trusts which were not speci- fied trusts it was provided that income vested in the beneficiary in terms of the trust was deemed to be income to which the beneficiary was entitled in possession. Consequently, the infant beneficiary was assessable on the income. 5.5 The trustees of the trust were liable to tax on all other income derived by them: that is, 30 income to which a beneficiary was not entitled in possession or deemed to be entitled in possession during the same income year in which it was derived by the trustees. 5 .6 The new trust taxation regime is of similar effect. All income derived by the trustees of a trust is characterised as either "beneficiary in- come" or "trustee income" . Both expressions are defined in s226(1). "Trustee income" encompasses all income derived by the trustee of the trust which is not beneficiary income. "Beneficiary income" is defined as income derived during an incomeyear by atrustee which either : (a) vests absolutelyin interestin a beneficiary of the trust during that income year ; or (b) is paid or appliedto or for the benefit of the beneficiary during or within 6 months after the end of the income year. 5 .7 If income derived by a trustee is benefici- ary income it is assessable to the beneficiary: s .227(1). The trustee is also liable for tax in respect of such income as agent of the beneficiary: s.227(2). If the income derived by the trustee is trustee income it is assessable to the trustee, and in some instances to the settlor of the trust, in accordance with s .228. Replacement of entitlement in possession with vesting and removal of restrictions on paid or applied limb 5 .8 The previous trust regime was generally considered to be ineffective to frustrate income splitting through trusts. For example, although it was not possible for infant beneficiaries to be entitled in possession to income derived by the trustee, income could often be taxed to the infant beneficiary by passing it through to a sub-trust in the beneficiary's favour. Rather than placing further restrictions on the ability of trustees to have income taxed to beneficiaries, and therefore further to limit opportunities for income splitting through trusts, it was decided to make it easier to have income taxed to beneficiaries. This approach was taken because of the substantial flattening of income tax rates . It was considered that the flatter rate scale justified giving trustees greater flexibility in determining whether income should be taxed to the trustee or to the beneficiary . The removal of the distinction between specified and non-speci- fied trusts also reflects reduced concern in relation to income splitting through trusts in the context of the flatter tax rates . However, the extent to which trusts can be used to have income taxed at lower rates is limited by excluding income derived by beneficiaries through trusts from the low income rebate calculation: s.50D . 5 .9 The entitlement in possession requirement of the previous trust regime has been replaced by a less stringent absolute vesting requirement. Consequently, a beneficiary who is unable to demand the receipt of his or her income, such as an infant or a person of unsound mind, may derive beneficiary income where previously this may have been precluded by the terms of the legislation. Further, the restrictions placed upon the paid or applied limb have been removed. To qualify as beneficiary income under this limb a payment or application by the trustees must still be made to or for the benefit of a beneficiary. However, the requirement that the payment or application be achieved by a bona fide transaction which places the income beyond the possession and control of the trustees, and the rule assessing income paid or applied to infant beneficiaries of specified trusts to the trustee where it came under the control of the trustee or was used in a business carried on by the trustee, have been removed. 5.10 Simpson v CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,144 provides a practical example of how the new definition of beneficiary income will operate. There, trustees of a family trust appropriated trust income for the benefit of infant beneficiaries by paying the income into the bank account of the beneficiaries' parents. The trust deed provided that any beneficiary to whom trust income was appro- priated was deemed to have an absolutely and indefeasibly vested interest in the income. In terms of the definition of beneficiary income, it is clear that the appropriation would result in the income being vested absolutely in interest in the benefici- ary and that the income would therefore be assess- able to the beneficiary as beneficiary income. Alternatively, the appropriation would be treated as a payment or application of income to or for the benefit of the beneficiary. Beneficiary income firstderived bytr ustee 5 .11 Beneficiary income is defined as income derived by a trustee which vests absolutely in interest in the beneficiary or which is paid or applied to or for the benefit of the beneficiary . Thus, income only constitutes beneficiary income if it first constitutes income derived by the trustee. 5.12 Where a distribution derived by a benefici- ary does not constitute income which has also been derived by the trustee it will not be benefici- ary income, although it may constitute a taxable distribution . For example, if the trustee distributes an amount derived in realising a capital asset the amount thus distributed is not income which was first de ri ved by the trustee (assuming that the capital gain is not required to be taken into ac- count under the Income Tax Act in calculating 31 assessableincome). Consequently, the distributed capital gainwill not be beneficiary income to the beneficiary. 5 .13 Another example is where a distribution from a trust is of a type described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of the definition of "distribution". Pursuant to those paragraphs, the term "distribu- tion" includes the disposition or making available of trust property to the beneficiary for less than market value and the provision of services to the beneficiary for less than market value. In these circumstances there will often be no income derived by the trustee which is then distributed to the beneficiary . For example, if the trust assets include a house and the trustee allows the benefi- ciary to occupy the house for a below market rental the distribution to the beneficiary (i.e., the difference between the market rental and the rental paid by the beneficiary) does not constitute income derived by the trustee which was then distributed to the beneficiary . Therefore, the distribution will not be beneficiary income. Income vesting absolutely in interest in the beneficiar y 5 .14 The expression "vests absolutely in inter- est" is not defined in the legislation. Income vests in a beneficiary where the beneficiary obtains an immediate fixed right of present or future posses- sion of the income. Thus, income vests absolutely in interest in a beneficiary if the beneficiary obtains an immediate right to possession of the income. Also, income vests absolutely in interest in a beneficiary if the beneficiary obtains an immedi- ate right to the future possession of the income . 5 .15 Income vests absolutely in interest in a beneficiary only if it vests indefeasibly in the beneficiary in the sense that the income is finally or absolutely vested in the beneficiary. This inter- pretation arises from the use of the word "vests" and from the use of the word "absolutely" to qualify the expression "vests in interest". It has been held in the context of New Zealand trust taxation legislation (in particular s102(b) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1923) that "vested" means indefeasibly vested in the sense of finally and absolutely vested and not merely defeasibly vested:CofTv Johnsonand Maeder\[1946\] NZLR 446. The use of the word "absolutely" makes it even clearer that income must vest indefeasibly in a beneficiary in order to satisfy the vests abso- lutely in interest requirement . 5.16 Thus, where income vests in interest in a beneficiary but the vesting is not indefeasible the income will not be vested absolutely in interest in the beneficiary. For example, if income is vested in an infant beneficiary subject to the beneficiary attaining the age of 21 the income will not be indefeasibly vested because the beneficiary may not reach that age . On the other hand, if the in- come vests in interest in an infant beneficiary in year 1 but is not payable until year 3,and the payment of the income in year 3 is not subject to divestment or to the satisfaction of any conditions, the income will vest absolutely in interest in the beneficiary in yearIbecause the beneficiary has an indefeasible title to the income in year 1 even though possession is not obtained until year 3. Thus, in contrast to the entitlement in possession test under the previous trust regime, it is not necessary that the beneficiary be entitled in posses- sion to the income.Oneconsequence of income being vested absolutely is that even though the beneficiary may not yet be entitled to possess the income (by reason of infancy, for example) if the beneficiary dies the income belongs to his or her estate; it does not fall back to the trust. 5.17 Income will only vest absolutely in interest in a beneficiary if the income is existing property at the time of vesting . Where the income is future property or an expectancy the vesting will not be effective until the income is received or is receiv- able:Hadleev CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,155. 5.18 In summary,income vestsabsolutely in interestin a beneficiary if the incomeis indefeasi- bly vested in the beneficiaryin the sense of abso- lutely and finally vested. The followingpoints are relevantin determiningwhetherincome vests absolutelyin interestin the beneficiary: (i) income vests absolutelyin interest in a beneficiary where the beneficiaryobtains an i mm ediatefixed right to the present or future possession of the income and the interestof the beneficiaryis notsubject to a contingency and is not subject to being divested in the future; (ii) where (i) is sa ti sfied the income vests absolutely in interestin the beneficiary whether or not the beneficiaryis entitled in possession to the income or is able to demand receipt of the income; (iii) income only vests absolutely in interest in the beneficiary if it is existing property rather than a mere expectancy or future property. Income paid or applied by the trustee: comparison with previous regime 5 .19 Paragraph (b) of the s.226(1) "beneficiary income" definition provides that income derived by a trustee during an income year is beneficiary income if it is paid or applied to or for the benefit 32 of the beneficiary during or within 6 months after the end of the income year. 5.20 The previous trust regime contained a paid or applied provision which was in similar terms to that now contained in the s.226(1) defini- tion of beneficiary income . Where income derived by a trustee during an income year was paid or applied to or for the benefit of a beneficiary during or within 6 months after the income year, the beneficiary was deemed to be entitled in possession to the income and the income was thus assessable to the beneficiary or to the trustee as agent for the beneficiary. However, several restric- tions were placed upon the application of this provision. These restrictions have been omitted from the new legislation. 5.21 The restrictions on the paid or applied limb which have now been removed are: (i) First, the requirement that the payment or application had to be achieved by a'bona fide" transaction. (ii) Second, the requirement the transaction must place the income beyond the posses- sion and control of the trustee in the trustee's capacity as trustee of the trust. This provision was designed to counter transactions of the type dealt with in CIR v Ward \[19701 NZLR 1 where income which was appropriated to the beneficiary in the accounts of the trust was held to have been applied for the benefit of the beneficiary. (iii) Third, the provision that amounts were deemed not to have been paid or applied to or for the benefit of infant beneficiaries of discretionary specified trusts if the income came under the control of the trustee in his or her capacity as trustee, or if the income was used in a business carried on by the trustee . In these circum- stances the income was taxed to the trustee . 5.22 One result of removing these restrictions is that it is now no longer necessary for trustees to channel income through sub-settlements to ensure that the income has been placed beyond their control and possession. The fact that income is under the control of the trustee or is used in a business carried on by the trustee as trustee of the trust does not of itself mean that the paid or applied limb (or the vesting limb) is not satisfied . 5 .23 The paid or applied test under the previ- ous regime applied where the trustee exercised a power to pay or apply income. The paid or appliedtest under the new regime also applies only where the trustee exercisesa power to pay or apply income. Therefore,the testdoes not apply where incomevests in thebeneficiaryin terms of the trust deed . Meaning of paid or applied (a) Payment of incom e 5.24 Income derived by the trustee will be "paid" to a beneficiary in terms of the "beneficiary income" definition if the income is transferred to the beneficiary in money or money's worth. It is not necessary that the income should be trans- ferred directly to the beneficiary: it is sufficient that the income is placed unreservedly at the disposal of the beneficiary. (b) Applicationof income 5.25 The meaning of the term "applied" was considered by the Court of Appeal inCIR vWard \[19701 NZLR 1. This case remains good authority in interpreting the term "applied" in the context of the s.226(1) "beneficiary income" definition. 5.26 The question inWardwas whether a resolution by the trustee that a certain amount of income was to be held on trust for the beneficiar- ies constituted an application of the income to or for the benefit of the beneficiaries although the income was not severed from the trust fund. The majority of the Court held that the resolution did constitute an effective application of the income because it resulted in the income becoming the absolute property of the beneficiaries. Under the trust deed the beneficiaries had only a contingent interest in the income because they were not entitled to it until they attained the age of 21. The effect of the trustee's resolution was that the income immediately became the absolute property of the beneficiaries and would have constituted part of their estates if they had died before the age of 21. Thus, by converting a contingent interest to an absolute one the resolution constituted an ap- plication of the income. The income remained in the trustee's hands; however it was held that this factor did not mean that there could not have been an application. For that purpose, it was not neces- sary that the income be physically severed from the trust fund. 5.27 The Wardcase is autho rityfor the fo llow- ing propositions in relation to the meaning of "applied"in the paid or applied limb of the "beneficiaryincome" definition : (i) There is an application of income if by virtue of the exercise by the trustee of a power to pay or apply income the income derived by the trustee becomes the 33 absoluteproperty of the beneficiary. But income allotted toa beneficiary by the trustee will notbecome the absolute property of the beneficiary, and therefore will not be applied for the benefit of the beneficiary, if thetrustee has the power to vary or alter any shareof the income allottedto the beneficiary. (ii) Wherethe trustee exercisesa power to pay or apply income for the benefit of a benefi- ciary whohas only a contingent interest in the income it is immate ri alwhether the income is immediately usedfor the benefit of the beneficiary. The importantconsid- eration iswhether theincome becomes the absolute property of the beneficiary rather than whether it is severed from the trust fund . (iii) For there to be an application of income it is not necessary that the income be in- vested by the trustee on behalf of the bene- ficiary. The question of whether there is an application of income turns upon the effect of the exercise of the trustee's power and not upon what the trustee does with the income after the power has been exercised . (iv) Entries in the trust accounts alone do not establish that income has been applied for the benefit of a beneficiary. To establish that income has been applied it is neces- sary to produce more concrete evidence that the trustee has exercised the power to apply income. For example, a written and recorded resolution of the trustee that the power has been exercised will suffice. 5.28 For there to be an application of income it is not necessary that there be a specific sum allocated to the be neficiary : Davidson v CAR \[1976\] NZLR 705. Thus, a resolution that two thirds of the income is allocated to a particular beneficiary would constitute an application of income . Also, it is not necessary that the resolution by the trustee effecting the application use the word "applied" or "application" :Davidson. The relevant question is whether the resolution constitutes an exercise of the power to apply income. Thus, words such as "allocate", "disposed of", that income "shall belong to" a beneficiary and that income is "held for the credit of" a beneficiary may effect an application of income. 5.30 Income cannot be paid or applied to or for the benefit of a beneficiary unless it is existing property. Income cannot be paid or applied if it is future property or an expectancy. (c) To or for the benefit of the beneficiary 5.31 The payment or application must be made "to or for the benefit of the beneficiary": that is, the test is satisfied if the income is paid "to" the beneficiary or is applied "for the benefit of" the beneficiary. Although this issue is largely depend- ent upon the facts of each case, in general terms a transaction will be for the benefit of a beneficiary where it improves the material situation of the beneficiary: Re Pilkingtori sWillTrusts \[1964\] AC 612 HL; CIR vSimpson(1989) 11 NZTC 6,140, 6,144. 5.32 From theWardcase it is clear that if the exercise of a power to pay or apply income by the trustee constitutes an application of income it will generally follow that the application will be for the benefit of the beneficiary. The fact that the benefi- ciary's interest in the income changes from contin- gent to absolute means that the exercise of the trustee's power constitutes an application of in- come and, because the beneficiary's title to the income is improved, the application is for the benefit of the beneficiary. In cases where the trustee exercises a power to pay or apply income by paying income to the beneficiary's parents or guardian for expenditure on behalf of the benefi- ciary the exercise of the power will result in an application of income for the benefit of the benefi- ciary. 5.33 Where the trustee makes a payment of income to a person other than the beneficiary, and the payment discharges an obligation of the beneficiary, the payment will constitute an applica- tion of the income for the benefit of the benefici- ary : Re Clore'sSettlement Trusts \[196612 All ER 272. In that case the court rejected a submission that a payment to a person other than the beneficiary was for the benefit of the beneficiary only if there was a direct benefit to the benefiriary•. Instead, the court held that there was a benefit to the benefici- ary if the payment resulted in "the discharge. .. of certain moral, or social, obligations on the part of the beneficiary, for example towards dependants" (p 274). Thus, a payment to a dependant of a beneficiary will constitute an application of income for the benefit of the beneficiary . Six month rul e 5 .34 Income derived by a trustee during an income year will be taxed in the hands of a benefi- ciary if a payment or application is made by the trustee during or "within six months after the end of that income year". This additional 6 month period enables the trustee to calculate the trust's income for the relevant year before paying or applying any income to or for the benefit of a 34 beneficiary. This is especially relevant for trustees with farming or business income, who may be unable to calculate the amount of income avail- able for distribution to the beneficiaries until after the end of the incomeyear.Finally, where income is paid or applied to or for the benefit of a benefici- ary during the six month period after the end of the income year in which the income was derived by the trustee, that income is assessable income of the beneficiary for the income year during which the income was derived by the trustee. Trust records 5.35 Trusts often provide for income to be paid to a parent or guardian of a beneficiary, that receipt of the income by the parent or guardian is sufficient discharge for the trustee and that the trustee does not have to ensure that the parent or guardian pays the income to the beneficiary. In these circumstances, the payment of the income to the parent or guardian will be sufficient evidence for tax purposes that the income vests absolutely in interest in the beneficiary or is applied for the benefit of the beneficiary. Beneficiary income and the suRprannuation regime 5.36 The concluding language of the definition of "beneficiary income" provides that beneficiary income does not include income derived by the trustee of the trust in any income year during which the trust is a "superannuation fund" (as defined in s.2). 5.37 The new superannuation taxation regime, enacted by the Income Tax Amendment Act 1989, has been integrated with the trust taxation regime subject to several qualifications . One of the more significant qualifications is that income derived by superannuation funds is to be taxed to the trustee and not to the beneficiary . This is achieved in three ways . First, the concluding language of the defini- tion of "beneficiary income" ensures that income derived by a trustee of a superannuation fund is not beneficiary income and that therefore it con- stitutes trustee income. Second, the definition of "taxable distribution" in s.226(1) specifically does not apply in relation to superannuation funds. Thus, beneficiaries of superannuation funds cannot derive taxable distributions. Third, the proviso to the definition of "qualifying trust" in s.226(1) provides that superannuation funds are qualifying trusts on and after 1 April 1990. Conse- quently, distributions made from superannuation funds after 1 April 1990 are not included in the beneficiary's assessable income (s.227(6)), al- though distributions made before that date will be included in assessable income, for example as pensions, if they fall within s.65(2). Trustee income 5.38 The expression "trustee income" is de- fined in s.226(1) in relation to any trust and any income year as meaning the income derived in that income year by a trustee of that trust which is not beneficiary income for any beneficiary of the trust. Trustee income is assessable for income tax to the trustee, and in some instances to the settlor, in accordance with the rules in s.228. Those rules are discussed in Part 10 of this bulletin. The dis- tinction between specified trusts and non-speci- fied trusts which was contained in the previous trust taxation regime has been removed and all trustee income is taxed in the same manner. Beneficiaryincomeand trustee incomewhere income is passed between trusts The issue 5.39 In some cases income derived by the trustee of one trust may be passed through to the trustee of another trust (the second trust) before it is distributed to a beneficiary of the second trust. The beneficiary of the second trust may also be a beneficiary of the first trust. Where income is passed through several trusts in this manner, the question arises as to how the income is to be treated in relation to each trust. In particular, the question is whether there is any possibility of double taxation arising when income is passed through several trusts to the ultimate beneficiary. 5.40 Where the trusts in question are all quali- fying trusts double taxation will not arise when income is passed through tiers of trusts. If the beneficiary of the second trust is also a bene- ficiary of the first trust the distribution to the second trust may be an application of income for the benefit of the beneficiary . In these circum- stances the income will be beneficiary income in relation to the first trust and the beneficiary will be assessable for tax on the income . The trustee of the first trust will be liable to tax as agent of the beneficiary. If the distribution to the second trust is not an application of income for the benefit of a beneficiary of the first trust the treatment of the income as it passes between the trusts is deter- mined by applying the "beneficiary income" and "trustee income" definitions in relation to each trust. The effect of this analysis, illustrated in the examples discussed below, is that the income will be assessable for tax only once. 5.41 Several examples of the treatment of income flowing through tiers of trusts are dis- cussed below. It is emphasised that the analysis applies only in relation to trustee income and beneficiary income. It does not apply with respect to amounts which are classified as taxable distri- 35 butions. Where income is distributed as a taxable distribution it may have borne New Zealand tax as trustee income but it will still be liable to tax in the beneficiary's hands as a taxable distribution. Examples (a) Assumptions 5 .42 Several simplifying assumptions are adopted in the following examples. These are that each trust has a settlor that is resident in New Zealand, and that the trustees and beneficiaries of each trust are also resident in New Zealand. (b) Case1 5.43 In this case it is assumed that income is derived by the trustee of Trust A in a particular income year and that some or all of this income is distributed to the trustee of Trust B during that income year . Trust B is a member of the class of discretionary beneficiaries of Trust A. The trustee of Trust B either retains the income or distributes it to the beneficiary of Trust B during the same income year. 5.44 In these circumstances the income will be beneficiary income with respect to Trust A be- cause it constitutes income derived by the trustee of Trust A that is paid to or applied for the benefit of a beneficiary of Trust A, i.e., Trust B, during the income year in which the income was derived by the trustee of Trust A. 5.45 The income derived by the trustee of Trust B from Trust A is treated in the same manner as any other income derived by the trustee. Thus, if the income is retained by the trustee of Trust B it will be trustee income in relation to Trust B . In this situation the income will be beneficiary income with respect to Trust A and trustee income with respect to Trust B. If the income is vested abso- lutely in interest in, or is paid to or applied for the benefit of, the beneficiary of Trust B it will be beneficiary income in relation to Trust B. In this situation the income will be beneficiary income in relation to both Trust A and Trust B. 5.46 The result is that double taxation of the income is avoided as it passes through to Trust B. As the income isbeneficiaryincome in relation to Trust A the primary liability to tax lies with Trust B: the trustee of Trust A is liable to tax only as agent for Trust B(s.227(1)). If the income is re- tained by the trustee of Trust B it constitutes trustee income in relation to that trust and the trustee of Trust B is liable to tax on that income: s .228 . The trustee of Trust A will be liable for tax on the income as agent for the trustee of Trust B. If the income is vested in or paidto orapplied for a beneficiary of Trust B the beneficiary will be liable to tax on the income as beneficiary income . The trustee of Trust B will be liable to tax on the income as agent for the beneficiary . The trustee of Trust A will also have an agency liability in respect of the income. (c) Case2 5.47 In this case it is assumed that the trustee of Trust A retains the income beyond the one year plus six month period and pays New Zealand income tax on that income. The income is distrib- uted to the trustee of Trust B and the trustee of Trust B immediately distributes the income to a beneficiary of that trust. 5.48 In these circumstances the income is trustee income in relation to Trust A. The trustee of Trust A will be liable to tax in respect of the income : s.228. When the income is later distributed to the trustee of Trust B it will constitute a distri- bution from a qualifying trust of an amount which does not constitute beneficiary income . Therefore, the trustee of Trust B will not be assessable for income tax in respect of the distribution: s.227(6) . As the distribution is not income derived by the trustee of Trust B it will not be beneficiary income to the beneficiary of that trust. Thus, it will be a distribution from a qualifying trust of an amount which does not constitute beneficiary income. Consequently, the distribution will not be assess- able to the beneficiary of Trust B : s .227(6). (d) Case3 5 .49 In this case it is assumed that, during the year of derivation, income derived by the trustee of Trust A is settled on a sub-trust, Trust B, for the benefit of a beneficiary of Trust A. Under the previous trust regime this transaction would have satisfied the paid or applied limb (assuming that the restrictions on that limb did not apply) and the income would have been taxed to the beneficiary. 5.50 The income will constitute beneficiary income in relation to Trust A if the settlement constitutes a payment or application of the income to or for the benefit of the beneficiary (i.e ., if the income becomes the property of the beneficiary absolutely). Assuming that the income is be nefici- ary income in relation to Trust A, the beneficiary will be liable to tax in respect of the income and the trustee of Trust A will be liable to tax in respect of the income as agent for the beneficiary. 5 .51 With respect to Trust B the income will be neither trustee income nor beneficiary income because it constitutes a settlement of property on 36 that trust. Accordingly, the trustee of Trust B will not be liable to tax in respect of the income. (e) Case4 5.52 In this case it is assumed that the trustee of Trust A derives income during a particular in- come year and during the same income year resettles the income on Trust B under a power to resettle the income. This case differs from case 3 in that the resettlement does not confer a benefit on any particular beneficiary. Also, the case differs from case 1 in that Trust B is not named as a beneficiary of Trust A. 5S3 The result in this case is the same as in case 1. Trust B is a beneficiary of Trust A, al- though it is not named as a beneficiary. This is because Trust B benefits from the distribution from Trust A. As Trust B is a beneficiary of Trust A the income will be beneficiary income in rela- tion to Trust A and trustee income or beneficiary income in relation to Trust B, depending upon whether the trustee of Trust B accumulates the income or distributes it to a beneficiary of that trust. The analysis is not the same as in case 3 because the distribution to Trust B does not benefit a particular beneficiary of Trust A. PART 6: SETTLOR DEFINITION Significance 6.1 The term "settlor" is defined in s.226(2) and several other subsections of s.226 extend or limit that definition. The "settlor" definition is important in two respects. First, except in the case of trusts which are superannuation funds, the foreign source income of which is always liable to income tax, the taxation of trustee income from sources outside New Zealand is determined on the basis of the residence of the settlor. Two rules apply in this context. The first is that the trustee income derived from outside New Zealand in an income year is liable to income tax if at any time during that income year a settlor of the trust is resident in New Zealand : s .228(3)(a) . The second rule is that the trustee income derived from out- side New Zealand in an income year is liable to income tax if a trustee of the trust is resident in New Zealand at any time during that income year and a settlor of the trust died resident in New Zealand in any income year. 6.2 The second respect in which the settlor definition is important is that, as a general rule, if a settlement has been made to or for the benefit or on the terms of the trust after 17 December 1987 any settlor who is resident in New Zealand at any time during an income year is liable to income tax on the trustee income derived in that income year as agent of the trustee: s.228(4). There are several exceptions to this rule. The most significant are that the settlor is not liable to tax on trustee income derived in an income year if at all times during that income year a trustee of the trust is resident in New Zealand or if the settlor was not resident in New Zealand at the time of any settle- ment by that settlor or at the time of any settle- ment since 17 December by any settler . Overview 6 .3 The expression "settlor" is defined in broad terms to ensure that any person who transfers value to a trust is treated as a settlor. Although aspects of the definition are based on the definition of "gift" in the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 there are significant differences between that definition and the definition of "settler" . The differences reflect an intention not to incorporate the technical deficiencies of the "gift" definition into the "settlof" definition. In particular, the definition of the expression "disposition of prop- erty" has been modified in important respects, the definition focuses on whether the transaction took place at "market value" rather than on whether adequate consideration was provided, and the treatment of on-demand loans where the power to demand interest is not exercised has been specifi- cally prescribed. 6 .4 Themain definition of "settlor"is con- tained in s .226(2) . In general terms, a settlor is defined as meaning a person who - (i) makes or who has made a disposition of property tothe trust for less than market value ; (ii) makes, or has made, propertyavailable to the trust, including the provision of financial assistance, for less than market value; (iii) provides or has provided services to the trust for less than market value; (iv) acquires or obtains, or has acquired or obtained, the use of trust property or any service provided by thetrusteefor greater than market value; (v) acts or abstains from acting or enters into a transaction or series of transactions with or in respect of the trust with the effect of defeating the intent and application of the "settlor" definition. 6.5 Section 226(3) provides that persons who make settlements while acting as nominees, or who settle nominal amounts on trust while acting 37 on the instructions of another person, are not settlors. Rather, the person on behalf of whom the nominee or nominal settlor acts is the settlor. By s .226(4), if a controlled foreign company (as de- fined in s .245C), or a resident company which would be a controlled foreign company if it were a foreign company, makes a settlement any person who has a control interest of 10 percent or more in the company at the time of settlement, or who would have such an interest if the company were a foreign company, is a settlor of the trust. 6.6 Bys .226(5), if the trustee of a trust settles a trust or makes a distribution to or on the terms of another trust any person who is a settlor of the trust making the settlement or distribution is a settlor of the trust to or on the terms of which the settlement is made. Section 226(6) defines a "settlement" as any action or failure to act on the part of a person which has the effect of making the person a settlor . Section 226(7) includes as a settlor any person who has acquired rights or powers in relation to a trustee or settlor of a trust where the purpose or effect of that acquisition was to enable the person to require the trustee to treat the person, or any other person, as a beneficiary of the trust. By s .226(12), an employer is not a settlor if that employer makes a settlement for the benefit of employees on the terms of a trust established principally for the purpose of providing retire- ment benefits. Se tt lements by way of adispositionof property Requirements 6.7 Section 226(2)(a) provides that a person is a settlor of a trust if that person makes, or has made at any time, a disposition of property to or for the benefit of the trust or on the terms of the trust for less than market value. 6.8 The provision applies if the person has made a settlement at any time. That is, the person will be a settlor if the disposition of property was made either before or after the application date of the new trust regime . The person may be a settlor if the disposition of property is made, or was made, to or for the benefit of the trust or on the terms of the trust . The disposition of property will render the person making, or who made, the disposition a settlor if it is at below market value . The concept of market value is discussed below at paras 6.76 to 6.91. Definition of disposition of property (a) Introductory languag e 6.9 In terms of the introductory language of the definition of "disposition of property" that expression means "any conveyance, transfer, assignment, settlement, delivery, payment or other alienation of property, whether at law or in equity". 6 .10 This language b rings within the definition only transactions that involve analienation of property;that is, atransfer of ownership of the property : CSD v Card \[19401 NZLR637. Transac- tions involving the use, rather than the change in ownership,of propertyare dealt with in para- graph(c) of the definition and ins.226(2Xb).The introductorylanguage is wide enough to encom- pass loans: Rossiter vCIR \[1977\] NZLR 195. Loans are also dealt with in s .226(2)(b). Thus the provi- sion of a loan at an interest rate which is below the market rate may result in the lender being a settlor eitherby virtue of the introductorylanguage of the "dispositionof property"definition and s.226(2)(a) orby virtueof s.226(2)(b). 6.11 "Delivery" in the context of the introduc- tory language means a change in both the owner- ship and the possession of property . Thus, if in terms of a contract title to the property passes on delivery there willbea disposition of property at the time of delivery . Also, the making available of property without the transfer of ownership does not constitute a disposition of property in terms of the introductory language . 6.12 The Estate and Gift Duties Act definition of "disposition of property" includes an addi- tional paragraph that is not contained in the s .226 definition. That paragraph provides that any transaction entered into by any person with intent thereby to diminish, whether directly or indi- rectly, the value of that person's own estate and to increase the value of the estate of any other person is treated as a disposition of property : s.2(1) Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968, "disposition of prop- erty" definition Para (f). That paragraph has been omitted from the s.226 definition in response to suggestions that the effect of Para (f) of the Estate and Gift Duties Act definition is that transactions involving an indirect conveyance, transfer, assign- ment, settlement, delivery, payment or alienation cannot be caught by the introductory language of the definition : Adams and Richarson Law ofEstate and Gift Duty(5 ed Butterworths 1978) Para 2/29 . Consequently there is nothing in the "disposition of property' definition which prevents the intro- ductory language of that definition from applying to indirect transactions . Finally, the transactions contemplated in Para (f) of the Estate and Gift Duties Act definition of "disposition of property" are encompassed within the concluding language of the s.226(2) "settlor" definition. 6.13 Five paragraphs dealing with specific circumstances succeed the general introductory 38 language. These paragraphs are expressed to apply "without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of this definition". This wording must be given effect to by ensuring that the introductory language is not read down by the succeeding specific paragraphs. The objective of paragraphs (a) to (e) of the "disposition of prop- erty" definition is to catch situations where there is in substance a settlement but where there is no alienation of property:FCT vStHelens Farm (ACT) Pty Ltd (1981) 11 ATR 544, 557. (b) Paragraph (a): allotment of shares 6.14 By para (a) of the definition of "disposition of property", an allotment of shares in a company constitutes a disposition of property. This ensures that transactions involving the reorganisation of a company and the issue of shares to trustees at below market value do not fall outside the "set- tlor" definition. This may occur because little or no consideration is provided by the trustees. Another possibility is that the trustees may pay an amount reflecting the market value of the other shares issued by the company but this may not reflect the market value of the shares issued to the trustees because special rights attach to those shares or because limitations are imposed on shares issued to other shareholders. 6.15 The facts of FCT vSt Helens Farm(ACT) Pty Ltd(1981) 11 ATR 544 illustrate the applica- tion of para (a). In that case the owner of property sold it to a private company and was allotted a number of ordinary shares in the company. Those shares were then converted to preference shares carrying the right to a fixed dividend and to a return of capital and payment of any arrears of dividend on winding up. The company then allotted ordinary shares to several relatives of the original owner of the property or to certain companies to be held in trust for such relatives. Those ordinary shares carried unrestricted rights to share in the assets of the company so that if the company were wound up the ordinary sharehold- ers would be entitled to the whole of the property transferred to the company less only the face amount of the original owner's preference shares and the costs of realisation. The amount paid by the ordinary shareholders for the shares, Aus$500, was considerably less than the value of the com- pany's assets, Aus$1,206,314 . 6 .16 On these facts it was held that the allot- ment of shares to the ordinary shareholders was an allotment of shares in terms of para (a) of the "disposition of property" definition contained in the Australian Gift Duty Assessment Act 1941 (that definition was, in relevant part, in the same terms as the s.226(1) "disposition of property" definition). The argument that para (a) applies only when the allotment of sharesconstitutes an alienation of property, as for example where shares in a company are allotted to a non-share- holder on the direction of a shareholder who would otherwise have been entitled to the shares, was rejected . Paragraph (a) thus applies whether or not the allotment involves an alienation of property . 6 .17 In the St HelensFarmcase the disposition of property was made by the company which allotted the shares. In the context of the s .226(2) definition of "settlor' the company would be a settlor of a trust if the allotment was made to the trust at below the market value of the shares. A shareholder in the company may also be a settlor of the trust in these circumstances by virtue of the concluding language of the s.226(2) definition of "settlor". This language is discussed below at paras 6.48 to 6.59. (c) Paragraph (b): creation of a trust 6.18 By para (b) of the "disposition of prop- erty" definition, the creation of a trust is treated as a disposition of property . A trust is created when propertyis impressed with the termsof atrust: that is, when the trustees accept property which is to be held in trust. Thus, where a person transfers property to trustees to be held in trust, thereby creating a trust, the transferor will be settlor of the trust if the transfer is effected at below market value. (d) Paragraph (c): granting of rights or interests in or over property 6.19 By paragraph (c) of the "disposition of property" definition, the grant or creation of any lease, mortgage, charge, servitude, licence, power, or other right, estate or interest in or over any property is treated as a disposition of property. This brings within the definition several transac- tions that do not involve a transfer in the owner- ship of property . 6.20 To some extent there may be an overlap between s.226(2)(a) and s.226(2)(b) arising from the inclusion within para (c) of the "disposition of property" definition of transactions involving the use of property. For example, if a person leased property to trustees that would be a para (c) disposition of property, and if the lease was for a below market rental, the person would be a settlor under s.226(2)(a) by virtue of making a disposi- tion of property at below market value and also under s.226(2)(b) by virtue of making property available at below market value. 6.21 However, although thereis anoverlap para (c) of the "disposition of property" definition 39 includes within its terms a wider range of transac- tions than is contemplated by s.226(2)(b). Among these are transactions involving the granting or creation of mortgages or charges. Thus, the granting to trustees of a mortgage or charge over an asset will constitute a disposition of property. If the person granting the mortgage or charge does not receive an amount representing the market value of the interest created by the mortgage or charge the person will be a settlor in terms of s.226(2)(a). If this type of transaction were not caught the creation of mortgages or charges would create opportunities for transferring value to trusts. For example, if a person who owns shares with a value of $1,000 grants a charge over the shares to a trustee, and the trustee acquires the shares or is entitled to dispose of the shares on crystalisation of the charge, the person effectively transfers value to the trust if a market value con- sideration is not provided by the trustee in respect of the creation of the charge. 6.22 Paragraph (c) applies where a power is granted or created over any property. Thus, if a person confers on trustees a power of appoint- ment over property owned by that person the granting or creation of the power will constitute a disposition of property. For example, there is a disposition of property where a person who owns a parcel of shares grants trustees of a trust a power to appoint the shares to any members of a class of persons . The conferral of the power will give rise to a fiduciary obligation on the part of the trustees. Consequently, there may be a para (b) disposition of property (i.e., the creation of a trust) as well as a para (c) disposition. In cases where the power is not granted to trustees there may still be a disposition of property to or for the benefit of a trust where the granting of the power is effectively an indirect disposition of property to the trust . Finally, para (c) of the definition differs from para (e) in that the former deals with the creation of a power while the latter deals with the exercise of a power. Paragraph (e) of the definition is discussed below at paras 6.28 to 6.29. (e) Paragraph (d): Releases, discharges, sur- renders, forfeiture or abandonment 6.23 By para (d) of the "disposition of prop- erty" definition, a disposition of property occurs where there is a release, discharge, surrender, forfeiture, or abandonment of any debt, contract, or thing in action, or of any right, power, estate, or interest in or over any property. Two require- ments must therefore be satisfied: first there must be a debt, contract, thing in action, right, power, estate or interest in existence ; and second, there must be a release, discharge, surrender, forfeiture or abandonment of that interest . In language extending para (d) it is further provided that a debt or any other right, estate or interest is deemed to have been released when it has become irrecoverable or unenforceable by action or for any reason ceases to exist. 6.24 The expression "thing in action" is used to describe "all personal rights of property which can only be claimed or enforced by action, and not by taking physical possession": 6 Halsbury'sLaws ofEngland 4 ed para 1. Debts and rights under a contract, both specifically mentioned in para (d), and any other claim against a trust are things in action. Thus, there would be a disposition of property, for example, if a person surrendered a claim against a trust by agreeing not to pursue the claim. 6.25 The extension to para (d) differs from the corresponding provision in para (d) of the Estate and Gift Duties Act "disposition of property" definition. That latter provision is to the effect that the interests in question are deemed to have been released or surrendered when they become "irrecoverable or unenforceable by action through the lapse of time" . In Re Marshall (Deceased),CIR v Public Trustee\[1965\] NZLR 851 it was held that the quoted words were not apt to describe a case where a right ceases to exist. Instead, they only deal with the situation where the right continues to exist but ceases to be recoverable or enforce- able . Paragraph (d) of the s.226(1) definition of "disposition of property' overcomes this defect by specifically providing that the rights in question are deemed to have been released or surrendered when they cease to exist. It also encompasses the situation dealt with in pars (d) of the Estate and Gift Duties Act definition (i .e., debts and other interests which become statute barred) by deem- ing debts and other interests which "become irre- coverable or unenforceable by action" to have been released or surrendered. Finally, because para (d) of the s.226(1) definition of "disposition of prop- erty" is not limited in its application to debts or other interests which become irrecoverable or unenforceable "through the lapse of time", it encompasses circumstances where a debt or other interest becomes irrecoverable or unenforceable through the lapse of time or for any other reason. 6.26 In Re Marshall the question was whether the failure by a person to claim interest under a mortgage from a trust in that person's favour, and fees due for the performance of services asa tustee of that trust, amounted to a disposition of property in terms of para (d) of the definition of that expression contained in s.2 of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968. Subject to the modification mentioned in the preceding paragraph, this provi- sion is in the same terms as para (d) of the s .226(1) definition of "disposition of property".Amajority of judges in the Court of Appeal held that th e 40 right to make a demand for interest and remu- neration was a thing in action. The failure to make a demand did not result in a "release, discharge, surrender...or abandonment" of the thing in action . Therefore, the issue was whether there had been a "forfeiture" of the right to demand interest and remuneration or a deemed release or surrender of that right in terms of the extension to para (d). As mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the Court held that there was no deemed release or surren- der because the right to claim interest and remu- neration still existed . The Court further held that "forfeiture" implies the loss of something as a penalty resulting from the breach of an obligation, contract or condition, and that as there had been no such breach there was no forfeiture . 6 .27 The result inRe Marshallwas that the failure to demand interest and remuneration did not amount to a disposition of property and, therefore, did not constitute a gift . If this holding were not negated in the context of the new trust taxation regime an easy avenue would be avail- able for avoiding settlor status while still transfer- ring value to a trust. Consequently, the provision of on demand loans to trustees where the right to demand interest is not exercised has been specifi- cally dealt with in s .226(2)(b) . By that provision, financial assistance is deemed to have been pro- vided at below market value, thus rendering the person providing such assistance a settlor, if amounts payable in relation to the financial assis- tance are payable on demand and the right to demand payment is not exercised. This rule applies whether or not the specified rate of inter- est payable on demand would otherwise be con- sidered to be a market rate of interest . (f) Paragraph (e): Exercise of general power of appointment Objective 6.28 By para (e) of the "disposition of property" definition, the exercise of a general power of ap- pointment in favour of any person other than the holder of the power constitutes a disposition of property. The objective of this provision is to bring within the definition the exercise of powers over property in circumstances where the person exercising the power does not actually own the property but is still able to obtain it or dispose of it for that person's own benefit. The exercise of such a power in favour of a person other than the holder of the power is equivalent to the holder of the power exercising it in that person's own favour to acquire the property and then disposing of the property to the trust. Consequently, it is necessary to include the exercise of general pow- ers of appointment within the disposition of property definition. 6.29 By wayof example, if a person has a power to disposeof propertyas he or she thinks fit, including the power to dispose of theproperty for the person's ownbenefit, and this power is exercised in favour of tr ustees of a trust, this would constitute the exercise of a general power of appointment. In terms of para(e) of the "dispo- sition ofproperty"definition, the exercise would be in favour of a person other thanthe holder of the power and there would be a disposition of property. Thedispositionof property would constitute a settlement if made at below market value. General power of appointment 6.30 By s.226(1), a "general power of appoint- ment" is defined as including any power or authority conferred by will, settlement inter vivos, or in any other manner which enables the holder of the power or authority, or which would enable the holder if the holder was of full capacity, to obtain, appoint or dispose of any property or to charge any sum of money upon any property for the holder's own benefit. 6.31 The definitionof "generalpower of ap- pointment"serves to extend the common law concept of a "general power of appointment". Thus, for the purpose of para (e) of the "disposi- tion of property"definitionboth the s.226(1) and the commonlaw definitions of a generalpower of appointmentare relevant. 632At common law powers of appointment are categorised into general and special powers. A general power of appointment is "a power that the donee may exercise in favour of such person or persons as he pleases, including himself or his executors or administrators." (36 Halsbury's Laws ofEngland 4ed para 806) . A special power of appointment is one which "may be exercised only in favour of certain specified persons or classes..." (Halsburypara 806). Therefore, at common law a power to appoint to a defined class including the holder of the power would be a special power of appointment rather than a general power of appointment. However, by virtue of the s.226(1) definition of "general power of appointment" such a power would be treated as a general power of appointment. Thus, for example, the power considered in Inre Penrose, Penrose v Penrose\[1933\] All ER 796, where a husband was given the power to appoint to a defined class which included himself, would be a general power of appointment in terms of the s.226(1) definition. 6 .33 The "general power of appointment definition" encompasses any power or authority conferred by will or by inter vivos settlement or created in any other manner . The power or author- 41 ity must enable the holder to obtain, appoint or dispose of property, or to charge any sum or money on any property, as the holder thinks fit for the holder's own benefit . If the person does not have such a power or authority because he or she is not of full legal capacity, the person is treated as having a power or authority to obtain, appoint, or dispose of property, or to charge any sum or money on property, if in the absence of the inca- pacity he or she would have had such a power or authority. Thus, for the purpose of the s.226(1) definition powers purportedly exercisable by incapacitated persons are treated as powers of appointment. 6.34 The manner of exercise of the power of appointment is irrelevant. Powers exercisable orally, by instrument inter vivos, by will or in any other manner are within the ambit of the defini- tion. Any power or authority which is exercisable by a person in a fiduciary capacity under a dispo- sition not made by that person or exercisable as a mortgagee are specifically excluded from the definition. The first exception excludes most situations where a trustee has the power to ap- point property in favour of beneficiaries. The second exception excludes powers exercisableby a mortgagee in relation to property over which the mortgagee holds a mortgage . Exercise of the general power of appointment 6.35 Paragraph (e) of the "disposition of prop- erty" definition requires the exercise of the general power of appointment in favour of a person other than the holder of the power . Thus, there is only a disposition of property, first, if there is an exercise of the general power of appointment and, second, if the exercise is not in favour of the holder of the power . (g)Concludinglanguage ofthe definition 6.36 The concluding language of the "disposi- tion of property" definition provides that disposi- tions by will or intestacy which would otherwise fall within the definition aretreated as dispositions of property.It is further provided that a dis- claimer of an interest under a disposition made inter vivos or of an interest under a will or of an interest under an intestacy is excluded from the defini ti on. 6 .37 A disclaimer of a beneficial interest under a trust would constitute a surrender or abandon- ment of a thing in action in terms of para (d) of the "disposition of property" definition. However, by virtue of the concluding language to the definition such a disclaimer is specifically precluded from being a disposition of property. Settlements where property is made available to trustees Requirements 6.38 By s.226(2)(b), any person who makes, continues to make, or has at any time made, property available to or for the benefit of a trust for less than market value is a settlor for the purpose of the trust regime. The provision of financial assistance to a trust is treated as the making available of property to the trust. If finan- cial assistance is provided at below market rates the financial assistance is deemed to have been provided to the trust at below market value. 6.39 The objective of s .226(2)(b) is to treat as settlors persons who retain ownership of property while making it available to a trust at a below market rate of return and to specifically deal with the situation where financial assistance is pro- vided to a trust . Transactions of this nature clearly result in a transfer of value to the trust to the extent that the value provided by the trustees for the use of the property or the provision of financial assistance is less than the market value of the use of the property or the financial assistance. It is therefore appropriate to treat as a settlor any person who makes property available to a trust, or who provides financial assistance to a trust, at below market value. Timing of transaction 6.40 A person is a settlor in relation to a trust if that person "makes, continues to make, or has at any time made" propertyavailable to atrust at below market value. Thus, a person willbea settlor of a trust, if the other requirements of the provision are met, where the person has made property availableto a trust at anytime, whether before or after th e applicationof the new trust regime. Financial assistance 6 .41 The provision of financial assistance to a trust is specifically treated as the making available of property to the trust . "Financial assistance" is expressed to encompass financial assistance provided"byway of a loan, guarantee, the provi- sion of security, or otherwise". Thus, persons who guarantee loans made to a trust, or who provide security for such loans, will be treated as making property available to the trust. For example, if a person guarantees a loan made by a bank to a trust at a market rate of interest, and the consid- eration provided by the trust for the guarantee is below the market value of the guarantee, the person will be a settlor of the trust. 42 6.42 Section 226(2)(b) also provides that where financial assistance is provided to or for the benefit of a trust at below market rates the finan- cial assistance is deemed to have been provided for less than market value . The person providing such financial assistance is thus deemed to be a settlor . Persons who lend to trusts at below market rates of interest, or who provide guaran- tees or security for loans made to trusts at below market rates, will be settlors in relation to such trusts. 6.43 Section 226(2)(b) also deals specifically with the situation where financial assistance is providedto or forthe benefit of a trust and amounts payable in relation to the financial assis- tance are payable on demand and the right to demand payment is not exercised or is deferred. In these circumstances also the financial assistance is deemed to have been provided to or for the benefit of the trust at below market value . This overcomes the holding in Re Marshall (Deceased), CIR v PublicTrustee \[19651 NZLR 851 that an on demand loan where the right to demand payment is not exercised does not give rise to a disposition of property and ensures that such loans cannot be used to circumvent the "settlor" definition . Provisionof servicesas a settlement 6 .44 By s.226(2)(c), any person who provides, continues to provide or has at any time provided any service to or for the benefit of a trust for less than market value is a settlor of the trust . A person can be a settlor by virtue of this provision if the person provided services to or for the benefit of the trust at any time, whether or not those serv- ices are still being provided in the income year in question. 6.45 Section 226(2)(c) applies to any services provided to or for the benefit of a trust. For example, it would encompass investment advi- sory services, legal and accounting services, and services relating to any business carried on by the trustees of the trust . Trust property used or acquired, or services provided by the trustees, at above market valu e 6.46 By s.226(2)(d), a person who acquires or obtains the use of property of a trust, or who obtains any service from the trustees of the trust, for greater than market value is a settlor in relation to the trust. In these circumstances by acquiring or obtaining the use of property of a trust, or in receiving services from the trustees of a trust, for value which exceeds the market value of the property or services the person is transferring value to the trust. For example, if a person pur- chases an asset from a trust for $10,000 where the market value of the asset is only $1,000 the person has transferred value of $9,000 to the trust. Simi- larly, if services provided by the trustees have a market value of $1,000 but the person pays $10,000 the person has again transferred $9,000 of value to the trust. 6 .47 Given the ease withwhich it would be possible totransfer value to a trustby paying an inflated amount for propertyor servicesprovided by the tr ust, it isnecessary totr eat any person paying suchan inflated amount as a settlor. Section 226(2) concluding l an guage Descriptio n 6 .48 In terms of the concluding language of the s .226(2) definition of "settlor", a person is a settlor in two situations: first, if the person acts or ab- stains from acting and the effect of the action or abstention is that the intent and application of the settlor definition is defeated; second, if the person directly or indirectly enters into a transaction or series of transactions with or in relation to a trust with the effect of defeating the intent and applica- tion of the "settlor" definition. Objective 6 .49 The objective of the concluding language of the s.226(2) definition of "settlor" is threefold. First, it is intended to ensure that transactions of the type described in para (f) of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 definition of "disposition of property" fall within the "settlor" definition. Second, it is intended to ensure that actions and transactions falling outside Para (f) because of a defect in that provision fall within the settlor definition . Third, it is intended to provide an anti- avoidance rule which buttresses the specific provisions of the "settlor" definition . 6.50 Paragraph (f) of the Estate and Gift Duties Act definition of "disposition of property" treats as a disposition of property transactions entered into by a person with the intention of diminishing the value of that person's estate and increasing the value of the estate of any other person. It also provides that the passing by a company of a resolution which, by the extinguishment or altera- tion of rights attaching to shares or debentures of the company, results in the estate of a shareholder or debenture holder being increased in value at the expense of the estate of any other shareholder ordebenture holder is deemed to be a transaction entered into by that other shareholder or deben- ture holder if that person could have prevented the passing of the resolution. 43 6.51 The re are two main defects in para (f) of the Estate and Gift Duties Act definition of "dis- position ofproperty".The first is that it is limited to "transactions". InGrimwadev FCT (1949) 78 CLR 199 HCit was held that a transaction was somethingbetween persons rather than an action by one person. This distinction maybeimportant, for example, in cases involving the transfer of value be tween classes of shares. The facts in Robertsonv CIR(1959\] NZLR 492 provide a good example. There, resolutions were passed at a general meeting of a company increasing its nominal capital by the creation of new shares which ranked equally with the existing shares . A parcel of the new shares was issued to trustees of a trust which had been established by a shareholder in the company. The shares issued to the trustees represented the shares which would otherwise have been issued to the shareholder.The effect of the new issue was to dilute the value of the existing shares in the company. Consequently, because the shares which would otherwise have been issued to the shareholder were issued to the trustees the value of the sha re holder's shares was diminished, and this diminution was matched by an increase in the value of the trust's assets. 6 .52 Although it was held that this arrange- ment constituted a transaction falling within para (f), it can be argued that this decision was not correct: see Adams and Richardson Law of Estate andGift Duties(5 ed, Butterworths 1978) para 2/ 68 . There were two steps in the arrangement in question. The first involved arrangements con- cerning the passing of resolutions between the shareholder and other members of the company. The second involved the passing of the resolu- tions by the company in general meeting which resulted in the creation of new shares and the allocation to the trustees. Although the first step involved a transaction it did not involve a reduc- tion in the value of the shareholder's estate and an increase in the value of the trust's estate. Con- versely, although the second step did result in a transfer of value it did not involve a transaction but rather a unilateral act of the company. When the facts are analysed in this manner there was no transaction falling within the terms of para (f). 6.53 The second defect in para (f) is that the ex- tension to that paragraph dealing with company resolutions applies only where the change in value of the shares or debentures is attributable to an "extinguishment or alteration of the rights at- taching" to the shares or debentures. Therefore, it does not deal with the situation illustrated in Robertson where the company issues new shares or debentures as opposed to altering the rights attaching to existing shares or debentures. The issuing of the new shares may affect the value of the existing shares but it does not extinguish or alter the rights attaching to those shares . 6.54 The concluding language of s.226(2) deals with both defects in para (f) of the Estate and Gift Duties Act definition of "disposition of property". By that language, actions or the failure to act are taken into account in addition to transactions. Further, in cases involving shares in companies the concluding language will apply whether there is an alteration or extinguishment of rights attach- ing to shares or debentures or a transfer in value between parcels of shares held by different per- sons. Effect of the concludinglanguaf 6.55 A person is a settlor by virtue of the concluding language of s.226(2) if that person acts or abstains from acting and the effect is to defeat the intent and application of the settlor definition. Transfers of value to a trust by using a corporate intermediary may be caught by this language, for example, in the following circumstances : (i) an arrangement of the type evidenced in Robertsonwhereby value was transferred to a trust by way of a company resolution to issue additional shares. Such an arrangement may result in a transfer of value because the shareholder in question votes in favour of the resolution or be- cause the shareholder abstains from voting against the resolution; (ii) informal influenceor persuasion exercised by a minoritysha re holder the effect of which is that majorityshareholders vote in favour of a resolution which results in a transfer of value to a trust at the expense of sharesheld by theminorityshare- holder; (iii)arrangementswhere the value of shares issued to a person and to a trust is altered to increase the value of the shares held by the trust at the expense of the sha re s held by theperson ; (iv) arrangements of the type described in FCT v St HelensFarm (ACT)Pty Ltd(1981) 11 ATR 544 andGortonv FCT (1965) 113 CLR 604 where aperson transfersproperty to a companyin returnfor shares in the com- pany, additionalshares areissued to a trust and the effect of issuing the addi- tional shares is to reduce the value of the shares held by the person whotransferred the propertyto the trust and to transfe r 44 value tothe trust . In this situation the person transferri ngthe property to the company will be a settlor if the transfer is at less than marketvalue . The company may also be a settlor by virtue of para (a) of the "disposition of property" definition and s.226(2)(a); (v) therenouncement by a person of an enti- tlement to receive additional shares in a company in consequence of which addi- tional shares are issued to trustees of a trust: see, for example,Birksv CofT 10 ATD 266 (1953); (vi) the redemption by a company of shares held by one person where this results in an increase in the value of shares held by a trust. 6.56 These arrangements involve transfers of value to shares held by a trust . The concluding language may also apply where a company settles property on a trust if the settlement resulted from an action of a person holding an interest in the company or from the failure of such a person to act in relation to the company . For example, if a company settled income on a trust rather than distributing it to its shareholders, and the share- holders abstained from voting against the settle- ment, the shareholders may be settlors of the trust by virtue of the concluding language of s .226(2). 6.57 The concluding language of s .226(2) also includes as a settlor a person who enters into a transaction or a series of transactions with or in relation to the trust with the effect of defeating the intent and application of the "settlor" definition. The meaning of "transaction" is discussed below . 6.58 For the concluding language to apply the action, abstention or the transaction must have the effect of defeating the intent and application of the "settlor" definition. The intent of the "settlor" definition is to treat as a settlor any person who transfers value to a trust . This is clear from the list of transactions contained in paras (a) to (d) of the s.226(2) "settlor" definition . Each of those transac- tions involves a transfer of value to the trust, either because property is transferred to, or is used by, a trust, or services are provided to a trust, at less than market value, or because property is trans- ferred by or is made available by the trust, or services are provided by the trustees, at above market value . The concluding language thus brings within the definition persons who act or who fail to act, or who enter into transactions, in circumstances where they fall outside the terms of the specific transactions listed in the definition but where value is transferred by the person, directly or indirectly, to the trust. 6.59 The intention of the person who acts, abstains from acting or enters into the transactions is not relevant in applying the concluding lan- guage to the definition. The focus of the language is on the effect of the action or transaction or of the failure by the person to act. Section 226(2) proviso: value provided by beneficiaries 6.60 By the proviso to s.226(2), the fact that a person is or will become a beneficiary of a trust does not constitute the giving or receiving of any value. This ensures that beneficiaries of trusts who transfer property to a trust or provide services to trustees cannot argue that the fact that they remain or become beneficiaries constitutes value provided by the trustees in return for the property or services. Transaction or series of transactions 6.61 By s.226(2), a person is a settlor if "whether by one transaction or by a series of transactions" the person does any of the things specified in paras (a) to (d) of s .226(2). Further, the concluding language of s.226(2) treats as a settlor any person who "enters into a transaction or a series of transactions" with or in relation to the trust with the effect of defeating the intent and application of the settlor definition . 6.62 The word "transaction" was narrowly con- strued in Grimwadev FCT (1949) 78 CLR 199 to mean something done with another person as opposed to a unilateral act. A broader construction was given in Robertson v CIR \[1959\] NZLR 492 . There, it was held that a series of connecte d events or steps with a common objective consti- tuted a transaction although taken individually any one of the steps may not have been a transac- tion. Moreover, in Gorton v FCT (1965) 113 CLR 604 voting by a person at shareholders' meetings was sufficient to constitute a transaction. Consis- tently with these broader interpretations, "trans- action" can be taken to mean acts which affect persons other than the actor even if they are not with other persons: Adams and Richardson Law of Estate and Gift Duties (5 ed, Butterworths 1978) para 2/61. But even if this broader construction is not correct, and an activity must involve at least two persons to constitute a transaction, the con- cluding language of s.226(2) applies to acts as well as to transactions . Thus, an act falling within the terms of the concluding language will be suffi- cient to render a person a settlor . 6.63 The transactionor series oftr ansactions need not directly involvethe trustees of the trust inrelation to whichthetransaction is undertaken . There arethree featuresof the legislation which 45 support this view . First, if the term "transaction" can be taken to include acts which affect persons other than the actor then a unilateral act by a person in relation to a trust that does not directly involve the trustees is nevertheless a transaction for the purposes of the section . Second, the intro- ductory and the concluding language of s .226(2) provides that a"transactfon" may be undertaken indirectly . Third, the concluding language of s .226(2) provides that the transaction specified there may be entered into "with or in relation to" the the trust. 6 .64 From Robertson it is apparent that a series of related steps may be treated as a transaction . Section 226(2) also applies where there is a "series of transactions" . There will be a series of transac- tions if there are a number of transactions which together effect a disposition of property or any of the other things specified in s.226(2). Indirect transaction s Objective 6 .65 In terms of the introductory language of s.226(2) a person is a settlor if that person "di- rectly or indirectly" undertakes any of the transac- tions specified in paras (a) to (d). Further, a person is a settlor by virtue of the concluding language of s .226(2) if that person "directly or indirectly' enters into a transaction with the effect of defeat- ing the intent and application of the "settlor" definition . The inclusion of indirect transactions reduces opportunities for avoiding settlor status by indirectly transferring value to a trust . Indirect dispositions of property 6 .66 A person makes an indirect disposition of property, for example, where the disposition is made through an intermediary . This may occur in a number of ways. In a simple case A may transfer property to B, and pursuant to an agreement or understanding with A, B may then transfer the property to a trust. The interposition of B means that the disposition of property is not a direct one . However, A effectively transfers property to the trust indirectly through the intermediary, B . An indirect disposition may also occur where A pays B to acquire property on the basis that B transfers the property to a trust. 6 .67 In some cases where there is a disposition of property through an intermediary the interme- diary may be a nominee. If so, s .226(3) will apply to treat as a settlor the person on whose behalf the nominee acts. If the intermediary is not a nominee the person using the intermediary may be a settlor on the grounds that the person has made an indirect disposition of property to the trust . 6 .68 An indirect disposition of property may also be made through an associated person. For example, if a resident gifts property to a non- resident associate and the non-resident associate disposes of the property to a trust the resident may have made an indirect disposition of prop- erty. 6 .69 An indirect disposition of property may also occur where property is transferred to an entity owned or controlled by a trust . In these circumstances the disposition of property to the entity may have been made indirectly for the benefit of the trust. For example, if a person transfers property to a company and the issued shares of the company are owned by a trust, the person will have made an indirect disposition of property for the benefit of the trust . If the disposi- tion of property was at below market value the transferor will be a settlor in relation to the trust . Value is effectively transferred to the trust in these circumstances because the value of the trust's shareholding will increase to reflect the below market value transfer of the asset to the company . The result would be the same where a company allotted shares to another company at less than market value if the shares in that other company were owned by a trust. 6.70 Other categories of transaction described in the "disposition of property" definition may also constitute indirect dispositions of property for the benefit of a trust when entered into with an entity owned or controlled by a trust . For ex- ample, if a person forgives a debt owed by a company which is owned or controlled by a trust the forgiveness may constitute a disposition of property to or for the benefit of the trust . If the transaction is at less than market value the person will be a settlor of the trust. Similarly, if a person exercises a general power of appointment in favour of a company which is owned or con- trolled by a trust, and the company does not pay a market value amount to the person in return for the property appointed to the company, there will be a disposition of property for the benefit of the trust. Indirectly making property available to a trust 6 .71 Property will be made available indirectly to or for the benefit of a trust when it is made available through an intermediary. For example, if A lends money to B at below market rates and B lends the amount borrowed from A to a trust at below market rates A will have made the financial assistance available to the trust indirectly . Simi- larly, if B borrows money at market rates for on- lending to a trust at below market rates, and A pays B the difference between market rates and the rate paid by the trust together with a fee, A 46 will have provided financial assistance to the trust indirectly. B may be a nominee in these circum- stances, in which case s.226(3) will render A a settlor. If it cannot be established that B is a nomi- nee, A will be a settler by reason of making the fi- nancial assistance available to the trust indirectly . 6.72 Property will also be made available indirectly to or for the benefit of a trust if it is made available to an entity which the trust owns or controls. For example, if a person lends money to a company controlled by a trust, and the com- pany lends the money to the trust, the person will have made the financial assistance available to or for the benefit of the trust indirectly. If the finan- cial assistance is provided at below market rates the person will be a settlor of the trust. Indirect provision of services to a trust 6.73 A person provides services to a trust indirectly if that person pays another person to provide services to the trust. If the trust does not provide a market value consideration for the services the person will be a settler of the trust in terms of s.226(2)(c) . A person may also provide services indirectly to or for the benefit of a trust by providing the services to an entity owned or controlled by the trust . Indirect acquisition, or use of, proep\_\_rty of the trust or indirect provision of services by the trustees 6.74 A person may indirectly acquire property of the trust where it is provided to the person by the trust through an intermediary. For example, if the trustees of a trust sell property to A and A sells the property to B then B will have indirectly acquired the property from the trust. If the consid- eration provided by B is greater than the market value of the property this may result in B being a settlor of the trust in terms of s.226(2)(d). How- ever, this will not necessarily be the result. If the effect of the transaction is not to transfer value to the trust, either through A passing the considera- tion on to the trust or through A accumulating the consideration for the benefit of the trust, then B will not be a settlor . 6.75 Property may be made available to a person indirectly by a trust, or services may be provided indirectly by trustees, through similar use of intermediaries. Market value Significance 6.76 The tr ansactions specified in paras (a) to (d) of thesettler definition only result in a person being a settlor if, in the case of thetransactions specified in paras (a) to (c), they are effected at below market value or, in the case of the transac- tions specified in para (d), they are effected at above market value. The concept of market value is also relevant in the context of the definition of "corpus" and the definition of "distribution" in s .226(1). Market value compared with "fullyadequate consideration" 6.77 The concept of market value is used in relation to the "settler" definition contained in s.226(2) to overcome two defects in the "fully adequate consideration" concept used in the Estate and Gift Duties Act definition of "gift". The first of these defects is that it has been suggested that the question of whether fully adequate considera- tion has been provided can be determined by looking at the "nature of the transaction" and by considering whether what is given is a"fair equivalent" for what is received: CIR vNew Zealand Insurance Co Ltd \[1958\] NZLR 1077, 1088. This approach is less precise than placing a value on the property or services which passes on one side and comparing this with the value of the consideration provided on the other. The adop- tion of "market value" indicates that the "fair equivalent" test does not apply in the context of the "settler" definition and that the question of whether a person is a settler is determined by placing a value on the consideration flowing between the person and the trust . 6 .78 The second problem with the fully ade- quate consideration concept, also suggested by the New Zealand InsuranceCo case, is that the intention or purpose of the parties is relevant in determining whether consideration is adequate. This could give rise to arguments under the fully adequate consideration test that if the only pur- pose for which a person disposes of property to a trust is to receive consideration from the trust the consideration from the trust must be fully ade- quate. This argument could not be made under the market value test . The market value test is an objective one and that the intention or purpose of the parties is not a relevant consideration. General 12rinciples 6.79 The method of valuingtransactions with or in relation to trusts and of valuingproperty settled on trust will vary considerably from transaction to transaction. It is not possible in the contextof this bulletin to give precise guidance on how particularcategories oftransactions are tobe valued. However,some p ri nciples of general applicationare clear from cases decided in similar contexts. 47 6.80 In general terms, the market value of property or services is determined by assuming that the property is sold to a person, or the serv- ices are provided to another person, in a hypo- thetical transaction. This allows an objective judgment to be made as to whether the transac- tion was effected at market value. Applying this hypothetical transaction approach, the market value of property or services is the amount at which a reasonable and willing vendor will sell the property or provide the services to a willing, well informed and prudent purchaser where : (i) the vendor or person providing the serv - ices is assumed to be honest and reason- able, and therefore willing to provide prospective purchasers with all of the information which the vendor or person providing the services is entitled to pro- vide: Lynallv IRC \[1971\] 3 All ER 914; (ii) special circumstances surrounding the disposition of property or the provision of services - for example, that the person dis- posing of the property was in financial difficulty - can be taken into account : Edge v CIR \[1958\] NZLR 42; (iii) if the transaction involves the disposition or use of property, any special characteris- tics of the property must be taken into account : Lynall; (iv) the purchaser in the hypothetical transac- tion is assumed to be prudent, and there- fore the price which the purchaser would pay would be a reasonable one in view of the information which can be assumed to be available: Public TrusteeforNSWv CIR \[1966\] NZLR 257; Lynall; (v) all potential purchasers are considered but the price which a purchaser would pay for special reasons does not represent the market value unless there are sufficient special purchasers to indicate that the higher price is in fact the market value: HMR Propertiesv CIR 5 ATR 797 (1975); CIR v Crossman\[193611All ER 762; RobinsonBrothers (Brewers)Ltd v Houghton Assessment Committee \[1938\] 2 All ER 534. 6.81 The hypothetical purchaser is assumed to be well informed so that all available information can be taken into consideration in determining whether the transaction was effected at market value. All information which the person disposing of the property or providing the property or services is entitled to disclose, whether or not there is an obligation to disclose the information, is taken into consideration. 6.82 Any special circumstances surrounding the transaction may be considered. For example, if the vendor of property is desperate to sell because of financial difficulties, and is therefore willing to accept a lower price, that fact will be relevant in determining whether the property was disposed of at market value. If there are no special circum- stances surrounding the transaction it is not appropriate to assume special circumstances in determining whether the transaction was at market value. 6.83 In cases involving the disposition or making available of property, any special charac- teristics of the property may be considered in valuing the transaction. For example, if shares in a private company which are subject to a right of pre-emption are disposed of it is necessary to assume that the hypothetical purchaser of the shares would acquire them subject to that right of pre-emption: see the Lynall case cited above. Similarly, if the transaction involved land and there were restrictions on the use of the land it would be necessary to consider those restrictions in valuing the land. 6.84 As a general rule, a price which, for special reasons, a particular person would be prepared to pay for property or services will not represent the market value of the property or services. Thus if a property developer would be prepared to pay a high price for a piece of land in order to establish itself in a particular area the price which the developer would pay would not be determinative in establishing whether the price paid on the sale of the property to a trust repre- sented the market value of the property: see the HMR Propertiescase cited above. However, if there are a number of special purchasers willing to pay a special price that may indicate that the higher price represents the market value . 685 If the market selling value method of valuing trading stock for the purpose of s .85 of the Income Tax Act is adopted by a person, the correct approach is to ascertain the amount at which the person would be willing to sell the trading stock in the ordinary course of business at the relevant date:Sharkey v Wernher \[1956\] AC 58. The ordinary course of business approach does not differ significantly from the willing buyer - willing seller approach discussed above. Thus, in cases involving the disposition of property, or the provision of property or services, by a person who is in the business of disposing of property or providing property or services of the type in question, the market value of the property or services can be determined by establishing whether the amount charged is the amount which would be charged in the ordinary course of the person's business. 48 , 6.86 In determining whether a transaction results in a person being classified as a settlor by virtue of s.226(2) all value provided in relation to the transaction, whether in cash or in kind, is taken into account. However, as discussed above, the proviso to s.226(2) provides that the fact that a person is or will become a beneficiary does not constitute the giving or receiving of value. Services provided byprofessional advisers 6.87 In some cases professional advisers pro- vide services free of charge with the purpose of encouraging the person to whom the services are provided to become a longer term client . In other cases services may be provided free of charge to an existing client in order to encourage the person to remain a client, and on the basis that the serv- ices are relatively minor in the context of the overall services provided to the person. If services are rendered by a professional adviser to trustees of a trust for these types of reasons the question arises whether the adviser is a settlor of the trust. 6.88 Applying the willing seller - willing buyer approach, it would be clear that where services are provided free of charge in the circumstances described a well informed and prudent person receiving the benefit of the adviser's services would not pay for the services . Consequently, the provision of services would be at market value . Applying the ordinary course of business ap- proach, if the adviser provided services free of charge in the described circumstances then the provision of the services free of charge will be at market value. In this context, the question is not whether the adviser ordinarily provides services to the trustees free of charge but rather whether in the circumstances in which the services are pro- vided to the trustees the adviser would ordinarily provide the services free of charge to the adviser's other clients. Services provided by trustees 6 .89 As a matter of law trustees are generally prohibited from charging for services provided in relation to the trust . One exception to this rule is wherethe trustdeed allowstrustees to charge for services. The question arises whether atrustee who provides services free of chargein relation to a trustis therebyasettlerof the trust in terms of s .226(2). 6.90 If the trustee is not legally entitled to charge for the trustee's services this will be a special circumstance to consider in terms of the discussion above of the willing buyer - willing seller approach . Given the inability to charge for services, a willing buyer would not payfor the services. Consequently, in these circumstances the trustee will not be a settlor of the trust. However, the trustee may be a settlor if the trustee is able to charge for services but does not do so. Forgiveness of debt 6 .91 If a person forgives a debt owing by a trust the forgiveness will constitute a "disposition of property" by virtue of para (d) of the definition of that term . If the debt is forgiven at less than mar- ket value the person forgiving the debt will be a settlor of the trust . Where the trust and the trus- tees are insolvent the debt will have little or no value. Consequently, a forgiveness of the debt for no consideration will not result in the lender being classified as a settlor. However, if the trust and the trustees are not insolvent and the debt is forgiven at below market value the lender will be a settlor of the trust . Nominee and nominal settlors: s .226(3) Significance 6 .92 Section 226(3) provides that where any person has made a settlement to or for the benefit of a trust or on the terms of a trust as a nominee for another person, or if the settlement is made at the request of another person and is of a nominal amount, the other person is deemed to be the settlor of the trust rather than the person actually making the settlement. 6 .93 The objective of this provision is to ensure that persons acting as nominees, or who do not act as nominees but who settle a nominal amount on trust on instructions from another person, are not treated as settlors. Often professional advisers or relatives will assist in establishing a trust by settling a nominal sum on trust on behalf of another person. In these circumstances it is not appropriate to expose the professional adviser or relative to a potential tax liability under s.228. The professional adviser or relative is not the real settlor of the trust but is in effect only an interme- diary or facilitator . The real settlor is the person on whose behalf the professional adviser or relative acted in making the settlement. Thus, s .226(3) treats the person for whom the nominee or the nominal settlor acted as the settlor rather than the nominee or nominal settler . 6 .94 Section 226(3) also makes it clear that a person cannot avoid settlor status by using nomi- nees or nominal settlors to establish trusts . This is also apparent from s.226(2) as that provision includes as settlers persons who carry out indi- rectly the transactions described in that provision . 49 Requirements 6.95 The term "nominee" is not defined for the purpose of s .226(3). It will thus have the meaning which it normally has in the context of the Income Tax Act: i.e ., a person who acts on the instructions of another person . The nominee exception applies where any "settlement" is made by a nominee . By s .226(6) a settlement is any action or failure to act on the part or any person, or any transaction entered into by a person, which has the effect of making that person a settlor. 6.96 The question of whether a settlement is of a nominal amount is determined by considering the amount of the settlement in isolation rather than by comparing the amount of the settlement with the eventual value of the trust's assets. It is not possible to establish a fixed amount as being nominal . However, it would generally be the case that a settlement involving an amount less than $100 would be a nominal settlement. In contrast to the nominee settlor exception the nominal settlor exception is limited to settlements of "amounts". This is understood to mean amounts of money. Thus, the nominal settlor exception applies only to settlements of money. The exception would not apply, for example, in cases where the settlement involved the provision of services or the transfer of property other than money. This is because in practice the transactions which the exception is targeted at - the establishment of trusts by profes- sional advisers and relatives at the request of another person - only involve the settlement of small cash sums. 6.97 The nominal settlor exception applies only where the settlement was made at the request of another person. Thus, if a person settles a nominal amount on trust on that person's own initiative the person will remain a settlor in terms of s.226(2). Although it is not stated explicitly, it is implicit in the nominee concept that the nominee exception applies where the person who is acting as a nominee in making the settlement does so at the direction of another person. Disclosur e 6.98 Although s.226(3) excludes nominee and nominal settlors from being settlors for the pur- pose of the trust regime, persons in this category may still have an obligation under s.231(3) to make a disclosure. By s.231(3), a person is required to make a disclosure to the Commissioner if - (i) the person was resident in New Zealand at the time ofa settlementon or to or for the benefit ofa trust onor after 17 December 1987 ; and (ii) the person would otherwise be treated as a settlor of the trust but by virtue of the application of s.226(3) the person is not treated as a settlor of the trust; and (iii) atthe time of the settlement there was no trustee of the trust resident in New Zealand. 6.99 If these conditions are satisfied the person is required to disclose to the Commissioner the fact of the settlement, the name and address of the person who is deemed to be the settlor pursuant to s.226(3) and any further details which may be required. The disclosure must be made within three months of the date of settlement or, if later, by 31 May 1989. The deemed settlor may also have a disclosure obligation in relation to the settlement because, for example, there is no resident trustee of the trust at the time of settlement: s.231(2). Settlements by closelyheld companies: s.226(4 ) Objective 6.100 Section 226(4) provides that where a controlled foreign company, or a company which would be a controlled foreign company if it were a foreign company, settles a trust or is deemed to be a settlor of a trust any person who at the time of settlement held a control interest in any category of control interest (as defined in s.245C) in the company of 10 percent or greater is a settlor of the trust. 6.101 The objective of this provision is to limit opportunities for avoiding the trust regime by using a company to establish a trust and then winding the company up. The provision also recognises that where a closely held company is used to settle a trust the company is being used as a vehicle for the settlement and it is thus appropri- ate to look through the company to the real settlor. App\] ica tion of s.226(4) (a) Conditions to satisfy 6.102 Section 226(4) provides that a person who holds an interest in a company which settles a trust is a settlor of the trust if the following condi- tions are met : (i) the company settles a trust or is deemed to be a settlor of the trust by virtue of s.226; (ii) at the time of the settlement the company was a controlled foreign company (CFC) as defined in s.245C or, if it was not a CFC, 50 , it was a compan y which would have been a CFC ifit were a foreign company; at the time of the settlement the person held a control interest in any of the catego- ries of control interest specified in s.245C of 10 percent or more or, if the company was not a CFC, the person held an interest in the company which would have been a control interest of 10 percent or more in a CFC if the company were a foreign company. (b) Settlementby compan y 6.103 For s.226(4) to apply the company must settle a trust or it must be deemed by virtue of s.226 to be a settlor of a trust . A company will have settled a trust if it undertakes any of the transactions or actions which result in a person being a settlor by virtue of s .226(2) or if the com- pany is a settlor by virtue of s .226(4) or s.226(5). 6 .104 In this context it is important to appreciate that a company will be regarded as having settled a trust not only if it undertakes an action or transaction specified in s .226(2) but also if it is a settlor by virtue of any of the other provisions of s.226, or by virtue of s .226(4) itself. For example, if a New Zealand resident company which holds a control interest of 10 percent or more in a CFC is by virtue of s.226(4) a settlor of a trust settled by the CFC then the New Zealand resident company will be treated as being a settlor of the trust . Con- sequently, if the New Zealand resident company would have been a CFC if it were a foreign com- pany any person who held a control interest of 10 percent or more in the New Zealand resident company at the time of settlement by the CFC will also be a settlor of the trust by virtue of s .226(4). This is because s.226(4) applies where a company "settles a trust or is deemed by virtue of this section" to be a settler of a trust and in the ex- ample the New Zealand resident company settles the trust, or is deemed to be a settlor of the trust, in terms of s .226. Therefore, any person who held control interest of 10 percent or more in the New Zealand resident company at the time of settle- ment by the CFC will be a settlor of the trust. 6 .105 Section 226(4) applies where the person has a "control interest" of 10 percent or more in a company . In terms of s.245C "control interests" encompass direct and indirect control interests. An indirect control interest is a control interest held through a CFC . In the context of s.226(4) indirect control interests taken into account will be those held through CFCs or through companies that would be CFCs if they were foreign companies. Thus, where a lower tier CFC (or company which would be a CFC if it were a foreign company) settles a trust any person with an indirect control interest of 10 percent or more in the CFC (or company which would be a CFC if it were a foreign company) at the time of settlement will be a settler of the trust. 6.106 A company may bedeemed to bea settlor of a trust by virtue of s.226(3) or s.226(7). Thus, if a trust was settled by a nominee of a company the company would be deemed to be a settlor of the trust by s .226(3). Similarly, if a company acquired any rights or powers in relation to a trustee or settlor of an existing trust, and that acquisition had the purpose or effect of enabling the person to require the trustee to treat the company or any other person nominated by the company as a beneficiary of the trust, the company would be deemed to be a settlor of the trust by s .226(7). In both cases s .226(4) could be applied if the com- pany was a CFC, or a company which would be a CFC if it were a foreign company, to treat any person holding a control interest in the company of 10 percent or more as a settlor of the trust which the company is deemed to have settled by virtue of s .226(3) or s.226(7). (c) Nature of the company 6 .107 For s.226(4) to apply the company which settled the trust, or which is deemed to have been a settlor of the trust, must have been a CFC, or a company which would have been a CFC if it was a foreign company, at the time of settlement . 6 .108 The CFC legislation will be discussed in detail in a later bulletin . Briefly, a foreign com- pany is a CFC in relation to an accounting period if at any time during that accounting period the control interests in any of the categories of control interest listed in s .245C(4) of five or fewer New Zealand residents in the foreign company is at any time during the accounting period 50 percent or greater: s.245C(1) . By s .245C(3), the control interest of a person in a foreign company in any of the categories of control interest listed in s .245C(4) is calculated by aggregating with respect to each category of interest the person's direct control interest and indirect control interest and the direct control interest and indirect control interest held by persons associated with the person . By s.245C(4), a person holds direct control interests in a foreign company at any time equal to each percentage of the following things which the person holds or is entitled to acquire at that time: (i) the percentage of the total paid up capital of the foreign company ; (ii) the percentage of the totalnominal capital of the foreign company ; 51 (iii) the percentage of the rights to vote or participate in decision making concerning distributions, the constitution of the company, variation of the capital of the company, or the appointment or election of directors; (iv) the percentage of the income of the foreign company which the person would be entitled to receive if the income earned by the company was distributed on the last day of its accounting period and the entitlement of the person to receive income were the same at all other times during the company's accounting period; (v) the percentage of the value of the net assets of the foreign company which the person would be entitled to receive in the event of distribution of all of the company's assets . 6 .109 Indirect control interests are determined under s.245C(5) . Broadly, that provision allocates direct control interests held by a CFC, or by an associate of a CFC, in another foreign company to persons holding control interests in theCFC. The question of whether persons are associated is determined under s .245B. Control interests are calculated on four measurement days (31 March, 30 June, 30 September, and 31 December) and the contr ol interests held on those particular days are deemed to be held from the preceding measure- ment day up to and including that measurement day: s.245A(2)(e). Alternatively, an election may be made to calculate control interests on a daily basis. 6 .110 The control test is applied on a category of interest by category of interest basis. That is, a foreign company will be a CFC if the control test is satisfied in any one of the categories of interest listed in s.245C(4) . For example, if five or fewer residents hold direct and indirect control interests in the foreign company in the paid up capital category of 50 percent or more the company will be a CFC even if the aggregate interests held by the residents in the other categories are less than 50 percent. 6 .111 Section 226(4) applies in relation to both foreign companies which are CFCs and companies which are not foreign companies but which would be CFCs if they were foreign companies . This means that s.226(4) applies with respect to all companies, whether resident in New Zealand or not, which satisfy the control test contained in s .245C which applies with respect to foreign companies. 6 .112 The control interest concept encompasses both direct and indirect control interests . Thus, if a CFC holds a direct control interest in another foreign company residents holding control inter- ests in the CFC will have control interests in that other foreign company . If the other foreign com- pany is a CFC and it settles a trust, any resident who holds a control interest in the foreign com- pany of 10 percent or more at the time of settle- ment will be a settlor of the trust . (d) Inte rests in the company 6 .113 Section 226(4) applies with respect to any person who, at the time of the settlement by the company, held a control interest of 10 percent or more in the company in any of the categories of control interest listed in s.245C. The calculation of control interests in a foreign company has been discussed briefly above . Control interests are broader than "income interests" (calculated under s .245D) in that control interests include interests held by associated persons and entitlements to acquire interests. Also, a person may have control interests in each of the categories of control interest listed in s .245C(4) while an income interest is calculated as the highest of the interests listed in s .245D(2). Finally, there are different rules for cal- culating indirect control interests and indirect income interests . 6 .114 The effect of s.226(4) is that persons holding control interests of more than 10 percent at the time of settlement or deemed settlement are settlors of the trust. If the company is subsequently wound up, or the person's interest in the company is subsequently disposed of, the person will remain a settlor . Conversely, a person who ac- quires an interest in the company after the date of settlement will not be a settlor of the trust . This result is consistent with the objective of limiting opportunities for avoidance of settlor status by using closely held companies to settle trusts and with the objective of looking through closely held companies which settle trusts to establish the real settlor of the trust. Effecton the company 6 .115 Section 226(4) is a look through rule. It operates by defining as a settlor a person who holds an interest in a closely held company which settles a trust. However, the application of s .226(4) does not prevent the company from also being a settlor. Thus, if a resident company settles a trust it willbea settlorof thetrust. Additionally, if the requirements of s.226(4) are satisfied any person who holds an interest in the company may also be a settlor of the trust. 52 Example s Example6 Facts: NZco holds control interests in CFC of 100 percent in each of the categories of control interest specified in s.245C at the time CFC settles a trust. A and B each hold control inter- ests in NZco of 40 percent in each category of control interest at the time CFC settles the trust and C holds control interests of 20 percent in each category . NZco is not a foreign company and A, B and C are resident in New Zealand. Result: (i) At the time of settlement NZco held control interests of more than 50 percent in CFC in each of the categories of control interest listed in s.245C. NZco thus satis- fies s.226(4) in that at the time of settle- ment it held a control interest of more than 10 percent in any of the categories of control interest listed in s.245C. NZ co is therefore a settlor of the trust settled by CFC by virtue of s.226(4). (ii) NZco is a settlor of the trust and is thus treated as having made a settlement on the trust: s.226(6). At the time of settlement NZco is a company which would have been a CFC if it had been a foreign com- pany because A, B and C together have control interests in the categories listed in s.245C of 50 percent or more. As A, B and C each have control interests in NZco (which by s.226(4) is a settlor of the trust) of 10 percent or more at the time of settle- ment they are also settlors of the trust by virtue of s.226(4). There are thus four resident settlors of the trust: NZco, A, B and C . Example7 Facts: NZco2 settles property on Trustl on 1 April 1989 and on 1 June 1989 the trustees of Trustl settle property on Trust2. On both 1 April 1989 and 1 June 1989 A, a New Zealand resident individual, holds control interests of 100 percent in each category of interest in NZcol and NZcol holds control interests of 100 percent in each category of interest in NZco2. NZcol and NZco2 are both New Zealand resident companies which are not foreign companies. Result: (i) At the time of settlementof Trustl by NZco2, NZco2 is a company which would be a CFC if it were a foreign company. A's control interests in NZco2 are calculated under the indirect control interest rules contained in s .245C(5) because A does not hold a direct interest in NZco2 but rather an interest in NZcol which in turn holds an interest in NZco2. By application of those rules A has control interests in each of the categories of interest in NZco2 of 100 percent. Therefore, both NZco2 and A are settlors of Trustl . NZcol is also a settlor of Trustl because it has control interests of 10 percent or more in NZco2 at the time of settlement. (ii) When the trustees of Trustl settle property on Trust2 any person who is a settlor of Trustl is treated as a settlor of Trust2: s.226(5). Therefore, NZco2 is a settlor of Trust2 by virtue of settling Trustl and A and NZco1 are settlors of Trust2 by virtue of being settlors of Trustl under s.226(4). Settlor status and the CFC regime 6.116 By s.226(4), where a CFC settles a trust any person holding a control interest of 10 percent or more in the CFC at the time of settlement is a settlor of the trust . The worldwide trustee income derived by the trustees of the trust is therefore liable to tax in New Zealand by virtue of s.228 because there will be a resident settlor of the trust. If there are no resident trustees of the trust the settlor may be liable for tax on the trustee income. By s.245J(1), the branch equivalent income or loss of a CFC is calculated, generally, as if the CFC were a company resident in New Zealand. If a resident company settles a trust and there are no resident trustees the company may be liable for tax on the trustee income. Therefore, if a CFC settles a trust, the question arises whether the branch equivalent income or loss of the CFC is calculated by including the trustee income of the trust. 6.117 If trustee income were taken into account in calculating branch equivalent income or loss double taxation of trustee income could arise if such income were directly assessable to resident settlors as well as being attributed to settlors on a pro-rata basis under the CFC regime. Further, problems could arise if persons who held control interests in a CFC at the time of settlement subse- quently disposed of those interests to other residents. In these circumstances the persons originally holding the interests would remain settlors and might be liable for tax on trustee income while the persons acquiring the interests would be liable for tax on their pro-rata share of the trustee income under the CFC regime . 53 6.118 However, these problems do not arise because trustee income is nottaken into account in calculating branch equivalent income or loss. The scheme of the trust legislationis totax trustee income either to the trustee or to the settlor. The objective of the extended "settlor" definition in s.226 is to ensure that if a New Zealand resident settles a trust indirectly the trustee income derived by the trustees does not escape New Zealand tax . To require attribution of trustee income under the CFC regime would be inconsistent with the broad thrustofthesettlerdefinition. It istherefore consideredthatbecause there is a specific regime governing the taxation of trustee income the more general provisions of the CFC regime cannot be used to tax such income. Section 226(4)and indirect settlements 6 .119 Section 226(4) is expressed to apply "with- out limiting the situations in which a person is a settlor by reason of that person indirectly under- taking any of the transactions specified in subsec- tion (2) of this section". This is taken to mean that s.226(4) is not exhaustive of the situations in which a settlement made by a company is treated as also being a settlement made by persons hold- ing interests in the company. Thus, in some circumstances settlements made by a company which is not a CFC, or which is not a company which would be a CFC if it were a foreign com- pany, mayalso be treated as being made by a person holding an interest in such a company. For example, if a non-resident person used a closely held company to settle a trust before becoming resident in New Zealand, s.226(4) would not apply but the person using the company may be a settlor because the person made an indirect settlement on the trust . Settlements by trustees: s .226(5 ) Obiective 6.120 Section 226(5) provides that if a trustee of a trust settles another trust or makes a distribution to or on the terms of another trust any person who is a settlor of the trust making the settlement or distribution is a settlor of the trust on which the settlement is made or to which the distribution is made . The objective of s.226(5) is to ensure that settlerstatus cannot be avoided by using trusts to settle other trusts or to make distributions to other trusts. In the absence of this rule it may not be possible to establish that a settlor of a trust is a settlor of another trust settled by that trust. Application 6.121 Section 226(5) applies if, (i) there is a settlement or distribution by a "trustee of a trust"; (ii) the trustee "settles a trust or makes any distribution to or on the terms of another trust"; (iii) there is a settlor of the trust making the settlement or distribution . 6.122 In this context, the definition of "trustee" in s.2 is relevant. Among other things, that defini- tion provides that "in relation to any trust, a reference in this Act to a trustee of that trus t means that trustee only in the capacity as trustee of that trust" . Therefore, settlements or distributions made by trustees on or to other trusts are only relevant in applying s .226(5) if they are made by the trustee in the trustee's capacity as trustee of that trust . Consequently, if the trust from which the settlement is made is wound up the trustees of that trust will cease to be settlors of the resettled trust because the trustees were settlors of the resettled trust in their capacity as trustees of the trust from which the settlement was made rather than in a personal capacity . If the original trust is wound up the trustees lose their status as trustees of that trust and, because their status as settlors of the resettled trust depends solely on their status as trustees of the original trust, it follows that they also lose their status as settlors of the resettled trust . However, any person who was a settlor of the resettled trust by virtue of s.226(5) will remain a settlor of that trust even if the original trust is wound up . 6.123 The second requirement is that the trustee must settle a trust or make a distribution to or on the terms of another trust . The use of the present tense is taken to indicate that the rule only applies with respect to settlements or distributions made by trustees after the new trust regime came into effect: i .e., after the beginning of the income year commencing on 1 April 1988. The trustee will be considered to have settled a trust if the trustee is a settlor of the trust in terms of s.226. In determin- ing whether the trustee has made a distribution to another trust the definition of "distribution" in s.226(1) will apply . 6.124 The third requirement is that there must be a settlor of the trust which makes the settlement. Section 226(5) provides that the term "settlor" in relation to the trust on which the settlement is made "includes any person who is a settlor of the first trust, and includes any person who is a settlor of the first trust by the operation of this subsec- tion" . Thus, a person will be a settlor of the trust making the settlement (i .e ., the "first trust") if the person is a settlor of that trust by virtue of any of 54 the provisions of s.226, including s.226(5). For example, if A settles Trust 1, the trustees of Trust 1 settle Trust 2, and the trustees of Trust 2 settle Trust 3, A will be a settlor of all three trusts. A is a settlor of Trust 2 by operation of s .226(5) because A is a settlor of Trust 1 . A will also be a settlor of Trust 3 by virtue of s .226(5) because A is a settlor of Trust 2 by virtue of s.226(5). 6.125 Section 226(5) applies where the trustees of a trust settle another trust or make a distributio n to another trust after the beginning of the income year commencing on 1 April 1988, the date on which the new trust regime came into effect. However, the person who is a settlor of the trust from which the settlement or distribution is made (i .e ., the "first trust") need not necessarily have undertaken the transaction or action which rendered that person a settlor of the first trust after the effective date . If the person is a settlor of the first trust by virtue of s .226(2) it is clear that the transaction or action giving rise to that settlor status may have been undertaken at any time, whether before or after the commencement of the new trust regime. 6 .126 However, if the first trust was settled before the commencement date and the trustees of that trust settled another trust before the com- mencement date the settlor of the first trust would not be a settlor of the second trust by virtue of s.226(5). Unlike s .226(2), s.226(5) only applies to make a person a settlor of a trust where the transaction or action takes place after the com- mencement date of the new trust regime . Thus, the settlor of the first trust would only be a settlor of the second trust if the settlement on the second trust was an indirect settlement by the settlor of the first trust or if the trustees of the second trust were acting as nominees for the settlor of the first trust in making the settlement . 6 .127 By way of example, assume that on 1 February 1986 A made a disposition of property to a trust at below market value, and on 1 February 1989 the trustees of the trust made a disposition of property to another trust at below market value . A would be a settlor of the first trust in terms of s .226(2) even though the disposition of property to that trust took place before the commencement date of the new trust regime . By virtue of s.226(5), A would also be a settlor of the second trust because the disposition of property to the second trust took place after the commencement date of the new trust regime . However, if the disposition of property to the second trust was made before the commencement date of the new trust regime s .226(5) would not apply to render A a settlor of the second trust, although A would be a settlor of the first trust and the trustees of the first trust would be settlors of the second trust. Settlement definition : s.226(6)- 6.128 Section226(6) providesthat the term "set- tlement" means any action or failure to act on the partof any person, or any transaction or series of transactions entered intoby anyperson, which has the effect of making that person a settlor. The term "settlement" is used in a numbe r of contexts: see, for example, para(d) of the definition of "distribu- tion", the definition of "fore ign trust", the defini- tion of "qualifying trust", s.226(3), s .226(4), s.226(12), s.227A,s.228(4), s .228(5), s.228(6) and s.231. Acquisitionof ri ghts or powers in relation to settlor or trustee: s.226(7) Obiective 6 .129 Section 226(7) provides that if any person has acquired rights or powers in relation to a trustee or settlor of an existing trust, and the acquisition has the purpose or effect of enabling the person to require the trustee of the trust to treat the person or any other person nominated by the person as a beneficiary of thetrust,the person is deemed to be a settlor of the trust . 6.130 In the absence of this provision it would be possible to avoid settlor status by acquiring rights or powers in relation to an existing trust rather than by establishing a new trust. For ex- ample, if a Hong Kong resident settles $990,000 on trust where the trustee is a company owned by the Hong Kong resident, and a New Zealand resident acquires the trustee for $1 million, the New Zealand resident would not be a settlor of the trust under the other provisions of s.226. However, by acquiring the trustee the New Zealand resident may be able to nominate benefi- ciaries of the trust and exercise control over the $990,000 trust fund . Effectively, the person acquir- ing the trustee in these circumstances is in the same position as if that person had established the trust. Thus, by s .226(7) the person acquiring the trustee will be deemed to be a settlor of the trust if the acquisition has the purpose or effect of ena- bling the person to require the trustee to treat nominated persons as beneficiaries of the trust. Application 6 .131 Section 226(7) applies if: (i) a person acquired rights or powers in relation to a trustee or settlor of an existing trust; and (ii) the acquisition was made directly or indirectly; and 55 (iii) the acquisition had the purpose or effect of enabling the person to require the trustee to treat the person or any other nominated person as a beneficiary of the trust. 6.132 Section 226(7) applies where rights or powers are acquired in relation to either the trustee or the settlor of an existing trust . Rights in relation to a trustee or settlor may be acquired, or example, if the trustee or settlor is a company and the person acquires shares in the company. The acquisition of the shares may enable the person to require the trustee to treat the person or any nominated person as a beneficiary of the trust . In the case of trusts established outside New Zealand persons are often appointed in relation to the trust to ensure that the trustee's decisions are inaccor- dance with the settlor's wishes . These persons are often referred to as "protectors" but other termi- nology may be used . It may thus be possible to acquire powers in relation to a trustee, for ex- ample, by being appointed a protector of the trust or by being appointed to a position with the same function as a protector, by acquiring the protector or other person who performs the function of a protector, or by acquiring the settlor and using the settlor's influence or control over the protector or other person performing the function of a protector. 6.133 The acquisition may have been made directly or indirectly. The important consideration is therefore whether a person has acquired rights or powers in relation to a trustee rather than how those powers or rights were obtained . 6.134 The purpose or effect of the acquisition must be to enable the person to require the trustee to treat the person or any other person nominated by the person as a beneficiary of the trust. This will be determined by establishing whether the person can in fact require the trustee to treat the person or another nominated person as a beneficiary of the trust . If the person can require the trustee to treat the person or another nominated person as a beneficiary the person will be a settlor even if the legal documentation establishing the trust does not indicate that the person has this power. For example, it is often the case in relation to trusts established in tax havens that settlors exercise informal control over trustees; the control being informal in the sense thatit isnot disclosed in the documents establishing the trust. A person who acquires rights or powers in relation to a settlor of such a trust will be a settlor of the trust if the purpose or effect of the acquisition is to enable the person to utilise the settlor's informal control over the trustees in order to have the person or a nomi- nated person to be treated as a beneficiary of the trust. 6 .135 Section 226(7) applies if the acquisition has the purpose or effect of "enabling" the person to require the trustee to treat the person or a nomi- nated person as a beneficiary. Therefore, it is not necessary that the person actually require the trustee to treat the person or a nominated person as a beneficiary . The provision is satisfied if the person is able to require the trustee to behave in that manner. Consequently, if in year 1 a person acquires rightsor powers ofthe type described in s .226(7) and those rights or powers are not exer- cised until year 3, the person will be a settlor of the trust in years 1 to 3 inclusive. In these circum- stances the person effectively has a power of disposition over the income derived by the trus- tees and it is thus appropriate to treat the person as a sett\]or from the outset. Settlementsby employers: s.226(12) Obiective 6 .136 Section 226(12) provides that a person is deemed not to be a settlor of a trust if the person makes a settlement as an employer for the benefit of employees on a trust established principally for the purpose of providing retirement benefits to natural persons. This provision does not apply if the trust is a foreign superannuation scheme as defined in s.245R or if it is a superannuation fund (as defined in s.2). 6 .137 The objective of this provision is to ensure that New Zealand subsidiaries of multinational companies are not treated as settlors of superan- nuation schemes established by their non-resident parent companies where they make contributions to such schemes in relation to their employees. In the absence of this rule a New Zealand subsidiary of, say, a United States multinational company could be treated as a settlor of the superannuation scheme established by the United States parent company and could be liable for tax on the worldwide trustee income of the scheme in terms of s.228. Application 6 .138 For s.226(12) to applythe settlement must be made by an employer on the terms of a trust established principallyfor the purposeof provid- ing retirement benefits for natural persons. Section 226(12) does not apply ifthe trust is a foreign superannuationscheme asdefined in s .245R . These schemeswillbeunit trusts andby virtue of s.226(10) will therefore fall outside the scope of the trust regime. 6 .139 Section 226(12) also does not apply if the trust is a superannuation fund. By s.2, the expres- 56 sion "superannuation fund" is defined as mean- ing superannuation category 1 and 2 schemes and superannuation schemes which are registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. Superannuation schemes constituted outside New Zealand which have been classified by the Govern- ment Actuary under the Superannuation Schemes Regulations 1983 are excluded from the defini- tion. PART 7: TRUSTS SETTLED BY PERSONS BEFORE BECOMING RESIDENT Overvie w 7 .1 Section 226A applies where a settlor of a trust becomes resident in New Zealand after 17 December 1987 and, if a distribution had been made from the trust on the day immediately preceding the day on which the settlor became resident, the trust would have been a foreign trust in relation to the distribution. In these circum- stances any settlor, trustee or beneficiary of the trust may elect to pay tax on the trustee income derived by the trustee within 12 months of the later of 31 May 1989 or the day on which the settlor became resident . 7 .2 In many cases trusts settled by non- residents will have been established in ignorance of the New Zealand trust taxation regime. Conse- quently, it is not appropriate to automatically expose settlors of such trusts who subsequently become resident in New Zealand to taxation on trustee income in accordance with s.228 . However, to be consistent with the policy underlying the trust regime, if a settlor of the trust is resident in New Zealand it is appropriate either to subject the trustee income to tax or to tax resident beneficiar- ies deriving distributions of amounts other than beneficiary income at a higher rate to compensate for the deferral advantage they enjoy . Thus, rather than automatically exposing the trustee income of such trusts to taxation s.226A gives settlors, trustees and beneficiaries an option to elect to pay tax on such income . However, if an election is not made resident beneficiaries are taxed at a higher rate on distributions of income and capital gains to compensate for the deferral of New Zealand tax enjoyed on the trustee income as it is accumu- lated. 7 .3 The effect of an election is that the elector is liable to payincome tax on trustee income . Therefore, if an election is made the legislation treats the trust as a qualifying trust in relation to distributions of income, capital profits and capital gains derived by the trustees after the date on which the election is made . Distributions of such amounts, other than distributions of beneficiary income, are thus not assessable for income tax to the beneficiary: s.227(6) . The trust remains a foreign trust in relation to distributions of income, capital profits or capital gains derived before the date on which the election was made . Thus, distributions of income derived by the trustees before the election was made are assessable, subject to the application of the proviso to s.9 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 5) 1988 (see Part 3 of this bulletin for a discussion of s.9). Where the obligation to pay tax on trustee income ceases to be satisfied in any income year distribu- tions made in that income year, and in succeeding income years, are treated as distributions from a non-qualifying trust except to the extent that they consist of distributions of amounts derived before the election to pay tax on trustee income was made. 7.4 If an election is not made, and no further settlements are made on the trust after the settlor becomes resident in New Zealand, the settlor is not liable for tax on the trustee income: s.228(4) in relation to trusts settled on or before 17 December 1987; s .228(5)(b) in relation to trusts on which a settlement has been made after 17 December 1987 . Further, if the trustee is resident outside New Zealand at all times during the income year the trustee will not be liable for tax on the trustee income: s .228(6). Consequently, as the trustee income is not taxed as itis derived distributions of income, other than of beneficiary income, and capital gains derived after the expiry of the period for making the election are taxed at a higher rate to compensate for the deferral advantage enjoyed by the beneficiary . This is achieved by treating the trust as a non-qualifying trust in relation to such distributions: s.226A(3). The trust remains a foreign trust in relation to distributions of income, other than beneficiary income, and capital gains derived before the expiry of the 12 month period for making the election . That is, such distributions are assessable to the extent that they consist of income derived by the trustees, subject to the proviso to s.9 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 5) 1988. Elections : s .226A(1) Requirements 7 .5 Section 226A(1) applies if: (i) a"settlof' of a trust becomes resident in New Zealand; (ii) the settlor of a trust becomes resident in New Zealand after 17 December 1987; and (iii) the settlor is a natural person; and 57 (iv) if a distribution had been made from the trust on the day immediately preceding the day on which the settlor became resident the trust would have been a foreign trust in relation to the distribution. 7 .6 In these circumstances any settlor, trustee or beneficiary of the trust can elect, pursuant to s .228(7), to pay tax on the trustee income derived by the trustees . This election must be made within 12 months of the later of 31 May 1989 or the day on which the settlor became resident in New Zealand. Conditions for s.226A to apply (a) Settlor 7.7 Section 226A applies where a"settlor" of a trustbecomes resident in New Zealand. In this context, the broad definition of "settlor" contained in s .226, and discussed in Part 6 of this bulletin, applies. (b) Settlor becomes resident after 17 December 1987 7.8 Section 226A applies where the settlor be- comes residentin New Zealandafter17 December 1987. If thetrust was settledbefore 17 December 1987, and the settlor became residenton or before 17 December1987, an electionto pay tax on trustee income could have beenmade before 31 May 1989in terms ofs .227A. (c) Settlor a natural perso n 7 .9 Section 226A applies onlywherethe settlor who becomes resident in New Zealand is a natural person. If the settlor is a company the special rules in s .226A will not apply. Conse- quently, if a settlement has been made on the trust by a company after 17 December 1987 the corpo- rate settlor will be liable to tax on trustee income in terms of s.228(4), subject only to the exceptions contained in s.228(5). In this context, the most significant of these exceptions is that the corporate settlor will not be liable to tax on trustee income if a trustee of the trust is resident in New Zealand for the entire income year during which the settler is resident: s.228(5)(a). (d) Trusta foreign trust 7.10 The final pre-condition for s.226A to apply is that the trust would have been a foreign trust in relation to a distribution made on the day before the day on which the settlor became resident in New Zealand . This requirement willbe satisfied if there was no settlor of the trust resident in New Zealand from the later of 17 December 1987 or the date on which the trust was first settled until the date of deemed distribution (i.e., the day before the day on which the settlor became resident). Thus, s.226A would not apply, for example, if a settlor who had been resident in New Zealand after 17 December 1987 ceased to be resident and then later became resident again . As a settlor of the trust had been resident in New Zealand after 17 December 1987, the trust would not be a foreign trust in relation to a distribution made on the day preceding the day on which the settlor again became resident in New Zealand . However, the result would be different if a person who had been resident in New Zealand after 17 December 1987 first settled a trust after ceasing to be resident . If the person subsequently became resident in New Zealand again s .226A could apply because no settlor of the trust had been resident in New Zealand from the date on which the trust was first settled until the date on which the settlor became resident in New Zealand again . 7 .11 For the trust to be a foreign trust in rela- tion to an assumed distribution made on the day before the settlor became resident in New Zealand it is necessary that no settlor of the trust had been resident from the later of 17 December 1987 or the date of first settlement of the trust until the date of assumed distribution (i.e ., the day before the day on which the settlor becomes resident in New Zealand) . Thus, if there are two settlors of a trust, A and B, and A had been resident in New Zealand subsequent to the date on which the trust was first settled - the date of first settlement being after 17 December 1987 - s .226A and s .228(5)(b) will not apply if B later becomes resident in New Zealand. Instead, the provisions in s .228 governing settlor liability to tax on trustee income will apply . Election 7.12 The election to pay tax on trustee income may be made by any settlor, trustee or beneficiary of the trust. Thus, the settlor who becomes resi- dent in New Zealand may elect to pay tax on trustee income. Alternatively, any other settlor of the trust, or any trustee or beneficiary, may make an election . Also, any combination of settlors, trustees or beneficiaries may make a joint election . 7.13 If a trustee of the trust is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year in which the settlor becomes resident in New Zea- land, the trustee will be liable for tax on New Zealand and foreign source trustee income under s.228(2) and s.228(3) whether or not an election is made to pay tax on trustee income. However, to secure the benefit of s.226A it is still necessary that an election be made to pay tax on trustee income. 58 If no election is made the trust will be a non- qualifying trust in relation to distributions of amounts derived after the expiry of the period for making an election, even if the trustee has paid tax on trustee income in terms of s.228. To ensure that elections to pay tax on trustee income can be made by any settlor, trustee or beneficiary s .226A provides that the election is made pursuant to s.228(7), and s .228(7) provides that any settlor, trustee or beneficiary may make an election. Prior to amendment by the Income Tax Amendment Act 1989, s.228(7) permitted only settlors, trustees and beneficiaries who were not otherwise liable to tax on trustee income to make an election. The amendment was intended to ensure that settiors, trustees and beneficiaries could make an election even if they were otherwise liable to pay tax on trustee income. Example8 Facts : A settled property on trust on 1 June 1986 when A was resident in Australia. There are two trustees of the trust, one being A's spouse and the other being an Australian resident solicitor . The trust property earns Australian source income . A and her spouse become resident in New Zealand on 1 October 1990 . Result: (i) A is not liable to tax on trustee income because the trust was settled before 17 December 1987 : s .228(4). (If the trust had been settled after 17 December 1987 s.228(5)(b) would provide that A would not be liable to tax on trustee income) . (ii) Section 226A will apply because A became resident in New Zealand after 17 Decem- ber 1987, A is a naturalperson,and if3 distribution had been made from the trust on the day before the day on which A became resident in New Zealand the trust would have been a foreign trust in relation to the distribution. The trust would have been a foreign trust because no settlor of the trust was resident in New Zealand from the later of 17 December 1987 or the date of first settlement until the day before the day on which the settlor became resident. (iii) A's spouse, as trustee of the trust, is liable to pay tax on the trustee income of the trust derived from outside New Zealand from the income year commencing on 1 April1990because a settlor of the trust, A, is resident in New Zealand for a part of that income year: s.228(3) . The exceptions in s.228(6) do not apply because A's spouse is not resident outside New Zea- land at all times during the income year . (iv) If an electionis notmade in terms of s.226A(1) and s.228(7), thetrust will be a non-qualifyingtrust in rela ti on to distribu- tions of amountsderived by thetrustees after theexpiry of 12months from the date on which Abecameresident in New Zealand:i.e., after 1October 1991. (v) Although A's spouse is already liable to pay tax on trustee income he can make an election in accordance with s.226A(1) and s.228(7). If an election is made, either by A, by A's spouse, by the Australian trustee or by any beneficiary, the trust will be a qualifying trust in relation to distributions of amounts derived by the trustees after the date on which the election was made provided that the trustee's obligations in relation to the trustee income continue to be satisfied. 7.14 The election must be made within 12 months of the later of the day on which the settlor became resident in New Zealand or 31 May 1989. Thus, a reasonable transitional period is provided for settlors, trustees and beneficiaries associated with such trusts to decide whether to make an election to pay tax on trustee income. 7.15 If the requirements of s.226A are satisfied, and a settlor, trustee or beneficiary wishes to make an election, the election is made under s.228(7). Where the election is made in terms of s.226A, s.228(7) provides that the election must be made within the period specified in s.226A and that the effect of the election is that the elector is assessable and liable to income tax on trustee income from the date of election. Liability totax on trustee income derived, and treatment of distributions made, before election 7.16 When an election to pay tax on trustee income is not made immediately after the settlor becomes resident in New Zealand the treatment of the trustee income derived between the date on which the settlor became resident and the date on which the election is made is determined in accordance with s.228. The fact that provision is made for settlors, trustees and beneficiaries to elect to pay tax on trustee income does not sus- pend the operation of s. 228. Thus, any trustee in- come derived from New Zealand during the period before the election is made will continue to be liable to income tax: s.228(2). 59 7 .17 Also, if a settlement is made by the settlor after the settler becomes resident in New Zealand the settler and trustee of the trust will be liable to tax on trustee income de ri ved from outside New Zealand from the beginning of the income year in which the settlement was made . In this context, the broad definition of "settlor" set out in s.226, and discussed in Part 6 of this bulletin, applies . That definition is broad in its scope, and includes a wide range of direct and indirect transactions entered into with or in relation to a trust . 7.18 If a distribution is made to a resident bene- ficiary during the period before an election is made it may technically constitute a distribution from a non-qualifying trust. However, once the election has been made the effect will be that the distribution will be treated as a distribution from a foreign trust. Consequenceofelection: s.2280), s .226A(2) Trustee incom e 7 .19 Section 228(7) provides that where a person elects to pay tax on trustee income in the circumstances specified in s .226A the person is liable to income tax on trustee income from the date of the election, and the election applies from the date of the election and in respect of all suc- ceeding income years . The liability of any other person to tax on trustee income remains unaffected by the election . For example, if a resident settlor makes the election this will not affect the liability of any non-resident trustee to tax on trustee income derived from New Zealand. If the non- resident trustee later becomes resident in New Zealand the settler will remain liable to tax on all trustee income because of the election and the trustee will become liable to tax on trustee income derived from outside New Zealand because the trustee is resident in New Zealand and a settler of the trust is also resident in New Zealand: s .228(3). 7.20 No method is prescribed for determining the amount of trustee income derived on and after the day on which the election was made . The rules contained in s .226A(4) are relevant only for the purpose of determining the treatment of distribu- tions from the trust. However, to be consistent with the treatment of distributions either a time based apportionment using the method prescribed in s.226A(4)(a) or a calculation based on income actually derived after the date of election will be accepted. Distributions (a) Treatment of distribution s 7 .21 Section 226A(2) provides that if an election is made in terms of s .226A(1) the trust is deemed to be a foreign trust for the purpose of the defini- tion of "taxable distribution" in s .226 to the extent that any distribution from the trust consists of income, capital profits or capital gains derived by the trustee before the date of the election . Further, the trust is deemed to be a qualifying trust to the extent that any distribution consists of income, capital profits or capital gains derived by the trustee after the date of the election provided that the trustee's obligations in relation to the trustee income continue to be satisfied . 7.22 The rules contained in s .226A(2) apply for the purpose of the definition of "taxable distribu- tion" in s.226 . By categorising the trust in relation to separate components of a distribution, s .226A(2) thus determines the extent to which any distribu- tion constitutes a taxable distribution. As the trust is deemed to be a foreign trust in relation to a distribution to the extent that the distribution consists of income, capital profits or capital gains derived before the date on which the election was made, the distribution will be a taxable distribu- tion to the extent that it consists of a distribution of amounts other than corpus or of capital profits or capital gains derived by the trustee : s.226(1) "taxable distribution" definition . Also, as the trust is deemed to be a qualifying trust to the extent that the distribution consists of income, capital profits or capital gains derived by the trustee after the date on which the election was made, the distribu- tion will not be assessable to the beneficiary because distributions from qualifying trusts of amounts which do not constitute beneficiary income are not assessable: s .227(6) . (b) Application of the proviso to s .9 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 5) 198 8 7.23 By the proviso to s .9 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 5) 1988, distributions of income, capital profits or capital gains derived by trustees in income years commencing before 1 April 1988 are not assessable for income tax where the distribution is made after 1 April 1988 . Section 226A(2) applies subject to s.9 of the Amendment Act. Therefore, although s .226A deems the trust to be a foreign trust to the extent that it consists of income, capital profits or capital gains derived before the election was made, the effect of the proviso to s.9 is that the distribution will be a taxable distribution only to the extent that it con- sists of income derived by the trustees in income years commencing on and after 1 April 1988. Section 9 is discussed in Part 3 of this bulletin. (c) Satisfaction of trustee's obligation s 7.24 Section 226A(2)(b) provides that where an election has been made the trustis a qualifying 60 trust to the extent that any distribution consists of income, capital profits or capital gains derived after the date on which the election was made if the trustee's obligations in relation to the trustee income have been satisfied. If the trustee's obliga- tions are not satisfied in the income year in which the election is made or in any subsequent income year, the trust is deemed to be a non-qualifying trust in relation to any distribution made in that income year except to the extent that the distribu- tion consists of amounts derived by the trustee before the date of election. The trust remains a foreign trust to the extent that the distribution consists of income, capital profits or capital gains derived by the trustee before the date on which the election was made. 7.25 If the trustee's obligations are not satisfied the trust is deemed to be a non-qualifying trust with respect to any distributions made in the income year in which the obligations were not satisfied and in any subsequent year. Accordingly, the distribution is a taxable distribution to the extent that it consists of amounts other than beneficiary income or corpus. This is the case even if the amounts distributed were derived in income years during which the trustee's obligations were satisfied, thus providing an incentive to the elector or any other person who is liable to tax on trustee income to continue satisfying the trustee's obliga- tions. There are two exceptions to this rule. First, the trust remains a foreign trust with respect to a distribution to the extent that it consists of in- come, capital profits or capital gains derived by the trustee before the date on which the election was made: s.226A(2)(b) language in parentheses. Second, the distribution will not be a taxable distribution to the extent that it consists of income, capital profits or capital gains derived by the trustees in income years commencing before 1 April 1988: proviso to s .9 Income Tax Amendment Act (No5) 1988. 7.26 The trust will remain a qualifying trust in terms of s .226A(2Xb) if the "trustee's obligations under this Act in respect of the trustee's liability to income tax in respect of the trustee income de- rived by the trustee have been satisfied" . Thus, it is only necessary to establish that the trustee's obligations have been satisfied . It is not necessary that the obligations be satisfied by the trustee personally, by the settlor if the settlor is liable for tax under s .228, or by the person who makes the election in terms of s.226A and s .228(7). (d) Application of s .23 0 7 .27 Section 230(2)(d) provides that where the trust is one to which s .226A applies the ordering rules contained in s.230(1) do not apply to a distribution from the trust except where the trust is deemed to be a non-qualifying trust by s .226A(2)(b). Instead the distribution is deemed to consist of such amounts as reflect the terms of the trust or the terms of the discretion of the trustee. 7.28 Thus, in cases where s .226A(2) applies the constituent elements of a distribution are deter- mined according to the terms of the trust or in terms of the exercise of the trustee's discretion . If the trustee distributes corpus to a beneficiary in exercise of the trustee's discretion, the distribution is treated as a distribution of corpus even if accumulated income remains available for distri- bution by the trustees. This rule does not permit trustees to argue that distributions of income, for example, are distributions of corpus if a distribu- tion of corpus to a particular beneficiary is outside the terms of the trust or outside the terms of the trustee's discretion. 7.29 If the trustee's obligations are not satisfied, and the trust becomes a non-qualifying trust in terms of s .226A(2)(b), the ordering rules in s.230(1) will apply in relation to distributions made in the income year for which the trustee's obligations were first not satisfied and in subsequent years. Consequenceof not making an election: s.226A(3), s.228 Trustee income 7.30 If no election is made to pay tax on trustee income the trustee or settlor of the trust may still be liable to tax on trustee income by virtue of s.228 . The rules in s.228 apply both during the period in which an election may be made in accordance with s.226A and after the expiry of that period. The application of s.228 is not sus- pended during the period that an election may be made in accordance with s.226A. The application of ^,.228 is discussed in Part 10 of this bulletin . 7.31 If a settlement is made by the settlor after the settlor becomes resident in New Zealand the settlor and trustee of the trust will be liable to tax on trustee income derived from outside New Zealand from the beginning of the income year in which the settlement was made. In this context, the broad definition of "settlor" set out in s .226, and discussed in Part 6 of this bulletin, applies. 7.32 For example, a person will have made a settlement on a trust after becoming resident in New Zealand if the trustees of a trust settled by the person before becoming resident (the first trust) themselves settle a further trust (in their capacity as trustees of the first trust) after the date on which the settlor became resident: s.226(5). This could occur, for example, if the first trust contained a provision for the trustees to settle 61 income on a subtrust in circumstances where the settlement does not constitute beneficiary income of a beneficiary. If, after the date on which the settlor became resident, the trustees of the first trust exercised the power to settle income on a subtrust the settlor of the first trust would be deemed to have made a settlement on the subtrust after the date on which the settlor became resi- dent. Consequently, the settlor would be liable to tax on the trustee income of the subtrust in accor- dance with s .228 even though no election had been made to pay tax on trustee income. Distributions (a) Treatment of distribution s 7.33 Section 226A(3) provides that if an election is not made in accordance with s .226A(1) the trust is deemed to be a foreign trust for the purpose of the definition of "taxable distribution" in s.226 to the extent that any distribution from the trust consists of income, capital profits or capital gains derived by the trustee before the "election expiry date" . The election expiry date is 12 months from the later of 31 May 1989 or the day on which the sett lor became resident in New Zealand. The trust is deemed to be a non-qualifying trust to the extent that the distribution consists of income, capital profits or capital gains derived by the trustee after the election expiry date . 7.34 As with s.226A(2), the rules in s.226A(3) apply for the purpose of the definition of "taxable distribution" in s.226. The rules are therefore relevant in determining the extent to which a distribution from a trust of the type described in s.226A is a taxable distribution if an election to pay tax on trustee income is not made in accor- dance with s.226A and s.228(7). The trust is deemed to be a foreign trust to the extent that the distribution consists of income, capital profits and capital gains derived by the trustee before the election expiry date : s .226A(3)(a). In the context of the "taxable distribution" definition, this means that the portion of the distribution in relation to which the trust is deemed by s.226A(3)(a) to be a foreign trust is a taxable distribution to the extent that it consists of amounts other than corpus, capital profits and capital gains and to the extent that it does not constitute beneficiary income. 7.35 Section 226A(3)(b) provides that the trust isdeemedto be a non-qualifying trust to the extent to which any distribution from the trust consists of income, capital profits or capital gains derived by the trustee after the election expiry date. Thus, the portion of the distribution in relation to which the trust is deemed to be a non- qualifying trust is a taxable distribution to the extent that it consists of amounts other than corpus or beneficiary income. (b) Application of the proviso to s.9 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No5)1988 7.36 As discussed in Part 3 of this bulletin, the proviso to s.9 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No5)1988 provides that distributions of income, capital profits or capital gains derived in income years commencing before 1 April 1988 are not assessable where the distribution is made after 1 April 1988.In the context of s.226A(3) this means that a distribution in relation to which the trust is deemed to be a foreign trust is not assessable to the extent that it consists of income, capital profits or capital gains derived in income years com- mencing be fore 1 April 1988. (c) Applicationof s.230 7.37If an election is not made in accordance with s.226A and s.228(7) the ordering rules in s.230(1) will generally apply to determine the constituent elements of a distribution from the trust. The exceptions to the application of s.230(1), set out in s .230(2), are discussed in Part 13 of this bulletin. Income derivedbefore election or before election expiry date: s.226A(4 ) 7.38 Where an election is made to pay tax on trustee income the trust is deemed to be a foreign trust to the extent that any distribution consists of income, capital profits or capital gains derived by the trustee before the date on which an election was made and a qualifying trust to the extent that the distribution consists of amounts derived by the trustee after that date: s.226A(2). If an election is not made the trust is deemed to be a foreign trust to the extent that any distribution consists of income, capital profits or capital gains derived by the trustees before the election expiry date and a non-qualifying trust to the extent that any distribu- tion consists of amounts derived by the trustee after that date: s.226A(3). Thus, where an election is made during an income year, or where the election expiry date falls within an income year, it will be necessary to calculate the portion of the income, capital profits or capital gains derived by the trustees before the election or before the election expiry date. This calculation is governed by the rules in s.226A(4). 7.39 Section 226A(4) provides two methods for calculating the income, capital profits or capital gains derived by the trustees during the portion of the income year falling before the date of election orbe fore the election expiry date. Any trustee, settlor or beneficiary who is liable to pay tax on the trustee income of the trust can choose which of these methods they wish to apply . 62 7 .40 The first method is a time-based appor- tionment. Under this method the income, capital profits or capital gains derived during the entire income year are multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the income year falling before the date of election or before the election expiry date and the denomina- tor of which is 365 . In algebraic terms theincome, capital profits or capital gains derived before the date of election or before the election expiry date is calculated as follows : ax b 365 where: a is the income, capital profits or capital gains derived by the trustee during the income year in which the election is made or in which the election expiry date falls; and b is the number of days in the income year falling before the day on which the elec- tion is made or before the election expiry date. 7.41 In using this method it is necessary to apply the formula separately to the income de- rived by thetrusteesand to the capital profits or capital gains derived by the trustees. For example, if during the relevant income year the trustees derived $10,000 income and $22,000 capital profits or capital gains, and there were 100 days in the incomeyearbefore the election was made, the income and capital profits or gains would be calculated as follows: (i) income \_ $2,740$10,000 x 36 5 (ii) capital profits or capital gains $22,000 x ~ = $6,027 7.42 The second method is based on the in- come, capital profits or capital gains actually derived by the trustees. Under this method the trustee, settlor or beneficiary who is liable to tax on trustee income calculates the income, capital profits or capital gains which were actually derived by the trustees before the day on which the election was made or before the election expiry date. Section 227Aelections 7.43 A further election procedure was provided by s .227A in relation to trusts first settled on or before 17 December 1987. If, on or before 31 May 1989, any settlor, trustee or beneficiary of such a trust made an election to pay tax on trustee income derived in income years commencing on and after 1 April 1988 all trustee income derived from outside New Zealand, or derived from New Zealand only as non-resident withholding income, in income years commencing before 1 April 1988 is deemed to have been liable to New Zealand income tax and the trustee's obliga ti ons in re la tion to that liability are deemed to have been satisfied . This means that the trust is likely to satisfy the requirements of the definition of "qualifying trust" in s .226, provided that the trustee's obligations in relation to New Zealand source income other than non-resident withholding income have been satisfied and that the trustee's obligations in relation to all trustee income derived after the income year commencing on 1 April1988have been satisfied. 7.44 A trust of the type described in s.226A may also fall within the termsofs.227A. Thus, if a settlor of a trust which was first settled on or before 17 December 1987 becomes resident in New Zealand after that date, and before 31 May 1989, an election could have been made under either s .226A or s .227A. (If the settlor becomes resident after 31 May 1989 it will be too late for any person associated with the trust to make a s.227A elec- tion). The effect of making a s .227A election as opposed to a s.226A election is as follows: (i) trustee income • s.227A election:elector liable for tax on trustee income derived in income years commencing on and after 1 April 1988; • s.226A election: elector liable for tax on trustee income derived after the date of election (s.228(7)); (ii) distributions • s .227A election : distributions which constitute beneficiary income assess- able; distributions of amounts other than beneficiary income not assess- able if all of the trustee's obligations in relation to the trustee income continue to be satisfied (s.227(6)); • s.226A election: distributions which constitute beneficiary income assess- able; distributions of amounts other than beneficiary income assessable to the extent that the trust is a foreign trust in relation to the distribution and the distribution consists of amounts other than corpus or capital profits or gains derived by the trus- 63 Examples tees in incomeyears commencing before 1 April1988(s.9 Income Tax Amendment Act (No 5) 1988). 7.45 The following examples illustrate the ap- plication of s.226A to a given fact pattern in the three circumstances contemplated by that section: i.e., where an election is made to pay tax on trustee income and the trustee's obligations are satisfied; where an election is made but the trustee's obliga- tions are not satisfied ; and where no election is made . To simplify the examples it is assumed that the trust was first settled on 1 June 1988. This means that the trustees derived no income or capital profits or gains in income years ending before 1 April1988.Consequently, the proviso to s.9 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 5) 1988 is not relevant to the examples. Example 9: Election made and trustee's obligations satisfied Facts: (i) A settles $100,000 on trust on 1 June 1988 when A is resident in Hong Kong . The trustees are all resident in Hong Kong. Two members of A's family, B and C, are beneficiaries of the trust. The trustees have a discretion to pay income or capital to B and C. No further settlement is made on the trust after 1 June 1988. (ii) A becomes resident in New Zealand on 1 May 1991. A had not previously been resident in New Zealand. B and C also become resident in New Zealand on 1 May 1991 . (iii) On 1 November 1991 A makes an election in accordancewith s.226A and s.228(7) to pay tax ontrustee income. (iv) All of the income derived by the trustees is derived from outside New Zealand. (v) The amounts derived and accumulated by the trustees are as follows: Year EndingIncome $Capital Gains$ 31 March 1989 10,0005,000 31 March 199011,000 5,000 31 March 1991 13,0002,000 31 March 1992 8,0003,000 31 March 1993 10,0003,000 (vi) On 1 April 1993 the trustees make distri- butions to B of $50,000 and to C of $30,000. A had paid tax on the trustee income derived between the date of election an d 1 April 1993. B and C were resident in New Zealand on 1 April 1993. Result: (a) entitlement to make election A is entitled to make an election in accordance with s.226A and s.228(7) because A is a natural person who became resident in New Zealand after 17 December 1987 and the trust would have been a foreign trust in relation to a distri- bution made on 30 April 1991, the day before A became resident . The trust would have been a foreign trust in relation to such a distribution because no settlor of the trust had been resident in New Zealand from the date on which the trust was first settled, 1 June 1988, unti l 30 April 1991. As beneficiaries of the trust, B and C are also entitled to make an election in accordance with s.226A and s.228(7). The Hong Kong trustees are also entitled to make an election. The election must be made within 12 months of the later of the day on which the settlor became resident or 31 May 1989. A became resident on 1 May 1991. Thus the election may be made at any time on or before 1 May 1992. A's election on 1 November 1991 is therefore within time. (b) Trustee income Before A became resident in New Zealand the trustee income derived by the trustees was not liable to New Zealand tax because no settlor of the trust was resident here and the income was all derived from outside New Zealand: s.228. After A became resident A is not liable to tax on trustee income in the absence of a s.226A election by A because A was not resident in New Zealand when the settlement was made on the trust : s .228(5)(b) . Further, the trustees are not liable for tax on the trustee income derived in the income year during which A became resident and in subsequent income years because the trustees are resident outside New Zealand at all times during those income years and the settlor was not resident in New Zea- land at the time of settlement:s.228(6) . The effect of the election is that A is liable to pay tax on the trustee income derived from the date of election . No method is prescribed for calculating the income derived in the year of 64 election after the date on which the election is made. However, as indicated in paragraph 7 .20 above either a time-based apportionment or a calculation based on income actually derived will be accepted . Assuming that a time-based apportionment is made the trustee income in respect of which A is liable for tax is as follows : Year ending Trustee income 31 March 1992 $8,000 x ~ = $3,31 0 31 March 199 3 (note : the $10,000 income derived by the trustees in the income year ending 31 March 1993 is distributed to B as beneficiary income.) (c) Distributions The trust is a discretionary trust and an election to pay tax on trustee income has been made in accor- dance with s.226A and s.228(7) . Consequently, by s.230(2) the ordering rules in s .230(1) do not apply in relation to the distributions to B and C and the distributions are deemed to reflect the terms of the exer- cise of the trustees' discretion . If it is assumed that B is an income beneficiary (entitled only to distributions of income), that C is an income and capital beneficiary, and that the trustees exercised their discretion to pay capital to C, the treatment of the distributions is as follows : - $50,000 distribution toB The distribution is deemed to consist of a distribution of the income derived in the income years ending on 31 March 1989 to 31 March 1993. The treatment of the distribution is as follows: Amount SourceTreatment $32,000 (1)Income years ending 31 March Assessable as a taxable distribution from a foreign 1989, 1990 and 1991trust: s. 226A(2)(a) $ 8,000Income year ending March 1992Portion derived before INovember 1991 election date assessable as taxable distribution from foreign trust: 21 4 i.e.,$8,000 x = $4,69 0 365 remaining $3,310 not assessable as constitutes distribution of income from qualifying trust which does not constitute beneficiary income : s. 226A(2); s. 227(6) $10,000Income year ending 31 March 1993 Assessable as beneficiary income notes : (1) The $32,000 is the sum of the income derived in the income years ending 31 March 1991 and 1992 and $8,000 of the income derived in the income year ending 31 March 1989 . The distributionisthus assessable to B to the following extent: Assessable incom e - taxable distribution $36,690 - beneficiary income 10,000 Total $46,690 The taxable distribution of $36,690 is from a foreign trust . Therefore, it is taxable at B's normal marginal rates. 65 - $30,000 distribution toC The trustees exercise their discretion to distribute capital to C . The distribution thus consists of the $18,000 capital gains derived by the trustees in the income years from 31 March 1989 to 31 March 1993 and $12,000 corpus. The treatment of the distribution is as follows : AmountSourceTreatmen t $12,000Capital gains derived in income Not assessable as constitutes a distribution of a capital years ending 31 March 1989, 1990 profit or gain from a foreign trust and 1991 $ 3,000Capital gains derived in income year Portion derived before election not assessable: ending March 1992 i.e.,$3,000 x 214. $1'759 365 (Distribution of capital gain from a foreign trust); remaining $1,241 not assessable as constitutes a distribution from a qualifying trust of an amount other than beneficiary income $ 3,000Capital gains derived in income year Not assessable: distribution from a qualifying trust of an ending 31 March 1993 amount other than beneficiary income ~ $12,000Corpus Not assessable: distributions of corpus not assessable The result is that no portion of the $30,000 distribution is taxable . Example 10: Election made but trustee's obliga- tions not satisfied Facts : As in Example 9, except that the trus- tee's obligations are not satisfied in the income year ending 31 March 1993 . Result: (a) Trustee income The trustee income derived in the income year ending 31 March 1992 remains liable for tax as in Example 9 . That is, there is no liability to tax in respect of the trustee income derived before the election to pay tax on trustee income was made (i.e., before 1 November 1991); but the settlor is liable to tax on trustee income derived after that date (i.e., $3,310). The settlor is liable to tax on trustee income derived in all subsequent income years. (b) Distributions The distributions to B andC(made o n 1 April1993)are in an income year subse- quent to the income yearin which the trustee's obligations are not satisfied. Therefore, the trust is deemed to be a non- qualifying trust in relation to the distribu- tions, except to the extent that they consist of amounts derived by the trustees before the election was made to pay tax on trustee income, and s.230(1) applies. The distributions are contemporaneous. No rules are provided as to how contempora- neous distributions are to be ordered in terms of s.230(1). Thus, the characterisa- tion of contemporaneous distributions will generally be for the trustee to decide, subject to the rules in s.230 governing the order in which income, capital profits and corpus are deemed to be distributed. In this case it is assumed that the trustee decides to allocate $50,000 of the income to B. The remaining $2,000 of the income is allocated to C because s .230(1) treats all income as having been distributed before capital profits or gains are distributed. By s .226A(2)(b), any distributions made in the income year in which the trustee's obligations are not satisfied and in any subsequent income year are treated as distributions from a non-qualifying trust except to the extent that they consist of amounts derived before the day on which the election was made to pay tax on trustee income. Further, by s.230(2)(d) the s.230 ordering rules apply in relation to any such distribution. The treatment of thedistributions is as follows: - $50,000 distribution toB The trustee's discretion to pay out earlier years' income is overridden by s .230(1) . Thus, in terms of s .230(1) current years' income must be paid out first and then preceding years' income. In this case none 66 of the income is derived in the incomeyearin which the distribution is made. The treatment of the income is therefore determined according to s.230(1)(b) . That provision does not specify that preced- ing years' income must be regarded as having been distributed in any particular order and it is assumed that the trustees distribute $50,000 of the income to B and the remaining $2,000 of the income to C. If the later years' income is distributed to B the distribution to B consists of: Amount Source Treatment $32,000Income derived in income years Assessable as taxable distribution from foreign trust: ending 31 March 1989, 1990 and s. 226A(2)(a) 1991 $ 8,000Income derived in income year Portion derived before election assessable as taxable ending March 1992 distribution from foreign trust: i.e.,$8,000 x3 $4,690 365 remaining $3,310 assessable as a taxable distribution from a non-qualifying trust at 45%: s. 226A(2)(b), s.227(4) $10,000Income derived in income yearAssessable as beneficiary income as paid or applied ending 31 March 1993 within 6 months from end of incomeyear The distributionis taxable asfollows: taxable distribution - from foreign trust - from non-qualifying trust beneficiary income $36,690 $3,310 $10,000 notes: (1) assessable at ordinary rates (2) assessable at 45% - $30,000 distribution toC The distributions to B and C are contemporaneous. Therefore, the distribution to C cannot consist of amounts which are deemed to have been contemporaneously distributed to B. Consequently, C is deemed to receive $2,000 of the income derived in the income year ending 31 March 1989, the capital gains of $18,000 derived in the income years ending 31 March 1989 to 31 March 1993 and corpus of $10,000. The following treatment results: Amount SourceTreatment $ 2,000Income derived in income year Assessable as taxable distribution from foreign trust ending 31 March 1989 $12,000Capital gains derived in incomeNot assessable as constitutes a distribution of capital years ending 31 March 1989, 1990 gains from a foreign trust and 1991 $ 3,000 Capital gain derived in income year Not assessable to extent derived before election as ending 31 March 1992 constitutes distribution of capital gain from foreign trust i.e.,$3,000 x214~$1'759 3 6 5 remaining $1,241 assessable as a taxable distribution from a non-qualifying trust at 45%: s 226A(2), s227(4) $ 3,000Capital gain derived in income yearAssessable as taxable distribution from non-qualifying ending 31 March 1993 trust at 45 % $10,000Corpus settled on 1 June 1988Not assessable 67 The distribution is thus taxable as follows: taxable distribution - fromforeign trust$2,0000) -from non-qualifying trust$4,241 (2) Notes:(1) Assessable at ordinaryrates (2) Assessable at 45% Example11: No election to y ay tax on trustee incom e Facts : Same as Example 9 except that no election is made to paytax on trustee income. Result : (a) Trustee income As no election has been made the trustee income is not liable to tax. By s.228(6), the trustee is not liable for tax on trustee income because the trustee is resident outside New Zealand at all times during the income years in question and A, the settler, was not resident in New Zealand at the time of any settle- ment on the trust. A is not liable for tax on trustee income because A was resident outside New Zealand when the trust was settled : s .228(5)(b). (b) Distributions By s .226A(3), the trust is deemed to be a foreign trust to the extent to which any distribution consistsof income, capital profits or capital gains derived before the election expiry date (i.e., before 1 May 1992) and a non-qualifyingtrust to the extent that the distribution consists of income, capital profits and capital gains derived after that date. The ordering rules in s .230(1) apply in determining the constituent elements of the distribution. The distributions to B andC are contemporaneous and it is assumed that the trustees treat $50,000 of the income as having been distributed to B and the remaining $2,000 as having been distributed to C . - $50,000 Distribution toB Amount SourceTreatment $32,000Income derived in income yearsAssessable as taxable distribution from foreign trust: ending 31 March 1989, 1990 ands 226A(3)(a) 1991 $ 8,000(1)Income derived in income year Assessable as taxable distribution from foreign trust ending 31 March 1992 $10,000(2)Income derived in income year Assessable as beneficiary income: paid or applied ending 31 March 1993 within 6 months after and of income yea r Notes: (1) By s.226A(1) the election expiry date is 12 months from the later of 31 May 1989 or the date on which the settler became resident in New Zealand. The settler became resident in New Zealand on 1 May 1991. Thus, the election expiry date is 1 May 1992 and pursuant to s.226A(3) a distribution of income derived before the election expiry date is treated as a distribution from a foreign trust. The distribution of the $8,000 income derived in the income year ending 31 March 1992 is therefore a distribution from a foreign trust. (2) The distribution of the $10,000 income derived in the income yearending 31 March 1993 is beneficiary income because it constitutes income paid or applied to the beneficiary within 6 months after the income year in which it was derived . If the distribution had been made after that 6 month period it would have been necessary to apportion the income to the periods falling before and after the election expiry date, l May 1992 . To the extent that the distribution consisted of income derived before the election expiry date it would bea 68 taxable distribution from a foreign trust, and to the extent that it consisted of income derived after that date it would consist of a taxable distribution from a non-qualifying trust. The tax treatment of the distribution is: Taxable distribution from foreign trust $40,000 Beneficiary income $10,000 - $30,000 Distribution toC Amount SourceTreatment $ 2,000Income derived in income year Assessable as taxable distribution from foreign trust: ending 31 March 1989 s 226A(3)(b) $15,000Capital gains derived in income Not assessable as distribution of capital gains from years ending 31 March 1989 toforeign trust 1992 $ 3,000 Capital gain derived in income year Portion derived before election expiry date not assess- ending 31 March 1993 able as distribution of capital gains from foreign trust: 30 i.e.,$3,000 x-$246.57 365 Portion derived after election expiry date assessable as taxable distribution from non-qualifying trust: $3,000 - $246.57 = $2,753.43 $10,000Corpus settled on 1 June 1988Not assessable The resultis as follows: Taxable distribution - from foreign trus t - from non-qualifying trust Notes: (1) Assessable at normal rates (2) Assessable at 45% $2,000 (1) $2,753 (2) 69 PART 8: INCOME ASSESSABLE TO BENEFICIARIES Overview of s.227 8.1 In outline, s.227(1) requires beneficiaries to include beneficiary income and taxable distribu- tions in their assessable income. By s.227(2), the trustee is liable to income tax as agent of the beneficiary in relation to the beneficiary income and taxable distributions derived by the benefici- ary . An anti-avoidance rule, set out in s.227(3), provides that any person who becomes resident in New Zealand within 5 years of having ceased to be resident is deemed to have derived any beneficiary income and taxable distributions derived from a foreign or non-qualifying trust during the period of non-residence on the day on which that person again becomes resident in New Zealand. Section 227(4) sets out the treatment of taxable distribu- tions from non-qualifying trusts. Another anti- avoidance rule is contained in s .227(5) . This provi- sion is aimed at arrangements whereby property or services are transferred or made available to a person other than a beneficiary in circumstances where the intent and application of s.227 is de- feated. By s.227(6), distributions from a qualifying trust which do not consist of beneficiary income are not assessable for income tax . Finally, s.227(7) sets out the treatment of beneficiary income where a trustee furnishes a return of income under s.15 for an accounting year ending with an annual balance date other than 31 March . Assessable income :s.227(1) Inclusion ofbeneficiaryincome and taxable distributionsWassessable incom e (a) Amounts included in assessable incom e 8.2 Section 227(1) provides that the assessable income of any person in any income year includes any beneficiary income and any taxable distribu- tions derived by that person in that incomeyear. Income is beneficiary income where it vests abso- lutely in interest in the beneficiary during the same income year in which it is derived by the trustee or if itis paid or applied to or for the benefit of the beneficiary during that income year or within six months thereafter. In the case of a fore ign trust, a distribution is a taxable distribution to the extent that it does not constitute beneficiary income and does not consist of capital profits or gains realised by the trustee or corpus (unless the capital profit or gain is generated in a transaction with an associ- ated person : s .226(11)). In the case of a non-qualify- ing trust, a distribution is a taxable distribution to the extent that it does not constitute beneficiary income and does not consist of corpus. (b) Derivation of beneficiary income and taxable distributions 8 .3 Beneficiary income and taxable distributions are included in assessable income when "derived" by the beneficiary . Income is generally derived by a person when it has been received or when it has become due and payable. Section 75 extends the general concept of derivation. Pursuant to that section income is deemed to have been derived by a person if it has been "credited in account, or reinvested, or accumulated, or capitalised ... or otherwise dealt with in \[the person's\] interest or on \[the person's\] behalf" even if it has not been paid to or received by the person . Income which falls within the beneficiary income and taxable distribu- tion definitions will be income "derived" by the beneficiary in accordance with the ordinary mean- ing of that term or in accordance with s.75. (c) Dual derivation of beneficiary incom e 8 .4 Under the previous trust taxation regime income derived by a trustee which was also derived by a beneficiary entitled in possession, or who was deemed to be entitled in possession, to the receipt of the income was assessable to the beneficiary and to the trustee as agent for the beneficiary. Income which was derived by the trustee which was not also income derived by a beneficiary entitled in possession, or who was deemed to be entitled in possession to the income, was assessable to the trustee as if the trustee were beneficially entitled to the receipt of the income. The scheme of the legislation was therefore that income derived by a trustee was assessable to the trustee as agent for the beneficiary or as if the trustee were beneficially entitled to the income, depending upon whether or not there was a beneficiary entitled in possession, or who was deemed to be entitled in possession, to the income. In cases where the income was derived by a trustee and there was a beneficiary who was entitled or who was deemed to be entitled in possession to the receipt of the income it was said that there was a dual derivation of the income by the trustee and the beneficiary. 8 .5 The scheme of the legislation with respect to income derived by a trustee during an income year in circumstances that the beneficiary is also liable for tax on the income in respect of that income year is unchanged. All trust income is derived first by the trustee. If during the income year that the income is derived by the trustee the income vests absolutely in interest in the beneficiary, or during that income year or within six months thereafter the income is paid or applied to or for the benefit of the beneficiary, the income is derived by the beneficiary as beneficiary income . By s.227 the 70 beneficiary is liable for income tax in respect of that income and the trustee is liable for income tax in respect of that income as agent for the benefici- ary. If the income derived by the beneficiary is not beneficiary income the trustee is liable for tax in respect of the income (referred to as "trustee income") as if the trustee were beneficially entitled to the income: s.228. The treatment of income derived by trustees in this context is therefore unchanged from the treatment under the previous trust regime: that is, there is dual derivation of beneficiary income by the trustee and beneficiary. Characterisation of beneficiary income and taxable distributions 8 .6 Section 227(1) provides that beneficiary income is included in assessable income . This could be taken to mean that beneficiary income is a category of assessable income which is separate from the other categories of assessable income listed in s .65(2). However, the correct interpreta- tion is that the trust regime is silent on the question of characterisation of trustee income and benefici- ary income and that income derived by trustees retains the character which it possessed on deriva- tion by the trustees, whether the income is classi- fied as trustee income or beneficiary income. 8.7 Authority for the proposition that income retains its character as it is passed through to the beneficiary is provided byArcher-Shee v Baker \[1927\] AC 844 and Syme v Webb \[1914\] AC 1013. Also, in general terms the scheme of the trust legislation is that there is only one trust income rather than a separate income for trustee and beneficiary. A change in the character of income could only be assumed if the income derived by the trustee and beneficiary was separate. It is also significant in this context that under the imputa- tion and dividend withholding payment regimes it is assumed that dividends flow througF. to benefi- ciaries as dividends, and provision is made for im- putation credits and dividend withholding pay- ment credits to be allocated to such dividends: s.394ZD. 8 .8 The only situation where the one income principle does not apply is in the case of a distribu- tion of an amount which does not constitute bene- ficiary income from a foreign trust or a non-quali- fying trust . With respect to these distributions the legislation does not assume that there is only one trust income and income derived by the trustee in one year may be treated as being derived by the beneficiary in a later year if distributed in the later year as a taxable distribution. As the one income principle does not apply in relation to taxable distributions such distributions constitute a sepa- rate category of income in the beneficiary's hands. Accordingly, taxabledistributions arenot charac- terised according to the character in thetrustee's hands of the amountsfrom which the distributions are made. Residence and source 8.9 Section 227(1) requires beneficiaries to include beneficiary income in their assessable income. This provision does not override the normal rules as to residence and source of income. Consequently, by s.242 resident beneficiaries are assessable for income tax on beneficiary income derived from both within and outside New Zea- land and non-resident beneficiaries are assessable for income tax only on beneficiary income derived from New Zealand. 8.10 By s.243(2)(n) income derived by a benefici- ary is derived from New Zealand so far as the "income of the trust fund is derived from New Zealand". This is taken to mean that beneficiary income is derived from New Zealand if the trustee derived the income which constitutes the benefici- ary income from New Zealand. For example, if in a particular income year the trustee derives interest and dividends from New Zealand in terms of s.243(2)(m) and s.243(2)(g), and that income constitutes beneficiary income because it vests absolutely in interest in the beneficiary during that income year, then the beneficiary income will be derived from New Zealand. In effect, beneficiary income is sourced according to the source of the income when derived by the trustee. 8.11 In this context the discussion above of the dual derivation of beneficiary income is relevant. It has been argued that in contrast to the position under the previous trust regime there is no dual derivation of beneficiary income under the new trust regime and that therefore income derived by a beneficiary is not income of the trust fund in terms of s .243(2)(n). Consequently, it is argued, it can be inferred that beneficiary income derived by a non-resident beneficiary cannot be sourced in New Zealand pursuant to s .243(2)(n). This inter- pretation is based on the incorrect premise that there is no dual derivation of beneficiary income . It is quite clear from the beneficiary income defini- tion that all trust income is first derived by the trustee and that such income is treated as being derived also by the beneficiary if it is beneficiary income . Therefore, beneficiary income does repre- sent income of the trust fund in terms of s.243(2)(n) because it is income which has first been derived by the trustee . Even if this interpretation were incorrect beneficiary income could be sourced in New Zealand under the other paragraphs of s .243(2) because, as discussed above, income retains its character as it is passed through as beneficiary income. 71 8 .12 Where a beneficiary who is not resident in New Zealand derives New Zealand source benefi- ciary income there will be a non-resident with- holding tax liability if the income is non-resident withholding income as defined in s.310(2). By s.312 a liability to deduct non-resident withholding tax arises when a person makes a payment of non- resident withholding income. In this context it is considered that the definition of "payment" in s .309 is sufficiently wide to cover transactions which constitute the vesting or payment or appli- cation of income in terms of the beneficiary income definition. 8 .13 Where a person makes a payment of non- resident withholding income to a non-resident trustee of a trust, and the income is beneficiary income in relation to the trust, the person will be required to deduct non-resident withholding tax. If a person makes a payment of interest, dividends or royalties to a resident trustee of a trust and the income is beneficiary income of a non-resident beneficiary, the resident trustee will be required to deduct non-resident withholding tax. However, in this latter situation it would also be proper for the trustee to arrange for the person paying the inter- est, dividends or royalties to make the payment directly to the beneficiary and to deduct non- resident withholding tax from the payment. Income year (a) Inclusion of amounts derived during the income year 8 .14 Section 227(1) provides that the assessable income of any person in any "income year" in- cludes any beneficiary income and any taxable distributions derived by that person "in that income year" . The question arises as to how this requirement operates where, pursuant to s .15, the trustee or beneficiary furnishes returns to a balance date other than 31 March . 8.15 Section 15 provides that if instead of furnish- ing a return to a year ending with 31 March a taxpayer furnishes a return for the year ending with the annual balance date of the taxpayer's accounts the income derived during the year ending with the annual balance of the taxpayer's accounts is deemed to have been derived during the year ending with the 31 March nearest to the annual balance date. The effect of this rule is that if the taxpayer returns income to a balance date ending between 1 April and 30 September the income derived during the accounting year ending on the balance date is deemed to have been de- rived in the year ending on the preceding 31 March . On the other hand if the taxpayer returns income to a balance date ending after 30 Septem- ber the income derived during the accounting year ending on the balance date is deemed to have been derived in the year ending on the next 31 March. (b) Beneficiary retu rn s income to balance date otherthan 31 March 8 .16 There is no special rule governing the situation where a beneficiary returns income to a balance date other than 31 March. Beneficiary income and taxable distributions derived by the beneficiary during the accounting year ending with a balance date other than 31 March are therefore deemed to have been derived in the income year ending with either the preceding 31 March or the succeeding 31 March, depending on whether the balance date ends before or after 30 September. For example, if the beneficiary returns income to a balance date ending on 30 June the beneficiary income and taxable distributions derived during the accounting year ending 30 June are deemed to have been derived in the income year ending on the 31 March preceding the 30 June. 8.17 By s.226(1), beneficiary income is defined in relation to any person who is a beneficiary of a trust for any income year as being income derived during "that income year" by the trustee which during "that income year" vests absolutely in interest in the beneficiary or which is paid or applied to or for the benefit of the beneficiary during or within 6 months after the end of "that income year" . The "income year" referred to in the definition is that of the trustee. Thus, the question is whether the income vests absolutely in interest in the beneficiary in the income year in which it was derived by the trustee or is paid to or applied for the benefit of the beneficiary during or within six months after that income year. If this requirement is satisfied the income will be beneficiary income although it may not be assessable to the beneficiary in the same income year because the beneficiary returns income to a balance date other than 31 March . 8.18 Assume, for example, that the trustee re- turns income to the year ending 31 March while the beneficiary returns income to the year ending 31 October . If income derived by the trustee in the year ending 31 March 1990 vests absolutely in interest in the beneficiary on 31 March 1990 the effect of s.15 is that the income is deemed to have been derived by the beneficiary in the income year ending 31 March 1991, that being the closest 31 March to the beneficiary's 31 October 1990 balance date . From the trustee's perspective the income will be beneficiary income in relation to the in- come year ending 31 March 1990 because it vests 72 absolutely in the beneficiary in that income year. The income is thus beneficiary income of the bene- ficiary, althoughit is not assessableto the benefici- ary until the following income year ending on 31 March 1991. (c) Trustee returns income to balance date other than 31 Marc h 8.19 Section 227(7) provides that if a trustee furnishes a return under s.15 for an accounting year ending withan annualbalance date other than 31 March, and any income derived by the trustee in that accounting year is also beneficiary income during that accounting year, the benefici- ary is deemed to have derived the beneficiary income during the same income year as that during which the trustee is deemed to have de- rived the income pursuant to s.15. 8 .20 By way of example, if the trustee furnishes a return of income to an annual balance date of 31 October income derived by the trustee during the accounting period ending 31 October 1990 which is also income derived by the beneficiary during the period ending 31 October 1990 will be beneficiary income for the income year ending 31 March 1991. Similarly, if the trustee furnishes a return of income to an annual balance date of 31 July, income derived by the trustee during the account- ing period ending 31 July 1990 which is also income derived by the beneficiary during the period ending 31 July 1990 will be beneficiary income for the income year ending 31 March 1990 because pursuant to s.15 the trustee is deemed to have derived the income during the year ending 31 March 1990. 8.21 The definition of "beneficiary income" in s.226(1) refers to income that vests absolutely in interest in the beneficiary during the "income yeaf" in which it was derived by the trustee or that is paid or applied during that income year or within six months thereafter. Where pursuant to s.15 the trustee furnishes a return of income to a balance date other than 31 March the question arises whether the paid or applied limb of the beneficiary income definition is satisfied if the payment or application is made during or within six months after the income year or during or within six months after the trustee's accounting year. Although s .15 does not change the trustee's income year, but rather only deems income de- rived to the balance date of the trustee's account- ing year to be derived in the income year ending on the preceding or the succeeding 31 March, it is considered that the paid or applied limb is satis- fied if a payment or application is made up to six months from the end of the accounting year to which returns are furnished by the trustee in accordance with s.15. This interpretation is consis- tent with the intention of the six month rule in the "beneficiary income" definition and avoids anomalies which could arise if the rule only applied where the payment was made during or within six months after the end of the income year. 8.22Byway of example, if pursuant to s.15 the trustee furnishes a return to 31 October 1990 and a payment or application of income derived in the accountingyear ending on 31 October 1990 is made to a beneficiary on 15 April 1991 the income thus paid or applied will be income derived by the beneficiary during the same accounting year in which it was derived by the trustee. Consequently, pursuant to s.227(7) the income will be beneficiary income for the income year ending 31 March 1991. Similarly, if pursuant to s.15 the trustee furnishes a return to 31 July 1990 and a payment or applica- tion of income derived by the trustee during the accounting year ending 31 July 1990 is made to a beneficiary on 25 January 1991 the income will be derived by the beneficiary during the accounting year ending 31 July 1990. Therefore, in terms of s.227(7) the income will be derived by the benefici- ary in the income year ending 31 March 1990. Foreign tax credits (a) Beneficiary income 8.23 In cases where beneficiary income is derived from outsideNew Zealand tax mayhave been paid onthe income to anothercountry. Where the beneficiaryis residentin New Zealanda credit may be allowedagainstNew Zealand tax payable on the beneficiaryincome forthe incometax paid to the other country on that income. There are no special rules governing credits for foreign taxes paid on beneficiary income. Thequestion of whether suchcredits are allowed is determined under the general foreign tax credit provisions containedin Part VIII of the Income Tax Act . 8.24 Section 293(2) provides that where a person who is resident in New Zealand derives income from a country or territory outside New Zealand income tax paid in that country or territory on the income is allowed as a credit against income tax payable in New Zealand on that income. The credit is allowed for "income tax" paid to the other country or territory. 8.25 To satisfy s.293(2) the tax paid to the foreign country or territory must be an income tax. "In- come tax" in relation to a country or territory outside New Zealand is defined in s.293(1) as meaning "any tax (whether imposed by a central, state or local government) which, in the opinion of the Commissioner, is substantially of the same 73 nature as income tax imposed under Part IV of this Act or as non-resident withholding tax imposed under Part IX of this Act. .." Additional tax for late payment of tax, and any interest, penalty or additional tax imposed under the penal provisions of the law of the other country or territory, are excluded from the definition of income tax . Amounts deducted from dividends which the person deriving the dividend was not personally liable to pay - that is, taxes other than withholding taxes that are paid in respect of a dividend - are also excluded from the income tax definition . 8 .26 A credit is allowed under s.293(2) only if income tax has been "paid" to the other country or territory in respect of the income. Tax which is payable but which has not been paid is not credit- able. However, s.301 allows a credit in relation to an income year if within four years after the income year in which the income was derived an application is made to the Commissioner for the credit and all information necessary to determine the amount of the credit is supplied . At the Commissioner's discretion an application may be made within a further period beyond the four year period but that further period may not exceed two years . Section 301 thus allows foreign taxes which had not been paid when the New Zealand tax liability in relation to the income arose to be credited later against the New Zealand tax that was paid on the income . For example, assume that a beneficiary derives $100 beneficiary income from Australia in year one, that New Zealand tax of $33 is paid in respect of that income and that income tax which converts to NZ$25 is paid in Australia in respect of the income in year three . In these circumstances s.301 allows the beneficiary to claim a credit against the New Zealand tax paid in year one for the Australian tax paid in year three . To give effect to the claim an amendment to the assessment made in respect of year one will be made in terms of s.23 and s.25. 8 .27 Section 293(2) provides that the foreign tax is credited against the income tax payable in New Zealand in respect of the income. The amount of New Zealand tax payable in respect of the foreign source beneficiary income is determined in accor- dance with s.306. By s .306(2) the calculation is made by apportioning to the foreign source benefi- ciary income the portion of the income tax payable on the taxable income of the beneficiary which represents the same proportion that the foreign source beneficiary income from a particular source bears to the beneficiary's total assessable income. For example, if during the income year ending 31 March 1990 an individual derives a$50,000 salary from New Zealand and $5,000 beneficiary income from Australia the New Zealand income tax payable inrespectof the beneficiaryincome is calculatedas follows: - tax on $55,000 $30,875 x 24% = $7,410 $24,125 x33%=$7,961 $15,371 - tax on $5,000 beneficiary income $15,371 x 5-000 = $1,39 7 55,000 8.28 If Australian income tax which converts to NZ$1,250 was paid in respect of the $5,000 benefi- ciary income the beneficiary would be allowed to credit the $1,250 against the New Zealand tax of $1,397 paid in respect of the beneficiary income . In this context it should be noted that by s .304 the amount of the credit is limited to the amount of the New Zealand tax payable in respect of the income. Therefore, if in the example the Australian tax was NZ$1,500 the credit would have been limited to $1,397. (b) Taxable distributions 8.29 Section 293(2B) provides that where a resident beneficiary derives a taxable distribution a credit against New Zealand income tax payable in respect of the taxable distribution is allowed only for tax paid on the taxable distribution that is of substantially the same nature as non-resident withholding tax imposed under Part IX of the Income Tax Act . That is, a credit is allowed only for non-resident withholding taxes paid in relation to the taxable distribution. A credit is not allowed for tax paid on the income and capital gains from which the taxable distribution is made . For ex- ample, if the trustee of a non-qualifying trust derived income in year 1 of $100 and paid $10 income tax on the income, and in year 3 the trustee distributed the net income of $90 to a resident beneficiary, no credit would be allowed to the beneficiary for the $10 tax paid in respect of the income from which the distribution was made. 8 .30 The amount of the credit against income tax payable in relation to the taxable distribution is calculated in accordance with the following formula: axb c where - a is the tax that qualifies for a credit under s.293(2B) (i.e., the tax paid in respect of the taxable distribution that is of substantially the same nature as non-residen t withholding tax imposed under Part IX) ; 74 b is the amount of the taxable distribution including the tax that qualifies for a credit under s.293(2B); c is the total amount of the distribution (as defined in s.226) including the tax that qualifies for a credit under s.293(2B). 8.31 The objective of the formula is to ensure that foreign withholding tax paid in relation to a non- taxable portion of a distribution is not creditable . For example, if a distribution of $100 is made from a foreign trust and in terms of s .230(1) the distribu- tion consists of $80 income derived by the trustee in prior years while $20 consists of capital gains derived by the trustee, and if a withholding tax of $30 is paid on the distribution, the entire $30 should not be creditable because a portion will have been paid in relation to the non-taxable capital gains componentofthe distribution. By operation of the s.293(2B) formula, the amount which is creditable is calculated as: $30 x 1=$24 If the New Zealand tax payable on the taxable distribution is $26.40 (i .e., $80 x 33%) the net New Zealand tax payable after allowance of the credit is: $26.40 - $24 = $2.40. (c)Taxable distributionsderived bycontrolled foreign companies from non-qualifying trusts 8.32 Where a taxable distribution is derived by a controlled foreign company(CFC) from a non- qualifying trust the taxable distribution is attrib- uted to any person resident in New Zealand with an income interest of 10 percent or greater in the CFC separatelyfrom other income derived by the CFC: s.245J(24), s.245G(5). Theamount thus attributed is subject to tax at the rate applying to taxable dis tr ibu ti ons from non-qualifyingtrusts. Section 245K(6)(a) sets out the rules gove rn ing credits for foreign taxes in these circumstances. 8.33 Section 245K(6)(a) provides that a credit is permitted against New Zealand income tax pay- able on the income attributed under s.245G(5) only for tax paid on that income which is substantially of the same natu re as non-resident withholding tax imposed under Part IX of the IncomeTax Act. The creditable taxes are thus the same as where a taxable distr ibu ti on is de rived directly bya person resident in New Zealand. 8.34 Where the entire distribution to a CFC is not a taxable distribution, for example because a portion of the distribution constitutes corpus, s.245K(6)(b) limits the amount of the foreign non- resident withholding tax that is available for cred- iting to the portion which is attributable to the taxable distribution component of the distribution. The formula prescribed for this purpose is essen- tially the same as the formula set out in s.293(2B) that was discussed above. 8.35 The amount of the foreign tax paid in respect of the taxable distribution that is creditable to the person holding an income interest of 10 percent or greater in the CFC is finally determined by s.245K(6)(c). This provides that the credit is cal- culated by multiplying the creditable tax deter- mined under s .245K(6)(b) by the income interest of the person in the CFC. Losse s (a) Losses and calculation of beneficiary income and trustee incom e 8.36 Where the expenses incurred by a person and the allowances permitted to a person exceed the income derived during an income year the person sustains a loss for income tax purposes. In the context of the trust regime the question arises whether such a loss can be passed through to a beneficiary to be deducted from income derived from other sources and whether it can be carried forward to succeeding income years. (b) Pass through of loss to beneficiar y 8.37 There are two possible ways in which a loss could arguably be passed through to a beneficiary and deducted from income derived from other sources. The first is if income and expenses were passed through separately to the beneficiary, with the deductible items being offset against the income at the beneficiary level. However, there is no provision in the legislation for deductible items and income to be passed through separately to the beneficiary. The only provision is for "income" to be vested in or paid or applied to the beneficiary, and "income" is a positive amount. Also, expendi- ture and allowances of the trustee are not deduct- ible by the beneficiary because the expenditure is not incurred by the beneficiary and the beneficiary does not carry out the activities that give rise to the deductible expenses and allowances:Doherty v FCT(1933) 48 CLR 1; CIR v Dasent \[1956\] NZLR 959. 8.38 The second method by which losses could arguably be passed through to the beneficiary is by the trusteededucting the deductibleitems from the income and then passingthroughthe net loss to the beneficiary. However,again the legislation makes provision only for "income" to be passed 75 through to the beneficiary and "income" is a positive amount. Moreover, it is not possible to vest or to pay or apply negative amounts. 8.39 Consequently, losses may not be passed through to a beneficiary and offset against income derived by the beneficiary from other sources. However, losses may be carried forward and deducted from income derived by the trustee in later income years as discussed below. (c) Carryforward of losses 8.40 Where the trustee sustains a loss in an income year the loss may be carried forward to succeeding income years and deducted from income derived by the trustee in those income years: s.188. For income tax purposes the loss is available to be deducted from income derived in succeeding income years whether or not in terms of the trust losses are to be borne by income. Thus, s.188 overrides the common law rule that losses are borne by capital if it is clear from the trust or will that this is the intended treatment. This conclusion is not affectedby Rutherfordv CIR \[1965) NZLR 444 because in that case it was as- sumed that the terms of the trust governed and the specific point of whether s .188 overrides the terms of a trust was not argued. 8.41 Where losses are able to be carried forward for offset against future income they are deducted from the income derived by the trustee in the succeeding income year. If after the deduction of such losses in the succeeding income year there is income remaining this income will be beneficiary income or trustee income, depending upon whether the income is vested in or paid or applied to or for the benefit of the beneficiary. Thus, the loss is not carried forward and deducted against beneficiary income or trustee income: rather, it is carried forward and deducted from income de- rived by the trustee in the succeeding income year in determining whether there is any income in that year which may be classified as beneficiary income or trustee income. Trustee liabilityfor tax onbeneficiary income: s.227(2) 8.42 Section 227(2) provides thatwhere any beneficiary de rivesbeneficiaryincome or a taxable distribution during any income year the trustee is liable to income tax inrespect of that income as agent of thebeneficiary. This bri ngs into play the agency provisions of Part VII of the Income Tax Act. 8.43 Section 266 requireseveryperson who is an agent to make returns of the income in respect of which the person is an agent. Further, the agent is assessed on such income in the same manner as if the agent were p ri ncipal. The trustee is thus liable for tax onbeneficiaryincome as if the income were the trustee's income. 8.44 Section 267 deals with the rate and amount of tax payable. It provides that except where expressly provided otherwise the rate of tax for which an agent is assessable and liable is deter- mined by reference to the total taxable income of the principal . However, tax is charged and payable only on the income in respect of which the agency exists and in the same proportion as that income bears to the total taxable income of the principal. In the context of s.227(2), this means first that the trustee must calculate the tax payable on the total taxable income of the beneficiary. Then the trustee must pay an amount of tax that represents the proportion of the total tax payable on the taxable income of the beneficiary that the beneficiary income and taxable distributions represent of the total taxable income of the beneficiary. For ex- ample, if during the income year ending 31 March 1990 a beneficiary who is a natural person derives beneficiary income of $5,000 and total taxable income, including the beneficiary income, of $50,000 the tax payable by the trustee in respect of the beneficiary income would be calcu- lated as: tax payableon taxable income $30,875 x 24% = $ 7,410 $19,125 x33% = 6,311 $13,721 tax payable on beneficiary income $13,721 x $ 5,000 = $1,372 $50,00 0 8.45 Section267 applies "exceptwhere otherwise provided"in the Income TaxAct. Whereabenefi- ciaryderives a taxable distribution from a non- qualifying trust the taxable distribution is assess- able at the special rate of tax provided for in s .227(4) andin clause 9D of the First Schedule to the Act. Consequently, where a be neficia ry de ri ves a taxable distribution from a non-qualifying trust the amount of tax for which the trustee is liable as agent forthe beneficiaryis calculated according to s.227(4)rather than according to s.267 . 8.46 Section 268 provides that theliability of the agent does not release theprincipalfrom liability to make returns and tobeassessed and chargeable with tax . Further,any assessment of the agent for tax does not preclude an assessment of theprinci- pal for thesameta x and any assessment of the principal doesnot preclude an assessment of the agent for the same tax. The trustee andbeneficiary 76 a rethus jointly and severally liable for tax on beneficiaryincome and on taxabledistributions. Therefore, the beneficiary remains liable to fu rn ish returns and to assessment for tax onbeneficiary income and taxable distributions. 8.47 In practical terms, where the trustee has paid tax on the beneficiary income or on the taxable distribution in full the beneficiary will not be required to pay tax on that income. If the trustee pays tax on the beneficiary income or taxable distribution but the amount paid is less than the correct amount that is payable the beneficiary will be required to pay the difference between the amount that the trustee paid and the correct amount that is payable. If the trustee has not paid tax on the beneficiary income or taxable distribu- tion the Commissioner may seek to enforce the liability against the trustee and the beneficiary. 8.48 By s.269, when an agent pays tax the agent may recover the amount so paid from the princi- pal, or the agent may deduct the amount from any money in the agent's hands which belongs to the principal. The trustee thus has a right of indemnity against the beneficiary for any tax paid as agent for the beneficiary . Section 270 provides that an agent may retain out of money belonging or payable to the principal an amount which it may reasonably be considered is sufficient to pay the tax for which the agent is or may become liable . Thus, where the trustee has not yet paid tax on beneficiary income or on a taxable distribution the trustee may deduct from money belonging or payable to the beneficiary an amount which will be sufficient to meet the tax liability on that income or distribution. 8.49 By s.272,a person ispersonally liable for tax on theincome inrespect of which the person is an agent . The trustee is therefore personally liable for tax onbeneficiary income and on taxable distribu- tions. 8 .50 The residence of the trustee is not relevant for the purposesof s.227(2). Thetrustee is liable for tax as agenton beneficiary income and taxable distributions whether the trustee is resident or non-resident. The trustee'sliability extends only as far as the beneficiary1s liability . Thus,if the benefi- ciaryis not resident in New Zealand the trustee is liable as agent for tax onbeneficiary income from sources within New Zealand only . Beneficiaries temporarily ceasing to be resident: s .227(3) 8.51 Section 227(3) applies where any person who is resident in New Zealand ceases to be resident for a period of less than five years and during the period of non-residence the person derived beneficiary income or any taxable distri- bution from a foreign trust or from a non-qualify- ing trust. In these circumstances the person is deemed to have derived the beneficiary income or taxable distribution on the day on which the person again becomes resident in New Zealand. 8.52 This provision is an anti-avoidance rule which is designed to limit opportunities for mak- ing tax-free distributions of amounts accumulated in foreign or non-qualifying trusts by making the distribution when the beneficiary is temporarily resident outside New Zealand. The rule applies with respect to distributions from foreign trusts and non-qualifying trusts only because income will not have been accumulated free of New Zealand tax if the trust is a qualifying trust. 8S3 Section 227(3) applies where a person derives beneficiary income or taxable distributions while temporarily non-resident. It is not necessary that the person was a beneficiary of the trust when the person ceased to be resident or when the person again becomes resident. Section 227(3) would therefore apply where a person having ceased to be resident becomes a beneficiary of a foreign trust or non-qualifying trust and derives beneficiary income or a taxable distribution while non-resident. The provision would apply whether or not the person was still a beneficiary of the trust when the person again became resident in New Zealand. 8.54 Section 227(3) affects amounts that would have been assessable as beneficiary income from a foreign trust or a non-qualifying trust or as a taxable distribution had the recipient been resident in New Zealand when the sums in question were derived. If such amounts are derived by a person when non-resident they are deemed to have been derived by the person on the day on which the person becomes resident in New Zealand again . Such amounts must therefore be included in assessable income in the income year in which the person again becomes resident in New Zealand . Where the person becomes resident again during an income year no apportionment of the income is made between the part of the year for which the person was resident and the part of the year for which the person was non-resident: the entire amount is included in assessable income. The normal rules discussed in this bulletin which apply to beneficiary income and taxable distribu- tions will then apply to the amounts whichare deemed to have been derived. 8 .55 The proviso to s.227(3) provides that s.227(3) does not apply to beneficiary income or taxable distributions derived by the person prior to the date on which the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 5) 1988 received the Royal assent. That Act received the Royal assent on 16 December 1988. 77 Taxable distributions from non-qualifying trusts : s .227(4) Special rate of tax 8.56 Section 227(4) provides that where any person derives a taxable distribution from a trust which is a non-qualifying trust in relation to the distribution the taxable distribution is not included in the person's assessable income but instead the person is liable for tax in respect of the taxable distribution at the rate specified in the First Sched- ule to the Income Tax Act . The rate currently specified in clause 9D of the First Schedule, which applied from the beginning of the income year commencing on 1 April 1988, is 45 cents for every $1 of the taxable distribution. 8.57 Taxable distributions from non-qualifying trusts are thus less favourably treated than other categories of distribution in three respects: they are subjected to a higher rate of tax; they include distributions of capital gains in addition to distri- butions of income ; and, as with taxable distribu- tions from foreign trusts, a credit is allowed for non-resident withholding tax paid on the distribu- tion but not for tax paid on amounts out of which the distribution is paid. There are two reasons for this unfavourable treatment. The first is to encour- age such trusts to be brought within the New Zealand tax system through the election mecha- nisms prescribed in s.226A and s.227A. If an election is not made tax may not be paid on trustee income as it is derived, but the beneficiary may be taxed in a comparatively unfavourable manner on distribution. The second reason is that as income other than New Zealand source income is not taxed in New Zealand as it is derived the benefici- ary has the advantage of deferring liability to tax in respect of the income until it is distributed. The unfavourable treatment on distribution thus serves to compensate for the deferral advantage received by the beneficiary in relation to the income derived by the trustee . 858 In this context, the proviso to s.9 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 5) 1988 is rele- vant. The effect of that provision is that a distribu- tion from a non-qualifying trust is not a taxable distribution to the extent that it consists of amounts derived by the trustee in income years commencing before 1 April 1988. Section9is discussed in Part 3 of this bulletin. Taxable distributions derived by controlled for- eign companies 8.59 Under the controlled foreign company (CFC) regime contained in Part IVA of the Income Tax Act income derived and losses incurred by a CFC are attributed to residents holding income interests in the CFC of 10 percent or greater. The amount of income or loss attributed to a resident is determined first by calculating the branch equiva- lent income or loss of the CFC and then by multi- plying that income or loss by the person's income interest in the CFC: s.245J; s.245G. Where a CFC derives a taxable distribution from a non-qualify- ing trust the taxable distribution is attributed to residents holding an income interest in the CFC of 10 percent or greater. The amount thus attributed is taxed separately from other income derived by the CFC. This rule ensures that it is not possible to convert a taxable distribution which by s.227(4) would be taxable at a higher rate to an amount which is taxable at normal rates simply by passing the taxable distribution through a CFC . 8.60 The separate attribution of taxable distribu- tions from non-qualifying trusts through CFCs is achieved by s.245J(24) and s.245G(5) . By s .245J(24), if a CFC receives a taxable distribution to which s.227(4) would apply if the CFC were a taxpayer the taxable distribution is not taken into account in calculating the branch equivalent income or loss of the CFC and s.245G(5) applies with respect to the taxable distribution. Section 245G(5) provides that where pursuant to s.245J(24) a taxable distribution is not taken into account in calculating the branch equivalent income or loss of any person in relation to a CFC, the attributed foreign income of that person in relation to the taxable distribution is calculated separately by multiplying the taxable distribution by the income interest of the person in the CFC for the accounting period of the CFC during which the taxable distribution was re- ceived. The person is liable to tax in respect of the amount thus calculated at the rate which would apply by virtue of s.227(4) if the person had re- ceived the taxable distribution as a beneficiary of the trust from which the taxable distribution was made. A credit for foreign non-resident withhold- ing tax paid on the taxable distribution is allowed in accordance with s.245K(6). That provision is discussed above at paragraphs 8 .33 to 8.35. Derivation of taxable distributionand losses 8.61 The proviso to s .227(4) provides that if in the income year during which the person derives a taxable distribution from a non-qualifying trust the person has a loss or a loss carried forward to which s.188 would apply the personmayclaim as a deduction from the taxable distribution an amount calculated in accordance with the follow- ing formula: a xb c where - a is the part of the loss or loss carried forward that the person claims to be taken into account under the proviso; 78 b is the minimum rate specified in the First Schedule for income tax on income derived by trustees, the rate being expressed as a decimal; c is the rate specified in the First Schedule for income tax in respect of taxable distributions from non-qualifying trusts, the rate being expressed as a decimal . 8 .62 The effect of the proviso is to allow a loss which is available for carry forward under s.188 to be deducted from a taxable distribution derived from a non-qualifying trust, but only if the amount of the loss thus deducted is reduced by application of the formula to reflect the fact that the taxable distribution is taxable at a higher rate than assess- able income against which the loss would other- wise be offset. 8.63 The proviso applies where the person has a loss or loss carried forward to which relief would be given under s.188. The losses to which s .188 applies are global losses; that is, the result of a year's trading : Grieve vCIR \[19841 1 NZLR 101, 103 . The proviso therefore applies where during the income year in which the taxable distribution is derived deductible expenses and allowances exceed income derived, thus resulting in a loss in that income year which may be available for car- ryforward to the succeeding incomeyear,or where a global loss of this type has been carried forward from an income year prior to the incomeyear during which the taxable distribution is derived. For the proviso to apply the loss must be one which can be carried forward pursuant to s.188. Therefore, if the person deriving the taxable distribution is a company the continuity of owner- ship requirements of s.188(7) must be satisfied. Also, if the person deriving the taxable distnbution is a company the loss grouping provisions of s .191 may apply. If the company claims a deduction from a taxable distribution in accordance with the proviso to s.227(4) the amount of the loss available for carryforwardunders.188, and for grouping under s.191, will be reduced by virtue of the proviso. 8 .64 If the loss is one to which relief would be given under s .188 the taxpayer is entitled to claim a deduction from the taxable distribution of an amount calculated in accordance with the formula specified in the proviso . If a deduction is taken in accordance with the proviso the loss is not avail- able for deduction or carry forward under s.188 to the extent that it is taken into account under the proviso . If the taxpayer claims a deduction it is necessary to also claim the portion of the loss which taken into account as item a of the formula. Therefore, there are two decisions to make : first, whether to claim a deduction from the taxable distribution; and second, if it is decided to claim a deduction, the amount of the loss which is to be taken into account in applying the formula in the proviso. 8.65 The followingexample illustratesthe opera- tion of theproviso to s.227(4): Example 12 Facts: (i) Xco is a New Zealand resident company . In the income year which commences on 1 April 1989 Xco derives a taxable distri- bution of $10,000 from a non-qualifying trust of which it is a beneficiary. (It is assumed that the distribution is made from income and capital gains derived during the income year commencing on 1 April 1988 and that the distribution of income is a taxable distribution rather than beneficiary income. As the distribu- tion is from amounts derived durin g the income year commencing on 1 April 1988 the proviso to s.9 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 5) 1988 has no effect for the purpose of the example). (ii) Xco has a global loss for the income year commencing 1 April 1989 of $50,000. This loss is available for carryforward to the succeeding income year in terms of s.188. Xco wishes to deduct from the taxable distribubon the portion of the loss which will result in Xco having no tax to pay on the taxable distribution . This calculation is made by solving the equation: y x 0 .33 = 10,000 0.45 where - y is the amount of the loss needed to secure a deduction of $10,000 from the taxable distribution; .33 is the rate of tax applying to trustee income in the income year commencing on 1 April 1989; .45 is the rate of tax applying to taxable distributions from non-qualifying trusts in the income year commenc- ing on 1 April 1989; 10,000 is the deduction which Xco wants to secure. (This formula is not prescribed by the legisla- tion but is provided in order to explain ho w 79 Xco calculates the amount of the loss it wishes to take into account) Solving the equation,item " y ' has a value of $13,642 . Xco thus claims to take into account $13,642 of its loss for the purposes of applying the s.227(4) formula. Result: (f) Xco has derived a taxable distribution from a non-qualifying trust. By s.227(4) this distribution is liable to tax at the rate of 45 percent. If the proviso to s.227(4) were not invoked Xco would be liable to tax in respect of the taxable distribution of $10,000 x 45% = $4,500. (ii) The loss of $50,000 is one to which s .188 applies. Therefore, Xco is entitled to deduct an amount from the taxable distribution in accordancewith s .227(4) proviso. (iii) Xco claims to take into account $13,642 of the loss in calculating the deduction from the taxable distribution. On the basis of this claim the amount of the deduction from the taxable distribution is calculated as follows: $13,642 x.45 = $10,000 The multiplier in the formula is based on the rates of tax applying in the income year commencing on 1 April 1989. (iv) Xco deducts the $10,000 calculated in accordance with the proviso to s.227(4) from the taxable distribution of $10,000 resulting in no tax liability in respect of the distribution. (v) Theportion of the loss taken into account for the purpose of the proviso to s.227(4), i.e., the $13,642, is no longer available for carryforward under s.188. The loss available for carryforward under s.188, or for grouping under s.191 if Xco is a mem ber of a group of companies and the requirements of s.191 aresatisfied, is reduced to $50,000 -13,642=$36,358. Arrangements to defeat the intent and applica- tion of s.227 : s.227(5) 8.66 Section 227(5) applies where in relation to any trust and any beneficiary an arrangement has been entered into pursuant to which property is transferred, or services or other benefits are pro- vided, to a person other than the beneficiary and the effect of the arrangement in relation to the beneficiary is to defeat the intent and application of s .227 . In these circumstances s.227(5) deems the property, services or benefits to have been received or enjoyed by the beneficiary. 8.67 The objective of s.227(5) is to limit opportu- nities for distributions to be made tax free to a person who is not a beneficiary of the trust in circumstances where a beneficiary of the trust benefits from the distribution. In many cases trans- actions of this type will constitute an "application" of income or property of the trust for the benefit of a beneficiary in terms of the "beneficiary income" and "taxable distribution" definitions. Thus, s.227(5) effectively operates to buttress the "benefi- ciary income" and "distribution" definitions in situations where a transaction does not constitute an application of trust income or property for the benefit of a beneficiary but where the beneficiary nevertheless benefits from the transaction. 8.68 The intent of s .227 is to require beneficiaries to include beneficiary income and taxable distribu- tions in their assessable income . An arrangement will defeat the intent and application of s.227 if the beneficiary derives a benefit as a result of the property being transferred, or the services or other benefits being provided, to another person and the beneficiary directly or indirectly benefits from that transfer of property or provision of services or benefits. 8.69 Section 227(5) applies where the arrange- ment has been entered into in relation to any trust and any beneficiary. There is no specification as to who must have entered into the arrangement and, in particular, it is not necessary for the beneficiary to be a party to the arrangement. In this context, the term "arrangement" is defined in broad terms in s.226(1). 8 70 If s.227(5) applies the property, services or benefits are deemed to be received or enjoyed by the beneficiary. Consequently, the beneficiary may derive beneficiary income ora taxabledistribution as a resultof the application of s.227(5) . Distributions from qualifyingtrusts: s.227(6) 8.71 Section 227(6) provides that distributions derived by a beneficiary which are not beneficiary income in the hands of the beneficiary are not assessable for income tax if the trust is a qualifying trust in relation to the distribution. This ensures that the law as stated in Coft v Luttrell \[1949\] NZLR 823 is preserved in relation to qualifying trusts. That is, where income which is not benefici- ary income is assessable to the trustee the income is not assessable to the beneficiary when it is later distributed. The legislation thus recognises in the context of qualifying trusts that the trustee pays 80 tax on trustee income as a representative of the beneficiary and that therefore it is not appropriate to tax the beneficiary on the income when the beneficiary actually receives it. 8.72 As indicated in the preceding paragraph, s.227(6) operates to exclude from the assessable income of a beneficiary of a qualifying trust amounts that have been subject to tax in the trustee's hands and that are later distributed to the beneficiary. Other types of distributions are also excluded from the beneficiary's assessable income by virtue of s.227(6). For example, distributions from qualifying trusts of the type described in paras (a) and (b) of the s.226(1) definition of "dis- tribution" are not be assessable if they fall outside the s.226(1) definition of "beneficiary income". This is because in the case of such distributions there may be no derivation of income by the trustee which corresponds with the distribution to the beneficiary . If this is the case, there will be no beneficiary income, because only income which is first derived by the trustee can be beneficiary income, and the distribution will not be assessable by virtue of s .227(6) . 8 .73 Section 227(6) only applies in respect of a distribution from a trust that is a qualifying trust in relation to the distribution. Section 227(6) does not apply where the trust is a foreign trust or a non- qualifying trust in relation to the distribution. Trustee returns income to accounting year balance date: s .227(7) 8 .74 Section 227(7) applies where a trustee fur- nishes a return of income under s.15 for an ac- counting year ending with a balance date other than 31 March . In these circumstances, any income derived by the trustee in the trustee's accounting year which is also beneficiary income during that accounting year is deemed to have been derived by the beneficiary during the income year in which the trustee is deemed to have derived the income under s.15. This provision is discussed above at paragraphs 8.19 to 8.22. PART 9: ELECTION FOR TRUSTS SE TT LED BEFORE 17 DECEMBER 1987 Section 227Aelection 9.1 Section 227A applies where a settlement was first made on the terms of atrust on or before 17 December 1987, whether or not further settle- ments were made onth e trust on or after that date. It provides that any settlor,trustee orbeneficiary could have made an elec tion under s.228(7) on or before 31 May 1989 to pay tax on trustee income deri ved in income years commencing on or after 1 April1988 . If an election was made it is provided that for the purpose of determining the liability of any person for income tax in respect of a distribu- tion from the trust all trustee income derived from outside New Zealand, or derived from New Zealand as non-resident withholding income if the obligations of all persons to pay income tax in respect of that non-resident withholding income have been satisfied, is deemed to have been liable to New Zealand income tax and the trustee's obligations in respect of the trustee's liability to such income tax are deemed to have been satisfied. 9.2 The objective of s.227A was to provide a mechanism for trusts which would otherwise be non-qualifying trusts in relation to distributions to become qualifying trusts . The trusts in question are those which were first settled on or before 17 December 1987 where the trustee income was not liable for tax in New Zealand or where such income was liable for New Zealand tax only as non-resident withholding income. The prime example of a trust in this category is one settled by a New Zealand resident on non-resident trustees. The foreign source trustee income of this trust would not have been liable to New Zealand income tax under the old trust taxation regime because the trustee was non-resident. Therefore, if an election were not made the trust would not be a qualifying trust in relation to distributions made from the trust. Instead, it would be a non-qualify- ing trust and taxable distributions to beneficiaries would be assessable at 45 percent. 9.3 Section 227A is not limited byits terms to trusts which are non-qualifying trusts. Conse- quently, it would havebeenpossible fora settlor, trustee or beneficiaryof a foreign trust first settled on or before 17 December 1987to have made an electionin accordance with s.227A. Requirements 9.4 Section 227A applies where a settlement was first made on the terms of a trust on or before 17 December 1987 whether or not further settle- ments were made to or for the benefit of the trust or on the terms of the trust after that date. The significance of 17 December 1987 is that where a settlement has been made on a trust after that date any settlor of the trust who is resident in New Zealand is liable to tax on trustee income derived by the trustee in income years commencing on or after 1 April 1988: s.228(4). Consequently, in cases where a trust was first settled by a resident after 17 December 1987 all of the trustee income will be liable for tax in New Zealand and the trust will be a qualifying trust if the trustee's obligations in relation to that liability are satisfied. In these cases it is therefore not necessary to provide an election procedure . 81 9.5 However, if a trust was first settled on or before 17 December 1987 the foreign source trustee income derived in income years commencing before 1 April 1988 will not have been liable to New Zealandtax ifthe trustee was non-resident, and if the New Zealand source trustee income was non-resident withholding income it will only have been liable to non-resident withholding tax. Trustee income derived from outside New Zea- land in income years commencing after 1 April 1988 will have been liable to New Zealand tax under s.228(3), although by virtue of the excep- tions contained in s.228(5) and s.228(6) there may be no settlor or trustee liable to tax in respect of the trustee income. However, the trust will not be a qualifying trust unless the income derived in in- come years commencing before 1 April 1988 was liable to income tax. A trust in this category will therefore not satisfy the qualifying trust definition other than through the election procedure pro- vided in s .227A. Election 9.6 An election under s.227A could have been made by any settlor, trustee or beneficiary or by any combination of settlors, trustees or beneficiar- ies, including a settlor or trustee who was already liable to tax on trustee income. For example, if a resident settled property on a trust with non- resident trustees on 1 June 1986, and the person made a further settlement on 1 October 1988, the settlor and trustee would be liable to pay tax on trustee income derived in income years commenc- ing on and after 1 April 1988 because a settlement was made after 17 December 1987: s.228. However, the trust would not be a qualifying trust because the income derived in income years commencing before 1 April1988would not have been liable to income tax . Thus, the trustee or settlor might have considered it appropriate to make a s.227A election notwithstanding the fact that they were already liable to tax on trustee income. 9.7 The election had to be made on or before 31 May 1989. There was no provision for the Com- missioner to extend the time for making an election in accordance with s.227A. An election to pay tax on trustee income can still be made under s.228(7) after 31 May 1989 but if such an election is made in relation to a trust which was first settled on or before 17 December 1987 the election will not convert the trust to a qualifying trust. This is be- cause (except for the different times specified in s.226A and s.227A) a s.227(8) election only oper- ates from the income year in which the election is made. Consequently, the income derived in in- come years commencing before the income year in which the election was made will not have been liable to New Zealand income tax and the election will not convert the trust to a qualifying trust. Effect of election 9.8 Where an election was made in accordance with s.227A it is provided that in determining the liability of any person for income tax on a distribu- tion from the trust all trustee income derived by the trustee from outside New Zealand, or from within New Zealand as non-resident withholding income if the obligations of all persons to pay tax in relation to that income have been satisfied, is deemed to have been liable to income tax under the Income Tax Act other than only as non-resident withholding income. Further, it is provided that the trustee's obligations in relation to that liability are deemed to have been satisfied. 9.9 The language used in s .227A ties in with the language used in the s.226(1) definition of "quali- fying trust". There are two essential elements to that definition: (i) first, that all of the trustee income derived by the trustee commencing with the income year in which a settlement was first made on the trust and ending with the income year in which the distribution is made has been liable to New Zealand income tax other than only as non-resident withholding income; and (ii) second, that the trustee's obligations in respect of the trustee's liability to New Zealand income tax have been satisfied. 9.10 The effect of a s.227A election is therefore that the requirements of the qualifying trust defini- tion are deemed to have been satisfied in relation to trustee income derived from outside New Zealand, or derived from New Zealand as non- resident withholding income, in income years commencing before 1 April 1988. 9.11 A s.227Aelection does not affect income derived from New Zealand other than as non- resident withholding income. Consequently, if the trustee de ri ved income from New Zealand other than as non-resident withholding income, and the trustee's obligations in relation to the trustee's liability to pay tax on such income have not been satisfied, the trust will notbea qualifying trust in relation to any distribution from the trust. Also, after a s.227A election has been madethe person making the election must con ti nue to satisfy the obligation to pay tax on the trustee income: s .228(7). If this obligation is not sa ti sfied the trust will cease to be a qualifying trust in rela tion to distributions . 82 PART 10: TAXATION OF TRUSTEE INCOME Overview of s.22 8 10.1 Section 228 sets out the rules governing the taxation treatment of trustee income . The broad scheme of s .228 is that the trustee is always liable to tax on New Zealand source trustee income and, subject to several exceptions, that the trustee is also liable for tax in respect of foreign source trustee income derived in any income year in three situ- ations . The first is where any settlor of the trust is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year. The second is where the trust is a superannuation fund (as defined in s .2). The third is where a trustee of the trust is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year and a settlor of the trust died resident in New Zealand, either during that income year or during any other income year. 10.2 Where a settlement has been made on a trust after 17 December 1987 any settlor of the trust who is resident in New Zealand at any time during an income year is, subject to several exceptions, liable to tax on trustee income derived during that income year as agent of the trustee. The most significant exceptions are where a trustee of the trust is resident in New Zealand at all times during the income year, where the trust is a superannua- tion fund, and where the settlor was not resident in New Zealand at the time of any settlement made by that settlor or was not resident in New Zealand at the time of any other settlement made after 17 December 1987. 10.3 In outline, s.228(1) provides that, subject to s.228, a trustee is assessable and liable for income tax on trustee income as if the trustee were an individual beneficially entitled to the trustee in- come . Section 228(2) provides that the trustee is liable to income tax on trustee income derived from New Zealand, and s .228(3) establishes the rules governing the taxation of trustee income derived from outside New Zealand. By s.228(2A) and s.228(2B) special rules are provided for calcu- lating the assessable income derived by trustees of superannuation funds. Section 228(4) provides that where a settlement has been made on a trust after 17 December 1987 any settlor of the trust who is resident in New Zealand at any time during an income year is liable for tax on trustee income derived during that income year as agent for the trustee. Section 228(5) contains a number of excep- tions to this rule. Section 228(6) contains several exceptions to the rule that trustees are liable for tax in respect of income derived from outside New Zealand in cases where a settlor of the trust is residentin NewZealand during an income year. Section 228(7)contains a procedure whereby any settlor, trustee or beneficiaryof a trust can elect to paytax ontrustee income. Liabilityfor tax on trustee income:s.228(1) 10.4 Section 228(1) provides that, subject to s .228, a trustee is assessable and liable for income tax on trustee income as if the trustee were an individual beneficially entitled thereto. This rule is qualified in that the rate of tax is calculated by reference to the trustee income alone, the trustee is not entitled to any rebate of income tax or to any deduction by wayof special exemption, and the trustee is not entitled to be a cash basis holder for the purpose of s.64B to s.64M (the accruals rules) . 10.5 Section 228(1) applies subject to the other provisions of s .228. Thus, the trustee is only liable for tax in respect of trustee income derived from outside New Zealand if s.228(3) applies and if none of the exceptions in s.228(6) apply. 10.6 The trustee is liable for income tax on trustee income as if the trustee were an "individual beneficially entitled thereto". One consequence of this language is that if the trustee is a company that fact is ignored in determining the amount of tax for which the trustee is liable. Thus, if at any time company rates of taxation differ from the rates applying with respect to trustee income it cannot be argued in cases where the trustee is a company that the trustee income is taxable at the company rate. With respect to the income year ending 31 March 1990 the rates of tax on income derived by resident companies and by trustees is the same. 10.7 Paragraph(a) of s.228(1) provides that the rate of tax is calculated by reference to the trustee income alone.This reflectsthe principle discussed in Part 5 of this bulletin that trustees are assessable for income tax on trustee income as representa tives of the beneficia ri es of the trust . Thus, income derived by the trustee in a capacityother than as trustee of the trust is not taken into account in determining the amount of tax on the trustee income and the rates of tax applying to the trustee income are not affected by the rates applying to other income derived by the trustee. 10.8 Paragraph (b) of s.228(2) provides that the trustee is not entitled to any rebateof income tax or to any deduction by way of specialexemption. Together with paragraph (a) this also reflects the principle thattrustees are liable for income tax on trustee incomeas representati vesfor the benefici- aries ofthe trust. 83 10.9 Paragraph (c) of s.228(3) provides that the trustee is not entitled to be a cash basis holder pursuant to s.64D. Consequently, the cash basis holder exception to the accruals rules contained in s.64C(5)(a) does not apply and the trustee is re- quired to accrue income derived in respect of financial arrangements in accordance with the rules contained in s .64C . This ensures that indi- viduals who do not otherwise qualify for the cash basis holder exemption and companies cannot take advantage of that exemption by placing financial arrangements in a number of trusts. New Zealand source trusteeincome: s.228(2 ) 10.10 Section 228(2) provides that a trustee is liable for income tax on all trustee income derived from New Zealand . This is the case whether or not the trustee or settlor of the trust is resident in New Zealand . The question of whether income is derived from New Zealand is determined in accordance with s.243. 10 .11 Where the trustee is resident outside New Zealand and the New Zealand source trustee income is non-resident withholding income as defined under s.310, there will be a liability to pay non-resident withholding tax in relation to the income . If the trustee income is liable for tax only as non-resident withholding income the trust will not be a qualifying trust in relation to distributions to beneficiaries: s.226(1) "qualifying trust" defini- tion. Consequently, distributions from the trust which do not constitute beneficiary income may be assessable to resident beneficiaries as taxable distributions from a foreign trust or from a non- qualifying trust. Superannuation regime: s.228(2A), s.228(2B ) 10.12 Section 228(2A) provides that, notwithstand- ing s.106(1)(a) but subject to the other provisions of the Act, in calculating the assessable income derived in any income year by a trustee of a superannuation fund a deduction is allowed for expenditure incurred by the superannuation fund to the extent to which it is incurred in respect of developing, marketing, selling, promoting, and advertising for members to the fund. In the ab- sence of this provision such expenditure may be precluded from deduction by s.106(l)(a). Section 228(2A) does not apply to expenditure incurred in acquiring any plant, machinery, equipment, land, or building or expenditure which is not income in the hands of the recipient. 10.13 Section 228(2B) provides that where any funds of a superannuation fund are invested in another superannuation fund or in a policy of life insurance issued in New Zealand, any income, gain or benefit arising from that investment is deemed not to be assessable income derived by the trustee of the superannuation fund. This avoids the double taxation of income in the hands of both superannuation funds or in the hands of the super- annuation fund and in the hands of the life insur- ance office. Trustee income derived from outside New Zea- land: s .228(3) Overview 10.14 Section 228(3) sets out the rules governing the liability to income tax of trustee income de- rived from outside New Zealand . It provides that a trustee is liable to income tax on trustee income derived from outside New Zealand in any income year during which any settlor of the trust is at any time resident in New Zealand, during which the trustis atany time a superannuation fund, or during which any trustee was at any time resident in New Zealand if any settlor of the trust died resident in New Zealand, whether during that income year or during any prior income year. 10.15 Therefore, except in the case of superannua- tion funds, the residence of the settlor is the impor- tant connecting factor in determining whether trustee income from outside New Zealand is liable for income tax . This differs from the previous trust regime where the residence of the trustee was the relevant connecting factor. Trustee residence was not chosen as the basis for taxing trustee income from outside New Zealand because it was consid- ered that it would be too easy to avoid tax on such income by appointing non-resident trustees. Further, it was considered that in economic terms the residence of the settlor provided a more appro- priate basis for taxing foreign source trustee income than did the residence of the trustee. In the case of superannuation funds, the residence of the settlor is not relevant in determining whether trustee income from outside New Zealand is liable to income tax. Trustee income derived by superan- nuation funds is always liable to income tax. Settlor resident in New Zealand 10.76 By s.228(3)(a), a trustee is liable to income tax on trustee income derived from outside New Zealand in any income year during which any settlor of the trust is resident at any time in New Zealand. 10.77 The liability to tax on trustee income derived from outside New Zealand arises where any settlor of the trust is resident in New Zealand. Thus, if there is more than one settlor s.228(3)(a) applies i f 84 any one of the se tt lors is residentin New Zealand at any time du ri ng the income year. Further, it is not necessaryfor the settlor toberesident in New Zealand at all times during th e incomeyear. The liability will arise if the settlor is resident at any time du ri ng th e income year. 10.18 In cases where a settlor of the trust is resi- dent in New Zealand at any time during the income year the trustee will be liable for tax on trustee income derived from outside New Zealand whether or not the trustee is resident in New Zealand. The one exception to this rule, discussed below at paragraphs 10.74 to 10.84, is contained in s.228(6). Where the trustee is resident outside New Zealand it is provided that the trustee is liable to income tax "as if the trustee were resident in New Zealand". This ensures that if a settlor of the trust is resident in New Zealand it cannot be argued that foreign source trustee income is not liable to income tax if the trustee is not resident. Superannuation funds 10.19 By s.228(3)(aa), a trustee of a trust is liable to income tax on trustee income derived from outside New Zealand in any income year during which the trustis atany time a superannuation fund. This provision was inserted by the Income Tax Amend- ment Act 1989 as part of the legislation implement- ing the new superannuation taxation regime. The superannuation taxation regime has been inte- grated with the trust taxation regime and s.228(3)(aa) ensures that trustees of superannua- tion funds are assessable for income tax on the worldwide income of the fund. Settlor diedresident inNew Zealand 10.20 By s.228(3)(b), a trustee is liable for income tax on trustee income derived from outside New Zealand in anyincome year duringwhich any trustee ofthe trust was at any time resident in New Zealand andthe tr ust is a testamentary trust or an inter vivos trust where, in either case, any settlor of the trust died resident in New Zealand. The provi- sion applies whether th e settlor died during the income year in whichthe income in question was derived or duri ng any p ri or income year. 10.30 Section 228(3)(b) applies in relation to trustee income derived in an income year when any trustee of the trust is resident in New Zealand at any time during the incomeyear.If there is more than one trustee it is sufficient that any one of the trustees is resident in New Zealand. Thus, s .228(3)(b) may apply to render a non-resident trustee liable for tax on trustee income derived from outside New Zealand if another trustee is resident in New Zealand at any time during the relevant income year. The liability arises if the trustee is resident at any time during the income year . It is not necessary that the trustee should be resident at all times during the income year. 10.40 Section 228(3)(b) applies where the trust is a testamentary trust or an inter vivos trust and, in either case, the settlor died resident in New Zea- land . Thus, the trust may be one which was cre- ated on the death of the settlor or during the life of the settlor . The provision applies if the settlor died resident in New Zealand during the income year in which the relevant trustee income was derived or during any other income year. For example, if the settlor died resident in the 1990 income year, and a trustee of the trust was resident during the 1992 income year, the trustee income derived from outside New Zealand in the 1992 income year would be liable to New Zealand income tax. 10.41 In some cases a non-resident trustee may be liable under s.228(3)(b) for tax on trustee income derived from outside New Zealand. For example, the trustee may be resident for only part of the income year but will be liable for tax on trustee income derived from outside New Zealand during the whole income year . Or, the trustee may be non- resident for the entire income year but there may be another trustee who is resident in New Zealand during all or part of the income year. In these circumstances the trustee is liable to income tax in respect of trustee income derived from outside New Zealand as if the trustee were resident in New Zealand. Liability of trusteeresident outside New Zealand 10.42 The introductorylanguage of s.228(3) provides that in the circumstances specified in paras(a) to (b) of that subsection the trustee is liable to tax on trustee income derived from outside New Zealand. If the trusteeis resident outside New Zealand the language in parentheses states that thetrustee is liable to tax "as if the trustee were resident in New Zealand". This language ensures that, in the circumstances speci- fied in paras (a) to (b) of s.228(3), the provisions which normally apply to persons resident in New Zealand who derive income from outside New Zealand apply to trustees who are not resident in New Zealand. Read toge th er with s.228(1), which provides that trustees are liable for tax on trustee income as if they were individualsbeneficially entitled to the income, the effect of the language in parentheses is that non-resident trustees are liable to tax onincomederived from outside New Zealand calculated in th e same manner as for individuals who are resident in New Zealand . The liability to tax oftrustees as individuals is subject to the three exceptions contained in paras(a) to (c) 85 of s.228(1). These provisions are discussed above at paragraphs 10.4 to 10.9. 10.43 Section 228(3) provides that the non-resident trustee is liable to tax on trustee income derived from outside New Zealand as if the trustee were an individual resident in New Zealand. Thus, to the extent that it applies to income derived from outside New Zealand, s .242(a) applies to make the trustee assessable for income tax on trustee income derived from outside New Zealand. Other provi- sions relating to the taxation of income derived from outside New Zealand will operate as follows: (i) The trustee will be assumed to be resident in New Zealand for the purposes of calculating the credit for foreign taxes to which the trustee will be entitled under s.293. (ii) The exception from the accruals taxation regime provided by s.64M(e) for non- residents will not apply in calculating trustee income derived from outside New Zealand. (iii) Section 245R(11), which provides that any person who is resident outside New Zealand during an income year does not derive foreign investment fund income or incur a foreign investment fund loss, does not apply to the trustee. Thus, if the trust assets include an interest in a foreign investment fund the trustee will be required to take into account foreign investment fund income and foreign investment fund losses in calculating trustee income. (iv) Section 245F(1), which provides that any person who is resident outside New Zealand at all times during an income year is not required to calculate attributed foreign income or attributed foreign loss in respect of an interest in a controlled foreign com- pany (CFC), does not apply. Thus, if the trust assets include an "income interest of 10 percent or greater" (as defined in s 245A) the trustee will be required to take into account attributed foreign income and attributed foreign losses (where attribution is required under Part IVA of the Income Tax Act) in calculating trustee income . (iv) Non-resident trustees who are liable to tax on trustee income derived from outside New Zealand by virtue of s.228(3) are permitted to elect to maintain a branch equivalent tax account (BETA) in accor- dance with s.394ZZS (s.394ZZS applies rather than s.394ZZN because the trustee is liable to tax as an individual) . The non- resident trustee is permitted to maintain a BETA because the trustee is liable to tax in respect of trustee income derived from outside New Zealand on the same basis as if the trustee were resident in New Zealand . Thus, all provisions which affect the liability to tax of a person resident in New Zealand in respect of income derived from outside New Zealand apply to the non-resident trustee. A BETA is relevant in calculating the liability of a person resident in New Zealand to tax on dividends derived from foreign companies . Consequently, the non- resident trustee is permitted to maintain a BETA. Relevance of settlor liabilit y 10.44 The liability of a trustee to income tax on trustee income derived from outside New Zealand does not depend upon the liability of the senior to income tax with respect to that income. Thus, subject to the exceptions contained in s.228(6), if s.228(3) is satisfied a trustee will be liable to income tax on trustee income derived from outside New Zealand whether or not any resident settlor of the trust is liable to income tax in respect of that income . For the purpose of s.228(3) settlor resi- dence is relevant not settlor liability. Trustee not otherwise liable 10.45 The concluding language of s .228(3) pro- vides that a trustee is not otherwise assessable to income tax on trustee income derived from outside New Zealand. For example, if during the relevant income year no settlor of the trust was at any time resident in New Zealand the trustee is not liable for tax on trustee income derived from outside New Zealand unless the trustee elects to pay tax on trustee income in accordance with s.228(7). This is the case even if the trustee is resident in New Zealand and even if the settler has been resident in New Zealand in prior years. Settlor liability inrespect of trustee income : s.228(4 ) Ove rvie w 10.46 Section 228(4) sets out the general rule as to when a settlor is liable to income tax on trustee income. It applies in relation to trusts other than charitable trusts where a settlement was made to or for the benefit of a trust or on the terms of a trust after 17 December 1987. In these circum- stances, subject to s.228(5), if a trustee of the trust derives trustee income in any income year any settler of the trust who is resident in New Zealand at any time during that income year is assessable 86 and liable to income tax on that trustee income as agent of the trustee . Where there is more than one such settlor it is provided that they are jointly and severally liable for tax on that income . Exceptions to settlor liabilit y 10 .47 Section 228(4) creates a general rule that a settlor of a trust is liable for tax in respect of trustee income as agent for the trustee . There are a num- ber of exceptions to this rule . First, s.228(4) applies subject to s .228(5). Section 228(5) contains several significant exceptions to the rule that settlors are liable to income tax on trustee income. These are discussed below at paragraphs 10.55 to 10.73. 10.48 Second, s .228(4) does not apply in relation to charitable trusts. The expression "charitable trust" is defined in s .226(8) and s.226(9). Those provisions are discussed in Part 4 of this bulletin at para- graphs 4 .108 to 4.123. 10.49 The third exception to settlor liability is that s.228(4) applies only where a settlement has been made to or for the benefit of the trust or on the terms of the trust after 17 December 1987. The significance of 17 December 1987 is that the Government's Consultative Document on Interna- tional Tax Reform was released on that day. Prior to the publication of that document there was no indication that persons making settlements on trusts would be liable to income tax in respect of the trustee income derived by the trustee. Conse- quently, if a trust was settled before 17 December 1987, and no settlement has been made on the trust since that date, the settlor is not liable for tax on trustee income unless the settlor elects topaytax on trustee income in accordance with s.228(7). However, if a settlement was made on the trust after 17 December 1987, whether or not the trust was first settled on or before 17 December 1987, the person making the settlement is taken as being on notice that one consequence of making the settlement is that the person may be liable for tax in respect of trustee income. 10.50 Section 228(4) provides that any settlor of the trust who is resident in New Zealand at any time during an income yearis liable to income tax in respect of trustee income if a settlement was made to or for the benefit of the trust or on the terms of the trust by any person after 17 December 1987. Therefore, it is not necessary that the settle- ment made after 17 December 1987 was made by the settler who is resident in New Zealand during the relevant income year. For example, if a resi- dent individual, A, settled a trust on 1 June 1986 and a non-resident individual, B, made an addi- tional settlement to or for the benefit of the trust on 1 May 1989, A would be liable for income tax on trustee income (subject to s.228(5)) derived in the income year commencing on I April 1989 and in subsequent income years in which A was at any time resident in New Zealand. Application and effect of s.228(4) 10 .51 Where a settlement has been made on the terms of a trust or to or for the benefit of a trust after 17 December 1987 and during any income year the trustee of the trust derives trustee income, s. 228(4) provides that any settlor of the trust who is resident in New Zealand at any time during that income year is liable to income tax on the trustee income as agent of the trustee. Section 228(4) applies where the settler is resident at any time during the income year. If the settlor is resident at any time during the income year the settlor is liable for income tax on trustee income derived during the entire income year. 10.52 The effect of s.228(4) is that the settlor is liable to income tax on trustee income as agent of the trustee. The agency provisions contained in Part VII of the Income Tax Act therefore apply . One object of treating the settlor as agent of the trustee is to give the settlor a right of indemnity against the trustee for any tax paid by the settlor on trustee income: Report of the Consultative Committee on International Tax Reform and Full Imputation, Part 2 p 89 . This right of indemnity is provided for in s.269. 10.53 By s.266, every agent is required to make returns of the income in respect of which the agent is an agent . Further, the agent is assessable on such income in the same manner as if the agent were the principal . Therefore, in the context of s .228(3) it is permissible for the Commissioner to assess the settler for income tax on trustee income whether or not the Commissioner also assesses the trustee for income tax on such income . There is no require- ment for the Commissioner to assess the trustee on the trustee income and to attempt to collect the tax from the trustee before an assessment can be made on the settlor . Where an assessment is made of the settlor, s .268 provides that this does not preclude an assessment being made of the trustee. Further, by virtue of s .268 if an assessment is made of the settlor this does not release the trustee from the liability to make returns and to be assessed and charged with tax. 10.54 If there is more than one settlor liable to income tax under s .228(4) it is provided that they are jointly and severally assessable and liable to income tax in respect of the trustee income . Settlors are thus jointly liable for tax on the entire trustee income and it is for the settlors to apportion liability among themselves . An exception to this 87 general rule is provided in s.228(5)(c). By virtue of that provision an apportionment of the liability of a settler can be made where the settlor can satisfy the Commissioner that the settler's liability to tax exceeds the liability which the settlor should bear having regard to the settlements made by that settlor and the settlements made by other settlers . This exception is discussed further below at paragraphs 10.64 to10.71.. Exceptionsto settlorliability:s.228(5) Overview 10.55 Section 228(5) provides several exceptions to the rule contained in s.228(4) that a settlor of a trust is liable to income tax on trustee income if a settlement has been made on the trust after 17 December 1987 . By s .228(5)(a), a settlor is not liable to income tax on trustee income if at all times during that income year a trustee of the trust is resident in New Zealand . Section 228(5)(aa) excludes settlors of superannuation funds from liability. Section 228(5)(b) provides that a settlor of a trust who was not resident in New Zealand at the time when the settlor made a settlement on the trust, and who was not resident in New Zealand at the time of any settlement since 17 December 1987, is not liable to tax on trustee income. Section 228(5)(c) contains a rule for limiting the liability of settlors in circumstances where there is more than one settler of the trust. By s.228(5)(d), a settlor is not liable for tax on trustee income to the extent that the trustee income is derived by virtue of the application of s.64B to s.64M to amounts remitted by the settlor under any financial arrangement. Trustee resident: s.228(5)(a) 10.56 Section 228(5)(a) provides that s.228(4) does not apply to any settlor of a trust in any income year where at all times during that income year, or, where the trust was first settled during the income year, at all times from the date of first settlement until the end of the income year, a trustee of the trust is resident in New Zealand. 1057 In these circumstances liability is not im- posed on the settlor because there is a resident trustee who can pay the tax. Where no trustee is resident during the income year, or where a trustee is resident for only part of the income year, it may be less likely that the tax can be collected from the trustee. Therefore, in that situation s.228(5)(a) does not apply and the settlor is liable fortax on trustee income in accordance with s.228(4) (subject to any other relevant exceptions) if a settlement has been made on the trust after 17 December 1987. 1058 The language in parentheses in s.228(5)(a) deals with the situation where a trust is first settled during the income year. In those circum- stances s.228(5)(a) will operate where a trustee has been resident in New Zealand at all times from the date of first settlement until the end of the income year. Superannuation funds: s.228(5)(aa) 10.59 Section 228(5)(aa) provides that settlors of superannuation funds are not liable for tax on trustee income. The trustees of superannuation funds are liable to tax on trustee income derived from New Zealand (s.228(2)) and from outside New Zealand (s.228(3)(aa)). Non-resident settlors: s.228(5)(b) 10.60 Section 228(5)(b) provides that a settlor of a trust is not liable to income tax on trustee income if the settlor is a natural person who was not resident in New Zealand at the time of any settlement by that settlor and who was not resident at the time of any settlement since 17 December 1987 . This rule does not apply if the settlor elects to pay tax on trustee income pursuant to s.228(7). 10 .61 Section 228(5)(b) ties in with s.226A, the provision which applies where a settlor of a foreign trust becomes resident in New Zealand. Read together, the effect of these two provisions is that settlors of foreign trusts who become resident in New Zealand are not liable to income tax in respect of trustee income unless they elect to pay tax on such income. Persons who settled trusts before becoming resident in New Zealand may have made the settlement in ignorance of the New Zealand trust taxation regime . Therefore, it is appropriate that they not be liable automatically to income tax on trustee income on becoming resi- dent. In this regard, settlors of such trusts are treated in a similar manner to resident settlors who settled trusts before 17 December 1987 . 10 62For s.228(5)(b) to apply the settlor must be a natural person. The exception does not apply if the settler is a company . This is consistent with s.226A which also applies with respect to natural persons only. The settlor must not have been resident in New Zealand at the time of any settlement by the settlor . Further, the settlor must not have been resident at the time of any other settlement (that is, any settlement made by any other person) made after 17 December 1987 . 10 .63 Section 228(5)(b) does not apply where the settlor electsto pay tax ontrustee income pursuant to s .228(7). Severalcategories of electionare covered by the s.228(7)procedureincluding elec- tions which can bemade in the circumstances specified in s.226A. Thus,the s.228(5)(b)exception will not apply wherea settlor of a foreign trust who becomesresidentin NewZealand elects to 88 • pay tax on trusteeincome in accordance with s.226A and s .228(7). Elections under s.228(7) to pay tax on trustee incomecan be made by the settlor, trustee or beneficiary. When the election is made by the trustee orbeneficiary,and notby the settlor, the settlor will continueto be exempted from liabilityfor tax on trustee income if the terms of s.228(5)(b) are satisfied. Limitation of liability: s .228(5)(c) (a) Requirements and application 10.64 Section 228(5)(c) may limit the liability of settlors where there is more than one settlor of the trust. It provides that a settlor is not liable to income tax on trustee income to the extent that the settler can establish to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the liability of that settlor exceeds the liability which that settlor should bear in comparison with other persons who have made a settlement on the trust . In determining whether liability should be limited the Commissioner is required to have regard to settlements made on the trust by all settlors. 10.65 Section 228(5)(c) may apply where the settlors are all resident in New Zealand and the settlors prefer an apportionment of liability under that provision to the joint and several liability imposed by s.228(4). It may also apply where there is a mix of resident and non-resident settlors and the resident settlers seek to limit their liability to a proportionate share of the trustee income. 10.66 The relief granted by s.228(5)(c) applies only to the extent that the settler can establish to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the liability to income tax of that settlor exceeds the liability which that settlor should bear in comparison with other settlers. For s.228(5)(c) to apply the settlor must make full disclosure of all relevant facts. In determining whether the liability of a settlor should be limited the Commissioner must have regard to the respective settlements made by the settlor and by other settlors. Such a comparison maybe relatively simple if the settlements in question result from dispositions of property to the trust. In those circumstances the settlor's liability can be limited by applying either of the two following methods: (i) by determining, at the time of the settlement by the settlor, the proportion which the market value of the property settled by the settlor on the trust bears to the market value of the trust's net assets . The relevant propor- tion is determined at the time of the settle- ment and remains unchanged until a further settlement is made on the trust. When a further settlement is made on the trust the property settledearlier is revalued and the liability ofthe settlors is worked out by comparing the current values ofall property settled on the trust. (ii) by tracing the income attributable to the property settled on the trustby the settlor. 10.67 To illustrate the first me thod, assume that A and B each tr ansfer proper tywith a market value of $10,000 to a trust in year 1 and that in year 4 B transfersfurther property with a market value of $5,000 to the trust . Assume further that in year 4 the propertytransferredby A and B in year 1 has a market value of $15,000(i .e., the value of the trust propertyp ri or to the further se ttlement by B is $30,000). In these circumstances, the liabili ty of A and B for tax on trustee income in years 1 to 3 is calculated in each of those income years as - Trustee Income x 10 000 $20,000 In year 4the respective proportions oftrustee income forwhichA and B are liable are recalcu- lated by revaluing the property ori ginally cont rib- uted by A andB and by taking into account the additional settlement madeby B. The propor ti on of trustee income in respect of which A would be liable to income taxwould be - $15,000 =.43 (i .e., 43%) $35,000 B would be liable to income tax in respect of the remaining57% of the trustee income . 10.68 Where persons settle different types of property producing different returns the tracing approach may be more appropriate. This approach could be used, for example, if one settlor trans- ferred shares to the trust while another transferred land. In these circumstances it may be feasible to determine the liability of the settlors by allocating the income derived from the shares to the person who transferred the shares to the trust and by allocating the income derived from the land to the settler who contributed the land to the trust. 10.69 The examples discussed above assume quite simple fact patterns . In more complex cases where, for example, property settled by one settlor has been disposed of by the trustee, or where settle- ments have arisen by virtue of the contribution of property and the provision of services, it may not be possible to make a sensible comparison of the settlements for the purpose of s.228(5)(c). If this is the case s.228(5)(c) will not apply. The question of whether s.228(5)(c) can be applied will depend on the facts of each case. 89 (b) Limitation of liability and qualifying trust definition: s.228(5) proviso 10.70 The proviso to s.228(5) provides that s .228(5)(c) does not apply in determining the nature and extent of the obligations of the trustee of the trust and whether those obligations have been satisfied for the purposes of the definition of "qualifying trust" in s .226(1) and for the purposes of the application of that definition. 10 .71 Therefore, for the purpose of the "qualifying trust" definition if during any income year a settlor of the trust is resident in New Zealand the trustee will be liable for tax on the New Zealand and foreign source trustee income in terms of s .228(2) and s.228(3). If tax is not paid on the entire trustee income because the resident settler's liability to tax is limited by s.228(5)(c) the trust will not be a qualifying trust in relation to any distribution made from it. Trustee income arising from remittance of debt: s.228 5d 10.72 By s.228(5)(d), a settlor is not liable to income tax on trustee income to the extent that the trustee income is derived by virtue of the applica- tion of s.64B to s.64M to amounts remitted by the settlor under any financial arrangement where s.64F or s.64FA applies. 10 .73 In terms of the accruals legislation the remittance of a financial arrangement will gener- ally give rise to income in the hands of the issuer of the financial arrangement . Where the remittance of a financial arrangement gives rise to trustee income s.228(5)(d) exempts the settlor from liabil- ity to tax in respect of the trustee income thus arising. However, the trustee will remain liable to tax in respect of the trustee income arising from the remittance and if the trustee's obligations in relation to that liability are not satisfied the trust will not be a qualifying trust for distribution purposes . - Exceptions to trustee liability: s .228(6) Overview 10.74 Section 228(6) contains two exceptions to the rule in s.228(3) that, in the circumstances specified in s.228(3), a trustee is liable to income tax in respect of tr ustee income derived from outside New Zealand. The first exception is where the trustee is resident outside New Zealand at all times during the income year and no settlement has been made on the trust after 17 December 1987. The second exception is where the trustee is resident outside New Zealand at all times during the income year and the only settlements made on the trust have been made by settlors who at the time of settlement were not resident in New Zealand and who had not been resident since 17 December 1987. Neither exception applies where an election to pay tax on trustee income has been made by the trustee. Further, by the first proviso to s.228(6) nothing in s .228(6) affects the liability for income tax of any settlorof a trust, and by the second proviso to s .228(6) the trustee income remains liable to income tax for the purpose of determining whether the trust is a qualifying trust. No settlement after 17 December 1987 10 .75 Section 228(6) provides that where in any income year a trustee would be liable to income tax pursuant to s .228(3) in respect of trustee in- come derived from outside New Zealand the trustee is not so liable if no settlement has been made to or for the benefit of the trust or on the terms of the trust since 17 December 1987 . 10 .76 The exception applies only with respect to income derived from outside New Zealand . The trustee remains liable to income tax on trustee income derived from New Zealand. The exception ties in with s.228(4) . Section 228(4) imposes a liability to income tax on a settlor of a trust only if a settlement has been made on the trust since 17 December 1987 . Thus, where no settlement has been made on a trust since 17 December 1987 the settlor of the trust is not liable to income tax on the trustee income and any non-resident trustee is not liable toi ncome tax on trusteeincomederived from outside New Zealand. 10 .77 The exception does not apply where the trustee is resident in New Zealand at any time during the relevant income year . In these circum- stances it is more likely that the tax will be col- lected from the trustee and it is not appropriate to exempt the trustee from liability. 10.78 The exception does not apply where an election has been made by the trustee to pay income tax on trustee income. An election to pay income tax on trustee income can be made by any settlor, trustee or beneficiary of the trust. Thus, where the election is made by a settlor or by a beneficiary, and not by the trustee, the exemption provided for trustees by s .228(6) will still apply. Settlements made when settlor non-residen t 10 .79 Section 228(6) also provides that a trustee is not liable to tax on trustee income derived from outside New Zealand where the only settlements made on the trust have been made by settlors who 90 at the time of settlement were not resident in New Zealand and who had not been resident in New Zealand at any time since 17 December 1987. 10.80 This exception ties in with the exception from liability to tax on trustee income afforded by s.228(5)(b) to settlors of foreign trusts who become resident in New Zealand . Thus, where settlements have been made on the trust by non-residents any settlor who becomes resident in New Zealand only is not liable to income tax on trustee income and any trustee is not liable to income tax on trustee income derived from outside New Zealand . 10.81 As with the exception applying to trusts where no settlements have been made after 17 December 1987, the exception with respect to trusts settled by non-residents only applies if the trustee is resident outside New Zealand at all times during the income year. Further, the excep- tion does not apply if the trustee makes an election to pay income tax on trustee income. Limitations on application of s.228(6): s.228(6) provisos 10.82 The application of the exceptions in s.228(6) is limited by two provisos. The first proviso states that s.228(6) does not affect the liability to income tax of any settlor of the trust . Thus, for example, if a settlor of a trust on which no settlement has been made after 17 December 1987 elects in accordance with s.227A to pay tax on trustee income the liability of the settlor to pay tax on trustee income is not affected by the fact that pursuant to s .228(6) the trustee may not be liable for tax on trustee income derived from outside New Zealand. 10.83 The second proviso states that for the purpose of determining whether a trust is a quali- fying trust the trustee income of thetrust remains liable to income tax ands.228(6) does not apply in determining whether the trustee's obligations in relation to that liability have been satisfied . Thus, where the trustee is exempted from income tax on trustee income derived fromoutside NewZealand by virtue of s.228(6) that exemption is irrelevant in determiningwhetherthe trust is a qualifying trust in relation to distributions made from the trust. 10.84 Consequently, where a settlor of a trust is resident in New Zealand at any time during an income year and no settlements have been made on the trust after 17 December 1987, or settlements were made when the settlor was resident outside New Zealand, the trust will be a non-qualifying trust in relation to distributions unless tax is paid on the trustee income . As the settlor will not be liable to income tax in respect of the trustee income by virtue of s.228(5), and the trustee will not be liable to income tax on trustee income derived from outside New Zealand by virtue of s .228(6), the trust will only be a qualifying trust in relation to distributions if an election to pay tax on trustee income is made in accordance with s.228(7) and if the obligations to pay tax on the trustee income are subsequently satisfied. Elections topaytax on trustee income: s.22.8(7) Overview 10.85 Section 228(7) provides that any trustee, settlor or beneficiary of a trust may, in relation to any income year, furnish to the Commissioner within the prescribed period for furnishing an annual return of income for that income year, or within such other period as may be specified in s.226A and s .227A, an election to pay tax on trustee income for that income year or from the date of the election . If an election is made, the person making the election is assessable and liable to income tax on the trustee income and the election applies in respect of the income year in relation to which the election is made or from the date of the election, and in respect of all succeeding income years. Application 10 .86 Elections to pay tax on trustee income may be made under s .228(7) in three situations. The first is where a settlor of a trust becomes resident in New Zealand and the trust would have been a foreign trust in relation to a distribution made from the trust on the day immediately preceding the day on which the settlor became resident. In these circumstances any trustee, settlor or benefici- ary of the trust may, by virtue of s .226A, elect in accordance with s .228(7) to pay tax on trustee income within 12 months of the later of 31 May 1989 or the day on which the settlor became resident (s.226A is discussed in Part 7 of this bulletin). 10.87 The second situation where an election may be made under s .228(7) is where a trust was first settled on or before 17 December 1987 . In these circumstances s.227A empowers any trustee, settlor or beneficiary to elect in accordance with s.228(7) to pay tax on trustee income before 31 May 1989 (s .227A is discussed in Part 9 of this bulletin). 10.88 Finally, s .228(7) permits any trustee, settlor or beneficiary of a trust to elect to pay tax on trustee income in any other situation where the trustee, settlor or beneficiary considers it appropri- ate to make an election . For example, if a person who settled a trust while resident in New Zealand ceases to be resident trustee income derived from outside New Zealand ceases to be liable to incom e 91 tax from the income year in which the settlor is not at any time resident in New Zealand. The trust will therefore cease to be a qualifying trust from that income year because a portion of the trustee income ceases to be liable to income tax. To avoid that consequence the trustee, settlor or beneficiary may consider it appropriate to elect to pay tax on trustee income from the income year in which the settlor is first not resident in New Zealand at any time. Persons who may make s.228(7) election 10.89 Section 228(7) permits any trustee, settlor or beneficiaryof a trust toelect to pay tax on trustee income. Elections may be made individually by trustees,settlors or beneficiaries or they may be made jointly by any combination of trustees, settlors or beneficiaries. 10.90 An election may bemade under s.228(7) whether or not the person making the election is otherwise liable to income tax on the trustee income. For example, if a settlor of a trust that is a foreign trust in relation to distributions becomes resident in New Zealand, andthereis a trustee of the trust resident in New Zealand, the trustee may make a s.228(7) election although the trustee is already liable to pay tax on trustee income under s.228(2) and s.228(3). In this situation, if the trust is to be treated as a qualifying trust in relation to distributions of income and capital gains derived after the expiry of twelve months from the date on which the settlor became resident in New Zealand an election must be made in accordance with s.226A ands.228(7)topaytax on trustee income. If the resident trustee makes the election this relieves the settlor and the beneficiary of the decision as to whether to make the election themselves. At the same time, it satisfies the requirement of s.226A that an election must be made if the tr ust is to be treated as a qualifying trust in relation to distribu- tions of income and gains derived after the final date for an election. Time for making an election 10.91 An election under s.228(7) must be made within the prescribed period for furnishing an annual return of income for the income year in relation to which the election is first made or within such other period as may be specified in s .226A and s.227A. 10.92 The period specified for making an election in accordance with s.226A is twelve months from the later of 31 May 1989 or the day on which the settlor first became resident in New Zealand. The period specified for making an election in accor- dance with s.227A is the period falling on and before 31 May 1989. 10.93 Where a s.228(7) election is not made for the purposes of s.226A or s .227A it must be made within the prescribed period for furnishing a return of income for the income year in relation to which the election is first made. For example, if the settlor ceases to be resident in New Zealand during the income year ending 31 March 1990, and the trustee wants to ensure that the trust remains a qualifying trust by electing to pay tax on trustee income, the trustee would be required to furnish a s .228(7) election to the Commissioner within the period for furnishing a return of income for the income year ending 31 March 1991. It would not be necessary to make an election in relation to the income year ending 31 March 1990 because the trustee income would in any event be liable to New Zealand tax by virtue of the settlor being resident for a part of that income year. Effect of election 10.94 The effect of a s .228(7) election is that the elector is liable to income tax on the trustee income derived by the trustee and the election applies in respect of the income year for which the election was made, or from the date of the election, and in respect of all succeeding income years . 10 .95 The person making the election will be liable to income tax in respect of the trustee income from the date of the election where the election is made in accordance with s .226A or s .227A . In other cases where a s .228(7) election is made the elector will be liable to tax in respect of the trustee income de- rived in the entire income year to which the election relates . 10 .96 An election under s.228(7) applies in respect of the income year for which the election was made, or from the date of the election, and in respect of all succeeding income years . There is no provision for an election to be revoked. Once an election has been made the elector thereafter remains liable to income tax in respect of the trustee income. If the obligations to pay tax on the trustee income are not satisfied in a later income year the trust will cease to be a qualifying trust for distribution purposes. PART 11: TRUSTSBECOMING SUBJECT TO TAX Overview of s.228 A 11.1 In a number of instances the trustee income derived by the trustees of a trust will become subject to New Zealand income tax some time after the trust was first established. This will occur, for example, if the trust was settled by a person who was not resident in New Zealand at the time 92 of settlement where an election to pay tax on trustee income is made in accordance with s.226A and s.228(7) when the settlor subsequently be- comes resident in New Zealand. Similarly, it will occur if property was settled by a resident on the terms of a trust with non-resident trustees before 17 December 1987 where an election to pay tax on trustee income is made in accordance with s.227A and s.228(7) . In these circumstances, it is necessary for New Zealand tax purposes to establish opening values for trading stock and depreciable assets owned by the trust, and to ensure that income or expenses which would have been accrued in relation to financial arrangements held or issued by the trust if the trustee income had been liable to New Zealand income tax are not accrued after the trustee income becomes liable to income tax. This is achieved by the rules contained in s.228A. Application of s.228A(1) 11.2 Section 228A(1) applies where, in relation to any trust and any income year, the trustee income of the trust becomes liable at any date to New Zealand income tax and immediately before that date the trustee income was not liable to New Zealand income tax other than as non-resident withholding income. 11.3 Section 228A(1) also applies where the trustee income of the trust was previously liable to New Zealand income tax as non-resident with- holding income and subsequently becomes liable to New Zealand income tax other than as non- resident withholding income. For example, if the trustee income of a trust settled by a non-resident included interest paid by a New Zealand resident company the interest would cease to be liable to income tax as non-resident withholding income if the settlor and trustee became resident in New Zealand and an election was made in accordance with s.226A and s.228(7) to pay tax on trustee income. 11 .4 Section 228A will apply also where a portion of the trustee income was previously liable to New Zealand income tax while another portion was not, and the portion of income which was not previ- ously liable to income tax becomes liable . In this situation, s.228A will apply only in relation to the assets and financial arrangements employed in producing the income which was not previously liable to income tax. For example, if the trustee of a trust settled by a non-resident derived business profits from within and outside New Zealand only the profits derived from New Zealand would be liable to income tax . However, if the settlor be- came resident in New Zealand and an election was made to pay tax on trustee income both the New Zealand and foreign business profits would be liable to income tax. In these circumstances, s .228A would applyin re lation to the assets and financial arrangements used to produce the fo re ign source business profits. Premises, plant, machinery,equipment and trading stock 11S Section 228A(1)(a) establishes the method for determining the "cost" of premises, plant, machinery, equipment and trading stock on the date on which the trustee income becomes liable to New Zealand income tax. In the case of premises, plant, machinery, and equipment the "cost" thus determined forms the basis for depreciation allow- ances which are allowable under the Income Tax Act in calculating trustee income. With respect to trading stock, the "cost" determined under s.228A establishes an opening value of the trading stock for the purpose of applying the trading stock pro- visions. 11.6 Two methods are prescribed for calculating the cost of the premises, plant, machinery, equip- ment or trading stock. The person who is liable to income tax on trustee income has an option to apply either method. The person who is liable to pay tax on the trustee income should indicate the option which is taken in the return of income furnished in relation to the trustee income. 11.7 Under the first method the person may use the historical cost of the asset, less accumulated depreciation, or other value at that date used for the purpose of income tax calculations in any country or territory in which the trustee income has been liable to income tax. That is, the person may elect to use the depreciated basis or other value of the asset which is used for the purpose of income tax calculations in another country. The relevant date will probably fall within the income year used for the purposes of calculating income tax in the other country. If so, it will be necessary to calculate the depreciated value by apportioning the depreciation allowed in the foreign country in the relevant income year to the periods before and after the relevant date . It will also be necessary to value the trading stock on the relevant date ac- cording to the methods used for income tax pur- poses in the foreign country, even though an actual valuation is not required for the purpose of the foreign country's tax laws on that date. 11.8 For the first method to be available the trustee income must have been liable to income tax in another country or territory and the asset must have a value (whether historical cost less deprecia- tion or any other value) for the purposes of income tax calculations in that country or territory. 11.9 Under the second method, the person may use the value which would be used for the pur- 93 poses of the Income Tax Act at the relevant date if the trustee income had at all times been liable to income tax under the Income Tax Act other than only as non-resident withholding income . Thus, in the case of premises, plant, machinery and equip- ment the "cost" is calculated: (i) first, by establishing the value of the asset which would have been used for New Zealand depreciation purposes when the asset was first employed in income producing activities if the income from those activities had been liable to New Zealand tax; and (ii) second, by deducting from the original depreciation basis calculated under (i) the aggregate amount of depreciation which would have been allowed as a deduction up to the date on which the trustee income became liable to New Zealand income tax if during the period the asset was used to produce trustee income which was not liable to New Zealand income tax the asset had been used in producing trustee income which was liable to New Zealand income tax. 11 .10 With respect to trading stock, the person may use any of the three valuation methods pre- scribed in s .85 to obtain a value on the date on which the trustee income became liable to New Zealand income tax. 11 .11 For the purposes of the second method of establishing cost specified in s.228A(1) it is as- sumed that the trustee income of the trust had at all times been liable to New Zealand income tax. This does not mean that it is assumed that the asset was atall times located in New Zealand and that therefore special rates of depreciation available in respect of activities carried on in New Zealand are applicable . Thus, if the asset was used in carrying on a business in Hong Kong the depreciation is calculated by assuming that the trustee income derived from the Hong Kong business was always liable to New Zealand income tax and that depre- ciation was allowed in the amount which would have applied on the basis of the asset being located in Hong Kong. Financial arrangements 11.12 Section 228A(1)(b) provides a method for calculating the acquisition price of a financial arrangement at the date on which the trustee income becomes liable to New Zealand income tax . The acquisition price thus determined is then used in calculating the base price adjustment under s .64F in relation to the financial arrangement when it matures, or when it is remitted, sold or other- wise transferred. The objective of adjusting the ac- quisition price is to ensure that income or expenses which would have been accrued in relation to the financial arrangement in the period before the date on which the trustee income became liable to New Zealand income tax if the trustee income had been liable to income tax are not accrued in the period succeeding the date on which the trustee income became liable to income tax . 11.13 There are two options which those who are liable to income tax in respect of the trustee income may adopt in establishing the acquisition price . The first is the market value of the financial ar- rangement on the date on which the trustee in- come became liable to New Zealand income tax . The second is the "adjusted base price" . The ad- justed base price of a financial arrangement on the date on which the trustee income became liable to New Zealand income tax is defined in relation to an issuer of a firtancial arrangement as the acquisi- tion price of the financial arrangement plus all accrued expenditure incurred by the issuer less consideration paid by the issuer in relation to the financial arrangement before that date. The ad- justed base price is defined in relation to a holder of a financial arrangement as the acquisition price of the financial arrangement plus all accrued income derived by the holder less consideration received by the holder in respect of the financial arrangement prior to the relevant date . 11 .14 The acquisition price referred to in the definition of "adjusted base price" is the original acquisition price of the financial arrangement in relation to the person. The terms "accrued expen- diture incurred" and the "accrued income de- rived" are not defined in the legislation. However, they constitute the expenditure which would have been incurred and the income which would have been derived if the trustee income had been liable to New Zealand income tax and if the accruals leg- islation contained in s .64B to s.64M had applied with respect to the financial arrangement from the date of its acquisition or issue . 11.15 The acquisition price calculated under s.228A(1)(b) is taken into account as item b of the formula in s.64F(2) when calculating the base price adjustment in relation to the financial arrange- ment. Exceptions to s.228A(1): s .228A(2) 11.16 Section 228A(2) provides that s.228A(l) does not apply in two situations where the trustee income was not liable to New Zealand income tax in the period before the date on which the trustee income became liable to New Zealand income tax . The first is where there was no liability to income tax solely because the trustee derived no income i n 94 the period preceding the date on which the trustee income became liable to New Zealand income tax. The second is where there was no liability solely because the deductions allowable under the Income Tax Act exceeded income derived by the trustee in the period before the trustee income became liable to income tax or losses carried forward pursuant to s .188 exceeded the income derived by the trustee in the period before the trustee income became liable to income tax . 11.17 In these circumstances if there had been trustee income derived by the trustees it would have been liable to New Zealand income tax. Consequently, the assets of the trust would already have values attached to them for the purpose of calculating New Zealand income tax and it would not be appropriate to apply the rules in s.228A(1). PART 12: RENTS, ROYALTIES AND INTEREST DERIVED BY MAORI TRUSTEE 12 .1 Section 229 provides that to the extent that rent, royalty, or interest income derived by the Maori Trustee in the Maori Trustee's capacity as collecting and distribution agent for such income is not also beneficiary income, the Maori Trustee is assessable and liable for income tax on that income as if the Maori Trustee were beneficially entitled thereto. 12.2 This provision is carried over largely un- changed from the previous trust taxation regime and ties in with the taxation of Maori Authorities (which include the Maori Trustee) under s.234 to s.240. The taxation treatment of Maori Authorities is outside the scope of this bulletin and is not con- sidered any further. PART 13: DISTRIBUTIONS FROM TRUST S Overview of s.230 13.1 By s.227(1) beneficiaries of trusts are re- quired to include taxable distributions in their assessable income. The expression "taxable distri- bution" is defined in s.226(1). In relation to a foreign trust a distribution is a taxable distribution to the extent that it does not constitute beneficiary income or a distribution of capital profits or gains or corpus . In relation to a non-qualifying trust a distribution is a taxable distribution to the extent that it does not constitute beneficiary income or a distribution of corpus. 13.2 As distributions of corpus and capital profits or gains from foreign trusts and distribu- tions of corpus from non-qualifying trusts are not taxable distributions opportunities could arise for avoiding or deferring tax on amounts accumulated in such trusts by distributing taxable amounts to non-resident beneficiaries or by distributing non- taxable amounts before taxable amounts. The rules contained in s.230 are intended to limit opportuni- ties for manipulating distributions from non- qualifying and foreign trusts in this manner. This is achieved by overriding the provisions of the trust deed or the exercise of the trustee's discretion as to the characterisation of distributions from non-qualifying and foreign trusts and by provid- ing a series of ordering rules that determine the order in which amounts are deemed to have been distributed from such trusts. 13.3 Section 230(1) contains the ordering rules which apply to distributions to beneficiaries. It provides that distributions are deemed to consist of the following amounts in the following order: (i) income derived by the trustee in the income year in which the distribution is made ; (ii) income derived by thetrustee in earlier income years; (iii) capital profits or gains derived in the income year in which the distribution is made; (iv) capital profits or gains derived in earlier income years; (v) corpus. 13.4 Section 230(2) specifies the circumstances in which the ordering rules contained in s.230(1) do not apply. These are: where the trust is a qualify- ing trust; where the trust is a specified type of non- discretionary trust; where the distribution is a distribution by virtue of paragraphs (a) and (b) of the definition of "distribution"; and where s.226A(2) applies to the trust . Section 230(3) pro- vides that to the extent to which the records maintained in relation to any trust do not permit the s .230 ordering rules to be applied with respect to a distribution the distribution is treated as a taxable distribution . Section 230(4) contains an anti-avoidance rule whereby income or capital profits distributed to one beneficiary are not treated as having been distributed to that benefici- ary if the effect is that any part of a distribution to another beneficiary is not treated as a taxable distribution. This rule does not apply where the distribution to the beneficiary was made in a bona fide transaction which placed the amount distrib- uted beyond the possession and control of the trustee provided that the transaction does not constitute a settlement. 95 Ordering rules: s.230(1) Distribution to consist of current year's income (a) Description of the rule 13 .5 Section 230(1)(a) provides that a distribution made to a beneficiary during an income year is deemed to consist of the income derived by the trustee in that income year. This rule applies whether or not the income was also beneficiary income when derived by the trustee. The rule does not apply where the income was deemed pursuant to s.230 to be part of an earlier or contemporane- ous distribution. (b) Section 230(1)(a) and calculation of beneficiary income 13.6 Section 230(1)(a) deems the distribution to be made from income derived in the income year in which the distribution is made whether the income is beneficiary income when derived or otherwise. The applicationofs.230(1)(a)may determine whether a distribution constitutes beneficiary income. If the distribution involves the vesting or payment or application of an amount derived by the trustee, it will be beneficiary in- come if s.230(1)(a) deems the amount thus vested or paid or applied to be income derived by the trustee in the income year during which the distribution was made . Thus, amounts which would be beneficiary income if s.230(1)(a) were not applied may be deemed not to be beneficiary income by application of that provision . 13.7 For example, if during an income year the trustee of a non-qualifying trust derived $100 income and $100 capital profit, and the $100 capital gain was paid to the non-resident beneficiary on 1 February and the $100 income was paid to the resident beneficiary on 1 March, the $100 payment to the resident beneficiary would ordinarily be treated as beneficiary income. However, the effect of s .230(1)(a) is that the $100 payment to the non- resident beneficiary is deemed to consist of the $100 income derived by the trustee and the $100 payment to the resident beneficiary is deemed to consist of the $100 capital gain derived by the trustee (assuming that there is no income from prior years accumulated by the trustee which would be deemed to be distributed before the current year's capital gain). Therefore, the distribu- tion to the resident beneficiary would be a taxable distribution rather than beneficiary income. 13 .8 The language in parentheses in s.230(1)(a) provides that the amount taken into account in applying that provision includes amounts which are beneficiary income when derived. The refer- ence to beneficiary income in this context means amounts which are beneficiary income in terms of the trust or in terms of the exercise of the trustee's discretion. The question of whether a distribution finally constitutes beneficiary income is deter- mined after s .230(1) has been applied. (c) Earlier and contemporaneous distributions 13.9 When s .230(1)(a) is applied to determine the constituent elements of a distribution, income deemed pursuant to s .230 to have constituted part of any earlier or contemporaneous distribution from the trust in that income year is deducted from the income derived by the trustee in that income year . Thus, once income is deemed to have been included in an earlier or contemporaneous distri- bution in that income year it is not thereafter available to characterise any other distributions . In the case of contemporaneous distributions it may be necessary for the trustee to determine how the current year income is spread among the distribu- tions . This will not be important if the contempora- neous distributions do not exceed the total income derived by the trustee in the income year in which the distribution was made. However, where the contemporaneous distributions do exceed the current year income it will be necessary to estab- lish how the current year income is spread among the distributions. As no method is prescribed by the statute the method of spreading the income will be a matter for the trustee to establish. (d) Method ofcalculating income 13.10 Section 230(1)(a) deems the distribution to consist of "income" derived by the trustee in the income year during which the distribution is made. "Income" in this context means income calculated according to the rules contained in the Income Tax Act. It does not mean income calcu- \]ated according to the rules which apply in any other country where the income derived by the trustee is liable to income tax . Distributionto consist of prior years' income 13.11 Section 230(1)(b) provides that to the extent to which the distribution exceeds the amount specified in s.230(1)(a) it is deemed to consist of income, apart from beneficiary income, derived by the trustee in preceding income years during which the trust was in existence . Amounts which are deemed to have constituted part of any earlier or contemporaneous distribution are excluded from the pool of income available for characteris- ing the distribution under s .230(1)(b) . 13.12 Therefore, the amount available for charac- tensing a distribution under s.230(1)(b) is the aggregate of the income derived by the trustee in income years preceding the income year in which 96 the distribution is made less amounts which con- stituted beneficiary income with respect to those earlier income years and less any other amounts previously or contemporaneously distributed. 13.13 To the extent that the distribution does consist of income derived by the trustee in preced- ing income years it willbe a taxabledist ri bution as defined in s .226(1).However, to the extentthat the distribution is deemed to consist of income de- rived bythe trustee in incomeyears commencing before1 April 1988 the distributionwill not be treated as a taxable distributionby virtue of the provisoto s.9 of the IncomeTax Amendment Act (No 5) 1988( s.9 is discussed in Part 3 of this bulle- tin). Distribution to consist of current year's capital MAIMS 13.14 Section 230(1)(c) provides that to the extent that the distribution exceeds the amounts specified in s.230(1)(a) and (b) it is deemed to consist of profits derived during the income year in which the distribution is made from the realisation of a capital asset or from any other capital profit or capital gain realised during that income year by the trustee less any capital loss suffered by the trust in that income year. Capital profits, gains and losses which are required to be taken into account under the Income Tax Act for the purpose of assessing income tax are not included in the amount to which s.230(1)(c) applies . These amounts are taken into account in calculating the amount of income available to characterise the distribution under s.230(1)(a). For example, capital profits on the sale of land to which s.67 would apply are taken into account in calculating the income to which s.230(1)(a) applies. 13 .15 The profits taken into account under s.230(1)(c) are those which are derived from the "realisation" of a capital asset or from any other capital gain or profit "realised" during the income year. A capital gain or profit will be realised when it has been converted into money or money's worth. A capital gain or profit which has accrued but which has not been converted into money or money's worth will not be realised. Realised capital profits and gains are reduced by capital losses suffered during the income year in which the distribution was made. The expression "suf- fered" is taken to mean endured or sustained and a loss will be suffered during an income year to the extent that it is realised during that income year . 13.16 Ifthe trusteedistributes an appreciated asset to a beneficiaryin speciethe distribution will constitutearealisationof the capital profit or gain accrued onthe assetprior to distribution. This is because the distributiondischarges any claim of the beneficiaryagainstthe propertyof the trust. As an in specie distribution of an appreciated asset realises the profit or gain accrued in respect of the asset the realised profit or gain willbeavailable to characterisethe distribution and any other distri- butions from the trust. Distribution to consist of prior years' capital profits 13.17 Section 230(1)(d) provides that to the extent to which the distribution exceeds the amounts specified in s.230(1)(a), (b), and (c) it shall be deemed to consist of profits derived in preceding income years from the realisation of a capital asset or from any other capital profit or capital gain realised during preceding income years less any capital losses suffered during such preceding income years. 13.18 Where the distribution is made by a foreign trust it will not be a taxable distribution to the extent that it is deemed to consist of capital gains derived during the income year in which the distribution is made or in preceding income years: s.226(1) "taxable distribution" definition (note in this context that capital profits or gains realised in transactions with associated persons are treated as income for the purpose of the taxable distribution definition: s .226(11)) . However, if the trust is a non-qualifying trust the distribution will be a taxable distribution to the extent that it is deemed to consist of prior years' income and current and prior years' capital gains. This is subject to the proviso to s .9 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 5) 1988. That provision (discussed in Part 3 of this bulletin) states that distributions of income or capital profits or gains derived in income years commencing before 1 April 1988 are not assessable for income tax. Distribution to consist of corpus 13.19 Section 230(1)(e) provides that to the extent that the distribution exceeds the amounts specified in s.230(1)(a), (b), (c), and (d) it is deemed to consist of corpus of the trust. The definition of "corpus" in s .226(1) is relevant in this context. In terms of that definition certain amounts settled on trust are excluded from corpus. Time of application of s .230(1 ) 13.20 Section 230(1) is applied on an end of year basis . That is, a distribution is not characterised under s.230(l) at the time at which it is made. Rather, it is characterised at the end of the income year in which it is made by reference to the total income and capital gains derived in that income year and in previous income years . Section 230(1) is applied individually to each distribution in the order in which it was made . As s.230(1) is applied 97 to each distribution the amounts available under that provision to classify other distributions are reduced to reflect the fact that such amounts have already been used to characterise distributions. Exceptions to s.230(1): s .230(2) Distributions from qualifying trusts 13.21 Section 230(2)(a) provides that s.230(1) does not apply to any distribution from a trust which is a qualifying trust. Where the trust is a qualifying trustin relation to the distribution the concluding languageof s.230(2)provides that the distribution is deemed to consist of such amounts as reflect the terms of the trust or the terms of the exercise of the discretion of the trustee. 13.22 Section 230(1) does not apply to distribu- tionsfromqualifying trusts because a trust will only be a qualifying trust if all trustee income has been liable to income tax and the trustee's obliga- tions in relation to that liability have been satisfied. As the income will be taxed either to the benefici- ary as beneficiary income or to the trustee as trustee income it is not necessary to apply the ordering rules to limit opportunities for manipula- tion of distributions. Distributions from non-discretionary trust s 13.23 Section 230(2)(b) provides that s.230(1) does not apply to distributions from three categories of trust where the trustee has no discretion as to the source, nature and amount of distributions to beneficiaries. These are : first, trusts created by will or codicil or by order of Court varying or modify- ing the provisions of any will or codicil ; second, trusts created on any intestacy or partial intestacy; and third, trusts on which no settlement has been made since 17 December 1987 . The concluding language of s.230(2) provides that distributions from these trusts are deemed to consist of such amounts as reflect the terms of the trust. 13 .24 In these circumstances there is less scope for distributions to be manipulated deliberately to avoid New Zealand income tax. First, the trusts in question are non-discretionary so that the trustee has no discretion to direct distributions to benefici- aries in a manner which results in the avoidance of New Zealand tax. Second, the trusts are of a type where it is unlikely that the provisions governing distributions would have been structured with a view towards avoiding New Zealand tax. Non- discretionary trusts on which a settlement has been made after 17 December 1987 (apart from those created by will or codicil or on any intestacy or partial intestacy) are outside the scope of the exception . If this were not the case it would be possible to create non-discretionary trusts, or to use non-discretionarytrusts establishedbefore 17 December 1987, to avoid the s.230(1) ordering rules. 13.25 As s.230(2)(a) provides that s.230(1)does not apply to distributionsfrom qualifying trusts, s .230(2)(b) effectivelyoperates to provide an exceptionin relation to distributionsfromforeign trusts andnon-qualifyingtrusts only. Distributions where property disposed of to beneficiary, or where services provided by trustee, at less than market value 13 .26 Section 230(2)(c) provides that s.230(1) does not apply to any distribution which would not be deemed to be a distribution but for the application of paragraphs (a) and (b) of the definition of "distribution" in s.226(1) . Paragraph (a) of that definition provides that where property of the trust is disposed of or made available to a benefici- ary for less than market value there is a distribu- tion to the extent that the property was disposed of or made available to the beneficiary at below market value . Paragraph (b) of the definition of "distribution" provides that where the trustee has provided services to a beneficiary for less than market value there is a distribution to the extent that the services were provided to the beneficiary for less than market value. 13 .27 In the case of distributions to which s .230(2)(c) applies there may be no amounts derived by the trustee which correspond to the distribution made to the beneficiary . For example, although it is appropriate to provide that there is a distribution where property is made available to a beneficiary at below market value there may be no income or capital gains derived by the trustee which corresponds to the making available of that property by the trustee . Accordingly, it would not be appropriate to apply the ordering rules because the distribution is not actually out of income, gains or corpus. 13 .28 The concluding language of s.230(2) pro- vides that where a distribution is specified in s.230(2)(c) the ordering rules in s.230(1) do not apply in relation to the distribution. In these circumstancesit isprovided that the distribution is a taxable distribution. This rule only applies if the distribution is not of a type specified in any of the other paragraphs of s.230(2). For example, if a distribution of the type described in paragraph (a) or (b) of the "distribution" definition is made from a qualifying trust the s.230(1) ordering rules do not apply with respect to the distribution by virtue of s.230(2)(a). Thus, the operation of the ordering rules is excluded by s .230(2)(a) rather than by s.230(2)(c). Accordingly, the concluding language to s.230(2) does not make the distribution a taxabl e 98 distribution. This is because a distribution is a taxable distribution by virtue of the concluding language only if the s.230(1) ordering rules do not apply to the distribution pursuant to s.230(2)(c). The concluding language does not operate to make a distribution a taxable distribution where the ordering rules do not apply to a distribution by virtue of one of the other paragraphs of s .230(2) . Distribution from trust to which s.226A applies 13.29 Section 230(2)(d) provides that s .230(1) does not apply to a distribution from a trust to which s.226A(2) applies except where the trust is deemed to be a non-qualifying trust pursuant to s.226A(2)(b). Section 226A(2) applies where a settlor of a foreign trust becomes resident in New Zealand and an election is made in accordance with s.228(7) to pay tax on trustee income . In these circumstances s .226A(2) provides that for the purpose of the definition of the term "taxable distribution" the trust is deemed to be a foreign trust to the extent that any distribution from the trust consists of income, capital profits or capital gains derived before the date on which the election was made, and a qualifying trust to the extent that any distribution consists of income, capital profits or capital gains derived by the trustee after the date on which the election was made . Where in respect of the incomeyear in which the election was made, or in any subsequent income year, the trustee's obligations are not satisfied the trust is deemed to be a non-qualifying trust in relation to any distributions made in that income year. 13 .30 Thus, where the settlor of a foreign trust becomes resident in New Zealand and an election is made to pay tax on trustee income the ordering rules contained in s.230(1) do not apply in deter- mining whether any distribution from the trust consists of income, capital profits or capital gains derived before or after the date on which the election was made. In these circumstances the concluding language of s.230(2) provides that the distribution is deemed to consist of such amounts as reflect the terms of the trust or the terms of the exercise of the discretion of the trustee. Inadequate records: s.230(3) 13 .31 Section 230(3) provides that a distribution from atrust is ataxable distribution to the extent that the recordsmaintainedin respect of the trust do not permit s.230(1) to be applied accurately to determine the constituent elements of the distribu- tion. 13.32 Section 230(3) applies subject to s.230(2). Thus, it does not apply where the s.230(1) ordering rules do notapply pursuant to s.230(2). Section 230(3) applies to the extent to which the records maintained in relation to any trust do not permit s.230(1) to be applied accurately to determine the constituent elements of a distribution. If, for ex- ample, the trust records were sufficient to indicate accurately that a portion of the distribution was income derived by the trustee during the income year in which the distribution was made s.230(1) will be applied to classify that portion of the distri- bution as beneficiary income. However, if the records did not permit s.230(1) to be applied in relation to the remainder of the distribution that remaining portion of the distribution would be a taxable distribution. Distributions to other beneficiaries : s .230(4) Overview 13.33 Section 230(4) provides that in determining the constituent elements of a distribution made to a beneficiary no amount of income, capital profits or gains derived by the trustee is treated as having been distributed to any other beneficiary of the trust if the effect is that any part or all of the distribution would be treated as not being a taxable distribution . This rule does not apply where the amount distributed to the other benefici- ary was distributed in a bona fide transaction which placed the whole of the amount beyond the possession and control of the trustee in the trustee's capacity as trustee of that trust, so long as that transaction did not itself constitute a settle- ment. 13.34 The object of this provision is tolimit oppor- tunities for distributing non-taxable amounts to beneficiaries who are assessable for tax on taxable distributions by distributing taxable amounts to beneficiaries who are not taxable in relation to such amounts . This could occur, for example, where in the case of a foreign trust income was distributed to non-resident beneficiaries and capital gains were distributed to resident benefici- aries. The s.230(1) ordering rules would not pre- vent the streaming of income and capital gains in this manner if the distribution to the non-resident was made before the distribution to the resident. In this situation s.230(4) will treat the income as not having been distributed to the non-resident benefi- ciary and such income will therefore be available for the purpose of determining the constituent elements of the distribution made to the resident beneficiary. Section 230(4) will not apply if, as will usually be the case, the distribution was made in a bona fide transaction which placed the whole of the amount beyond the possession and control of the trustee in the trustee's capacity as trustee of that trust . However, this exception does not apply if the transaction constituted a settlement. 99 Application and effect 13 .35 Section 230(4) applies in relation to a distri- bution to a beneficiary where a distribution to any other beneficiary has the effect that all or part of the distribution to the beneficiary is not a taxable distribution . The important consideration is the effect of the distribution to the other beneficiary. The purpose of the trustee in making the distribu- tion to the otherbeneficiary is not relevant. In some circumstances a distribution to a beneficiary may not be a taxable distribution because taxable amounts have been distributed to another benefici- ary but at the same time it may notbeappropriate to apply s .230(4) because the distribution to the other beneficiary was a taxable distribution in relation to which the other beneficiary was liable to income tax . Section 230(4) does not be apply in these circumstances. 13 .36 Section 230(4) applies where the effect of a distribution being made to one beneficiary is that .any part or all" of a distribution to another benefi- ciary is not treated as a taxable distribution. Where s .230(4) applies the effect is that "no amount of income or capital profits or gains derived by the trustee of the trust shall be treated as having been distributed to any other beneficiary of that trust". 13 .37 This does not mean that the entire amount distributed to the other beneficiary is treated as not having been distributed . Rather, it means that the amount is treated as not being distributed if the effect of the distribution of that amount is that all or part of the distribution in question is not a taxable distribution . For example, if the distribu- tion of $100 by a trustee of a non-qualifying trust of to a non-resident beneficiary leaves only corpus in the trust, and a distribution of $80 is subse- quently made to a resident beneficiary, $80 of the distribution made to the non-resident beneficiary (not $100) is treated as not having been made to the non-resident beneficiary forthe purpose of applying s .230(1) with respect to the distribution to the resident beneficiary.If a further distribution of $50 is later made to the resident beneficiary, the additional $20 which was earlier distributed to the non-resident beneficiary (i.e., the $100 distributed less the $80 added back to the trust accounts in relation to the first distribution to the resident beneficiary) is then treated as not having been distributed for the purpose of applying s .230(1) in relation to the $50 distribution. 13 .38 Section 230(4) does not apply if the distribu- tion to the other beneficiary was made in a bona fide transaction which placed the whole of the amount distributed beyond the possession and control of the trustee in the trustee's capacity as trustee of that trust unless the transaction was itself a settlement . A transaction is bona fide if it is real and genuine to all intents and purposes :CIR v Simpson(1989) 11NZTC 6,140 . Thus, if amounts are distributed to a beneficiary in a transaction which is not real or genuine the amount thus distributed may be treated as not having been distributed for the purpose of s.230(4). 13 .39 The transaction must place the income beyond the possession and control of the trustee in the trustee's capacity as trustee of that trust. Thus, transactions of the type considered in CIR v Ward \[1970\] NZLR 1, where income was merely appro- priated to the beneficiary in the accounts of the trust, would not satisfy the exception to s.230(4) because the income would not be placed beyond the possession and control of the trustee . Similarly, where amounts are vested in a beneficiary but not paid out the exception to s.230(4) will not be satisfied. 13 .40 Even if the transaction is bona fide and places the amount beyond the possession and control of the trustee in the trustee's capacity as trustee of the trust, the amount will still be subject to s .230(4) if the transaction in question constitutes a settlement. For example, if the trustee of a for- eign trust settled all of the income derived by the trustee on a sub-trust for the benefit of a non- resident beneficiary, and then made a distribution to a resident beneficiary on the basis that only capital gains and corpus remained to be distrib- uted, the amount settled on the sub-trust would be treated as still being available for the purpose of applying s.230(1) to the distribution made to the resident beneficiary. Example Example13 Facts : The trustee of a non-qualifying trust vests $1,500 absolutely in interest in a non- resident beneficiary, A, on 1 October 1990. The trustee retains possession of the amount thus vested. On 1 November 1990 the trustee makes a distribution of $1,50 0 to a resident beneficiary, B . With respect to the income year ending 31 March 1991 the income, capital profits and corpus available for distribution are as follows: Year Ending IncomeCapltalProfitCorpus 31 March 1989 5005,000 31 March 1990 500 1,00 0 31 March 1991100 Totals 1,100 1,0005,000 Result: (i) The vestingof $1,500 in A consti tutes a distributionas defined in s.226(1) . 100 Ignoring s .230(4), the distribution of $1,500 to A would be deemed by s.230(1) to consist of the $1,100 income derived by the trustee in the income years ending 31 March 1989,1990, and 1991 and $400 of the capital profits derived in the income year ending 31 March 1990 . The amount thus distributed would no longer be available for the purpose of applying s.230(1) to the distribution to B . There- fore, the distribution to B would be deemed to consist of the remaining $600 of the capital profit derived in the income yearending 31 March 1990 and $900 of the corpus settled in the income year ending 31 March 1989. (ii) The effect of the distribution to A is therefore that a part of the distribution to B-i.e., the $900 which would be treated as a distribution of corpus if not for the application of s.230(4) - would not be treated as being a taxable distribution. Further, the $1,500 was not distributed to A in a transaction which placed that amount beyond the possession and control of the trustee of the trust because the amount was only vested in A but was not paid out to A. Therefore, s.230(4) applies for the purpose of determining the constituent elements of the distribu- tion to B. (iii) Section 230(4) is applied by treating $900 of the $1,100 income distributed to A as not having been distributed for the pur- pose of applying s.230(1) in relation to the distribution to B. Consequently, the distribution to B will be deemed to consist of $900 income derived by the trustee and $600 capital profits derived by the trustee . The entire distribution will thus be a taxable distribution. (iv) The income which pursuant to s.230(4) is deemed not to have been distributed will not include the $100 incomederived by the trustee during the income year ending 31 March 1991because the effect of that amount be ing distributed to A is not that a portion of the distribution to B is not a taxable distribution but rather that a portion does not constitute benefi- ciary income. Section 230(4) does not apply in this situation . However, if a further distri bution is made toB ina later income year the $100 will then be treated as not having been distributedto A if the effect of that distribution to A is that all or part of that later distribution does not constitute a taxable distribution. PART 14: DISCLOSURE Overviewof s.231 14.1 Section 231 requires a person who makes a settlement on a trust to disclose the settlement to the Commissioner in three circumstances: (i) First, wherea settlement was made on a non-qualifying trust on or before 31 May 1989 and the trustis s till in existence on 31 May 1989: s.231(1); (ii) Second, where a settlement was made on or after 17 December 1987 and at the time of settlement or at any time thereafter there is no resident trustee of the trust : s.231(2); (iii) Third, where the settlement was made by a nominee, or by a nominal settlor, who is deemed not to be a settlor of the trust under s.226(3): s.231(3) . 14.2 By s .231(4), the Commissioner is permitted to make default assessments in cases where a person has failed to disclose information required under s.231 or under s.17 of the Inland Revenue Department Act 1974, or if the person is unable to obtain sufficient information to calculate trustee income . Section 231(5) requires trustees to furnish returns of trust income. Sections 231(6) and (7) provide that the s.231 disclosure obligations do not apply in relation to superannuation funds and superannuation schemes approved under regula- tions 29 or 30 of the Superannuation Schemes Regulations 1983 . Non-qualifying trusts in existence at 31 May 1989: s.231(1) 14 .3 Section 231(1) required any person who had made a settlement on the terms of a trust on or before 31 May 1989 to make a disclosure to the Commissioner on or before 31 May 1989 if the trust was still in existence on that date and if the trust would have been a non-qualifying trust in relation to any distribution which was made on 31 May 1989. 14.4 Section 230(1) applied where the trust was a non-qualifying trust as defined in s .226(1) or where the trust would have been a non-qualifying trust if not for the application of s.227A. For s .231 to apply the trust must have been in existence on 31st May 1989. Therefore, the settlor of a non-qualifying trust which had been wound up before this date would not have been required to fulfil the disclo- sure requirements although the provisions of the trust regime in all other respects would still apply in relation to the trust. 101 14.5 The disclosure obligation arose where the person made a settlement on the terms of a trust on or before 31 May 1989. By s .226(6), "settlement" means any action or failure to act on the part of a person which has the effect of making the person a settlor. The definition of "settlor" is discussed in Part6 ofthis bulletin. 14.6 By way of example, where a person resident in New Zealand settled property producing income from outside New Zealand on a trust with Hong Kong trustees on 1 June 1986, the trust would have been a non-qualifying trust if a distri- bution had been made on 31 May 1989 because all trustee income derived from the date on which the trust was first settled until31May 1989 would not have been liable to New Zealand income tax . If the trust was in existence on 31 May 1989 the settlor would have been required to make a disclosure in accordance with s.231(1). 14.7 Where s.231(1) applied the settler was required to disclose to the Commissioner in the prescribed form the existence of the trust, the name and address of the trustee and the beneficiary of the trust, and such further details as may be required by the Commissioner . Settlement by resident after 17 December 1987: s.231(2) 14.8 Section 231(2) provides that a disclosure is required by any person who makes a settlement on a trust on or after 17 December 1987 if either at thetimeofsettlement no trustee of the trust was resident in New Zealand or if at any time after the settlement there ceased to be a trustee resident in New Zealand . If there is no resident trustee at the time of settlement the person making the settle- ment is required to make a disclosure by the later of 31 May 1989 or three months from the date of settlement. If there is a resident trustee at the time of settlement, but at any time after the settlement there ceases to be a resident trustee, the person who made the settlement is required to make a dis- closure by the later of 31 May 1989 or three months from the date on which there ceased to be a resi- dent trustee. 14.9 If s.231(2) applies the person who made the settlement is required to disclose to the Commis- sioner in the prescribed form the fact of the settle- ment, the name and address of the trustee and beneficiary of the trust and any further details required by the Commissioner. Settlements by nominee or nominal settlors : s .231(3) 14 .10 Section 231(3) applies where a person makes a settlement on a trust as a nomineefor another person or where a person settles a nominal amount on trust at the request of another person . In these circumstances s.226(3) provides that the person for whom the nominee or nominal settlor acted is deemed to be the settlor rather than the nominee or nominal settlor. However, although the nominee or nominal settlor is not treated as a settlor of the trust such nominee or nominal settlor is still required to make a disclosure under s.231(3) if at the time of settlement no trustee of the trust was resident in New Zealand. 14.11 If s.231(3) applies disclosure is required by the later of 31 May 1989 or three months from the date on which the nominee or nominal settlor made the settlement. If at the time of settlement by the nominee or nominal settler a trustee of the trust was resident in New Zealand s.231(3) does not apply and the nominee or nominal settlor is not required to make a settlement . However, if at any time after the settlement there ceases to be a resident trustee the person who is deemed to be the settler of the trust under s .226(3) will have an obligation to disclose the settlement pursuant to s.231(2). 14.12 The nominee or nominal settler is required to disclose the fact of the settlement, the name and address of the person who is deemed to be the settler of the trust pursuant to s .226(3) and any further details required by the Commissioner . Default assessments: s .231(4) 14.13 Section 231(4) empowers the Commissioner to make default assessmentsin three situations : (f) where a person has failed to disclose in accordance with s.231 the existence of a trust or any of the further details required by the Commissioner; (ii) where a person has failed to disclose any information requested by the Commissioner pursuant to s .17 of the Inland Revenue Department Act 1974; (iii) where a person is unable to obtain sufficient information to calculate the trustee income of the trust. 14.14 In any of these circumstances the Commis- sioner is empowered to determine the amount of trustee income for the income year in relation to which the failure to disclose occurs or in relation to which the information cannot be obtained. The Commissioner is required to determine the amount of trustee income in such manner as the Commissioner considers fair and reasonable. 102 0 Returns: s.231(5 ) 14.15 As under the previous trust regime, the trustee of a trust is required to furnish separate annual returns of income for each trust in respect of which the trustee has derived income as trustee. Thus, a trustee is required to keep returns of trust income separate from returns of income derived by the trustee in respect of any other trust or income derived by the trustee in any capacity other than as trustee. 14 .16 Section 231(5) requires a disclosure of the "whole income" derived by the trustee. The ex- pression "whole income" means that the trustee is required to furnish a return of all income the trustee derives, whether that income is beneficiary income or trustee income. Superannuation regime:ss.231(6) and (7) 14.17 Section 231(6) provides that ss.231(1) to (4) do not apply in relation to a trust which is a super- annuation fund, or to any person in respect of a superannuation fund. This ensures that persons making contributions to superannuation funds are not required to disclose contributions pursuant to s.231. 14.18 Section231(7) provides that ss.231(1) to (4) do notapply to anysuperannuation scheme consti- tutedoutside New Zealand and classified by the Government Actuaryunder regulation29 or 30 of the Superannuation Schemes Regulations. 14.19 Sections 231(6) and (7) do not preclude the application of s.231(5). Thus, the obligation to furnish returns of income imposed by s.231(5) applies with respect to superannuation funds and with respect to superannuation schemes described in s.231(7). Offences and penaltie s 14.20 Several offences in relation to the disclosure obligations imposed under s.231 are created by s.416(1)(ba), s.416(1)(bb) and s.416A: (i) Section 416(1)(ba) provides that a person commits an offence if that person knowingly fails, or knowingly permits the failure, to disclose any information which that person is required to disclose under s.231. Prior to the enactment of the Income Tax Amendment Act 1989, s.416(1)(ba) applied only to any corporate body which was required to make a disclosure under s.231. Section 416(1)(ba) was amended by s.76 of the Income Tax Amendment Act 1989 with effect from 22 March 1989. The paragraph now applies to any person who is obliged to make a disclosure under s.231. (ii) Section 416(1)(bb)(ii) provides that any person who knowingly makes false disclosure or knowingly gives any false information to the Commissioner in respect of the disclosure obligation imposed under s .231 commits an offence. (iii) Section 416A(3)(a) and (b) apply where an officer or employee of a corporate body is required, by virtue of that office or employ- ment, to make a disclosure under s .231. In these circumstances the officer or employee commits an offence if he or she knowingly fails or permits the failure to disclose infor- mation which the corporate body is required to disclose under s.231, or knowingly makes a false disclosure or gives any false informa- tion to the Commissioner in relation to the disclosure obligation imposed on the corpo- rate body under s.231. (iv) Section 416B(2)(b) provides that for the pur- pose of s .416(1)(ba), s.416(1)(bb) and s.416A(3) the term "person" includes any person who aids, abets, or incites any other person to commit the offences specified in those provisions. This effectively means that s.416(1)(ba), s.416(1)(bb) and s.416A(3) create offences of aiding, abetting or inciting the offences specified in those provisions. 14.22 The penalties for the offences created by s.416(1)(ba), s.416(1)(bb) and s.416A(3) are pre- scribed by s.416B(2A) . The penalty for which a person committing an offence against any of those provisions is liable is the same in each case : impris- onment for a term not exceeding 2 years or a fine not exceeding $50,000, or both. A person aiding or abetting such an offence is liable to the same penalty by virtue of s.416B(2B). PART 15: TRUSTEES OF ESTATES Income received by t rustee after death of deceased person: s.232 15.1 Section 232 provides that any amount received in any income year by the trustee of the estate of a deceased person is deemed to be assess- able income derived by the trustee during that income year if it does not represent assessable income derived by the deceased during that person's lifetime but if it would have been in- cluded in that person's assessable income if the person had been alive when it was received. 15.2 This provisionis car ri edover from the previoustrust taxation regime and deals with th e 103 rule under general law that income earned by a deceased person before his or her death is capital in the hands of the beneficiary of that person's estate. In the absence of s .232, the effect of this rule under general law is that there is no tax liability on income earned by a deceased person prior to his or her death if the income had not been derived for income tax purposes. The deceased person would not have been liable to tax because the income was not derived by that person before his or her death, and the income would be treated as capital in the hands of the trustee and the beneficiary of the deceased's estate. This situation would arise where the deceased person returned income on a receipts basis and services were performed by the person be fo re his or her death for which payment was not received until after the person's death. Employees, barristers and doctors fall into this category. It would also arise where the deceased person was an accruals method taxpayer under general tax ac- counting principles if the income had been earned but at the time of death the income earning process was not at the stage where the deceased was required to account for the income. 15.3 Section 232 applies only where the amount received by the trustee does not represent assess- able income derived by the deceased person during that person's lifetime. If the amount re- ceived had been assessable income derived by the deceased, the deceased, or his or her representa- tives, would have been liable to income tax in respect of the income and it is not appropriate to deem the trustee of the deceased's estate to derive the income. Section 232 also applies only if the amount received by the trustee would have been included in the deceased's assessable income if he or she had been alive when it was received . That is, the amount must be one which would have had the character of assessable income in the hands of the deceased if it had been received by the de- ceased during his or her lifetime. 15.4 The effect of s.232 is that the amount re- ceived by the trustee is deemed to be assessable income derived by the trustee. As the amount is deemed to be assessable income, rather than trustee income, it will be treated as income which can be vested absolutely in interest in the benefici- ary or which can be paid or applied to or forthe benefit of the beneficiary thus constituting benefi- ciary income . If there is no vesting or payment or application the income will be trustee income. Deduction of irrecoverable book debts: s.233 15.5 Section 233 applies where a debt owing to a person at the date of his or her death has been included in the assessable income of the person or of the trustee of the person's estate for any income year, and the debt or any part of it isproved to the satisfaction of the Commissioner to be irrecover- able and to have actually been written off by the trustee as a bad debt . In these circumstances the amount thus written off is deemed to be a loss incurred by the trustee in the income year in which the amount was written off and is allowed as a deduction: (i) first, against any income derived by the trustee as trustee income during that income year; (ii) second, any balance is deductible against income derived by or in trust for a benefici- ary who has a vested interest in the capital of the estate to the extent that the loss is chargeable against the capital of that beneficiary; (iu) third, any balance is carried forward to the next income year and offset against trustee income and beneficiary income according to the rules outlined above, with any further excess being carried over to subsequent income years and offset according to the same rules. 156Section 232 applies only to amounts written off as bad debts where the amount written off was earlier included in the deceased person's assess- able income or in the assessable income of the trustee of the deceased's estate. It does not apply to losses arising from the fact that deductible ex- penses and allowances exceed income derived by the deceased or by the trustee of the deceased's estate. 15 7 The amount written off is deductible first against trustee income with any excess being deductible against beneficiary income derived by a beneficiary who has a vested interest in the capital of the estate. To apply s.233 it is necessary first to calculate the trustee income and the beneficiary income derived by the trustee and beneficiaries of the deceased's estate in the income year in ques- tion, ignoring the loss incurred by the bad debt write off. The loss incurred on writing off the bad debt is then deducted against any trustee income with any excess being deducted against beneficiary income derived by beneficiaries with a vested interest in the capital of the trust. The amount written off is not deductible against beneficiary income derived by beneficiaries who have an interest in the income of the trust only. 104
1 ACCRUAL TAX REGIME AND GROUP INVESTMENT FUNDS SUMMARY As a result of an enquiry the Department has consid- ered whether an investment in a Group Investment Fund is a financial arrangement and thus subject to the accruals regime. RULING An investment in a Group Investment Fund is not a “financial arrangement” and is therefore not subject to the accruals regime. Reference: HO.10.A.3.0 1990 PROVISIONAL TAX RECALCULATION Worksheets for the recalculation of provisional tax, to take into account Interest and Dividend PAYE, have recently been issued. Interest Not Subject To PAYE The formula for recalculating 1990 provisional tax does not make a distinction between interest with PAYE deducted at source and interest which is not subject to PAYE (e.g. overseas interest). Logically the latter will still be provisional income However the worksheet correctly reflects the legislation on this point in that the calculation may be based on all interest not just PAYE interest. If the formula is followed, protection will be given from any additional tax even if interest not subject to PAYE is included in the calculation. Statements Showing “Estimates” For operational reasons, each recalculation of 1990 provisional tax generates a statement which indi- cates that 1990 provisional tax has been estimated. 'This is causing concern for those who followed the formula and have not actually made an estimate. Please do not object to any statements which incor- rectly show an estimate as they will all be corrected once we have the system in place. Be assured that we have not confused the calculations with estimates and everyone who followed the formula will receive the promised protection from additional tax. GST - MATRIMONIAL PROPERTY AGREEMENTS SUMMARY This item amends the Department’s policy regarding the GST implications of the transfer of ownership of the assets of a taxable activity in terms of a matrimo- nial property agreement made pursuant to the Matrimonial Property Act 1976. BACKGROUND The Department’s previous position is set out in Public Information Bulletin No 171 and was that the transfer of ownership of the assets from one spouse to the other was a supply for the purposes of the Goods and Services Act 1985. RULING The provisions of the Matrimonial Property Act 1976 establish certain rights for both spouses to the assets of the marriage. In entering into a matrimonial property agreement the spouses are doing no more than formalising those rights. It is arguable that the assets should always have been treated as owned by both (not necessarily in equal shares). When such an agreement is entered into the Depart- ment will accept that a partnership exists between the husband and the wife in respect of the assets covered by the agreement. This means that where the husband and wife continue the taxable activity in partnership with those assets the only action required is to register the partnership for GST purposes. No GST liability will arise in respect of assets covered by the agreement in this situation until they are subsequently supplied The husband’s and/or wife’s registration will be cancelled unless another, separate taxable activity is carried on by that person. Any subsequent supply, including assets retained by either party or any assets not covered by the agreement will be treated in the same manner as any other supply by a registered person. Where the husband and the wife do not carry on the taxable activity in partnership after entering into the agreement the Department still considers that a partnership existed at the time the agreement was entered into. The assets transferred from the partner- ship to each spouse would be a supply to an associ- ated person. The value of the supply would depend on whether the assets will be used principally in a taxable activity or will be for the private use of either spouse. The net result would be a GST neutral position where the assets continue to be used in a taxable activity and a GST liability (on the open market value of the assets) where they are not. This is consistent with the purpose of the legislation which is to tax consumption. 2 In this situation the registered person is one of the spouses. As the spouses do not intend carrying on the taxable activity in partnership there is no point in registering the partnership merely to deal with the transfer of the assets to each spouse. The Depart- ment will therefore not require the registered person to charge output tax on assets covered by the agree- ment provided those assets will be used by either spouse principally in a taxable activity. As stated above a GST liability arises in respect of any assets which will no longer be used principally in a taxable activity. It is the responsibility of the spouse who is registered to account for the output tax Any subse- quent supply by the registered person(s), including assets retained or any assets not covered by the agreement will be treated in the same manner as any other supply by a registered person. The above only applies to assets covered by a matri- monial property agreement and is only for the purposes of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985.

The industry recently asked the Department to consider an application for deprecia- tion rates on certain items of plant and equipment used in the industry. These items had never been considered previously because of the tax free status of the companies prior to 1 April 1988. RULING The assets listed below have been approved at the rates shown.

V CIR - M 508/87 - WHETHER PREMIUM PAID IN RESPECT OF GOODWILL IS DEDUCTIBLE UNDER SECTION 137. FACTS The objector is a private company which entered into an agreement for the sale and purchase of property to acquire the lease of a hotel. A substantial portion of the purchase price was, “For the goodwill of the said business including the benefit of the tenancy of the said premises”. The objector sought a deduction for the goodwill, contending that section 137 expressly provided for such a deduction. The objector’s contentions were as follows: (i)The whole of the payment was a premium either in terms of section 137(1)(b) as a payment of goodwill attached to the land, or in terms of section 137(1)(c) as a payment in consideration for the transfer of the lease; (ii)The payment was deductible under the proviso to section 137(2), which permits a deduction to an assignee of a lease, calcu- lated by reference to the amount paid by the assignee, apportioned over the remaining term of the lease. The Commissioner’s argument was that: (i)A substantial proportion of the payment constituted a payment of goodwill for the business as distinct from goodwill attached to the land and the assignment of the lease; (ii)The onus was on the objector to establish what portion, if any, of the goodwill payment related to goodwill attached to the land and the assignment of the lease, and that the objector had not established the portion; (iii)Even if the objector had established the portion, as in (ii), the objector had not shown what proportion of the goodwill is deductible and must therefore fail; (iv)Section 137 does not permit a deduction of goodwill paid on an assignment of a lease. The main argument of the Commissioner in that regard is that the payment of goodwill was not a “premium” in terms of section 137(1) for the reason that “premium” is defined as being “in relation to a lease of land” and “lease” does not, as defined in section 2 of the Act, include an assignment. As a secondary argument the Commissioner contended that the proviso to section 137(2) limits the deduction an assignee may claim. DECISION Wallace J, considered that the objector had estab- lished that the whole of the payment of goodwill was attached to the land and the assignment of the lease. Wallace J, also considered that section 137(2) includes premiums paid on assignments, however he agreed with the Commissioner in that the proviso to subsection (2) places a limitation on the preceding paragraph. He considered the application of the proviso to be a two step process. Firstly, the appro- priate proportion (if any) of the premium not de- ducted by the original lessee (spread over the term of the lease) must be ascertained. Secondly, this must be compared with the appropriate proportion of any premium paid by the assignee. In the result an assignee’s position is as follows - (i)If the original lessee has claimed a deduction(s) for the entire premium paid on grant or renewal, the assignee cannot claim a deduction for any premium paid. (ii)If there is a balance not deducted by the original lessee, which exceeds the propor- tionate part of the premium paid by the assignee, the assignee is limited to a deduc- tion based on the proportionate part of the premium paid by the assignee. If no pre- mium was paid, by the assignee on the assignment, no deduction can be made. (iii)If the proportionate part of the premium paid by the assignee is greater than the balance not deducted by the original lessee (spread over the term of the original lease), the maximum amount allowed by the proviso is not exceeded. In that event the assignee is entitled to deduct the proportionate part of the balance of the premium paid by the original lessee. The proviso does not, of itself, authorise a deduction. COMMENT This was considered to be one of those unusual cases where the context of the word “lease” required that it be given a different meaning from that pro- vided in the definition section of the Act (section 2). Reference:H.O. 10.D.1.1 4 GST - TAX INVOICES SUMMARY This item sets out a number of areas relating to GST tax invoices where the legal requirements are not being met and some other matters registered persons should note about tax invoices. 1. TAX INVOICES - COMMON ERRORS BACKGROUND Recent Departmental surveys show that documents intended to be tax invoices frequently fail to meet the requirements of section 24 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. COMMENT Examples of these shortcomings are: •The words “Tax Invoice” are omitted, too small or not in a prominent place. Although most particulars required for a “tax invoice” may be on the reverse the words “tax invoice” must be on the front. If there is more than one page the words “tax invoice” must at least be on the first page. The particulars may be included by a stamp and do not need to be printed. •In some cases recipients have stamped the words “tax invoice” on an invoice to give it the appearance of a “tax invoice”. This action is an offence by the recipient as misleading the Commissioner •The name and address of the recipient is omitted. However this information is not required if the consideration is $100 or less. •There is no statement that the consideration includes GST if the GST is the tax fraction. However, if the consideration is more than $100, as an alternative, the tax invoice may show; -the total amount of GST charged; -the consideration excluding GST; -the consideration including GST. •Tax invoices for zero rated supplies simply state that the consideration includes GST without stating the GST is NIL. In these cases, the tax invoices must state the consid- eration excluding the tax and the amount of the tax as NIL. •In many instances more than one document containing the words “Tax Invoice” had been issued for a supply. Care must be had to the retention by the supplier of copies of tax invoices issued by them. In these cases section 24 is being complied with providing: (a)these copies are not issued, and (b)they must clearly be identifiable as not being the original tax invoice e.g. “Accounting Copy” or “File Copy”. In certain circumstances the Commissioner may agree that not all the particulars prescribed in section 24 need be shown on a tax invoice or that a tax invoice need not be issued. Prior approval of this is necessary. Tax invoices are not needed where the taxable supply does not exceed $20. When planning stationery requirements, registered persons should consider the above comments care- fully. 2. CONDITIONAL TAX INVOICES BACKGROUND The question has been raised whether invoices containing the words “THIS BECOMES A TAX INVOICE WHEN PAID” qualifies as a tax invoice. RULING When a renewal notice is issued such as for subscrip- tions or insurance policies, in most cases it is not a document notifying an obligation to make a pay- ment but an offer to provide goods and services for a consideration. Accordingly the time of supply generally occurs when paid or a formal invoice is issued. In these cases, provided the renewal satisfies the requirements of section 24, it may be endorsed as shown above. Input tax may not be claimed until the amount has been paid. 3.PURCHASE OF SECONDHAND GOODS - RECORD KEEPING REQUIREMENTS BACKGROUND Examinations of records of registered persons have shown that in many cases where secondhand goods have been purchased from non-registered persons or from registered persons outside their taxable activity (i.e. goods of a private nature), the requirements of section 24(7) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 have not been met 5 COMMENT Input credits may only be claimed where payment is made during the taxable period and where regis- tered persons meet the requirements of section 24(7) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, i.e., that the recipient of the goods maintains sufficient records to enable the following particulars to be ascertained: (a)The name and address of the supplier; (b)The date upon which the secondhand goods were acquired; (c)A description of the goods; (d)The quantity or volume of the goods supplied; (e)The consideration for the supply. Where the consideration does not exceed $20, the above detailed records do not need to be kept al- though a sufficient record to verify the transaction should be. The meaning of “payment” is set out in TIB No.4. Where secondhand goods are purchased from a registered person who has principally used the goods in their taxable activity the normal tax invoic- ing requirements apply. 4.GST TAX INVOICES - SELF BILLING (BUYER CREATED) BACKGROUND For certain types of supplies the value of the goods is determined by the recipient of the goods when the supply is made. Examples are stock sales to freezing companies, supplies of milk to dairy and other co-operatives. TAX INVOICE REQUIREMENTS these cases the tax invoice requirements are: (a)Registered persons who are recipients of supplies must obtain written approval from the Department to produce self-billing tax invoices. Retrospective approval may not be granted. (b)In each case where a buyer created tax invoice is to be provided both the supplier and the recipient must agree that the supplier will not issue a tax invoice in respect of that supply. (c)The buyer created tax invoices must be given to the supplier and a copy retained by the recipient. (d)Buyer created tax invoices must show the normal tax invoice particulars including the name and registration number of the supplier of the goods (i.e., NOT the person who gener- ates the tax invoices), and the name and address of the recipient (i.e., the purchaser and person actually generating the buyer origi- nated tax invoice). (e)Where two separate supplies of goods and services are generated as a result of transac- tions between two separate parties the full amount of inputs and outputs must be shown on the tax invoice i.e., there cannot be a “net- ting off” on which GST is calculated. (f)In cases where purchases are made from non registered persons the invoices raised on behalf of the non registered person should neither display the words tax invoice nor charge GST. 5.TAX INVOICE REQUIREMENTS - PROPERTY TRANSACTIONS - ZERO-RATED SUPPLIES BACKGROUND PIB 175 on page 28 stated the tax invoice require- ments in relation to claiming input tax on the pur- chase of land and buildings. The question has been raised as to how zero-rated supplies are dealt with. RULING Where a property transaction meets the require- ments of a zero-rated supply under section 11(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, a tax invoice, if required by the purchaser to be issued by the sup- plier, must show the GST content as zero percent. The option for the invoice to simply state that the GST charged is the tax fraction of the consideration in terms of Section 24(3)(g)(ii) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 is not available in this case, even if the consideration is not more than $100. If the unconditional agreement for sale and purchase is to be used as the tax invoice the agreement must show clearly that GST is imposed at zero percent 6.TAX INVOICES - SALES AND PURCHASES OF LAND AND BUILDINGS - WHO MAY ISSUE A TAX INVOICE? INTRODUCTION The question has been raised as to whether a solici- tor acting on the purchase of land and buildings may issue a tax invoice for the supply. BACKGROUND Settlement statements issued by solicitors for the purchaser as tax invoices in respect of goods and services supplied by them in the course of purchase of property are in some cases also being used to claim deductions for input tax in respect of the purchase of land and buildings. 6 The proviso to section 60(1) of the Goods and Serv- ices Tax Act 1985 allows for an agent to issue a tax invoice when the agent makes a supply of goods and services for and on behalf of any other person who is the principal of the agent. RULING The settlement statement issued by the solicitor for the purchaser may act as a tax invoice in respect of the supply of goods and services by the solicitor such as fees and disbursements. However, the solicitor for the purchaser does not make the supply of land and buildings for and on behalf of the supplier and is therefore not an agent of the supplier. The proviso to section 60(1) therefore does not apply and the settlement statement issued by the solicitor for the purchaser should not be used by the recipient of the supply (purchaser) to repre- sent a tax invoice in respect of the supply of land and buildings. When the supply of land and buildings is a taxable supply and the recipient requires a tax invoice to claim an input credit, the supplier (vendor) should issue the tax invoice. This tax invoice needs to meet the requirements of section 24 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. This may be issued by the supplier’s solicitor if requested by the supplier but it must constitute a tax invoice issued by the supplier. This includes the supplier’s own GST number and not the solicitor’s GST number. Note that only one tax invoice may be issued in respect of a supply. A solicitor should only issue a tax invoice in terms of section 60(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 if there is a true agency situation present and they are making the supply on behalf of the principal. 7.ELECTRONIC TAX INVOICES BACKGROUND The following questions have been raised. •Whether tax invoices may be in electronic form. •If the invoice is transmitted electronically from the supplier to the recipient, whether the content and format of the invoices as received must be the same as that transmitted. RULING Tax invoices may be in electronic form. This is because “document” is defined in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 as “...including any electronic data, computer programme, computer tapes and computer discs”. The tax invoices must contain the minimum infor- mation required by section 24 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 including the words “tax invoice” in a prominent place. Any difference in content or format of the “invoice” produced by the recipient compared with that transmitted by the supplier would not invalidate the “tax invoice” so long as the above conditions are met. If a tax invoice is re-issued for any reason by either the supplier or any other stage in a computer net- work then the re-issued tax invoice must include the words “copy only”. When a transmission is not complete and not acknowledged by the recipient, then this is not an issue of a tax invoice. In these cases, the message when eventually received is the original and not a copy. Income Tax Treatment Electronic tax invoices also meet the requirements as “records” for the purposes of section 428(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Storage of Documents Electronic tax invoices must be retained in the same medium (on hard copy if desired) for both goods and services tax and income tax purposes as follows: •goods and services tax - for at least 10 years after the end of the taxable period to which they relate. •income tax - for at least 10 years after the end of the income year to which they relate. Printing of Documents It will be necessary for any such scheme to have a facility for any document to be printed if required by departmental officers. Evidential Requirements It may be necessary to establish the admissibility of electronic records in any proceedings. DEPRECIATION REVIEW The Department is shortly to commence a major review of the deductions allowed for depreciation and is currently inviting submissions on the issue. Any interested party is invited to submit any con- cerns that they have or suggestions or matters that they would like considered to: Mrs. L J Bamfield Senior Research Officer Inland Revenue Department Head Office PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON The closing date for submissions is Friday, 16 February 1990. 7 DEPRECIATION ON RENTAL PHOTOCOPY MACHINES SUMMARY This item is to advise the rate of depreciation set for rental photocopy machines. BACKGROUND Currently the Department allows a depreciation rate of 20 percent diminishing value on photostat equip- ment. We have now established d that this rate is insuffi- cient to cover the additional wear and tear which rental photocopy machines undergo. RULING As from \[and including\] the income year commenc- ing 1 April 1989, the rate of depreciation applicable to rental photocopy machines is 33 1/3 percent DV. Reference: HO. 10.D.3.6 residence (being exempt from land tax under section 27(1)(g) of the Act), and land used for “dairy” pur- poses (being taxable). Apportionments In general the Commissioner will accept a “just and reasonable” apportionment of the land values for the purposes of section 7 of the Act. If agreement cannot be reached the Commissioner will request the Valuer General to make the apportionment and the assessment will be based on that apportionment. Application This new interpretation will apply in respect of land owned on 31 March 1989. LAND TAX: APPORTIONMENT OF LAND IN PART TAXABLE/EXEMPT The Department’s current practice for apportioning land for land tax purposes where the land is used for both taxable and non-taxable activities has been reviewed. Existing Interpretation Under the existing interpretation where an area of land is used principally for a taxable purpose the value of the entire area of land is subject to land tax even though part of the land could Be used for an exempt purpose. Consequently where 51% or more of the land is used for taxable purposes (the remain- der used for private/non-taxable purposes) the total value of the land is subject to land tax (no apportion- ment for exempt use being made). New Policy The Department now considers an apportionment is to be made bearing in mind the apportionment basis envisaged by section 7 of the Land Tax Act 1976. This means that where land is used for both taxable and non-taxable purposes land tax will only be payable on the value of the land used for taxable purposes. For example, take the case of a corner dairy where part of the land/building comprises the shopkeep- er’s residence. The value of the land will be required to be apportioned on the basis of land used as a RETENTION OF BUSINESS AND OTHER RECORDS - MICROFILMING/ MICROFICHING OF RECORDS SUMMARY This statement is the Department’s new policy on microfilming of business and other records and the subsequent destruction of originals. BACKGROUND The requirement to keep business and other records for tax purposes in New Zealand is provided for in section 428 of the Income Tax Act 1976 and section 75 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. These sections require the records to be retained for at least 10 years, after the end of the income year or, as the case may be, the taxable period to which they relate unless (a)The Commissioner has given notice in writing that retention of certain records is not re- quired; or (b)In the case of a company, the company has been wound up and finally dissolved. New policy on Microfilming on records Because of advances in technology of record storage facilities, the size of records required to be retained and the increasing problems of storage of original records, the Department has reviewed its policy on which records it will permit to be microfilmed. Listed below are the records which are now able to be microfilmed, without seeking specific approval from the Inland Revenue Department. Once micro- filmed the original, (or copy) may be destroyed. These rules apply for income tax and GST purposes only. If the item is not listed it must be kept for 10 years unless specific approval is given. 8 RETAIN ORIGINAL PRIOR TO MICROFILMING FOR AT LEAST THE LAST FINANCIAL YEAR FOR WHICH AN INCOME TAX RETURN HAS BEEN FILED •Financial transaction records such as: -expense vouchers, invoices, tax invoices, copies of tax invoices, debit and credit notes -records of cash receipts till tapes and receipt books -records and associated invoices of all goods purchased and sold together with identifica- tion of buyers and sellers. These requirements do not apply to cash retail sales or to cash wholesale sales made in the same way as cash retail sales. -A record of all goods and services supplied by or to the registered person with identification of suppliers. -Accountants’ Working papers including: -client questionnaires -stock sheets (and the records from which those statements are compiled) -depreciation schedules -debtors’ and creditors’ calculations •Records and explanations of the accounting system, e.g., Chart of accounts, accounting manual. In businesses with a computer based accounting system, the systems logic and full audit trail is required. •Records of assets and liabilities in relation to the business. •Internal business memoranda including manage- ment reports and documents. •Written communications with other parties including business letters, facsimile messages and telex messages •Records in relation to fringe benefits provided to employees together with supporting documents. •Records relating to imputation credits, foreign payment withholding dividends, or branch equivalent tax accounts. •Records relating to specified superannuation contributions to a superannuation fund. RETAIN ORIGINAL PRIOR TO MICROFILMING FOR AT LEAST 5 YEARS •Books of account including cash books, journals and private ledgers. •Business bank statements, cheque butts and deposit slips. •Minute books (shareholders and directors) and documents and papers submitted to meetings of shareholders and directors Points to note on Microfilming •Microfilmed records must be of good quality and must be able to be read easily. •An adequate index to the stored material must be maintained. •If it is decided to microfilm records all records of a class must be microfilmed. It is not acceptable, if some documents or files are vetted before microfilming, for the vetted documents to be destroyed •Viewing and printing facilities for microfilmed records must be available free of charge to departmental of officers if required. •If requested, persons must locate selected data on the microfilm and print any items selected free of charge. •It may be necessary to establish the admissibility of microfilm records in any proceedings. •The above references to microfilm also apply to microfiche or similar type of photographic process. As with microfilming, the electronic recording of records where the originals are in hard copy form is acceptable providing the records if printed are identical in format and all other respects to the original records. Electronic Recording of Records Records may be maintained in electronic form such as for computer records and electronic data inter- change (EDI). In these cases, viewing and printing facilities must be made available free of charge to departmental officers, if required. Evidential requirements may need to be met as for microfilming. Approvals and Assistance Provided the above policy is followed, prior ap- proval to microfilm records is not required If taxpayers, accountants or other agents wish to vary the above policy written approval to do so is required. If taxpayers require any further information on microfilming records any Inland Revenue Office will be able to assist. Enquiries should be directed to the Verification Unit in your local Inland Revenue office. 9 INTEREST PAYE/DIVIDEND PAYE - IMPLICATIONS FOR NON RESIDENTS With the introduction of Interest/Dividend PAYE as from 1 October 1989, many financial institutions/ Companies are being approached by investors/ shareholders identifying themselves as non resi- dents. (The implication being that the income de- rived should be liable for Non Resident Withholding Tax and not the Resident Withholding Taxes re- cently introduced). All reasonable enquiries should be made direct with the investor/shareholder to establish whether or not that person is a non resident for New Zealand tax purposes (Pamphlets IR 291 “Tax Guide For Non Residents” and IR 292 “New Zealand Tax Resi- dence” define non resident, and are available at Inland Revenue Offices). An overseas address should be obtained in all instances, and should be incorporated when completing Non Resident With- holding Tax Certificates. Certificates, IR 202’s, should be completed fully in all instances. NOTE:Inland Revenue, including the Non Resident Centre, Dunedin, is neither able to: (a)Confirm or certify direct with the financial institutions/Companies the residency status of individual investors/shareholders (i.e. changes in residency laws/movements of individuals etc may affect past status), nor to; (b)Issue Certificates of Exemption in respect of non residents (although not liable for Resident With- holding Taxes, non residents do not come within any of the categories of “exempt recipients” as statutorily defined, and are therefore ineligible for Certificates of Exemption). DEPARTMENTAL TECHNICAL RULINGS Further to the item in TIB No.4 October 1989 we wish to advise that the Department’s Income Tax Technical Rulings are under review and it may be in a prospective purchaser’s interest to delay purchase until the new rulings become available. This is expected to be in approximately twelve months’ time. In the meantime, additional material for current manual holders will continue to be offered for sale as and when this becomes available. PRESS RELEASES 1. NEW MOVES TO SIMPLIFY THE TAX SYSTEM Following is a copy of a Press Release issued by David Henry, Commissioner of Inland Revenue, on 16 November 1989. Plans to simplify the tax system moved a step closer with the announcement that John Waugh will chair the Consultative Committee to be set up to review the Simplification of the Tax System. Inland Revenue is also taking the initiative in a number of areas in which taxpayer compliance costs could be reduced. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue, David Henry, said “we are looking at practical ways of reducing the complexities of complying with the tax system. Examples include: •the production of a Business Tax Kit to advise new businesses of their rights and obligations under all taxes; •simplifying and standardising IRD forms, returns and publications; •greater use of computer-generated return forms; •the supply by the Department of computer software to assist practitioners with the more complicated tax calculations.” “We expect to work closely with the Consultative Committee and believe the review will provide worthwhile benefits for all concerned. It is inevitable that many of the options the Committee will con- sider will require legislative change but there will be others that IRD can address directly. We are anxious to identify these and implement them as soon as we can. To this end we have already formed a small team to work on these issues and provide a contact point with the Consultative Com- mittee”, Mr Henry concluded. 2.INLAND REVENUE DECIDES SYSTEMS FOR COMPUTER REDEVELOPMENT Following is a copy of a Press Release issued by David Henry, Commissioner of Inland Revenue, on 16 November 1989. In redeveloping its computer systems, Inland Rev- enue has decided to expand its existing UNISYS environment through its association with GCS Ltd. In a joint announcement today David Henry, Com- missioner of Inland Revenue, Mike Foden, Chief Executive, GCS Ltd., and Brian Clark, General Manager UNISYS New Zealand Ltd. said it had been agreed that the Department would carry out its systems redevelopment using a UNISYS technical 10 platform subject to conclusion of satisfactory contrac- tual terms. Inland Revenue’s five year technology redevelop- ment plan encompasses all the systems within the Department including management and operational tax. It will also centralise processing returns and payments through three processing centres the first of which is already operating in Upper Hutt. The other two will be in Christchurch and Hamilton and will begin operations in October next year. David Henry said the new systems development, which will be one of the largest in the country, will provide Inland Revenue with an efficient, flexible and modern tax administration. He expects approximately three quarters of the total upgrading cost to be funded by resultant savings. “We are very excited about the Plan,” Mr. Henry said, “it will give New Zealand a really efficient and effective tax administration.” 3.LAND TAX - IRD BEGINS IDENTIFICATION EXERCISE Following is a copy of a Press Release issued by Bob Molony, Deputy Commissioner of Inland Revenue, on 22 November 1989. Inland Revenue will be issuing up to 10,000 letters over the next fortnight as the first stage of an exer- cise to identify landowners who will become liable for Land Tax next year. IRD Deputy Commissioner Bob Molony said they believed many people might not be aware that they are now liable to pay Land Tax because of the changes announced in this year’s budget. “We are expecting about 38,000 new Land Tax returns next year and we want to reach those people as soon as possible and make sure they understand what is required,” said Mr Molony. From next year all owners of non-exempt land valued at over $10,000 will be liable for Land Tax at the rate of 1 percent of its value at 31 March next year. Residential land, farm land and some land owned by charities will continue to be exempt. The Department’s letter explains the new provisions and asks recipients to complete details of their land ownership tor IRD. Revenue Collection Director Graham Burnett said the mailing list had been compiled from Valuation Department data recording land ownership at 31 March 1989. “We have extracted as many non-liable people as possible but some landowners who do not need to pay the tax may receive a letter. We would appreci- ate it if these people would still complete the tearoff slip and return it so we can update our records,” he said. The Department would also like to hear from people who don’t receive a letter but think they might be liable. “Those people should go to their local District IRD Office and confirm whether the new require- ments affect them,” said Mr Burnett. Queries that can’t be handled in the local office will be directed to Masterton District Office which is the centre for the Land Tax exercise. IRD has requested replies to its letters by Decem- ber 15. “It’s very important that everyone responds whether they’re liable or not, so that we know who will need return forms next year,” said Mr Burnett. Mr Burnett added that next year land tax payments will need to be made in two equal instalments by 7 May and 7 October in terms of a Bill currently before Parliament. In the following year the full payment will be required with the return by 7 May. DUE DATES REMINDER December 20November Tax Deductions payment due. January 7Third instalment of 1990 Provi- sional Tax due for taxpayers with January balance dates. 1989 Terminal Tax due for taxpay- ers with February 1989 balance dates.

1 RECENT DETERMINATIONS MADE BY THE COMMISSIONER Six determinations were issued by the Commissioner on the 4th of December 1989. Below is a short expla- nation of each. The full determinations are printed in the appendix to this TIB item. DETERMINATION G1A: This determination replaces Determination G1, made by the Commissioner on 13 May 1989. This determination was necessary to adjust the method of day counting prescribed to that which the Hewlett Packard Business Calculators use. DETERMINATION G7B: This determination replaces Determination G7A, made by the Commissioner on 11 May 1989. This determination is required to approve option con- tracts traded on the New Zealand Futures Exchange. A further futures contract (Three Year Government Stock Futures Contract) has also been added. DETERMINATION G9A: This determination replaces Determination G9, made by the Commissioner on 28 July 1988. This determination has been extended to allow its use in determining income and expenditure in respect of deferred property settlements in a foreign currency, for the purposes of a forthcoming determination. DETERMINATION G18: This determination approves certain overseas mar- kets, and sources of information, in respect of futures and options traded on overseas exchanges. DETERMINATION G19: This determination allows taxpayers who are not in the business of dealing in exchange traded options to use a market valuation method calculated in accord- ance with this determination. This determination only applies to those options traded on the markets approved in Determinations G7B, and G18. DETERMINATION E5: This determination applies in respect of the income year commencing on 1 April 1989. This determina- tion differs from Determination E4 by adding man- datory accounting costs, and accrual expenditure that is deductible under section 165 of the Act, to the schedule of expenditure which need not comply with section 104A of the Act. Amounts have also increased by 10% from Determination E4. INTEREST ON USE OF MONEY Statements of account will be produced at the end of January 1990 for taxpayers, advising them of what their current liability is, and what is to be paid by 7 February 1990. The figure shown will only include interest to date, it will not calculate a person’s interest liability up until 7 February 1990. If a practitioner has calculated up to 7 February 1990 for their client and they in turn pay it to the Depart- ment prior to the 7 February 1990 then a small credit may remain on the client’s account. It will not be the Department’s policy to credit or transfer these small balances. However, if requested the credit balance can be transferred by districts manually. Where small amounts have been charged, i.e. $0.10, they will only be written off when the overall bal- ance is $2 or less. PROVISIONAL TAX RECALCULATIONS Persons who have recalculated their provisional tax, with the introduction of the Resident Withholding Tax Legislation, will have received statements showing the new Provisional Tax figure as “esti- mated”, due to computer problems. Persons re-estimating solely as a result of the intro- duction of the Resident Withholding Tax will not be subject to the interest and underestimation penalties normally incurred from the estimation method for Provisional Tax. The Department will be amending these accounts to show the provisional tax as “recalculated”. As there is no change in the account balance the Department will not be issuing amended statements. FIRE LOSSES - SECTION 108 INCOME TAX ACT 1976 SUMMARY This item is to clarify the correct treatment for tax purposes on expenditure incurred in respect of fire losses. BACKGROUND Section 108(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976 restricts section 104 in that it limits the deduction for the repair of certain assets used in the production of assessable income. The deduction is limited to the amount which would normally be spent in any year on those repairs unless an express provision exists elsewhere in the Act to allow the additional expense. 2 The first proviso to section 108 allows a deduction for: •depreciation on premises caused by fair wear and tear. •depreciation on plant, machinery, equipment or a temporary building caused by fair wear and tear or by the asset becoming obsolete or useless. and which in either case the depreciation cannot be made good by repair. Under the second proviso, the Commissioner can allow a deduction for repairs or alterations that do not increase the capital value of the asset being repaired or, if they do increase the value of the asset, the amount of the increase is less than the cost of the repairs or alterations. FIRE LOSSES The tax treatment of fire losses is discussed in Tech- nical Rulings, Chapter 6, Part 1, Para 6.1.2. Rulings state that the “losses to buildings, plant, etc., caused by or resulting from a fire (including cost of repairing fire damage) are not due to fair wear and tear or obsolescence and are not deductible for taxation purposes.” The losses rulings are referring to here are those involving destruction of the asset. Although the conclusion reached is correct, the reasoning is not. The question of deductibility of fire losses must be considered under the second proviso to the section. For repairs or alterations to be deductible, they do not have to result from “fair wear and tear” or by reason of the asset becoming “obsolete or useless.” This test applies for depreciation purposes under the first proviso to section 108. Fire losses, where an asset is destroyed, will by necessity involve a replacement. Replacement of an asset involves something more than just an alteration to that asset. The cost of any replacement does not qualify for a deduction being a capital outlay. Partial damage to an asset due to fire where the asset can be repaired may be considered under the second proviso to the section. Each case will need to be examined to ensure no improvements are involved. INSURANCE RECOVERIES Insurance proceeds, indemnity charges or compensa- tion payments received in respect of certain assets lost, destroyed or damaged are taken into account virtually as sale proceeds for an asset sold. Losses on buildings, other than temporary buildings, continue to be treated as capital losses, and insurance recover- ies are not taken into account for income tax pur- poses. CONCLUSION Expenditure incurred on fire losses, where the damage incurred necessitates a full replacement of the asset, cannot be regarded as repairs or alterations and is therefore not deductible under the second proviso to section 108. Where there is only partial damage to the asset, and repairs are undertaken, the deduction for those repairs will be considered on a case by case basis.

BACKGROUND The question has been asked that when a person, who has interests in financial arrangements, be- comes a New Zealand resident, are all financial arrangements required to be valued under section 64J(2)(c), even if some of those financial arrange- ments were acquired prior to an “implementation date”, as defined? RULING Section 64(J)(2)(c) requires that when: •a holder or an issuer of a financial arrange- ment becomes a New Zealand resident the person shall be deemed to acquire or to issue the financial arrangement at the time at which the person becomes a New Zealand resident ... •and that acquisition ... shall be deemed to have been made for a consideration that might reasonably be expected for the acquisition if the acquisition had been made at arms length. Section 64(J)(2)(c) is however subject to the limitation as provided in section 64M. That is if the person acquired the financial arrangement prior to an “implementation date”, then that financial arrange- ment is not subject to sections 64B to 64L. Reference: HO 10.A.3.0 3 THE TREATMENT UNDER THE ACCRUAL REGIME OF A MARSHALL CLAUSE SUMMARY This item deals with the treatment under the Accrual regime (sections 64B to 64M of the Income Tax Act 1976) of a “Marshall” clause where a settlor has a right to demand interest but does not exercise the right. The following matters are discussed: •Does section 64C(1) apply to interest which may be payable under a Marshall clause? •Is a base price adjustment required where there is a failure to demand interest? •How is interest which is demanded and paid during a particular income year treated under the accrual rules? •What effect do the accrual anti-avoidance rules, sections 64I or 64J, have on “Marshall” clauses? BACKGROUND What is a “Marshall” Clause? The term comes from the case of Re Marshall \[1964\] NZLR 905, \[1965\] NZLR 851 which concerned the effect, for gift duty purposes, of the failure by the settlor (Marshall) of a trust to make demand for interest in due time. A deed of trust was executed in which Marshall (M) transferred some shares to himself and another as trustees for the benefit of M’s nephews and nieces. Contemporaneously with the execution of the trust deed an equitable mortgage was also executed over the shares to secure the unpaid purchase price. The mortgage provided that the trustees should pay interest to M at the rate of 6% per annum on the outstanding purchase price if M made demand for the interest by a specified date in each year. M failed to make the interest demand in the three years prior to his death. The Commissioner assessed M for gift duty in respect of the interest not de- manded. Gift Duty Provisions Section 38 Death Duties Act 1921 defined the term “gift” as - “a disposition of property without fully adequate consideration in money or money’s worth.” Section 39 of the Act defined the term “disposition of property” as, inter alia, - “... the release, discharge, surrender, forfeiture or abandonment of any debt, contract, or chose in action.” It further deemed a debt to be released or surrendered when it had become “irrecoverable or unenforceable by action through lapse of time.” The term “debt” was defined to include any pecuni- ary liability, charge, or encumbrance. THE ARGUMENTS The Commissioner relied on two principal submis- sions. (i)M’s right to interest for each year was a debt or a chose in action for the purposes of section 39 which was deemed to be released or surren- dered in that it became irrecoverable or unen- forceable by action through lapse of time. (ii)M’s right to demand interest was a chose in action for the purposes of section 39 which was deemed to be released or surrendered in that it became irrecoverable or unenforceable by action through lapse of time. THE DECISION Right to Interest The Court found that the right to interest was not a debt for the purposes of the gift duty. There is no existing debt for the interest component until the demand has been made for the interest to be paid. A distinction exists between an absolute and a condi- tional liability to pay interest. The right to interest, in this case, was a conditional liability which is not a legal liability until the contingency arrived. Until M made the requisite demand for interest the relation- ship between debtor and creditor did not exist. The giving of the demand in form and manner pre- scribed in the deed provided a condition precedent to liability on the part of the trustees. Until notice was given there was no right to interest. Rather there was only a right to make a demand. Right to Make a Demand The provisions enabling the mortgagee to demand interest created a right in the mortgage. It was a legal right in the strict sense. It was a right of some value which added value to the mortgage if it was purchased by another and this right passed with the mortgage. This right was found to be a chose in action. The refusal or omission by M to exercise a right to call for interest was held not to amount to a forfei- ture of that right within the meaning of the relevant gift duty provision. Forfeiture requires a breach of something in the nature of a duty, obligation, con- tract, or condition, which results in the loss. In the context of the statute the Court considered that forfeiture is of a positive character requiring an act of will rather than negative acquiescence. Failure to 4 exercise the right of demand did not amount to a forfeiture. The next issue the Court considered was whether there had been a release or surrender of the chose in action. The Commissioner considered that as M’s right to demand interest was a chose in action it was deemed to be released or surrendered in that it became irrecoverable or unenforceable by action through lapse of time. The Court did not agree. The Court considered that - “one cannot properly speak of a right which is only of a limited life and which ceases altogether at the end of its period of time, as being rendered irrecov- erable or unenforceable by action through lapse of time. The right is not irrecoverable or unenforceable: it is not one which is alive, having certain circum- stances but unenforceable through the Courts; it just does not exist any longer. It is dead.” THE EFFECT OF THE ACCRUAL RULES ON A MARSHALL CLAUSE Income and Expenditure Calculation Section 64(C) of the Income Tax Act 1976 sets out the method for spreading accrual income and expendi- ture. Subsection (1) provides that to calculate the amount of accrual income or expenditure regard shall be had to: “the amount of all consideration provided to the person and by the person in relation to a financial arrangement.” In a Marshall clause two situations are possible: Interest is demanded or it is not. Interest not Demanded Interest which is not demanded or paid under a Marshall arrangement is not an amount of consid- eration provided by the issuer or to the holder in relation to a financial arrangement. For considera- tion to pass in a Marshall clause arrangement there must be a debt in existence. In a Marshall clause the debt does not exist unless the demand for interest is made. Prior to the due date for demand it is impossi- ble to stipulate that consideration has been provided to the issuer or holder in relation to the financial arrangement. When the demand is not made on the due date then the debt ceases to exist and accord- ingly as the consideration will never be forthcoming it can not be said to be “provided”. In the situation where no demand or payment is made by the due date no income has been derived or expenditure incurred for accrual rule purposes in that particular income year. Interest Demanded It is clear that in any income year where interest is demanded and paid under a Marshall clause, such interest is part of “the amount of all consideration provided” and therefore must be accrued under section 64C during that income year. How is this interest to be accrued ? In the majority of cases it is clear that it is not possi- ble to calculate the amount of income or expenditure of the financial arrangement using the yield to maturity method as prescribed in section 64C(2). In addition the Commissioner has not issued a determi- nation providing a method of accounting for this type of financial arrangement. Section 64C(3)(b) provides, however, that the Commissioner will accept an alternative method of calculation if it: •conforms with commercially acceptable practice; and •is adopted and consistently applied by the person for all such financial arrangements for financial accounting purposes; and •results in the allocation to each income year of an amount that, having regard to the tenor of section 64C(2), is fair and reasonable. The appropriate allocation is dependent on how the Marshall clause operates. In some circumstances where the demand for interest is infrequent in terms of the length of the loan it is expected that the inter- est will be brought to account in the income year in which it is paid. There may be other circumstances where interest is frequently demanded. In this situation the interest should be accrued over the whole term of the financial arrangement. In cases of doubt the appropriate financial accounting principle will provide the necessary guidance. Base price adjustment Section 64(F) of the Act is designed to ensure that the total economic income or expenditure of a financial arrangement is brought to account for tax purposes. The mechanism used to achieve this is known as the base price adjustment. The adjustment is the calcula- tion performed upon the maturity, transfer or remit- tance of a financial arrangement, to establish the remaining income or expenditure related to that financial arrangement. Where, pursuant to a Marshall clause, a person fails to make an interest demand by the due date the issue arises of whether this failure constitutes the “remittance” of the financial arrangement. The term remittance is not defined for the purposes of this part of the Act. However section 64F(1)(c) sets out circumstances in which a financial arrangement is deemed to be remitted. These are - 5 (i)Where the debtor has been discharged from making all remaining payments under the debt without fully adequate consideration; or (ii)Where the debtor has been released from the debt due to the operation of the insolvency legislation or by any deed of composition with creditors; or (iii)The debt is irrecoverable through lapse of time. The Marshall case makes it clear that a failure to make the interest demand is more in the nature of negative acquiescence rather than positive action. Section 64(F) speaks in the positive for the purposes of the base price adjustment. The maturity, transfer or remittance of a financial arrangement denotes positive action. It is considered that negative acqui- escence is not sufficient. Therefore the Department considers that the failure to demand does not consti- tute the remittance of the financial arrangement at the time the failure occurs. In the Department’s view no base price adjustment is required for the failure to demand the interest by the due date. The base price adjustment calculation is required however upon the maturity, transfer or remittance of the financial arrangement. ANTI AVOIDANCE PROVISIONS Sections 64 (I) & (J) Post Facto Adjustment Section 64I applies to financial arrangements where the interest and other payments are at the discretion of the parties through the term of the arrangement, which are not generally accepted commercially, and which have the effect of defeating the intent and application of the accrual regime. An adjustment is required by the parties to recalcu- late income or expenditure from the arrangement from the time the party issued or acquired it to the end of the income year in which the adjustment is made, on the basis of actual cash flows. The adjust- ment is required to be calculated in every fifth income year since the issue or acquisition of the financial instrument until disposition. Non-market Dispositions Section 64J(1) applies when the parties to a financial arrangement deal with each other on a non-arm’s length basis in a manner that has the effect of defeat- ing the intent and application of the accrual regime. It empowers the Commissioner to deem financial arrangements to have been issued, acquired or transferred at market rates. Marshall Clause Fundamental to both these provisions is that the effect of the arrangement under review is to defeat the intent and application of the accrual regime. The intent and application is defeated by arrangements which are entered into for the purpose of deferring income or accelerating expenditure. The tests in the sections are objective, motive is irrelevant. An examination of the arrangement is required to ascertain its purpose. The application of the sections will be on a case by case basis. For instance in cases where an arrange- ment containing a Marshall clause is entered into for altruistic intra-family dealing and clearly not to defer income or accelerate expenditure then the anti- avoidance provisions will have no application. The sections may apply, however, where a pattern of demanding or not demanding interest clearly estab- lishes the defeat of the intent and application the accruals regime. TAXPAYER AUDIT PROGRAMME - LINES OF AUTHORITY SUMMARY This item explains the new structure of the Taxpayer Audit Programme in Inland Revenue. It also shows who taxpayers should contact if they have com- plaints regarding the conduct of an investigation or audit. BACKGROUND Since 1987, the Inland Revenue Department has undergone major restructuring. The Department’s field audit/investigations activity is now grouped under the Taxpayer Audit Programme - consisting of Payroll Inspectors, GST Audit, Verification Unit and the Investigations Unit. NEW STRUCTURE The Taxpayer Audit programme has three main levels: 1.Head Office Taxpayer Audit in Head Office is headed by the Director (Taxpayer Audit) and is concerned with policy matters. There is a small team of Specialist Inspectors who report to the Director. 2.District Office In the District Offices, Payroll Inspectors, GST Auditors and Verification Unit staff all have Supervi- sors to whom they report directly. The Manager 6 (Taxpayer Audit) has overall responsibility for the Payroll, GST Audit and Verification Unit pro- grammes and reports to the local District Commis- sioner. 3.Investigations Unit The Investigations Unit is structured on a Regional basis. It is managed by the Controller (Taxpayer Audit) who is situated at one of the Department’s Regional Offices in Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington and Christchurch. Individual Investigating Account- ants and Investigations Officers are situated at the various District Offices of the Department. They report initially to the Assistant Controllers (Investi- gations), who are located in Whangarei, Auckland, Otahuhu, Hamilton, Napier, New Plymouth, Palmerston North, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin. PROCEDURE FOR COMPLAINTS ABOUT AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS If a taxpayer is unhappy about the way an audit or investigation is being conducted, the matter should first be raised with the officer concerned. If the problem is not resolved, the next point of contact will depend on the type of audit or investigation. (a) For Payroll Inspectors, GST Audit and the Verifi- cation Unit, the relevant Supervisor should be contacted. If the matter cannot be resolved at this level, the local Manager (Taxpayer Audit) should be contacted. If the Manager (Taxpayer Audit) is unable to help, then the next step is the District Commis- sioner and ultimately the Regional Controller. (b) For cases involving the Investigations Unit, the appropriate Assistant Controller (Investigations) should be contacted at one of the offices listed above. If the Assistant Controller (Investigations) cannot resolve the matter, it should be referred on to the Controller (Taxpayer Audit) responsible for the officer. If that does not resolve the issue, the Re- gional Controller may be contacted. (c) Sometimes an Investigating Accountant or Inves- tigations Officer from one Region will investigate a file in another Region. Depending on the issues involved, the Controller (Taxpayer Audit) responsi- ble for the officer may travel to the other Region to meet with the taxpayer. If discussions with the Controller (Taxpayer Audit) do not resolve the matter, the local Regional Controller may be con- tacted. GST ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS USED PRINCIPALLY IN MAKING EXEMPT SUPPLIES SUMMARY This item is to clarify the ruling appearing in Public Information Bulletin 169 and Technical Policy Circu- lar No. 88/31 concerning GST on the disposal assets used principally in making exempt supplies. BACKGROUND The ruling on this matter was that the disposal of assets used principally in the making of exempt supplies does not constitute a taxable activity. Instead, it is an activity which is carried on in the course or furtherance of an exempt activity. CLARIFICATION An example of such a disposal is that of a bank. The disposal in this case is an extension of the bank’s principal activity and is carried on in the course of or furtherance to, an exempt activity, i.e., the supply of financial services under section 14(a) of the GST Act 1985. Therefore no GST liability arises under section 8(1) of the Act. Accordingly, there is no input tax credit available on the purchase of the building nor in respect of the expenses involved in maintaining and developing that building, whilst the principal purpose is the making of exempt supplies. It follows that there should be no output tax liability on the subsequent sale of the building. 7 However, if the bank was disposing of properties to the extent that the activity became continuous or regular, then these disposals alone could be treated as a taxable activity and a liability for GST would arise on these supplies. A case has arisen where a local authority has sold land which it had leased and on which prior to sale, the lessees had erected dwellings for the purpose of accommodation. The activity of freeholding residential land on the scale undertaken by the local authority had been such that it constituted a taxable activity, i.e., “any activity which is carried on continuously or regu- larly”. Also, the sales were made in the course or furtherance of the local authority’s taxable activity. Therefore, provided the activity did not involve the provision of exempt supplies, the transactions involved are subject to GST under section 8 of the GST Act 1985. Section 14(ca) exempts the supply of leasehold land used for the purposes of accommodation. Also exempt is the supply of rental accommodation under section 14(c). Section 14(d) of the Act exempts from GST the sale of any dwelling by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity being a dwelling which has been rented out by that registered person pursuant to section 14(c). The sale of leasehold land which has been used for accommodation is not specifically exempted under section 14. Therefore, the transactions involved are subject to GST under section 8 of the Act.

No. 8F E B R U A R Y 1 9 9 0 1 RESIDENT WITHHOLDING TAX - DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS (Interest PAYE) From 1 April 1990 the disclosure requirements of sections 327J and 327ZB will take effect. Section 327J requires disclosure of interest payments where no resident withholding tax deduction re- quired. Where a deduction of interest PAYE is not made because either:- •the payment is not made in the course of a taxable activity; or •the payer’s interest is below the $5000 thresh- old; AND the interest paid is claimed as a deduction by the payer when calculating assessable income, and is paid to a person who does not hold a certificate of exemption the payer is required to provide details of the payment to the Commissioner. Affected persons are likely to be persons who have borrowed from private lenders, such as relatives, for purposes such as share investment or purchase of one rental property. They will be claiming a deduction of interest against their taxable income, but will not be recorded as registered payers. Also affected will be persons who have paid less than $5000 in the previous period and so did not become registered payers, and who are paying to non-ex- empts e.g. payment to a family trust. Section 327ZB requires disclosure of transactions in financial arrangements . Where any person who holds a Certificate of Exemption: •acquires from or disposes to any other person, a financial arrangement; or •makes a redemption payment from which no deduction of interest PAYE is made; certain information is required to be provided to the Commissioner. This provision will almost always apply to registered payers. IRD NUMBER REPORTING REQUIRED. In both of the above situations one of the details required to be provided in relation to each person to whom a payment is made, or with whom a financial arrangement is traded, is that person’s IRD number for all transactions after 1 April 1990. TAXPAYER TO PROVIDE IRD NUMBER ON REQUEST Any taxpayer who receives a request from a relevant payer to provide an IRD number is required to do so within 10 working days. IRD NUMBERS TO BE RECORDED All persons who will have reporting requirements arising through these provisions should be taking the appropriate steps to obtain and record IRD numbers of persons about whom they will be required to report. Steps should also be taken to ensure that procedures are in place to record IRD numbers of new clients. GST AND THE DROUGHT REHABILITA- TION LOAN SCHEME SUMMARY This item explains the GST implications of the Drought Rehabilitation Loan Scheme which is avail- able to farmers in the designated drought areas of the South Island. BACKGROUND As part of the South Island Drought Post-Drought Adjustment Programme the Government has, through the Ministry of Agricultural and Fisheries, introduced a Drought Rehabilitation Loan Scheme. The purpose of this scheme is to allow farmers to restore their properties and stock in accordance with a realistic rehabilitation programme. This scheme is available to any farmer in the drought affected areas, who paid more than 15 percent of gross farm income in interest and rents (based on the 1987/88 financial accounts). A farmer may be pre- cluded from the scheme if a financier (i.e., a bank or NOTIFICATION TO EMPLOYERS: FBT PRESCRIBED RATE OF INTEREST FOR QUARTER COMMENCING 1 JANUARY 1990 The prescribed rate of interest used to calculate the fringe benefit value of low interest employment related loans has been lowered to 14.8 percent for the quarter commencing 1 January 1990. An order in Council to this effect has been issued. A brief press statement was released by the Minister of Revenue, David Caygill, on 13 December 1989 confirming the rate. 2 lending institution) considers the farm not to be a viable proposition. Under the scheme, an eligible farmer is entitled to borrow funds from a financier for specific items of expenditure such as re-pasturing, fertilizer etc. In respect of such advances (or drawdowns as they are referred to in the relevant documentation), the Gov- ernment will pay a portion of the interest on the drawdown direct to the financier for the initial two years of the loan. In addition, the Government under- writes and guarantees 80 percent of the principal for a period of 4 years. GST IMPLICATIONS The payment of interest and the underwriting of the loan is consideration for a supply made by the farmer in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. Accordingly, if the farmer is registered for GST there is an obligation to account for GST on this supply. The value of the supply is the amount of interest paid by the Government to the financier plus the value of underwriting the loan. As the value of the underwrit- ing is not expressed in monetary terms, it is valued at open market value. The open market value of this supply will be calculated as follows: The balance owing as at the anniversary of the commencement date of the loan (i.e., date of the first drawdown) multiplied by the difference between the risk free interest rate (such as the rate of Treasury Bills) and the normal interest rate that would be charged by the financier to that farming activity, reduced by any specific fees and charges payable by the borrower in respect of the under- writing, such as the guarantee fee payable to the Government. The risk free interest rate and the normal interest rate will be specified by MAF for each year for calculating the value of the under- writing. The value of the supply will be calculated quarterly, to coincide with the interest payments by the Govern- ment. The value of the underwriting will be calculated annually and included as part of the consideration for the supply in the quarter which covers the anniver- sary date. APPLICATION The value of this supply (i.e., the interest paid and the underwriting) will be grossed-up by MAF to become a GST inclusive amount. The GST component of this supply will be paid direct by MAF to the Inland Revenue Department and credited to the respective farmer’s GST account. In addition, MAF will issue an advice letter to each farmer at the end of each quarter, advising the farmer of: (a)The GST inclusive amount of the supply which is to be accounted for as taxable supplies made in the taxable period covering the end date of that quarter; and (b)the amount of GST that has been paid to the farmer’s account which should be taken into account in calculating the tax payable or re- funded for the respective taxable period. The first payments of interest by the Government in terms of this scheme were made in respect of the quarter ending 30 September 1989. Reference: LA GST S.5.Vol.1 DISCOUNTING OF DEFERRED PAYMENT LICENCES BY LAND CORPORATION LTD. The question has arisen as to the tax consequences of Land Corporation Ltd. discounting deferred payment licences entered into after 8.30pm 31 July 1986. The deferred payment licences in question were all entered into after 31 July 1986 and were one of the options available to a number of farmers under a renewable lease entered into with Land Corporation Ltd. The deferred payment licence is essentially an “agreement for the sale and purchase of property”, as defined in section 64B(1) of the Act and is therefore subject to the accruals provisions of the Act. A deduc- tion for the interest component of the deferred prop- erty settlement will be allowed to farmers, calculated on a yield to maturity basis. On the discounting of the deferred payment licence, and refinancing of the amounts outstanding, a base price adjustment is calculated in accordance with section 64F(2). The amount forgiven, i.e. the amount of the discount, will be reflected in the base price adjustment and therefore in the borrower’s assessable income for that income year. TAXATION REFORM BILL No.6 The Taxation Reform Bill (No.6) 1989 was passed through all its stages in Parliament on the 14th of December 1989. Immediately following passage it was split into six separate Acts being: •The Income Tax Amendment Act (No.4) 1989. •The Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act (No.2) 1989. •The Inland Revenue Department Amendment Act 1989. •The Estate and Gift Duties Amendment Act (No.2) 1989. 3 •The Stamp and Cheque Duties Amendment Act 1989. •Land Tax Amendment Act (No.2) 1989. These six Acts received the Governor General’s assent on the 19th of December 1989. The issues covered are: 1.New Start Grants. 2.Livestock taxation. 2A.Excess Retention Tax 2B.Resident Withholding Tax 3.Twice monthly PAYE is now only payable by employers whose total PAYE deductions are more than $50,000 per annum. 4.A number of changes to the Imputation, Divi- dend Withholding Payment and Branch Equiva- lent Tax Account regimes 5.Transitional arrangements for Provisional Tax in the 1990 income year. 6.The Land Tax Amendment Act makes a number of amendments, among them are amendments to the assessment of Land Tax, the due dates and the exemptions. 7.Minor amendments to the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968. 8.Minor amendments to the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971. 9.Minor amendments to the Inland Revenue Department Act 1974. 10.Several GST amendments. Details of the changes outlined above can be found in Appendix A to this bulletin. CERTIFICATES OF EXEMPTION FOR SOLICITORS’ TRUST ACCOUNTS This item relates to the insert in “Law Talk” issued to all solicitors on 1 November 1989 addressing the above topic. Under the heading “Instructions for Solicitors Requir- ing Refunds”, solicitors were advised that the new Certificate of Exemption would be showing an issue date of 1 October 1989, as this was the Department’s original intention. This is now incorrect. The legislation assented to on 19 December 1989 in the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 4) 1989 contains a provision whereby any certificate of exemption issued in terms of that Act, is deemed to have been held from 1 October 1989, where the application for that certifi- cate is made prior to 31 January 1990. In view of this, Certificates of Exemption that are issued with regard to Solicitors’ Trust Accounts will not be showing an issue date of 1 October 1989. GOODS AND SERVICES TAX AMEND- MENT ACT (NO. 2) 1989 This Act amends the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 and contains 18 sections in total. The scope of these amendments range from minor consequential drafting changes to technically complex amendments redefin- ing the boundary between taxable and exempt sup- plies. A number of these amendments result from the Legislative Audit currently being completed by the Department. Complete details on all the amendments contained in this Act are contained in Appendix B of this Bulletin. APPLICATION OF SECTION 99 The Commissioner released a policy statement on the application of section 99 on 1 February 1990. Follow- ing is a copy of the release issued By the Commis- sioner with the policy statement. SECTION 99 OF THE INCOME TAX ACT 1976 - STATEMENT OF INLAND REVENUE’S POLICY This policy statement on section 99 represents a significant step forward for taxpayers, their tax advisers and for Inland Revenue. The statement is the first comprehensive attempt for many years to indicate to taxpayers and their tax advisers how Inland Revenue sees section 99 and how it intends to apply the section. Section 99 is often referred to as the “general anti- avoidance” section. It is designed to protect the tax revenue of the Government from tax avoidance devices but being enacted in a general form its appli- cation can give rise to uncertainty. Hence this policy statement which is designed to reduce that uncer- tainty. There are three further points to note. First, the statement takes into account the views expressed to me by the New Zealand Law Society and the New Zealand Society of Accountants but it does not purport to represent any agreement between those two bodies and Inland Revenue. Indeed there may be significant differences between tax experts inside and 4 outside Inland Revenue on the subject but I have decided to issue the statement now to enable taxpay- ers and their advisers to gain the benefit of the re- duced uncertainty which this policy does provide. Secondly, I do not regard the statement as one which is not capable of further refinement and development. Thirdly and finally it is in the end the Courts which decide whether section 99 has been correctly applied to a particular taxpayer and I would expect further refinement to the statement to result from that proc- ess. Appendix C to this TIB provides the text of the policy statement and examples of its application. DUE DATES REMINDER February 20thJanuary PAYE Tax Deductions due.

The purpose of this statement is to set out the new policy. The state- ment presents the Commissioner’s view on section 99 - the need for the section, its function in terms of the Act, the impact and relevance of the recent legislative reforms and previous case law, the process of application, and some examples showing the effect of the new policy. It is not intended to be a detailed textual analysis of the provision. Rather it will provide guidance to both Departmental officers and taxpayers on the application of the section. The focus of the Commissioner’s new policy will be to evaluate arrangements in terms of whether they frustrate the underlying scheme and purpose of the relevant provisions of the Act. This new policy will apply from the date of release of this statement to all cases, including those cases which are presently under review. Section 99 Section 99 is the general anti-avoidance provision in the Act which renders void against the Commis- sioner any arrangement entered into for the pur- pose of avoiding tax. Section 99 is designed to protect the Government’s revenue from tax avoidance devices. To effectively achieve its objective the section is enacted in a general form, without reference to specific tax avoidance devices. This preserves flexibility to cope with new devices, but a consequence of this gener- ality is a degree of uncertainty. This uncertainty is the cause of much of the criticism levelled at the section. This uncertainty can be remedied, to some extent, by outlining the Commissioner’s opinion on section 99. The main points of this opinion are as follows - •the Commissioner’s view as to the function of the section; •the effect on the recent reforms to the income tax system; •the relevance of case law; •the process undertaken when considering invoking section 99; and •some specific examples demonstrating the effect of the new policy. Function of Section Section 99 is designed to protect the integrity of the tax system from tax avoidance devices implemented to frustrate it. It is not an independent charging section except insofar as section 99(3) provides for the reconstruction of an arrangement to counteract any tax advantage obtained, and section 99(5) provides for the reconstruction of dividend stripping arrangements. It does not itself create a liability for income tax. Its function is to protect the liability for income tax established under other provisions of the Act. Section 99 supports the more specific provisions of the Act to prevent their frustration by those who would avoid their impact. Impact of the Legislative Reforms The recent legislative reforms have significantly altered the income tax system. The lowering of the tax rate, broadening of the tax base, introduction of new regimes in the areas of international tax, trusts, accruals and dividend imputation have made significant structural changes to the system. The reforms have reduced the availability of schemes which some taxpayers used to avoid their liability to income tax. Many of these schemes utilise legis- lative gaps in the Act and, in terms of the Commis- sioner’s previous practise on section 99, the provi- sion was applicable. In light of the reforms the Commissioner has reconsidered the application of section 99. As discussed above the section does not itself create a liability to income tax but is intended to protect the liability for income tax established under the other provisions of the Act. Accordingly it is considered more appropriate that legislative gaps be filled by Parliamentary action to amend the law rather than by invoking section 99. The role of section 99 is to support the other provisions of the Act where the underlying scheme and purpose of the Act and the specific provision under review has been frustrated. The recent legislative reforms offer significant guidance in discerning the scheme and purpose of the Act and section 99 will actively be used to buttress the intent of the Act where that intent has been frustrated. Relevance of Case Law There are a number of interpretive guidelines, on section 99, of general application which have been judicially developed. Some relate to particular factual situations. Cases involving alienation of income, transfer of income earning assets on a short term basis, payments to relatives and family trusts claimed as a deduction give clear guidelines on the application of section 99 in these situations. 2 In addition certain broad interpretive principles have also evolved. The Newton predication test, for example, is regarded as fundamental to the process of section 99 application. In Newton v FC of T \[1958\] AC 450 the test was set out by Lord Denning. “In order to bring the arrangement within the section you must be able to predicate by looking at the overt acts by which it was implemented - that it was implemented in that particular way so as to avoid tax.” There was also the series of cases in the 1960’s involving constructional arguments primarily designed to ascertain the scope and the application of the predecessor to section 99. For example whether the section applies only to sham transac- tions or has fiscal effect - effect, that is, as against the Commissioner or just between the parties to the arrangement. CIR v Challenge Corporation \[1986\] 2 NZLR 556 is another example of the judicial development of section 99. In Challenge the taxpayer acquired a company (Perth) having no assets or debts but with a large deductible loss. After the acquisition, in compliance with s 191 of the Tax Act Perth gave notice of the transfer of its loss to the taxpayer’s other subsidiaries, thereby reducing the group’s assessable income. The Privy Council made it clear that s 99 is of general application and may apply notwithstanding that specific anti-avoidance provi- sions exist within a particular section. All of these cases have added to the knowledge of what the section was intended to do and how it achieves this purpose. They will continue to assist both the Commissioner and taxpayers in ascertain- ing the boundaries of the provision. Process of Application While application of the section is not dependent on any discretionary decision by the Commissioner, the Commissioner recognises that it will be of considerable assistance to taxpayers if they know the process undertaken in considering the invoca- tion of the section. The Commissioner’s approach requires a careful and thorough analysis of - (a)the underlying scheme and purpose of the Act as a whole and of the specific provision under review; (b)the arrangement to ascertain its purpose or effect; (c)whether a fair and reasonable inference can be drawn that tax avoidance is one purpose of the arrangement (other than merely inci- dental); (d)whether following this analysis it can be inferred that the arrangement frustrates the underlying scheme and purpose of the legislation. These four steps are cumulative - that is, it is necessary to undertake each step before the deci- sion is made as to whether section 99 is applicable. The following is an explanation, in general terms, of the constituent elements of this process. Scheme and purpose A succinct and practical guide to the “scheme and purpose” approach was given by Mr. Justice Richardson in his paper “Appellate Court Responsi- bilities and Tax Avoidance” delivered at Monash University in 1984. The approach was described as follows: “The twin pillars on which our approach to statute rests are the scheme of the legislation and purpose of the legislation. Consideration of the scheme of the legislation requires a careful reading in its historical context of the whole Act including the long title, analysing its structure and examining the relationship between the various provisions, and recog- nising any discernible themes and patterns and underlying policy considerations. It presupposes that in that way the study of the statute or of a group of sections may assist in the interpretation of a particular provision in its statutory context. It may provide a de- tailed guide to the intentions of the framers of the legislation and in so doing may cast light on the meaning of the provision in question.” His Honour considered that the scheme and pur- pose approach may not furnish an answer to all the interpretation problems which may arise. However he was satisfied that the emphasis on trying to discern the scheme and purpose of the legislation is likely in many cases to lead to the resolution of interpretation problems in the tax field that best reflects the intention of Parliament as expressed in the statute. The Commissioner concurs with this view. In trying to discern the scheme and purpose of the legislation primary regard must be had to the words of the legislation. It is Parliamentary intent, as expressed in the statute, which is crucial. The increased complexity of tax legislation has resulted 3 in some instances of ambiguity leading to confusion as to the meaning of particular provisions which makes the ascertainment of the true Parliamentary intent difficult. The Government’s consultative documents, the various consultative committee reports, Parliamentary discussion and debate, and Departmental interpretive guidelines may provide assistance in interpreting the legislation under review. The Purpose or Effect of the Arrangement The test to be applied in ascertaining the purpose or effect of an arrangement is objective. In short the word “purpose” means, not motive, but the effect which it is sought to achieve - the end in view. The word “effect” means the end accomplished or achieved. The whole set of words denotes con- certed action to an end - the end of avoiding tax. This is the well-known passage from Lord Denning in the Newton case. The section is not concerned with the motives of taxpayers. It is not concerned with the desire to avoid tax. Rather the section is only concerned with the means employed to avoid tax. In the Newton case Lord Denning said - “In applying the section you must, by the very words of it, look at the arrangement itself and see which is its effect - what it does - irrespective of the motives of the persons who made it. Williams J put it well when he said - ‘The purpose of a contract agreement or arrangement must be what it is intended to effect and that intention must be ascer- tained from its terms. Those terms may be oral or written or may have to be inferred from the circumstances but, when they have been ascertained, their purpose must be what they effect.’ Inference Having established the purpose of the arrangement as implemented by the taxpayer, it is necessary to effect a fair and balanced evaluation of that ar- rangement. The evaluation will be with a view to concluding whether one can predicate whether the arrangement was implemented in its particular way so as to achieve an income tax advantage. That advantage may arise in one or more of a variety of ways. These include the reduction, avoidance, or postponement of income tax. They also include an alteration in the incidence of income tax, or relieving persons from income tax. If there is an income tax advantage, it is necessary to identify whether or not that advantage is merely an incidental purpose or effect of the arrangement. In CIR v Challenge Corporation, Mr. Justice Woodhouse acknowledged that the meaning of this qualification is all important and stated: “... The issue as to whether or not a tax saving purpose or effect is “merely inciden- tal” to another purpose is something to be decided not subjectively in terms of motive but objectively by reference to the arrange- ment itself.” “... The phrase “merely incidental purpose or effect” in the context of section 99 points to something which is necessarily linked and without contrivance to some other purpose or effect so that it can be regarded as a natural concomitant. Many taxpayers when considering a course of action are likely to appreciate and welcome an opportunity provided by the Act for achieving some tax benefit as an aspect of it. But this should not bring the transaction or transactions almost automatically within the avoidance provi- sions of s 99. By itself conscious recognition and acceptance that a commercial transaction will be accompanied by a degree of tax relief is not the issue.” “... In the end the breadth of the qualifying phrase and so the ambit of the section itself will be discovered as a matter of fact and degree on a case by case basis.” “... When construing s 99 and the qualifying implications of the reference to “incidental purpose” the questions that need to be framed in terms of the degree of economic reality associated with a given transaction in contrast to artificiality or contrivance or what may be described as to the extent to which it appears to involve exploitation of the statute while in direct pursuit of tax benefits. To put the matter in another way, there is all the difference in the world between the prudent attention on one hand that can always be given sensibly and quite properly to the tax implications likely to arise from a course of action when deciding whether or not to pursue it and its pursuit on the other hand simply to achieve a manufactured tax advan- tage.” In some circumstances, an evaluation having regard to the view expressed by Mr. Justice Woodhouse may conclude that the securing of a tax advantage 4 is a non-incidental purpose or effect of the arrange- ment. In this case, it is necessary to consider whether that non-incidental tax advantage is one that constitutes tax avoidance as contemplated by section 99. Frustration This requires the synthesis of the other facets of the process. Section 99 is used to support the rest of the Act. Its function is to protect the liability for income tax established under other provisions of the Act. Accordingly the section will apply to void those arrangements where an evaluation of the arrange- ment results in the inference that a non-incidental purpose or effect is tax avoidance and the resulting tax advantage frustrates the intent of the Act. The Commissioner considers that this new four- step approach to the application of section 99 gives the provision its proper status within the Act, enabling it to do its work in a balanced but effective way. Pretence Many tax avoidance arrangements involve an element of pretence. Section 99 will be applied to counter this. The Commissioner expects that the provision will be mainly applied to those taxpayers who follow a course of action to achieve a manufac- tured tax advantage which is essentially void of any economic reality. However, economic reality is not of itself the sole determinate of whether section 99 applies. The degree of economic reality associated with a given transaction will be contrasted to any artificiality, contrivance, or exploitation of the Act while in direct pursuit of tax benefits. This analysis will focus on determining whether the underlying scheme or purpose has been frustrated. Invoking Section 99 The section may be applied in conjunction with other provisions of the Act but only where the merits of application have been properly consid- ered. The process requires the careful and thorough analysis described above. This analysis will be undertaken independently from the consideration of the transaction in terms of the more specific provisions of the Act. Section 99 will not be used without this analysis having been undertaken. In other words Departmental Officers are not empow- ered to invoke section 99, or indicate that it is intended to invoke the section, without having completed the analysis. Section 99 will be invoked by the Department against arrangements intended to frustrate the underlying scheme and purpose of the relevant provisions of the Act. Rulings The Department recognises as an important aspect of tax administration that the tax consequences of entering into any particular transaction be known with the greatest degree of certainty possible. To achieve this objective the Department will do its best within its current resource constraints to provide timely, accurate and adequate advice on the possible application of section 99 to specific situations subject to the following conditions: (a)the full facts and documentation (including proposed documentation) of the transaction and associated transactions must be disclosed; (b)the names of the parties, including the parties to the associated transactions, must be disclosed; (c)the taxpayer’s full arguments as to - (i)why section 99 does not apply; and (ii)the purpose and effect of the transaction; (d)any subsequent amendments to the proposals must be brought to the Department’s attention and presented with an analysis of whether the amend- ments affect the ruling given; (e)the ruling is not legally binding on the Com- missioner but the Commissioner will normally follow his ruling unless the taxpayer has failed to comply with one or more of these conditions; (f)the Commissioner may use the factual situa- tion submitted to amend or supplement his general guidelines on the application of the section but this would be done in such a way as to preserve the confidentiality of the taxpayer concerned. Requests for rulings on the application of section 99 should be made in the first instance to: Director (Taxpayer Services) Head Office P O Box 2198 Wellington. Examples of Application of Section 99 The Annex to this statement sets out some exam- ples of the application of this new policy. 5 ANNEX TO POLICY STATEMENT APPLICATION OF POLICY The examples set out below illustrate how the Department will in practice apply the new policy described above. It is important to note that the following examples are indicative only of when section 99 is considered by the Department to apply in the specific circumstances as described in each example. The examples should not be viewed as delineating the line between when section 99 will or will not be applied by the Department. It is assumed that the arrangements described below comply with the literal terms of the provisions of the Act concerned and that the transactions are legally valid.

PERMANENT TRANSFER OF IN- COME PRODUCING ASSETS YZ is an individual who derives income from salary and interest from a portfolio of interest bearing securities. YZ had some years ago estab- lished a discretionary trust for the benefit of YZ’s family and had from time to time made settlements to the trust. YZ’s income is at a level which attracts the highest marginal rate of tax. The income de- rived by the trustee during an income year is normally paid or applied to or for the benefit of the beneficiaries of the trust. The beneficiaries currently earn income at a level below the highest marginal rate of tax. YZ recognises the opportunity to reduce YZ’s liability to income tax on income that would other- wise be assessable to YZ and to reduce YZ’s expo- sure to estate duty. In pursuit of this goal YZ transfers absolutely the portfolio of interest bearing securities to the family trust. YZ grants to the trust an interest free loan repayable on demand to effect the sale of the portfolio and forgives a portion of the debt over several years. The effect of this arrangement is that YZ is no longer subject to income tax on the interest income and YZ’s estate has been considerably reduced. Assuming that the trustee pays or applies the income to or for the benefit of the beneficiaries during or within six months of end of the income year the overall effect is a reduction in the income tax paid. INTERPRETATION (a) Scheme and Purpose A trust is an equitable obligation, binding on persons referred to as trustees to deal with the trust property over which they have control for the benefit of the beneficiaries of the trust. A comprehensive scheme for the taxation of trus- tees and beneficiaries of trusts is contained in sections 226 to 233 of the Act. These provisions were substantially redrafted as a result of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No.5) 1988. The new regime generally takes effect from the income year commencing 1 April 1988. The former regime drew a distinction between “specified” and “non speci- fied” trusts. In broad terms, a non specified trust included trusts created by will or on intestacy and inter vivos trusts created before 19 July 1968. Specified trusts were inter vivos trusts created on or after that date. The distinction was brought about by an amendment to the Land and Income Tax Act 1954. The policy behind the distinction was an effort to frustrate income splitting through the use of trusts by creating a harsher tax regime which would apply to specified trusts. For example, trustees of a non specified trust were taxed at the normal individual rates after taking into account the $100 exemption. Whereas, trustees of a speci- fied trust were taxed at a minimum rate of 35c in the dollar. The specified trust regime was designed to deter but not prohibit the use of trusts for income split- ting purposes. As part of the introduction of the new trust regime, the distinction between specified and non specified trusts was removed. The continued inclusion in the Act of a specific regime for the taxation of trusts and the existence of the former trust regime, although drawing a dis- tinction between specified and non specified trusts, clearly indicates that the Act contemplated and still contemplates the likelihood of permanent transfers of income producing assets to a trust for the benefit of its beneficiaries. The inference that permanent transfers of income producing assets are consistent with the scheme of the Act is further reinforced by the presence of section 96 in the Act. Section 96 of the Act provides in general terms that where an assignment of income or income from settled property is for a period of less than seven years, and the assignor or settlor remains the owner or beneficial owner respectively of the income producing asset, or the property/corpus reverts to or otherwise remains under the control of the assignor/settlor, then the income, notwithstanding the assignment or settle- ment, is deemed for income tax purposes still to be derived by the assignor or settlor. By implication the Act contemplates as acceptable tax planning the permanent transfer of income producing assets without reservation, reversion or the right to control the disposition of the asset. The possibility of tax savings arising from the permanent transfer of income producing assets is contemplated by the Act, in that it provides for the taxation of beneficiary income at the beneficiary’s ordinary income tax rate. (b) The Purpose of the Arrangement On an objective evaluation of the arrangement it has several purposes: to reduce YZ’s potential estate duty liability, the setting aside of income earning assets for the benefit of YZ’s family, and the minimisation of income tax. 7 (c) Inference The taxpayer in this case has chosen to transfer the portfolio of investments to a trust, subject to the provisions of the Act as they apply to trusts. Such a transfer would have been influenced by domestic and economical factors which may have included a wish to secure income tax savings. A reduction in taxation has occurred. Although the tax saving may be significant, it is a natural consequence of the disposition of the assets to the trust. The inference to be drawn is that the tax saving is an incidental purpose or effect of the arrangement. (d) Frustration The Department does not consider that the scheme and purpose of the Act has been frustrated in the above circumstances. If a taxpayer permanently disposes of income producing property to another taxpaying entity so as to reduce the taxpayer’s burden of taxation the Act contemplates that the new owner will be liable for the tax on that income. The incidence of the tax and the burden of tax falls precisely as the Act intends, namely, upon the new owner. The Department would accept the above arrange- ment as acceptable tax and estate planning and would not apply section 99 to the arrangement. 2. INTERNATIONAL TAX REGIME FACTS A is a New Zealand resident and B is a non-resi- dent. A and B are involved in a joint venture operation. A joint venture company is incorporated in Panama with the following share structure. The pint venturers each hold 49.5% and a non-resident Managing Director holds the remaining 1%. The Managing Director’s shares carry limited voting rights. Additionally, the shares provide for limited entitlement to participate in the distribution of profits or the value of net assets on a winding up (or other distribution). The share structure adopted is not a requirement of the law of Panama, New Zealand, or the country in which B is resident. The Managing Director is neither a ‘nominee’ or ‘associ- ated person’ of resident A, as those terms are defined in sections 245A and 245B of the Act. (a) Scheme and Purpose One of the primary objectives of the International tax regime is to prevent the deferral/avoidance by New Zealand residents of New Zealand income tax on foreign sourced income earned through non- resident companies. The Controlled Foreign Company (CFC) regime was enacted as part of a trilogy of measures to ensure that foreign income derived by New Zea- land residents is subject to New Zealand tax as it is earned. The CFC regime only applies where five or fewer New Zealand residents have a 50% or greater control interest in a foreign company. The control tests contained in section 245C are the cornerstone of the CFC regime. Recognising the importance of this section, the legislature have included a specific anti-avoidance provision in section 245C(9). In general terms the provision provides that where two residents enter into an arrangement whereby any control interests in a foreign company are held by any other person or persons, where the arrangement has the purpose or a purpose of defeating the effect of section 245C, then the control interests are deemed to be held by those persons equally. (b) The Purpose of the Arrangement An objective evaluation of the arrangement is required to establish whether resident A effectively holds a 50% control interest in the joint venture. For example, the Managing Director may hold 0.5% of his shareholding on behalf of resident A in a man- ner intended to frustrate the control test require- ments of section 245C. (c) Inference It cannot be automatically inferred that the struc- ture like that outlined was designed to avoid the effect of the CFC regime. There may be a number of non tax related reasons for adopting the arrange- 8 ment, such as, accommodating the commercial or tax needs of the non-resident joint venturer. However, having considered all the relevant factors it may be that the only proper inference which can be drawn from the arrangement and surrounding circumstances is that it was implemented in this particular way so as to avoid tax. Once it has been identified that the arrangement provides for tax benefits, an evaluation must be made as to whether they are a more than merely incidental consideration in the implementation of the arrangement. (d) Frustration The control interest requirements of section 245C are designed to ensure that the CFC regime applies to those New Zealand residents who control a foreign company. If the reality is that resident A owns a 50% interest in the joint venture operation, the Department will apply section 99 to the ar- rangement, on the basis that the 1% holding by the Managing Director is an attempt to circumvent the provisions of section 245C. This is notwithstanding that the specific anti-avoidance provision in section 245C(9) has no application because the arrangement is not entered into between two or more New Zealand residents. The Department considers that section 99 can still apply notwithstanding that a specific anti-avoid- ance provision has been avoided. This is clear from the Privy Council decision in Challenge. The facts of the Challenge case were that Challenge acquired the shares in a tax loss company for the sole purpose of grouping those losses against Challenge’s assess- able income. One of Challenge’s arguments was that as section 191 of the Act contained its own specific anti- avoidance provision and that as Challenge had not temporarily acquired the shares in Perth and were not therefore within the ambit of the activities proscribed by section 191(1)(c)(i), then section 99 could not apply. Section 191(1)(c)(i) provided, in general terms, that in determining whether the requisite proportions had been met at the end of the year for the pur- poses of the tax grouping provisions, the Commis- sioner could disregard any temporary alteration in shareholding or constitution of a company. The taxpayer’s submissions on this point were firmly rejected by the majority of the Privy Council in the Challenge case. To reiterate, the Department considers that the existence of a specific anti- avoidance provision within a section e.g.,. the export incentive provisions, will not bar the appli- cation of section 99. Similarly, section 99 operates side by side with sections such as section 96, which have an anti-avoidance function. In this example the mere fact that resident A has settled for less than a 50% interest in the joint venture company does not in itself create a pre- sumption that the intention of the legislation has been frustrated. A detailed analysis must be under- taken as to the true capacity in which the shares owned by the Managing Director are held, in order to determine if they are held on behalf of resident A. Section 99 will not have application, where that section has been expressly excluded from operation e.g., section 336Y of the Act excludes section 99 from application in the context of fringe benefit tax. 3A. PREPAYMENT OF INTEREST (PRIOR TO ACCRUALS REGIME) FACTS For the purposes of this example, the transaction occurs prior to the introduction of sections 64B to 64M of the Act ( the “accruals regime”). PI Ltd need to borrow $100,000 to finance their assessable income earning activity. The capital is to be fully employed in the production of PI Ltd’s assessable income earning process. Bank Ltd offer two alterna- tive funding proposals. Proposal one, a five year loan of $100,000 at 10% simple interest per annum (the current market interest rate for loans of this term). For years one to four, interest of $10,000 is payable annually in arrears. At the end of five years PI Ltd is required to pay $110,000 to Bank Ltd, being interest of $10,000 and principal of $100,000. Proposal two, a five year loan of $100,000 with interest required to be prepaid. The loan agreement also provides that there is no right of refund of the prepaid interest in the event of the loan being repaid early. The prepaid interest is calculated as the present value of the future stream of interest payments of $10,000, that is, the interest payable in arrears in proposal one. Applying a 10% discount rate, the prepayment amounts to $37,907. At the end of five years, PI Ltd is required to repay the principal of $100,000 to Bank Ltd. 9 PI Ltd selects proposal two because it can obtain a tax deduction in terms of section 106(1)(h)(i) at the time of payment of the interest in year one. PI Ltd funds the interest payment out of existing cash resources. INTERPRETATION (a) Scheme and Purpose The statutory scheme in relation to the tax deduct- ibility of interest has not been conclusively re- solved. However, it is the Department’s policy that in order to qualify for a deduction in terms of section 106(1)(h)(i) the following criteria must be met: (i)The taxpayer’s purpose in borrowing the capital is relevant at the threshold stage of considering whether the statutory nexus has in fact been met: Pacific Rendezvous Ltd v CIR (1986) 8 NZTC 5146, 5154, (ii)The terms of section 104 must be satisfied as well as section 106. (iii)Interest is a prohibited deduction unless it comes within the exceptions contained in section 106(1)(h)(i), (ia), (ii). (iv)The paragraphs of section 106(1) provide cumulative proscriptions i.e. is the interest deduction prohibited by the other provisions of section 106(1) e.g. section 106(1)(j). Aspects of the Department’s policy were recently confirmed by Barber J in Taxation Review Author- ity Case No. 83/33. His Honour held that a tax- payer must cumulatively satisfy sections 104 and 106(1)(h) to qualify for an interest deduction. Specifically, in terms of this example, the Depart- ment considers that provided the tests as pre- scribed in section 106(1)(h)(i) are satisfied then the interest will be deductible for tax purposes. In other words, where the terms of section 106(1)(h)(i) have been met then that will be sufficient to satisfy section 104. In the circumstances section 104 is not considered to impose a more stringent test than section 106(1)(h)(i). This issue is largely academic in regard to interest tax deductions post 1 April 1985 because of the close similarity between sections 104 and 106(1)(h). Prior to 1 April 1985 section 106(1)(h) provided for a deduction for interest where: (i)It was payable on capital employed in the production of assessable income; or (ii)It was payable by one group company in respect of money borrowed to acquire shares in another group company. With effect from 1 April 1985 the section was significantly redrafted. The Income Tax Amend- ment Act 1987, inserted a proviso to section 106(1)(h) to the effect that accrual expenditure is deemed to be “interest payable”. The Income Tax Amendment Act (No.2) 1987, replaced the former section 106(1)(h)(i) as it existed prior to 1 April 1985 and introduced new subparagraphs (i) and (ia) in similar form to section 104. Commencing from 1 April 1985, section 106(1)(h) provides for the deductibility of interest in the following terms, where: “(i)It is payable in gaining or producing the assessable income for any income year: or (ia)It is necessarily payable in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or pro- ducing the assessable income for any income year; or (ii)It is payable by one company included in a group of companies in respect of money borrowed to acquire shares in another com- pany included in that group of companies: Provided that for the purposes of this para- graph expenditure deemed to be incurred pursuant to sections 64B to 64M of this Act shall be deemed to be interest payable.” Prepaid interest loans entered into between 1 April 1985 and 31 July 1986 (the earliest implementation date for the accruals regime) are dealt with in terms of the new section 106(l)(h)(i), (ia), and (ii). How- ever, the proviso is inoperative as prepaid interest schemes entered into before 31 July 1986 will not be subject to the accruals regime. In this example the capital is fully employed in the assessable income earning process so that sections 106(1)(j) or 106(1)(a) have no application. (b) The Purpose of the Arrangement On an objective evaluation of the arrangement its principle purpose is to provide PI Ltd with funds and to do so in a tax effective manner. (c) Inference The inference to be drawn from the facts of this case is that PI Ltd primarily required further working capital The tax-avoidance purpose is considered to be merely incidental. 10 (d) Frustration The Department considers that the scheme and purpose of section 104 and section 106(1)(h)(i) has not been frustrated in the circumstances described above. More specifically, the Act did not prior to the introduction of the accruals regime prohibit the deductibility for tax purposes of interest paid in advance. Additionally, the transaction is not artificial, the borrower has incurred real interest expenditure calculated by discounting to present value interest payable in arrears at the market interest rate. The prepaid interest is deductible in these circum- stances. The Department considers that section 99 would not apply to this arrangement because the scheme and purpose of section 104 and section 106(1)(h)(i) has not been frustrated and the taxpayer has been involved in genuine commitments and expenditure. 3B. PREPAYMENT OF INTEREST (PRIOR TO ACCRUALS REGIME) FACTS The transaction occurs prior to the introduction of sections 64B to 64M of the Act (the “accruals re- gime”). PI Ltd is a company which has substantial assessable income for the income year ending 31 March 1985. Bank Ltd is a financial institution whose activities include borrowing and lending money. PI Ltd enters into the following tax saving arrange- ment. On 29 March 1985 Bank Ltd advances $750,000 for 3 years to PI Ltd. The terms of the loan require an upfront payment of interest of $287,675 (17.5% annual compounding) payable one day after the drawdown of the loan Although it is not a term of the loan agreement that Bank Ltd or PI Ltd can make early repayment of principal, it is expected and anticipated that the loan will be repaid at a discounted value of $462,325 shortly after drawdown. A fee of $30,000 is payable by PI Ltd for this loan facility. PI Ltd deposits the $750,000 received on drawdown on call at 18% per annum. On 30 March 1985 PI Ltd recalls the sum of $287,675 and uses this to make the upfront payment of interest of $287,675 to Bank Ltd. PI Ltd claims an interest deduction in terms of section 106(1)(h)(i) of $287,675 for the income year ending 31 March 1985. On 31 March 1985 PI Ltd recalls the $462,325 remaining on call and uses this to fund the dis- counted repayment of principal of $462,325. The “gain” to PI Ltd of $287,675 (i.e., the gain arising from the discharge by PI Ltd of its debt of $750,000 by a payment of $462,325) is treated as capital and consequently non assessable. Interest is credited daily on the outstanding balance and the investment earns PI Ltd $598 of assessable income for the year ending 31 March 1985. Bank Ltd return the interest of $287,675 as assess- able income for the year ending 31 March 1985. The net tax effect to Bank Ltd of this arrangement is nil (ignoring the facility fee), the loss on loan of $287,675 (arising from the acceptance of a payment of $462,325 from PI Ltd in discharge of the debt of $750,000 owed to Bank Ltd) being set off against the assessable interest income. The arrangement can be illustrated as follows: INTERPRETATION (a) Scheme and Purpose The statutory scheme in relation to the tax deduct- ibility of interest is set out in example 3A above. (b) The Purpose of the Arrangement On an objective evaluation of the arrangement its sole purpose is the avoidance of income tax. It is considered that the income earning purpose is inconsequential to the tax avoidance purpose. (c) Inference The only inference that can be drawn from this arrangement and surrounding circumstances is that it was implemented in this particular way to avoid tax. The arrangement is economically neutral to all parties except for the interest deduction and loan facility fee. 11 (d) Frustration The Department considers that the interest is not deductible in terms of sections 104 and 106 as the deduction does not satisfy the statutory test for deductibility in so far as the nexus to assessable income has not been established. On the contrary the only purpose of this arrangement is the avoid- ance of tax. This arrangement is clearly intended to frustrate the scheme and purpose of the Act as it relates to the tax deductibility of interest and the Department would apply section 99 to this arrangement. The following dictum from Lord Templeman in the Challenge (PC) case is binding authority that such arrangements constitute tax avoidance: “In an arrangement of tax avoidance the financial position of the taxpayer is unaf- fected (save for the costs of devising and implementing the arrangement) and by the arrangement the taxpayer seeks to obtain a tax advantage without suffering the reduc- tion in income, loss or expenditure which other taxpayers suffer and which Parliament intended to be suffered by any taxpayer qualifying for a reduction in his liability to tax.” 4. SECTION 160A: AMOUNTS PAID ON SHARES IN PETROLEUM MINING COMPANIES FACTS P is a petroleum mining company in terms of section 214B of the Act. In order to continue its petroleum mining operations m New Zealand, it decides to raise further capital by way of an issue of ordinary shares to the public. E, a New Zealand resident individual considers that the shares will rise in the short term after the public issue. On the basis of this expectation, E borrows to subscribe to the shares and concurrently enters into a sale agreement with non-resident purchaser L. The sale agreement provides that the sale to L is to occur two weeks after acquisition of the shares by E, at the then prevailing market rate. Pursuant to this plan, E subscribes to the shares in P on 25 July 1986 and claims a one third deduction against E’s assessable income pursuant to section 160A of the Act. INTERPRETATION (a) Scheme and Purpose The Income Tax Amendment Act 1979 introduced into the Act a new taxation regime for petroleum mining companies. The regime provided for taxa- tion incentives to petroleum mining companies e.g., section 214B(5) provides for the deduction of exploration expenditure (this term being defined to include what would otherwise be considered to be capital expenditure); and to investors in petroleum mining companies e.g., section 160A. This section allows a New Zealand resident shareholder to claim a deduction of one-third of the amount paid as subscriptions or calls on petroleum mining shares, subject to the following limitations: (a)The money is used by the company in the exploring or searching for petroleum in New Zealand. (b)The shares are ordinary shares in the com- pany. (c)The deduction being disallowed if the petro- leum mining company does not use the money for the prescribed purposes within a reasonable time. The section 160A deduction only applies to pay- ments made on or before 30 September 1986 pursu- ant to calls made on or before 31 July 1986. (b) The Purpose of the Arrangement On an objective evaluation of the arrangement, it is entered into for the purpose of deriving a taxable profit. An incidental consequence of the arrange- ment is the availability to E of the section 160A deduction. (c) Inference The inference to be drawn from the arrangement is that the tax consequences are merely incidental to E’s profit making objective. (d) Frustration The Department considers that the plan falls within the underlying policy considerations for the provi- sion; being to encourage capital contributions to companies whose business is the mining of petro- leum in New Zealand. Additionally, the plan is neither artificial nor unreal. The Department considers that section 99 would not apply to this arrangement because the scheme 12 and purpose of section 160A has not been frus- trated, more specifically, the section does not specify any period of time that a resident share- holder must hold the petroleum mining company shares in order to qualify for the deduction. The taxpayer has also been involved in genuine commit- ments and expenditure. 5. REDEEMABLE PREFERENCE SHARE FINANCING FACTS Issuer Co is a company which is currently in a tax loss situation which is expected to subsist in the foreseeable future. Issuer Co needs to raise further finance to fund its assessable income earning activities. Issuer Co realising that it is currently unable to utilise an interest tax deduction calculates that the cost of its borrowings can be reduced by raising equity finance in the form of redeemable preference shares as opposed to debt financing. A suitable subscriber to the redeemable preference shares is identified. Investor Co is attracted to the redeemable preference share financing as it can achieve a better after tax return on the redeemable preference shares in comparison to a similar debt investment. The following arrangement is entered into. Investor Co borrows externally and uses the fresh capital to subscribe to redeemable preference shares issued by Investor Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary. The interest is claimed by Investor Co in terms of section 106 (1)(h)(ii). Investor Sub, in turn uses the capital to subscribe to redeemable preference shares issued by Issuer Co. Dividends are subsequently paid by Issuer Co and Investor Sub. The dividends are exempt income to Investor Co and Investor Sub in terms of section 63 of the Act. Additionally, Investor Co requires security in respect of the redemption of the redeemable prefer- ence shares. Accordingly, another company in Issuer Co’s group e.g. Issuer’s parent company, guarantees Issuer Co’s obligations to redeem the redeemable preference shares. Investor Sub allows Investor Co to pledge this guarantee as security for the debt raised from its own lender. INTERPRETATION (a) Scheme and Purpose The Act marks a line between the taxation treat- ment of debt and equity investments. Sections 64B to 64M (the “accruals regime”) provides for a comprehensive regime for the taxation of financial arrangements (a term which expressly includes a “debt instrument”). The accruals regime was not intended to affect the taxation treatment of equity instruments. This intent is reflected in the legisla- tion, where in general terms shares are an “ex- cepted financial arrangement”, as that term is defined in section 64B(1) of the Act. Equity investments have in general terms always been treated differently to debt investments for tax purposes e.g., interest is deductible but dividends are not. This difference has recently been further accentuated by the introduction of a full imputation system. Additionally, the Act had previously contained provisions which deemed certain debt instruments to be taxed as equity e.g., section 192 dealing with floating rate debentures and certain equity instru- ments to be treated as debt e.g., section 194 dealing with deductions for dividends on specified prefer- ence shares. As far as possible these deeming provisions have been refined or removed. Section 192 was further clarified to ensure that floating rate debentures that were to be treated as equity were those where there was a direct relationship between the company’s profits and the debenture payment. Secondly, section 192(3) expanded the exemption from treatment as equity where the interest on the debenture is calculated in terms of indices inde- pendent of the company’s performance. The deduction for dividends on section 194 speci- fied preference shares has been removed for post accruals regime issues. The intent of these amendments has been to ensure the delineation between debt and equity instru- ments for tax purposes is maintained as far as possible, without undermining the integrity of the tax system e.g., the tax treatment of debentures issued in substitution for shares was retained (section 195) and accordingly to tax financial instruments according to their true legal form. By drawing and recently reinforcing the distinction between debt and equity instruments for tax pur- poses, the scheme of the Act is clear in its intent to provide to taxpayers a choice of raising or investing in capital by way of debt or equity instrument. 13 The interest deduction is claimed in terms of section 106(1)(h)(ii) which provides for a tax deduc- tion for interest on money borrowed to acquire shares in another group company. (b) The Purpose of the Arrangement On an objective evaluation of the arrangement its purpose is to raise finance and to do so in the most tax efficient manner. (c) Inference The inference to be reached on evaluating the arrangement is that the tax considerations are merely incidental to the purpose of fund raising. (d) Frustration The scheme of the Act contemplates that taxpayers may raise finance through either the debt or equity market. The scheme of the Act has not been frus- trated when a taxpayer simply selects an option that the Act clearly contemplates that the taxpayer might choose. Section 106(1)(h)(ii) provides a special deduction outside the general scheme of the Act, which has its own nexus, not between expenditure and assessable income, but between expenditure and the acquisi- tion of shares in a group company. Investor Co has incurred genuine expenditure and both Investor Co and Investor Sub are members of the same group of companies. The terms of section 106(1)(h)(ii) are therefore satisfied. The Department considers that section 99 would not apply to this arrangement because the scheme and purpose of the relevant provisions of the Act have not been frustrated and Investor Co is in- volved in genuine commitments and expenditure. 6. VALUATION OF TRADING STOCK FACTS J Company is in the business of importing and selling computers. For the income year ending 31 March 1988, the corporate tax rate was 48 cents per dollar reducing to 28 cents per dollar for the income year ending 31 March 1989. J Company ordinarily adopts the cost price alterna- tive for valuing its closing stock for tax purposes. J company realises that it can achieve a tax saving by reducing its assessable income for the income year ending 31 March 1988 via the use of the trad- ing stock valuation options contained in section 85(4). In pursuit of this goal, J Company elects in terms of section 85(4) to value its closing stock of computers at replacement price. J Company evaluates the other options but this valuation represents the lower of the three permissible alternatives of cost price, market selling value and replacement price. J Company accepts the risk of an increase in assess- able income for the year ended 31 March 1989 (primarily because of the reduced value of the trading stock adopted in the previous year) because of the reduction of the corporate rate to 28 cents per dollar. INTERPRETATION (a) Scheme and Purpose Section 85 of the Act provides for a comprehensive regime for bringing to account trading stock for tax purposes. In particular, section 85(4) provides a taxpayer with three different options for valuing trading stock at year end i.e., cost price, market selling value, or replacement price. In addition section 85(4A) provides for a different regime for livestock, not used in a dealing operation. Section 85(6) requires a taxpayer to include in assessable income the value of the trading stock at the end of the income year. Section 85 provides for certain valuation options which are unique to the Income Tax Act i.e., they do not reflect any external busi- ness norm. Specifically, the tax options can be usefully contrasted to options available for account- ing purposes. Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No. 4 (SSAP 4) “Accounting for Invento- ries”, provides that inventories should be valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, whereas the tax options are cost price, market selling value, and replacement price. The only similarity that the tax options have with accounting standards is the option to value trading stock at cost price. Sec- ondly, it is important to note SSAP 4 requires the adoption of the lower of the two values specified, whereas, section 85(4) provides for a choice of options irrespective of their comparative value. Section 85, by providing for options for valuing stock which are not commercially available i.e., at market selling value or replacement price and the provision of an unqualified choice as to which option to adopt, creates a unique tax norm. (b) The Purpose of the Arrangement On am objective evaluation of the arrangement, its purpose is to reduce J Company’s liability to tax. 14 (c) Inference The prima facie inference to be drawn from the arrangement is that it was implemented in this particular way to avoid tax. The expression “tax avoidance” is defined in section 99(1) and includes “reducing or postponing any liability to tax”. (d) Frustration Section 85 creates trading stock valuation options which are unique to the Act, against which there is no external commercial yardstick that they can be judged. The Department does not consider it as tax avoidance for taxpayers to adopt an option created by the Tax Act and which exist only for the pur- poses of the Act. Section 85 is clearly intended to provide taxpayers with an unfettered choice as to how to value their trading stock at year end for tax purposes. The ability to achieve the type of tax saving described above is clearly contemplated by section 85. The Department considers that section 99 would not apply to this transaction because the scheme and purpose of section 85 has not been frustrated. 7. DIVIDEND STRIPPING FACTS Invest Co is an investment company with a sub- stantial portfolio of interest bearing investments and retained earnings. The shareholders of Invest Co wish to have the retained earnings distributed to them in a tax free form. In accordance with a plan, the shareholders of Invest Co arrange for the incorporation of DS Co and subscribe to all of the share capital. The shareholders in DS Co cause DC Co to acquire all their shares in Invest Co for a consideration equal to the Invest Co retained earnings of $1,000,000. DS Co funds the purchase of the shares by causing Invest Co to pay a dividend out of and equivalent to Invest Co’s retained earnings. The effect is that the original shareholders of Invest Co have had distributed to them the retained earnings of Invest Co in a tax free form whilst still retaining effective control of Invest Co. INTERPRETATION (a) Scheme and Purpose Section 99(5) is a specific provision included in the Act which deals with dividend stripping arrange- ments. In general terms the section provides that where the Commissioner considers that any consid- eration received by a taxpayer as a result of the sale of shares, is in substitution for a dividend that would otherwise have been received, the Commis- sioner may deem such consideration to be a divi- dend. A precondition for the application of section 99(5) is that the arrangement satisfy the criteria of section 99(2). As a result the normal sale of shares (not having a tax avoidance purpose) will not be caught by the section. (b) The Purpose of the Arrangement On an objective evaluation of the arrangement, it has been entered into solely to convert assessable dividend income into a non assessable receipt. The purpose of the arrangement is tax avoidance. (c) Inference The inference to be drawn from the arrangement is that it is entered into solely to avoid tax. 15 (d) Frustration The Department considers that section 99(5) of the Act applies to this arrangement and would treat the consideration received by the shareholders of Invest Co for the sale of their shares in Invest Co to DS Co as an assessable dividend. Section 99(5) is clear in its intent to defeat arrangements intended to recharacterise assessable dividends into non taxable receipts. 8. DUAL RESIDENT COMPANY LOSSES FACTS Res Co is a company resident in New Zealand. It has a subsidiary company, B Co, which in turn has a subsidiary company, C Co. Both B Co and C Co have been intentionally established so that they are resident of both Australia and New Zealand for income tax purposes. C Co has a wholly owned subsidiary in Australia, Oz Co. In order to finance investments by the group, dual resident company B Co, borrows to subscribe to shares issued by dual resident company, C Co. The interest deduction results in a tax loss in the dual resident company for New Zealand income tax purposes which is able to be grouped against assessable income derived by Res Co. Due to the dual resident status of B Co, the loss is also able to be grouped against the assessable income of Australian company, Oz Co. This results in the dual resident’s tax loss being able to be utilised twice, once in each tax jurisdiction. C Co advances funds to Oz Co and other associated group companies. Section 191 was amended in 1987 by the insertion of section 191(7E) and in 1988 by the insertion of section 191(7F). In general terms, the effect of these provisions are to quarantine dual resident company and non dual resident company losses from New Zealand group company assessable income. The following interpretation applies to losses incurred by dual resident companies prior to the introduc- tion of section 191(7E) and 191(7F). INTERPRETATION (a) Scheme and Purpose The Act as it was structured prior to the introduc- tion of section 191 (7E) and 191 (7F) did not con- template or address the problem of dual resident company losses. As no comprehensive scheme existed for the treat- ment of dual resident company losses, the analysis of the arrangement must proceed on the basis of analysing the scheme and purpose of the relevant taxing provisions affecting the different steps making up the arrangement. The arrangement described above generally relies on an interest tax deduction in terms of section 106(1)(h)(ii) for its effectiveness This section pro- vides for a deduction outside the general scheme of the Act, which has its own nexus, not between expenditure and assessable income, but between expenditure and the acquisition of shares in a group company. Section 191 of the Act provides for a comprehensive scheme for the offset of losses within groups of companies. The method by which losses may be offset depends on whether the group is character- ised as a “group of companies” or “specified group”. In general terms, a company is a part of a group of companies where there is a 66 2/3% commonality of shareholding. Companies are a part of a specified group where the shareholders hold all the paid up capital in all the companies in the same proportions. A group of companies may transfer losses by subvention payment, whereas a specified group may choose between a subvention payment or notice of election. There are a multiplicity of tests which must be satisfied before a taxpayer can avail himself of the grouping provisions. Section 191 creates a unique concept in a tax group, against which there is no external commercial yardstick. In other words, a tax group of companies is created by the Income Tax Act and exists only for the purposes of the Income Tax Act. (b) The Purpose of the Arrangement On an objective evaluation of the arrangement it has several purposes: the financing of group com- pany investments, the obtaining of a deduction in New Zealand and Australia for the incurring of a single expense, and to enable the dual resident company losses to be grouped against Res Co’s income. The latter purpose would prima facie amount to “tax avoidance” as that expression is defined in section 99, being to relieve “any person from liability to pay income tax”. 16 (c) Inference The inference to be drawn from this arrangement and surrounding circumstances is that the tax deductibility of the interest by B Co and the subse- quent grouping of B Co’s losses against Res Co’s assessable income is merely incidental to the pur- pose of funding the group’s investment activity. (d) Frustration The Department has identified several multina- tional companies which have utilised the dual resident structure described above. The Depart- ment does not consider that the scheme of the Act as it was prior to the introduction of sections 191(7E) and 191(7F) has been frustrated in these circumstances. The Department does not consider that section 99 applies to the above arrangement for the following reasons: (a)The terms of section 106(1)(h)(ii) have clearly been satisfied by this arrangement. (b)The scheme of section 191 has not been frustrated by this arrangement. Through section 191 the Act creates a tax group which exists only for the purpose of the grouping of tax losses. The Department does not consider that an arrangement can constitute tax avoidance where a taxpayer has simply satisfied the statutory form which the Act has purposely created. Although Res Co has been relieved to some extent of its liability to tax; that is one of the purposes of every offset of loss by one company against the profits of another; indeed it may be concluded that it is the only reason for the presence of section 191. (c)The Department considers that the mere ability to utilise losses in two separate tax jurisdictions is not of itself sufficient to trigger the operation of section 99. Europa Oil (NZ) Ltd v CIR \[1976\] 1 NZLR 546, 556, remains good law on this point; section 99 is not concerned with the fiscal consequences of the disputed arrangement in another tax jurisdiction. Section 99 is only concerned with the avoidance of New Zealand income tax. 9. CONTRIVED DEDUCTIONS FACTS F Corp is a company operating a business with substantial assessable income. The two major shareholders are a husband and wife, H and W respectively. F Corp enters into the following tax saving arrangement. F Corp acquire a household fridge from W for $100,000. The fridge is only worth $400. The purchase price is immediately lent back by W to F Corp on an interest free repayable on demand basis. The fridge is used by F Corp to store refreshments for entertaining clients. Two weeks after the purchase, F Corp sell the fridge to H for $500. F Corp claim the loss on disposal of $99,500 against its assessable income. INTERPRETATION (a) Scheme and Purpose The Income Tax Act provides a code in relation to deductibility. Section 101 provides that no deduc- tions are available otherwise than in terms of the Act. Section 104, the general deductibility provision of the Act provides for a deduction for any ex- penditure or loss incurred, or necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income. Expenditure otherwise deductible in terms of section 104 may be restricted by the provisions of section 106 e.g., section 106(1)(a) prohibits deductions for capital expenditure. Section 108 provides the test for deductibility for depreciation. (b) The Purpose of the Arrangement On an objective evaluation of the arrangement it has been implemented in this way for the sole purpose of avoiding income tax. (c) Inference The only inference which can be drawn from the arrangement and surrounding circumstances is that it was implemented in this particular way to avoid tax. 17 (d) Frustration The basis for deductibility of losses of this nature is unclear, the alternatives are section 104 or section 108. Where the claim is made in terms of section 104 the Department considers that the loss is not deductible as the arrangement has been entered into for the sole purpose of avoiding tax and thus lacks the nexus to assessable income. It is also considered by the Department that losses incurred in the above circumstances clearly fall outside the scheme of section 104. Where the claim is in terms of section 108 the Commissioner would similarly disallow the deduc- tion on the basis that it lacks the nexus to assessable income. The Department would also challenge the deduc- tion on the basis that it amounts to capital expendi- ture in terms of section 106(1)(a). Additionally, the Department would also invoke section 99 as the sole purpose of the arrangement is the avoidance of tax. The arrangement is artificial and is intended to frustrate the scheme and pur- pose of section Act. As from 1 October 1988 the excess over the market value of the fridge i.e., $99,600 is deemed to be a dividend to W in terms of section 4(1)(d) of the Act. If an arrangement as described above were entered into by a taxpayer, the Department would give serious consideration to treating the arrangement as tax evasion.
1 INCOME TAX AMENDMENT ACT (NO 4) 1989 INCOME EXEMPT FROM INCOME TAX. (Section 4) Section 4 introduces three new sources of exempt income. The first amendment extends the exemption in section 61(12) for pensions, annuities, and allow- ances, paid by the German Government as com- pensation to victims of Nazi persecution, to cover pensions paid by the Austrian Government in the same circumstances. This exemption applies from the income year commencing on the 1st day of April 1989. The second amendment exempts income in the form of Adverse Event Family Income Support Payments received by farmers, as part of the South Island drought relief package, between 1 October 1988 and 31 March 1989 inclusive. While such payments would, in the absence of this specific provision, have been subject to income tax, the Government has allowed this exemption for the six months period only in recognition that the taxation status of the payments had not been widely appreciated. Payments made after the 31st of March will be subject to income tax. The amendment also defines the terms “South Island drought relief package” and “Adverse Event Family Income Support scheme”. “South Island drought relief package” means a package approved by Cabinet for the relief of hardship due to the drought conditions that occurred during the 1988 and 1989 years which affected parts of Marlborough, Canterbury, and Otago and resulted in the parts so affected being designated by the Minister of Agriculture as “a drought affected area”. “Adverse Event Family Income Support Scheme” means a payment made by the Department of Social Welfare on behalf of the Ministry of Agri- culture and Fisheries to farming families who are facing financial difficulties because of drought conditions. The third amendment exempts payments made to any person as compensation under the First Schedule to the Crown Forestry Act 1989. INCOME AND EXPENDITURE WHERE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENT REDEEMED OR DISPOSED OF (Section 5) A new section 64F(7C) is inserted in the principal Act. The section applies to forgiveness of debt follow- ing the discharge from bankruptcy under section 114 of the Insolvency Act 1967; and the remittance of tax or duty under any of the Inland Revenue Acts or section 114 of the Accident Compensation Act 1982. The debt forgiven in these instances shall be deemed to have been paid for the purposes of this section and therefore does not give rise to assess- able income under the accrual regime. The section applies from 1 April 1985. NEW START GRANTS (Sections 6, 9 and 52) These sections expand the provisions in the princi- pal Act to allow New Start grants to be paid out for “adverse events”. The current provisions specify that they may only be paid out where a drought has occurred. Farmers, within the Kerikeri area, who experienced extreme rainfall as a result of Cyclone Delilah can now qualify for the tax relief associated with a New Start grant paid out by MAF. These amendments take effect from 1 April 1989 as some New Start Grants have already been paid. Section by Section Analysis of New Start Grants Section 6 - New Start Grants for Farmers Section 64FB of the principal Act is amended by introducing a definition of the term “adverse event”. An adverse event is defined to include - (a)The drought conditions that occurred dur- ing the years 1988 and 1989 and which affected parts of Marlborough, Canterbury, and Otago and were designated as “a drought affected area” by the Minister of Agriculture. (b)Land inside a 15 kilometre radius of Kerikeri. (c)Land outside a 15 kilometre radius of Kerikeri which has been designated as having been subject to extreme rainfall conditions by a local arbitration committee set up by the Minister of Agriculture. 2 There are also a number of consequential drafting amendments to section 64FB(1) and (2). They remove certain references to New Start grants relating solely to “drought relief” and insert the term “adverse event”. These amendments apply in relation to the tax on income derived in the income year that com- menced on the 1st day of April 1988 and in every subsequent year. An application date of 1 April 1988 was required to cover New Start grants paid in respect of both drought and extreme rainfall conditions prior to this amendment. Section 9 - Amounts Remitted to be taken into Account in Computing Income Sections 9 and 52 of the Amendment Act make amendments to sections 78(4)(b) and 414(2A) in relation to changing the term “drought relief” in section 64FB to “adverse event”. Section 7 - Post facto adjustment. Section 7 corrects a minor drafting error in section 64I(3)(a) of the principal Act which specifies a previously amended section. There is no change in the interpretation of section 64I(3)(a) as a result of the amendment. LIVESTOCK TAXATION (Sections 2,10,11,12,13 and 55) The amendments to the livestock regime in the Income Tax Amendment Act (No.4) 1989 are the result of discussions held by Inland Revenue with interested parties associated with the farming industry. These amendments are aimed at simpli- fying the livestock regime’s application for the benefit of the taxpayer, the tax professional, and Inland Revenue. The amendments made are as follows: HERD LIVESTOCK The herd livestock regime is expanded to include immature classes of female livestock and imma- ture male livestock where that livestock is in- tended to be used in the future for the production of wool, velvet, or fibre. The taxpayer is given the option, via an election, not to include these classes of livestock in the herd scheme. The herd scheme is further amended by introduc- ing a provision allowing the taxpayer to elect to immediately place livestock in the herd scheme rather than after the 2 year waiting period as previously required under the legislation. Finally a provision is introduced to allow farmers who cease farming prior to 1 January in any year, or estates of farmers where the farmer dies prior to 1 January in any year, to adopt the prior year’s herd livestock values. This may be done where, in the case of a deceased taxpayer, their tax return is furnished prior to the release of the current year’s values and in all other cases where an election is furnished prior to 1 January. Write-Down Provisions The 3 year write-down provisions in respect of specified livestock, which applied to - (a)New farmers for their first 4 years of busi- ness; and (b)Existing farmers significantly expanding their business; and (c)Farmers swapping from the herd scheme to the trading stock scheme: have been repealed. High-Priced Livestock The high priced livestock scheme is amended to allow farmers to depreciate livestock purchased within 6 months of balance date where that live- stock has been used by the taxpayer for breeding purposes. “Used for Breeding Purposes” has been defined in the Act to mean male livestock used for insemination purposes and female livestock which have given birth. The high priced livestock system is also amended to provide that livestock with a value of less than $100 cannot be high priced livestock. The legislation is further amended to allow farmers to commence depreciation of live- stock once it is older than 1 year of age. SECTION BY SECT ION ANALYSIS OF LIVESTOCK AMENDMENTS Section 2 - Interpretation - Definition of Herd Livestock This section extends the definition of “herd live- stock” to include male livestock that are intended to be used in the future primarily for the produc- tion of wool, velvet or fibre. A special application must be made to the Commissioner justifying the inclusion of the immature male livestock in the herd scheme. The Commissioner will be guided by the taxpayer’s statements on this matter and by other factors, such as the taxpayer’s actions in previous years. The classes of livestock included in the herd scheme are extended by the addition of classes of immature female livestock to column 3 of the 3 Twelfth Schedule to the Act. This amendment means that a taxpayer can now include immature female livestock in the herd scheme. The section applies in relation to the tax on income derived in the income year that commenced on the 1st day of April 1989 and in every subsequent year. Section 10 - Livestock Valuation Elections This section amends section 85A(2) to provide taxpayers with an option to elect not to include the immature classes of herd livestock in the ex- panded herd scheme. It also further amends section 85A(3)(d) of the principal Act to allow immediate entry into the herd scheme. The election must be exercised on a type by type approach with all immature classes of one live- stock type included or excluded as the case may be. This section provides that all herd livestock, meaning immature and mature livestock, is valued in the herd scheme unless an election is furnished by the taxpayer requesting that the immature livestock be valued under another scheme. If an election is received then the herd scheme values will only apply to the taxpayer’s mature herd livestock. In other words immature herd livestock is automatically included in the herd scheme except where the taxpayer elects otherwise. This section also requires that the election must be made in writing and furnished with the return of income for the income year that commenced on the 1st day of April 1989. This election option is only available to taxpayers who are already in the herd scheme. Taxpayers entering the herd scheme from 1 April 1990 are required to value all their immature herd livestock at herd livestock values. Any election to exclude immature livestock from the herd scheme can be revoked meaning the taxpayer may reverse the decision and place the immature classes of a livestock type in the herd scheme. The revocation once used is irreversible. In other words, once the immature classes of a herd livestock type are placed into the herd scheme they may not be removed. Taxpayers may now immediately enter the herd scheme without the previous 2 year waiting period. The entry provisions into the other live- stock schemes are not changed. The section applies in relation to the tax on income derived in the income year that commenced on the 1st day of April 1989 and in every subsequent year. Section 11 - Standard Value of Livestock The section amends section 86 of the principal Act to remove the 3-year write-down to trading stock values applying to specified livestock. The write-down applied to - (a)New farmers for their first 4 years of busi- ness; and (b)Existing farmers significantly expanding their business; and (c)Farmers swapping from the herd scheme to the trading stock scheme. The 3-year write down provisions will continue to apply with respect to non-specified livestock. The section applies to the tax on income derived in the income year that commenced on the 1st day of April 1989 and in every subsequent year. Section 12 - Valuation of Herd Livestock Subsection (1) amends section 86A of the principal Act by replacing the word “type” with “class”. This minor drafting amendment ensures that the herd scheme will apply where the taxpayer elects not to include immature livestock in the new expanded livestock in the herd scheme. Subsection (2) introduces a new section 86A(3A) to deal with a problem which arises on the death of a farmer or on the cessation of farming of a taxpayer in the herd scheme. The taxation liability of the taxpayer cannot be correctly determined until the herd livestock values for the income year are established generally after the end of that income year. The new section provides that where a taxpayer has: (a)Elected that their livestock shall be valued in accordance with the provisions of the herd scheme; and (b)During the income year the taxpayer dies or ceases farming and the herd livestock owned by the farmer is sold or otherwise disposed of prior to 1 January preceding the issuing of the herd values; and (c)In the case of: (i)The deceased taxpayer, the return to date of death is furnished prior to the issuing of the herd values in respect of that year; and (ii)In the case of all other qualifying taxpay- ers, an election in writing prior to 1 Janu- ary the values to be taken into account for the pur- poses of section 86A(3) of the principal Act are the herd values established for the previous year. 4 This section applies with respect to tax on income derived in the income year that commenced on the 1st day of April 1989 and in every subsequent year. Section 13 - Valuation of High-Priced Livestock This section amends the definition of “high- priced” livestock to set a $100 minimum entry level. Livestock with a value of less than $100 is not high priced livestock so must be included in the other livestock valuation regimes. This section also amends the depreciation provi- sions to allow depreciation to be claimed on livestock owned for less that 6 months where that livestock has been used for breeding purposes. The term “used for breeding purposes” means in respect of male livestock, that livestock used for insemination, and, in respect of female livestock, that livestock which has given birth. It was ac- cepted that breeding livestock depreciates with a single act so this definition is necessary to clarify exactly when that act is considered to have oc- curred. Livestock purchased within 6 months of the end of the income year are now able to be depreciated where that livestock has been used for breeding purposes by the taxpayer. All livestock 1 year of age and older are able to be depreciated. Section 55 - Twelfth Schedule The Twelfth schedule of the principal Act has had classes of immature female livestock added to the 3rd column. This column sets out those livestock classes eligible to be placed in the herd scheme. Also, some class names have been simplified to match current farming terminology. An extra class, rising 3 year and older steers, has been added to the Beef breeds and the Friesian breeds categories. BRANCH EQUIVALENT INCOME CALCULATION (Section 14) This section corrects several drafting errors con- tained in section 245(J). Section 245(J) is concerned with the calculation of Branch Equivalent income of a controlled foreign company. A number of subsections of section 245(J) make reference to “that person” or “the person”. The reference assumes “that person” or “the person” is a person with an income interest in the controlled foreign company, in respect of which the Branch Equivalent income or loss is being calculated, however the legislation fails to make that connec- tion. The amendments make it clear that the provisions of section 245(J), where they refer to “that person” or “the person” refer to a person who has an income interest in the controlled foreign company. EXCESS RETENTION TAX (Sections 15 to 19) Section 15 Subsection (1) amends the formula used to calcu- late excess retention tax. This appears in section 246 of the principal Act. It is intended that there be no tax benefit in chan- nelling dividend income through a privately controlled investment company. The previous formula used to calculate excess retention tax did not achieve this outcome in all cases - it worked correctly when all dividends received by the company either had the maximum or no imputa- tion or dividend withholding payment credits attached, and when all dividend income was either retained or distributed. However, it under- calculated excess retention tax (ERT) in instances where a company received a mixture of credited and uncredited dividends and only distributed some of its income. ERT is now payable on the “distributable portion of the dividend income derived by a company in an accounting year” which is the lesser of two figures: 1.Total dividend income derived by the company in that accounting year less the result of the formula a + b which is the same as in the previous cdefinition. The formula grosses up credits received, and dividend withholding payments made, to give an income equivalent. This calculation therefore effectively calcu- lates the amount of uncredited dividend income which is derived by the company in a year: or 2.Dividends (excluding imputation and dividend withholding payment credits) derived during the year less dividends paid (also excluding those credits) during the prescribed period relating to that year. 5 The amendment applies to excess retention tax on income derived in income years which commence on or after 1 April 1989. Subsection (2) of the amendment Act restricts the range of dividends subject to ERT to cash divi- dends and taxable bonus issues. This overcomes the difficulty experienced by privately controlled investment companies which receive deemed dividends but no cash and are required to distrib- ute such dividends to avoid excess retention tax. The amendment will be implemented with effect from the income year which commenced on 1 April 1988. Subsections (3) and (4) make a number of minor amendments to definitions in section 246. Section 16 substitutes a new section 250 conse- quential upon the amendment to the ERT formula. The “distributable portion of the dividend income derived by a company in an accounting year” is deemed to be an insufficient distribution. The effect of this is that ERT is now payable on the “distributable portion...”. Section 17 inserts a sunset clause into section 253 of the principal Act. The refund mechanism con- tained in that section will apply only where excess retention tax was paid in relation to income derived in an accounting year corresponding with an income year which commenced before 1 April 1989. Section 253 is not necessary in relation to ERT paid in respect of income derived in the income years commencing on or after 1 April 1988 since ERT paid gives rise to a credit in the company’s ICA and can now be passed through to sharehold- ers as imputation credits. Section 18 removes from section 255 of the princi- pal Act all references to “total income” and substi- tutes “total dividend income”. The definition of “total income” has been repealed. Section 19 repeals section 257 of the principal Act which allows the Commissioner to waive liability for ERT in certain specified situations. It was intended that a privately controlled investment company should not be relieved of an ERT liabil- ity unless an individual would have been relieved of an income tax liability on dividends in the same circumstances. None of the circumstances under which the Com- missioner was empowered to waive an excess retention tax liability under section 257 fall into this category. Section 257 has been repealed with respect to excess retention tax paid in respect of income years commencing on or after 1 April 1989. RETIREMENT TAX (Sections 20, 30, and 54) Section 257C of the principal Act is amended to change the way retirement tax is calculated in relation to company income. Previously retire- ment tax was to be calculated on the total taxable income of a company. This amendment now calculates retirement tax on a company’s assessable income, less the amount of dividends paid, plus the amount of dividends received. The purpose of this amendment is to avoid a double counting of retirement tax on company income which is distributed as dividends. That is, the amendment ensures that retirement tax is only attributed once to company income which is distributed as dividends to shareholders. This calculation shall apply for the 1990 income year and every subsequent year. The rate of retirement tax on fringe benefits is increased from 7.5 percent to 11.2 percent. This rate is consistent with the FBT rate. The fringe benefit tax rate is based on the 33 percent income tax rate of individuals. However income tax rates are applied to gross amounts of income. Fringe benefits on the other hand repre- sent net income in the recipient’s hands. For this reason the income tax rate is grossed up by a factor of 1 /(1-p) (where p is the individual tax rate) to arrive at the fringe benefit tax rate (49 cents in the dollar). In order to preserve consistency, in relation to retirement tax attributed to other forms of income, the retirement tax rate applying to fringe benefits should be grossed up by the same factor of 1/(1p). This results in a retirement tax rate, for fringe benefit purposes only, of 11.2 percent. DEDUCTION OF RESIDENT WITHHOLDING TAX (Section 21) This section deals with 5 different aspects of resident withholding tax: •Taxable Bonus Issues •Foreign Currency Accounts •$5000 threshold •Payments through exempt persons •Relief in respect of certain redemption payments 6 Taxable Bonus Issues Subsection (1) clarifies the amount of RWT to be deducted in relation to a taxable bonus issue. A full discussion of this legislation appears in the Appendix A to TIB No 3, issued in September 1989. Foreign Currency Accounts held in New Zealand Subsection (2) replaces subsection 327C(3) of the principal Act with a new subsection (3). The method for making RWT deductions from foreign denominated bank accounts held in NZ has been changed to allow the deduction to be made in the foreign currency. Where the deduction is made in the foreign currency the tax deduction certificate will show both the income and the deduction in foreign currency. For the purposes of calculating the NZ dollar value of the resident withholding income and the available withholding tax credit the taxpayer has the option of converting the foreign currency either at - •the close of trading spot exchange rate on the day on which the RWT deduction was made; or •At such rate as the Commissioner may specify for this purpose for the month in which the RWT deduction was made. Where any RWT deductions have been made in a foreign currency they are payable to the Commis- sioner in NZ dollars. Such deductions are to be converted at the close of trading spot exchange rate on the first working day of the month suc- ceeding the month in which the deduction was made. $5000 Threshold Subsection (3) replaces subsection 327C(5) of the main Act with a new subsection (5) which clarifies the operation of the $5000 threshold below which deductions of RWT are not required. A full discus- sion of this provision can be found in Appendix A to TIB 3. This amendment provides that where any pay- ment takes the total paid for that year over the $5000 threshold an RWT deduction will be re- quired from the whole of that payment. (Previ- ously it was only to the “extent that the payment exceeded $5000” which caused practical problems especially in cases where several payments were made simultaneously.) The amendment also ensures that the section only applies to a person who has a liability to deduct RWT; i.e. does not apply to persons making payments to which the RWT regime does not apply such as private mortgage interest. Payment through exempt persons Section 327C(7) of the principal Act provides that payments do not constitute resident withholding income where they are paid to persons who hold a Certificate of Exemption (COE). This provision is in addition to the provision in section 327B where interest or dividends derived by a person who holds a valid COE are excluded from the defini- tion of resident withholding income. Subpara- graph (vi) of section 327C(7)(c) provided that where a payer knew that a payment was not derived by the person who holds a COE that payer could not rely on section 327C(7) to avoid a re- quirement to make an RWT deduction. It was essentially an anti-avoidance provision. There was a similar provision in section 327C(7)(d). How- ever, these provisions created practical difficulties in for example certain trustee situations. Under the amendment in this Amendment Act (subsection (4), only in the case where a person is making an interest or dividend payment to a bank, building society or trustee bank, and the payment is not interest or dividends derived by that bank, building society or trustee bank as trustee for a third person, the payer cannot rely on the COE held by the bank, building society or trustee bank and will be required to deduct RWT. This provision will prevent persons from avoiding the requirement to make a deduction by paying through an exempt third party. Relief in respect of certain redemption payments Section 327C(8) of the principal Act provides relief where the payer is not aware that the payment constituted resident withholding income (RWI). Where any payer who is a bank, building society or trustee bank (i.e. has a COE pursuant to para- graphs (a) to (c) of S 327M(1)) receives a payment, or makes a payment at the request of another person (i.e. as agent or trustee), for the purpose of determining whether that payment constitutes RWI such payment shall be deemed not to consti- tute RWI if the payer could not reasonably be expected to know that the payment did constitute RWI. Practical problems arose with the existing provi- sion in situations where payments are made which are known to include a redemption pay- ment (e.g. bills of exchange) but, as the original issue price is not known, the payer has an obliga- 7 tion to deduct but does not know the amount from which to make a deduction. This amendment (subsection (5) extends section 327C(8) so that where a payer knows that a pay- ment includes a redemption payment but does not know the issue price and therefore cannot deter- mine the amount of the redemption payment the payment is deemed not to constitute resident withholding income. Application Date Subsection (6) deems subsections (1), (4) and (5) to take effect from 1 October 1989. AGENTS AND TRUSTEES - (Section 22) Section 22 of the Amendment Act amends Section 327D which imposes a liability on agents and trustees to make deductions of RWT on receipt of payments from which no deduction of RWT has been made. Where an agent, or trustee of a bare trust, either holds a COE, or receives a payment in the course of a taxable activity; and •the payment constitutes RWI; and •there has been no RWT deduction from that payment, the agent or trustee (of a bare trust) must deduct RWT at the time of receipt regardless of the reason why there was no previous deduction. This obligation does not apply, however, where any payment is received by a trustee of a trust which is not a bare trust. The obligation to deduct will arise if and when the trust income is distrib- uted. (A “bare trust” is a trust where the trustee has no duty to perform other than, on request, to convey the property of the trust to the beneficiary or according to the beneficiary’s direction.) There is also a minor drafting change which clarifies the relationship of 327D and 327C and removes the need to determine whether the payment was made in the course of a taxable activity. PAYMENT OF DEDUCTIONS OF RESIDENT WITHHOLDING TAX TO COMMISSIONER (Section 23) This section clarifies the payment provisions to clarify the distinction between payers who are required to make monthly payments of RWT deduction to the Commissioner and those who are required to make payments 6 monthly. Payers who estimate that they will make RWT deductions of more than $500 in each month of a particular year will be monthly payers. Where payers will not make payments of more than $500 in each month of that year they will be six- monthly payers. The requirement for 6 monthly payers to pay deductions to the Commissioner when accumu- lated deductions exceed $500 has not changed. Example Dedn’s mth EndedPay to CIR 31/10/89$ 165hold 30/11/89267hold 31/12/8960hold 31/01/90431pay $923by 14/2/90 28/02/90125hold 31/03/9063pay $188by 14/4/90 RESIDENT WITHHOLDING TAX RECONCILIATION STATEMENTS (Section 24) This is a minor amendment changing the word “30 days” to “20 working days” in section 327I (3) of the principal Act, in line with other provisions of Part IXA of the principal Act. CERTIFICATES OF EXEMPTION (Section 25) Section 327M(1)(D) is amended by extending the Public Trustee’s eligibility to obtain a COE for its wholly owned subsidiaries. Section 327M(1)(e) is amended by including the following categories of persons as eligible for COE’s: •solicitors’ nominee companies to which rules made by the Council of the NZ Law Society apply; and •brokers’ nominee companies to which the Securities Act (Contributory Mortgage) regulations 1988 apply. Section 327M(1) is further extended by a new paragraph (ea) which adds a new category of persons eligible to apply for a COE - solicitors, in relation to the operation of their trust accounts where such trust accounts are maintained in accordance with section 89 of the Law Practition- ers Act 1982. 8 Certain persons whose income is exempted from tax by various subsections of section 61 of the principal Act are able to obtain COE’s under paragraph (h) of Section 327M(1). Three additional subsections have also been included - (2A), (41) and (50). These refer respectively to:- •S61(2A) exempts certain income of Local Authorities. These were previously included in S61(2) which has been recently amended to apply only to Public Authorities. •S61(41) exempts the income on any sick, accident or death benefit fund. •S61(50) exempts income expressly exempted from income tax by any other Act. This particular provision will allow persons to obtain COE’s where they have previously had difficulty convincing payers by other means that their interest constituted “ex- empt” interest. Paragraph (c) of S 327M(12) is repealed. Any application for a COE pursuant to section 327M(12) has to be in the form prescribed which includes a declaration, so there was no necessity have an additional declaration as required by paragraph (c). A transitional provision is inserted to provide that where a person makes an application for a COE pursuant to the additional categories provided in this Amendment Act before the 31st day of Janu- ary 1990, the Certificate will be deemed to have been held since 1 October 1989. AMOUNT OF RESIDENT WITHHOLDING TAX DEDUCTION DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN RECEIVED (Section 26) Section 327ZA provides that the amount of RWT deduction is deemed to have been derived by the recipient of interest or dividend income. The amendment restricts the application of the section to RWT deducted from interest or specified divi- dends as RWT deducted from any other dividend is deemed to be a dividend withholding payment credit attached to that dividend and is included as income from dividends under section 394ZC. DISCLOSURE OF TRANSACTIONS IN FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS (Section 27) Section 27 extends the disclosure provisions in 327ZB to include situations where a redemption payment is made and an RWT deduction is not made because the payer either does not know that the payment is RWI, or does not know the extent to which the payment is RWI. (Section 21(5) of this Amendment Act refers) NO RIGHT OF ACTION WHERE OBLIGATION RELIEVED (Section 28) Section 28 provides a protection to payers who made deductions of RWT from recipients who subsequently obtain a “back-dated” COE so that the recipient cannot claim that they should have received a payment of RWI gross, and take action to retrieve the deduction made from the payer. This section also provides that any deductions made in those circumstances shall be a deduction of RWT not withstanding that the recipient re- ceives a back-dated COE. NATIONAL SUPERANNUITANT SURCHARGE - DETERMINATION OF SPECIFIED EXEMPTION This section amends a drafting error in section 336BA(1) of the Act. It ensures that a married superannuitant whose spouse does not qualify for National Superannua- tion can claim only one specified exemption. EMPLOYER EXEMPTION FROM TWICE- MONTHLY PAYE TAX DEDUCTION PAYMENTS AND SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTION WITHHOLDING TAX (Sections 31 to 35 and 38) At present PAYE tax deductions and Specified Superannuation Contribution Withholding Tax (SSCWT) are paid to the Department once a month. The date the payments are due is the 20th of the month after the month in which the contri- butions and the deductions were made (i.e.,. If the contributions or deductions were made in Janu- ary, the payments to the Commissioner would be due by the 20th of February). It was announced in the Budget that from 1 May 1990, all employers who make PAYE deduction payments and SSCWT would have to do so twice a month instead of monthly. This was achieved by splitting the month into two periods. The first period being from the 1st to the 15th of the month with payment due on the 20th of the same month, and the second period being from the 16th to the end of the month with pay- ment due on the 5th of the following month. 9 From 1 May 1990, twice monthly payment of PAYE deductions and SSCWT to the Inland Rev- enue Department shall be required only by those employers who in the previous tax year incurred PAYE deductions payable of $50,000 or more. Employers who in the previous tax year have incurred PAYE deductions payable of less than $50,000 may continue to pay the deductions to Inland Revenue on a monthly basis. Payment however, shall be required by the 5th instead of the 20th of the following month. A concession operates for new employers. Where an employer has not operated in the previous tax year, it is not possible to determine whether or not that employer should pay monthly or twice monthly. As a result, that employer may pay the deductions and any SSCWT on a monthly basis until such time as the deductions reach $50,000 or more in aggregate for that year. Once this hap- pens, that employer shall from then on be re- quired to make payment of the deductions and any SSCWT twice a month. FAMILY SUPPORT CREDIT OF TAX (Section 36) At present, if a two parent family is eligible for Family Support, the payment is split and made equally to both parents either through the em- ployer or the Department of Social Welfare, depending on the working status of each parent. At the end of the year, if a debit arises in the account of either parent, both parents are consid- ered jointly and severally liable to pay the debit. From 1 April 1990, Family Support in two parent families will be paid only to the parent in receipt of the Family Benefit. In almost all cases this is the parent who is the primary carer of the children. As a result, the parent (or secondary carer) who does not receive the family benefit will only receive Guaranteed Minimum Family Income (GMFI) if the family is also eligible for this tax credit. Because many Primary Carers do not receive any independent form of income, if a debit were to arise in the account of the Primary Carer due to an overpayment of Family Support, both parents will still remain jointly and severally liable. GUARANTEED MINIMUM FAMILY INCOME (Section 37) The amount of the Guaranteed Minimum Family Income is increased by $10 per week with effect from 1 April 1990. From that date full-time earners with one child will have a guaranteed after tax income of $320 per week. The increased amount will be included when new Certificates of Entitlement to Family Support are issued by Inland Revenue prior to 1 April 1989. IMPUTATION, DIVIDEND WITHHOLDING PAYMENT AND BRANCH EQUIVALENT TAX ACCOUNT REGIMES (Sections 39 to 50) Section 39 of the Amendment Act amends section 394D(1) of the principal Act to allow an imputa- tion credit to arise in the imputation credit account (ICA) of a company for resident withholding tax deducted in respect of resident withholding income derived by that company. This would only apply to interest paid to a company because no resident withholding tax is deducted where dividends are derived by a company. The credit arises on the date that the resident withholding tax is deducted (section 394D(2) amended by subsection (3)). Section 394D(1)(i) is also amended to provide that where a company which has credits in its branch equivalent tax account (BETA) arising under the new subsection 394ZZP(1)(b) (refer to commentary on section 48 of the Amendment Act) uses those credits to offset a dividend withholding payment liability no credit to the ICA arises. Section 40 amends section 394E to ensure that a debit does not arise in the ICA of a company where the company receives a refund of income tax or excess retention tax in respect of tax paid prior to the date that the company was in breach of the continuity of shareholder rules. When the company breaches the requirements, a debit arises in the ICA. The amendment ensures that a debit does not arise twice in respect of the same amount of tax. An amendment is made to section 394E(1)(f) consequential upon the changes made to section 394ZZP to ensure that a BETA credit arising from the offset of branch equivalent income against New Zealand tax losses in accordance with section 394ZZP(1)(b) (refer to commentary on section 48) does not give rise to a cross debit in the company’s ICA. Section 41 amends section 394L(4A) which pro- vides that where a company is paid a refund arising as a result of an export tax incentive which relates to the 1989 or a subsequent income year and which has given rise to a debit in the 10 company’s lCA, further income tax payable in relation to the end of year debit in the company’s ICA is reduced by all such refunds which have previously been paid to the company. The amount of the debit balance which is exempt from liability for further income tax is now reduced by all credits to the ICA received by the company in and since the imputation year that the debit arose in respect of such a refund. The amendment ensures that imputation credits may only be attached to dividends as a result of tax being paid, as was originally intended. Section 42 inserts into the definitions section for the dividend withholding payment regime (sec- tion 394ZK(1) a definition of ‘close of trading spot exchange rate’ consequent upon the insertion of a provision for converting foreign dividend with- holding payment dividends in section 394ZM (see section 43 below). Section 43 amends section 394ZM to provide for the conversion into New Zealand currency of foreign withholding payment dividends for the purpose of calculating the dividend withholding payment to be deducted. The dividend is to be converted either at: -the close of trading spot exchange rate on the day the deduction is to be made or on the following day, or -the rate the foreign withholding payment dividend was actually converted into New Zealand currency provided it was a market rate for transactions entered into at arm’s length. Section 44 amends section 394ZN(1) of the princi- pal Act to ensure that a company is required to pay dividend withholding payment where it is “paid” a foreign dividend rather than where it “receives” a foreign dividend. This is consistent with section 394ZL which requires a company to deduct dividend withholding payment when it is paid a foreign dividend. Section 45 inserts a new section 394ZS into the principal Act to counter arrangements entered into for the purpose of avoiding the application of the foreign dividend withholding payment re- gime. The amendment is designed to counter arrange- ments entered into to alter or disguise the nature of payments of foreign dividends so they are not recognisable as payments of dividends when they are paid by a non-resident company to a company that is resident in New Zealand. The Commis- sioner may deem a payment that is the subject of the arrangement to be a foreign withholding payment dividend. The provision applies only where a purpose of an arrangement is to defeat the application of the dividend withholding payment regime - where there is an arrangement to, in effect, make a payment to a New Zealand resident company in substitution for dividends. The provision can only apply in limited circum- stances, e.g., where it is determined that there is an arrangement to disguise a dividend payment to a company resident in New Zealand, being an amount that is paid in a non-taxable form. This is because the dividend withholding payment regime can only apply to a foreign withholding payment dividend which, as defined in sections 394ZK and 394ZL is a dividend paid by a non- resident company to a New Zealand resident company. An anti-avoidance provision is necessary to coun- ter such arrangements, as section 99 of the Act does not apply because the foreign dividend withholding payment is not income tax. The provision would be invoked by way of an assessment under section 394ZN. There is there- fore a right of objection under section 394ZN(9). Section 46 amends section 394ZV to clarify that no credit arises in the dividend withholding payment account of a company where that company satis- fies payment of dividend withholding payment by reducing its tax loss as it may elect to do under section 394ZN. The dividend withholding pay- ment regime is based on the premise that credits may only be passed on to shareholders where DWP is paid. To allow credits to arise where no DWP is paid may lead to shareholders effectively obtaining cash refunds for the tax losses of the company. Section 47 amends section 394ZW in a similar manner to the proposed amendment to section 394E in section 40. This will ensure that a debit does not arise twice in respect of a refund of dividend withholding payment where there has been a breach of the continuity of shareholder requirements. Section 48 repeals section 3947ZZP(1) and allows, in addition to the credit which already arises where tax is paid under the international regime, a credit to the branch equivalent tax account (BETA) of a company where the company offsets any branch equivalent income (attributed foreign 11 income) that arises under the international tax regime against its New Zealand tax losses. This amendment is required to address the prob- lem which arose where a company reduced its tax losses to offset both its income tax liability on branch equivalent income and its dividend with- holding payment liability on foreign dividends. There was in effect a double reduction of losses in respect of the same income. This section inserts subsection (4A) into section 394ZZP to provide an ordering rule to establish the order in which BETA credits are deemed to be exhausted. The rule provides that credits arising for the offset of branch equivalent income against NZ tax losses are deemed to have been exhausted first. This section also provides an amendment similar to that provided in section 40 in relation to re- funds of income tax on branch equivalent income where a company is in breach of the continuity of shareholding requirements. Section 49 amends section 394ZZQ to prevent any credit that arises under the new subsection (1)(b) of section 394ZZP (inserted by section 48) from being transferred to the lCA of the company. This is to prevent a company from passing on imputa- tion credits where no income tax has been paid. Section 50 amends section 394ZZU in a similar manner to that provided in section 40, in relation to refunds of income tax on the branch equivalent income of a life insurance company where a life insurance company is in breach of the continuity of shareholder requirements. INTEREST WHERE RESIDUAL INCOME TAX EXCEEDS PROVISIONAL TAX (Section 51) Individual taxpayers who earn less than $100,000 and do not estimate their provisional tax liability will now be subject to interest where their residual income tax liability exceeds the amount of provi- sional tax paid. Certificates of exemption from Interest PAYE and Dividend PAYE are granted in circumstances where the tax deducted at source from interest or dividend income would exceed the taxpayer’s annual liability. Where an indi- vidual who derived less than $100,000 provisional income is issued a certificate of exemption for this reason they will now be charged interest on any underpayment of provisional tax. This change takes effect for the provisional tax payable in the 1991 income year. TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR PROVISIONAL TAX IN THE 1990 INCOME YEAR (Section 56) This is a transitional measure to allow provisional taxpayers who pay 1990 provisional tax on the basis of their 1989 residual income tax \[RIT\] to reduce the amount of their provisional tax pay- ments for the 1990 year. The amount of the reduc- tion is calculated on the basis of half the amount of interest and dividend income derived in the 1989 income year. Deductions of Interest PAYE and Dividend PAYE commenced on 1 October 1989. Under the previ- ous legislation, taxpayers who pay provisional tax on the basis of the amount of their previous year’s RIT would have been subject to both PAYE and provisional tax on Interest and Dividend income derived in the final six months of the 1990 income year. The reduction in provisional tax is not available to taxpayers who have held a certificate of exemp- tion from Interest PAYE or Dividend PAYE which was valid at any time during the 1990 income tax year. Nor is it available to taxpayers who have estimated their 1990 provisional tax prior to the instalment due date. For the purposes of the calculation of provisional tax, the amount of residual income tax derived in the immediately preceding year is deemed to be reduced by the amount calculated by the formula shown below. The amount of reduction in 1990 provisional tax is 110 percent of the amount obtained through the following formula: a + b - c Where, ais half of the taxpayer’s interest income in the 1989 income year multiplied by the rate of Interest PAYE (24 percent) For the purposes of a the term interest excludes- -Exempt interest (refer Section 327A of the Income Tax Act 1976) -Interest which constitutes nonresident withholding income -Interest derived outside New Zealand by a nonresident -Interest paid between groups of compa- nies -Interest derived by a nonresident invest- ment company from development invest- ments bis half the taxpayer’s dividend income in the 1989 income year multiplied by the rate of dividend PAYE (33 percent); 12 Where the taxpayer is acting as an agent for the Crown (e.g. PAYE, GST), the funds are trust money and as such cannot be considered under this section. The Department has to consider the implications of the proposal/arrangement and, before giving consent, must be satisfied that: -there is a reasonable certainty that all remaining debts can be paid; -there is little or no likelihood of further arrears arising; -the proposal provides a better payment plan for the Department’s debt than could be obtained via some other recovery option; -all other creditors agree to the proposal; -no other creditor receives preferential payment in the general proposal put for- ward to creditors. Where misleading and/or new information comes to light that relates to the date on which relief was granted the Commissioner may reverse his deci- sion. Provision has been made for an interim assess- ment outside the taxpayers’ normal balance date. The Commissioner’s discretion under this section is limited to tax owing up to $50,000. Amounts in excess of $50,000, may be remitted, only with the approval of the Minister of Finance. Application for remission can be made through a taxpayer’s local District Office. INLAND REVENUE DEPARTMENT AMENDMENT ACT 1989 This Act inserts two new paragraphs, paragraphs (ba) and (ca), into section 13(4) of the Inland Revenue Department Act 1974 and consequen- tially amends section 15 of that Act. Section 13 of the IRD Act limits the extent to which information held by the Inland Revenue Depart- ment. may be communicated to other persons, whilst section 15 obliges persons to sign declara- tions of secrecy before being provided with any information. A new paragraph (ba) has been inserted into section 13(4) to permit Treasury staff access to IRD For the purposes of b the term dividends excludes - -Non-cash dividends to the extent that FBT is payable -Inter-corporate dividends exempt under section 63 of the Act -Amounts deemed to be dividends under specified provisions -Dividends which constitute non resident withholding income -Dividends derived outside New Zealand by a non-resident -Dividends expressly exempted from tax other than by the Income Tax Act cis the aggregate of any dividend withhold- ing payment credits and imputation credits attached to the dividends in item b. This transitional provision applies only for the 1990 income year. The transitional arrangements for the 1991 income year are in separate provi- sions - see section 17 of the Income Tax Amend- ment Act (No.2) 1989. The other transitional provisions for the 1990 income year which allow a zero uplift for taxpay- ers with income over $100,000, and provide adjustments for changes to rates of tax, will con- tinue to be applied after the adjustment described above has been made. DISCRETION TO GRANT RELIEF IN CASES OF SERIOUS HARDSHIP (Section 53) Section 53 inserts a new section 414A. This section provides the Commissioner with the discretion to remit all of a taxpayer’s tax payments or to remit part with the facility to spread any payment. The section is to be applied where a taxpayer is in financial difficulties and has entered into negotia- tions with his/her creditors. This section will allow the Commissioner to consider arrangements which will maximise the recovery of tax liabilities. The discretion will be applied in a manner that is consistent with commercial practice, such as, the concept that a dollar received today is worth more than a dollar received in the future. It will ensure the highest return possible of outstanding tax payments. A copy of the statement of financial position and the trading position are required along with the proposed arrangement by credi- tors. A declaration as to the fullness and accuracy of the information supplied is required, to ensure that the Commissioner has all available informa- tion on which to base his decision. The discretion to remit tax is limited to those taxes that relate to the taxpayers’ assessable income. 13 information for the sole purpose of assisting them in the preparation of taxation revenue forecasts. Paragraph (ca) was inserted into section 13(4) to enable the Commissioner to provide information to those persons he contracts for the performance of specific tasks. The amendment will allow officers of the Inland Revenue Department to provide contractors/consultants with sufficient information to enable them to perform their contracted duties. The amendment to section 15 of the Inland Rev- enue Department Act was consequential to the inclusion of paragraphs (ba) and (ca) into section 13(4). As a result of this amendment, declarations of secrecy will need to be completed prior to any information being provided to an officer of Treas- ury, for revenue forecasting, or to any contractor engaged by the Commissioner. This will subject any such person who fails to comply with their obligation to maintain secrecy to the same penal- ties as would apply to an IRD employee, i.e. on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term of up to 6 months or to a fine of up to $15,000. LAND TAX AMENDMENT ACT (NO.2) 1989 (SECTIONS 1 TO 35) Introduction The Land Tax Amendment Act (No.2) 1989 intro- duces earlier due dates for payment of land tax, as well as a “GST-style” self assessment approach. In addition, an exemption from land tax is provided for hospitals, area health boards, and vacant land intended for residential uses. Finally, the amend- ment Act confirms a 1 percent rate of tax on land held at 31 March 1990. The amendments may be summarised as follows- New Payment Dates The Land Tax Amendment Act (No.2) 1989 pro- vides for the new earlier land tax payment date of 7 May. The movement from the current 7 October payment date to 7 May date was announced by the Minister of Finance in the 1989 Budget. A transitional arrangement is also introduced which provides that for the 1990 year land tax is due and payable in 2 equal instalments on 7 May and 7 October. Self-Assessment Approach A number of consequential amendments were needed to the Land Tax Act 1976 to give effect to the new earlier payment date and self-assessment system. Taxpayers will be required to determine their tax liability and pay the tax so determined without awaiting receipt of a formal notice of assessment from the Department. Exemptions from Land Tax The exemption provided for land of a specific nature such as sea beds, reserves, and wildlife refuges is amended in order to include land of this nature owned by a local authority. The exemption is further amended by adding a pecuniary profit test to ensure that reserve land used for a business is subject to land tax. The exemption provided for land used as the site of a residence is amended to exempt vacant land which is intended to be used and can be lawfully used (without any application, dispensation, waiver under the Town and Country Planning Act 1976) as the site of any residence. In other words, small vacant residential sections are now exempt from land tax. New exemptions are introduced for land used as the site of any hospital (public or private) and for land used by an Area Health Board to provide health services. Confirmation of Tax Rate The amendment Act confirms the rate of land tax for the year of payment commencing on 1 April 1990 at 1%. Detailed Provisions Section 2 - Interpretation The new self-assessment approach means the Commissioner will not issue an assessment in the majority of cases. The removal of the requirement for the Commissioner to issue an assessment makes it inappropriate to define a land tax year as a “year of assessment”. It is as a result of the amendment that the year is now referred to as a “year of payment”. There is no change in the actual meaning of the amended definition which is retained as the year for which land tax is pay- able. The definition of the term “hospital” is introduced for the purposes of the hospital exemption in- serted by section 63 of the amendment Act. A “hospital” is defined as any hospital or similar institution, under the control of an Area Health Board, including any psychiatric hospital where that hospital is used principally for the treatment or diagnosis or rehabilitation or care of patients. 14 The definition also includes any licensed hospital within the meaning of Part V of the Hospitals Act 1957. Licensed hospitals are private hospitals which have met certain criteria specified in the Hospitals Act. The inclusion of this provision in the definition effectively means that private hospitals are now exempt from land tax. Section 140 of the Income Tax Act 1976 has been repealed and replaced with a new section 140. This new section provides that where land tax is deductible it is deductible in the year that the land tax is paid. This may mean that with the 2 pay- ment dates applying in the year of payment commencing 1 April 1990, half the tax relating to that year may be deductible in one income year and half in the next. Sections 3 to 13,15 to 20, 24 to 26 and 28 to 34- Minor Amendments These sections represent minor amendments providing for the new self-assessment approach. Section 14 - Exemptions of Certain Classes of Land This section amends two existing exemptions and introduces two new exemptions. The first amendment amends section 27(1)(b) of the Land Tax Act. This section ensures that lands of a specific nature such as sea beds and historic reserves are exempt from land tax. The amend- ment provides that where these lands are owned by a local authority they are now exempt from land tax. This amendment ensures that the exemption does not apply where the land is being used for the “pecuniary profit of any person”. The amendment also ensures that where land is owned and used by the Crown, or a public, or local authority for a purpose specified in paragraphs (i) and (k) of section 27(1), such as a public museum, the pri- vate pecuniary profit test of any individual con- tained in those paragraphs is applied. In other words where a museum is sited on reserve land the less strenuous private pecuniary profit test of “any individual” is applied rather than “any person”. Second the residential exemption provided by section 27(1)(q) is amended to exempt the typical small vacant residential section purchased for the purpose of building a home on the site. It provides that vacant land which is intended to be used and can be lawfully used as the site of any residence is exempt from land tax. The three tests that must be satisfied for the exemption to apply are (1)The land must be vacant. The land must be free of buildings or it cannot fulfil the requirement that it is to be used as the site of any residence as it is being used as the site of building designed for another pur- pose; and (2)The land can be lawfully used as the site of a residence. The most common case fulfill- ing this requirement is where the operative district scheme has the land classified as residential in nature. The land may also lawfully be used as residential where the land is subject to a specified departure, or where a dispensation has been granted, under the Town and Country Planning Act; and (3)The taxpayer must have the intention of using the land as the site of a residence in the future. A new exemption is provided for land to the extent that it is used as the site for a hospital. The land associated with a hospital is defined widely to include servicing and landscaped areas directly associated with the operation of the hospital. Also a further health related exemption is pro- vided to reflect the wider operations now ex- pected of area health boards. The exemption applies to health services which means - (a)Services to promote health (b)Services to protect health (c)Services to prevent disease or ill-health (d)Treatment Services (e)Nursing Services (f)Rehabilitative services (g)Diagnostic Services (h)Psychotherapy and counselling services (i)Contraception services and advice (j)Sterilisation Services (k)Ambulance Services (l)Mortuaries As with the hospitals exemption it is considered that this exemption does not apply to administra- tive offices and other similar secondary services unless they are on the site and directly associated with the health service being provided. Section 21- Payment Of Tax The section provides that the amount of land tax payable by the taxpayer is the amount the tax- payer calculates as payable in their land tax 15 return. The Commissioner will no longer issue an assessment informing the taxpayer of the actual amount of their tax liability. The tax shall be due and payable for any year of payment on the 7th day of May. Section 22 - Transitional Arrangements for Land Valued 31 March 1990 The section remains in the Land Tax Amendment Act (No.2) 1989 and provides for land owned on 31 March 1990, land tax shall be due and payable in 2 equal instalments on the 7th day of May and 7th day of October 1990. Section 23 - Additional Tax To Be Charged if Default Made In Payment of Tax As part of the self-assessment approach the exist- ing 10% 6 monthly incremental additional tax regime has been replaced. The new additional tax scheme imposes a one-off 10% additional tax charge if a payment is short, nil or late paid. Each subsequent month a further 2% additional tax on the balance outstanding is imposed until the tax is paid. Section 27 - Power of Commissioner in Respect of Small Amounts The Commissioner may now refrain collecting or refunding tax where the balance does not exceed $5. Section 35 - Confirming rate of land tax for year commencing 1 April 1990 For the year commencing 1 April 1990 land tax shall be imposed, levied, and paid pursuant to Part II of the Schedule to the Act. Part B specifies a rate of land tax of 1 percent. ESTATE AND GIFT DUTIES AMEND- MENT ACT (NO. 2)1989 Section 98 of the principal Act provides the Com- missioner of Inland Revenue with the discretion- ary power to destroy estate and gift duty records held after the expiration of 50 years from the date of death of the person or from the date of making a gift. The amendment contained in the Estate and Gift Duties Amendment Act (No. 2) 1989 reduces the minimum period of retention from 50 years to 15 years, with effect from the date of assent, 19 December 1989. STAMP AND CHEQUE DUTIES AMENDMENT ACT 1989 (Sections 1 to 4 Conveyance and Lease Duty) The Minister of Revenue issued a press release on 24 May 1989 to clear up the confusion which had arisen with the assessment of conveyance and lease duty, particularly, whether the value of the property and rental should be GST inclusive. The Minister confirmed that conveyance duty and lease duty was to be assessed on the GST inclusive value of the property and rental respectively. Further, the Minister advised that the Government would introduce amending legislation at the earliest opportunity to clarify this issue. Sections 2 to 4 clarify the legislation that for the purposes of computing lease and conveyance duty, the value of the rental and property, are to be inclusive of any goods and services tax charge- able. These sections will apply to any instrument of conveyance or lease executed on or after 19 De- cember 1989. (Section 5) This section repeals the exemption from cheque duty on bills of exchange drawn or made on behalf of any school committee formed under the Education Act 1964. This section takes effect from the date of assent, being 19 December 1989. This amendment is a consequential amendment resulting from the abolishment of the school committees with effect from 18 May 1989, and the replacement with the Boards of Trustees under the School Trustees Act 1989. Bills of exchange drawn or made on behalf of any Board of Trustee will be exempt from cheque duty pursuant to Clause 2 of the Second Schedule to the School Trustees Act 1989. APPENDICES TO TIB NO. 8.

1 GOODS AND SERVICES AMEND- MENT ACT (NO 2) 1989 Unless where otherwise stated, the provisions in this Act came into force on 19 December 1989 which was the date on which the Act received the Governor-General’s assent. SUPPLIES BY PUBLIC AUTHORITIES Sections 2(1), (3), and (4) Sections 4(2) and (7) The Public Finance Act 1989 made a number of consequential amendments to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to reflect the financial management reforms contained in that Act. In particular, the Public Finance Act 1989 amended the GST Act by: (i)Introducing the definition of the term “revenue from the Crown” to identify the amount appropriated by the Crown that would be subject to GST. (ii)Amending section 5(6) to deem a supply of goods and services by a public authority to occur where “revenue from the Crown” is brought to charge by that public authority. (iii)Inserting a new section 9(7) to provide a time of supply in respect of “revenue from the Crown” being brought to charge. (iv)Amending section 10(10) to determine the value of the deemed supply in terms of section 5(6). (v)Amending section 19 to limit the payments basis of accounting for GST to those public authorities on the mode A basis of appro- priation. That is, not those on an accruals basis (Mode B), or the appropriation method used in some trading activities of Government departments (Mode C). Revenue from the Crown - Sections 2(1), (3), and (4) The definition of “revenue from the Crown” ensures that only the revenue received from the Crown (an appropriation) in respect of a supply of goods and services produced by a public authority (including a Government department) is taken into account in calculating GST. This is achieved by excluding certain revenue received by a public authority from the meaning of that term. As the term refers to revenue received for the supply of goods and services, any money received an (appropriated) in relation to: (a)The Crown’s net asset holding in a public authority (i.e., capital injections); or (b)The payment of benefits and grants on behalf of the Crown - is not included. In addition, the following items are specifically excluded: (a)Revenue received from any other public authority in the form of explicit charges and fees. Such fees and charges are subject to GST in the same manner as any other supply. This revenue is excluded to ensure that where such amounts are also an appro- priation by the Crown a double impost of GST does not occur. (b)Goods and services tax levied under the GST Act on the deemed supply by a public authority. (c)Revenue collected by a department on behalf of the Crown, such as taxes. It should be noted that “revenue from the Crown” applies only in respect of appropriations made pursuant to Mode B or C. That is, appropriations on an accruals basis, or the appropriation method used in some trading activities of Government departments. The previous definition was deficient in identify- ing the portion of revenue received for the pur- poses of the deemed supply because: (a)It referred to an appropriation of public money which gives the impression that there is always a payment of public money for the supply of goods and services by a public authority. This is not the case as a Mode B appropriation may include non- cash items such as depreciation. (b)It also included fees and charges received from other public authorities and third parties, where those fees and charges were also an appropriation of public money. This would have lead to a double imposition of GST. Deemed supply by Public Authorities - Sections 4(2) and (7) Section 5(6)(b) of the GST Act which deems a supply to occur where revenue from the Crown is brought to charge by a public authority is amended to remove reference to public money. 2 The amendment is necessary because non-cash items appropriated under Mode B are part of the deemed supply by the public authority. These provisions apply in respect of supplies made on or after 1 July 1989 to coincide with the implementation of the Public Finance Act 1989. SERVICE OCCUPANCY AGREEMENTS Sections 2(2) and 8(2) A new term “service occupancy agreement” is defined as being a licence created where a person occupies a dwelling for no consideration. Section 14(c) of the GST Act 1985 (Exempt Sup- plies) is amended to ensure that where accommo- dation in a dwelling is supplied for no considera- tion, pursuant to a service occupancy agreement, an exempt supply is deemed to be made. FINANCIAL SERVICES Section 3 Sections 8(1) and (3) These amendments are a result of the recent Court of Appeal decision which held that certain serv- ices supplied to the trading banks were financial services, and therefore exempt from GST. This decision centred on the premise that the services supplied were an integral part of the financial services supplied by the trading banks and there- fore were an exempt supply. In addition, the Court looked at the activity rather than the nature of the supply of goods and services between the supplier and the recipient. The proposed amendment was announced on Budget night by the Minister of Revenue. The purpose is to ensure the original boundary be- tween taxable and exempt supplies is retained. The new rules are not solely directed at the com- pany featured in the Court of Appeal Case, but to any other person who in terms of that decision is treating taxable services as exempt. Financial services - Section 3 The meaning of the term “financial services” contained in section 3 of the GST Act 1985 is amended by: (a)Inserting a definition of the term “general accounting and record package services” in section 3(2); and (b)Deeming “general accounting and record package services” not to be financial services where those services are supplied to a supplier of financial services or a customer of that supplier of financial services. “General accounting and record package services” are (a)The provision of a financial clearing system which may form part of a settlement proc- ess. A financial clearing system is a system which allows for financial instruments such as cheques to be gathered at a central point to be processed. This processing may in- volve the verification of the information contained on those instruments, the extrac- tion of information for other purposes, or the sorting of those instruments for redistri- bution to the payers of those financial instruments. This list is not exhaustive. A clearing system may lead to a settlement process occurring where the total balance of all financial instruments processed is ascer- tained in respect of the parties to the clear- ing system. These balances are then set off between these parties to establish a net amount which is either payable or receiv- able. (b)The posting of financial transactions to customers’ accounts. This service involves the debiting and crediting of customers’ accounts (i.e., the customer of the provider of the financial services) with amounts shown on financial instruments. It also includes such amounts as interest etc., which are a direct result of a financial instrument. (c)The maintenance of customers’ accounts. This is the day to day upkeep of the custom- ers’ accounts involving changes of address, details of type of account, the account balance, interest and fee characteristics applicable to a customer and so on. It also involves the preparation of periodic state- ments, the monitoring of the account for default, exceeded predetermined credit limits, etc. Again this list is not exhaustive. (d)The provision of any ancillary services supplied in relation to the services supplied above. 3 This would include such services of network management where the supplier of the financial services has on-line computer access to the type of record contained in paragraphs (b) and (c). The provision also makes specific reference to software devel- opment and support. This provision is a catchall in respect of other services supplied in connection with the services described in the preceding paragraphs. The term “general accounting and record package services” does not include the above described services where those services are supplied by a supplier of financial services and are reasonably incidental and necessary to the supply of those financial services by that supplier. The purpose of this exclusion is to ensure that where, for example, a bank makes an explicit charge for a change of address in respect of a bank account, which would be deemed to be a taxable supply in terms of these amendments, it is treated as an exempt supply as it is reasonably incidental and necessary to the operation of the bank account which is a financial service supplied by the bank. Exempt supplies - Sections 8(1) and (3) Section 14(a) of the GST Act which exempts certain supplies of goods and services from the imposition of GST is repealed and a new para- graph substituted. The new paragraph provides that the supply of financial services is still exempt except where: (a)The supply of those services would be zero rated under section 11(2) of the GST Act 1985. This exception applied previously. (b)A supply of goods and services which forms part of a supply of financial services, be- tween the supplier of that part and the recipient, is not a supply of a financial service. The purpose of paragraph (b) is to ensure that the nature of the supply between the supplier and the recipient determines whether the supply is taxable or exempt, not the activity to which the supply was made. In the above-mentioned Court of Appeal decision it was held that services supplied were an integral part of the financial services supplied by the recipients and therefore were an exempt supply themselves. This gives the impres- sion that the tax status of the supply is determined by the nature of the recipient’s activity, not the nature of the supply itself. This amendment overcomes this concept as regards financial serv- ices by ensuring that only those supplies which are in themselves a financial service qualify for the exemption from GST. In addition, section 14(a) has been amended to expand the exemption from GST in respect of the supply of financial services to include goods and services which are supplied by a supplier of financial services in conjunction with a supply of a financial service. This expansion is limited to goods and services supplied by the supplier of a financial service which are reasonably incidental and necessary to the supply of that financial service. Despite the Government’s earlier intentions when the Minister of Revenue announced that the amendments would apply from 28 July 1989, these provisions apply to supplies made on or after 16 December 1989 when the enacting legislation received the Governor-General’s assent. GOODS SOLD IN SATISFACTION OF A DEBT Sections 4(1) and (6) Section 10 Section 11(3) These amendments amend the following sections of the GST Act: (a)Section 5(2) which deems a supply to occur where goods are sold in satisfaction of a debt; (b)Section 17 which provides for a special return to be furnished in respect of goods sold in satisfaction of a debt; and (c)Section 24 which sets out the tax invoice requirements. Goods sold in satisfaction of debt - Sections 4(1) and (6) A new section 5(2) of the Goods and Services Act is substituted. In addition to retaining the provi- sion of the repealed subsection, which deemed a supply to have been made where goods of one person are sold by another in satisfaction of a debt owed by that first-mentioned person, the new subsection also: (a)Provides for the GST treatment of goods repossessed in terms of a hire purchase agreement. Where a good is repossessed in terms of a hire purchase agreement and sold in satis- faction of a debt, the person seizing the good and selling it is making that supply to the subsequent purchaser on behalf the 4 defaulter. This means that there is no supply from the defaulter to the repossessor unless the repossessor purchases the good. (b)Makes it clear that the supply is deemed to be made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by the person whose goods have been sold in satisfaction of a debt and that that person is a registered person. (c)Provides a mechanism for the person exer- cising the power of sale to determine the tax status of the supply. At present, the person whose goods are sold is required to furnish to the person exercis- ing the power of sale a written statement to the effect that the supply would not be taxable, if made by the first person. In addition to the written statement, the person exercising the power of sale can, where no such statement can be obtained, determine the status of the supply on the basis of any reasonable evidence held. It is considered that reasonable information held for the purposes of paragraph (b) of the new section 5(2) would be: (a)Details of the customer’s or borrower’s GST status obtained by the retailer or financier from the customer or the borrower at the time of entering into the hire purchase agreement or loan document and whether the goods used as security form part of the taxable activity, if the customer or borrower is registered. In addition, the documentation should also contain a covenant requiring the customer or borrower to advise the retailer or financier of any change in registration for GST. (b)Information from the accountant, solicitor, neighbour of the person whose goods are sold, gained at the time of exercising the power of sale. It should be noted that, in terms of section 27(1A) of the GST Act, where any assessment is raised in respect of a special return (furnished pursuant to section 17) the person exercising the power of sale is liable for any tax payable. This ensures that the onus is placed on the person exercising the power of sale to determine that the status of the supply is correct. Special Returns- Section 10 Where goods are sold in satisfaction of a debt in terms of section 5(2) of the GST Act, section 17 requires the person selling the goods to furnish a special return accounting for the tax on that supply. This section of the amendment Act amends section 17 of the principal Act to allow the Commissioner to change the format of the special return. At present a special return is required to be fur- nished, by the person selling the goods, in respect of each person whose goods are sold in satisfaction of a debt. As a result of the amendment, such supplies will now be recorded on a composite return which will allow the person selling the goods to record the supplies of different defaulters on the one return. Instead of the person who sells the goods issuing a copy of the return form to the defaulter, that person will now be required to supply to the defaulter the information shown on the return form. Tax Invoices - Section 11(3) Section 24 of the GST Act is amended to explicitly allow the person selling goods in satisfaction of a debt to issue a tax invoice in respect of the supply made pursuant to section 5(2). This applies whether that person is registered for GST pur- poses or not. The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that a tax invoice can be issued in all cases where a recipient of the section 5(2) supply, requests a tax invoice. Previously, if the person selling the goods in satisfaction of the debt was not registered for GST purposes, that person was unable to issue a tax invoice in terms of section 60(1) of the GST Act. This problem was further compounded where the person whose goods have been seized and sold refused to provide a tax invoice or has absconded. This amendment also provides that where the person selling the goods is not registered for GST purposes, and therefore unable to show their GST registration number on the tax invoice, that person must show their Inland Revenue Department identification number instead. RACE BETTING - Section 4(3) - (5) and section 6(3) Section 5(8) deems there to be a supply of goods and services when a bet is placed on a race. The value of that supply being determined by section 10(12) of the GST Act 1985. The amendments relate to two issues: (a)Intertrack betting, and (b)Rounding of dividends. 5 Intertrack Betting An intertrack bet is a bet placed at a racecourse on races being conducted at another racecourse. Section 5(8) is amended to deem there to be a supply of goods and services where an intertrack bet is placed. This amendment brings the GST treatment of intertrack betting into line with the way that GST is imposed on other forms of race betting. Rounding of Dividends The Racing Act 1971 provides that dividends paid shall be rounded down to the nearest 5 cents. Income from the rounding of dividends (fractions income) is deemed to be a taxable supply. The value of fractions income is calculated as the amount of money retained by either the racing clubs or the Totalisator Agency Board due to the rounding of dividends (to 5 cents). Example If the amount of money available to be distributed as dividends was $3400 and there were 2764 winning punters then the dividend that should be paid to each is $1.23. This amount would, how- ever, be rounded down and only $1.20 would be paid. The amount that is retained, by either a racing club or the Totalisator Agency Board, as a result of rounding will, following this amendment, be subject to GST. In the example the amount of GST charged would be calculated as; (3400 - (2764 x $1.20)) x 1 /9 = $9.24 TIME OF SUPPLY - Section 5 Section 9(3)(aa)(ii) of the Goods and Services Tax Act currently provides for successive time of supply rules where: (i)Goods and services are supplied directly in the construction, major reconstruction, manufacture, or extension of a building or a civil engineering work, and (ii)The consideration for that supply is to be paid in instalments or periodically in rela- tion to the progressive nature of the supply. Each successive supply is deemed to take place when any payment falls due or an invoice relating to that supply is issued. Section 5 widens the scope of section 9(3)(ii)(aa) to include goods and services supplied directly in the construction, major reconstruction, manufacture, or extension of an engineering work. An example of an engineering work that will now be included within the scope of section 9(3)(aa)(ii) is the construction of a boat. VALUE OF SUPPLY OF GOODS AND SERVICES - Section 6(1) Section 10(3) of the Goods and Services Tax Act provides that where there is a supply between two associated persons the consideration shall be deemed to be the open market value of that supply. Section 10(3A) provides that section 10(3) shall not apply where the associated persons are both registered. However, this exclusion could have been used to manipulate the GST value of goods and services provided between associated parties who could thereby gain a GST advantage. Section 6(1) of the Act repeals the previous section (3A) and substitutes a new subsection which provides that section 10(3) shall not apply where: (i)Both of the associated persons are regis- tered, and (ii)The supply is principally for use in a taxable activity. IMPOSITION OF GOODS AND SERVICES TAX ON IMPORTS - Section 7 Section 12(2) of the Goods and Services Tax Act determines the value, for GST purposes, of goods imported into New Zealand. This provision is now amended to provide that this value will include any amount of duty levied under the Dumping and Countervailing Duties Act 1988. TAXABLE PERIODS - Section 9 Section 9 amends section 15 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Section 15 provides for taxable periods of one, two, or six months duration. This amendment ensures that all taxable periods commence on the first day of a month and finish on the last day of a month. 6 TAX INVOICES - Section 11 Section 11 amends section 24 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to: (i)Deem an invoice issued by the recipient of a supply to be a tax invoice, where certain conditions are met, and (ii)Alter the conditions that are required to be met before an invoice issued by the recipient of a supply may be deemed to be a tax invoice. An invoice that is issued by the recipient of a supply will be deemed to be a tax invoice only where, in addition to the present conditions contained in section 24, the following conditions are met: (a)The invoice is provided to the supplier of the supply and a copy is retained by the recipient of the supply, and (b)The words “buyer created tax invoice - IRD approved” are displayed in a promi- nent place on the document. The current conditions, that still apply, are (a)The Commissioner must grant prior approval for the issue of such documents. (b)The supplier and the recipient must agree that the supplier shall not issue a tax invoice in respect of the taxable supply to which the recipient created tax invoice has been issued. (iii)Require that the words “modified tax invoice - IRD approved” be shown in a prominent place on any tax invoice which is issued pursuant to a determination by the Commissioner, that a tax invoice may omit one or more of the requirements specified in the Goods and Services Tax Act. (iv)Provide that where the Commissioner has granted his approval for a recipient to issue tax invoices in respect of a supply of goods and services, that approval may be withdrawn at any time where the Commis- sioner is satisfied that the conditions of that approval have not been complied with. (v)Provide that where the Commissioner has determined, either, that modified tax invoices may be issued, or that a tax in- voice is not required to be issued, that determination may be revoked at any time where the Commissioner is satisfied that the conditions of that approval have not been complied with. CREDIT AND DEBIT NOTES - Section 12 Section 25 of the GST Act specifies situations where a debit note or credit note may be issued and the details that are required to be shown. The amendment provides that where a supplier has issued one or more tax invoices to a recipient in respect of taxable supplies and; (i)One or more supplies of goods and serv- ices have been cancelled; or (ii)The nature of those supplies of goods and services has been fundamentally varied or altered; or (iii)The previously agreed consideration for those supplies of goods and services has been altered, whether due to discount or otherwise; or (iv)The goods and services or part of those goods and services have been returned to the supplier, the Commissioner may determine that the sup- plier may issue one credit note or debit note to each recipient with respect to those tax invoices. Approval is conditional on: (i)The Commissioner being satisfied that there are sufficient records available to establish the particulars of a supply, and (ii)Any other conditions the Commissioner may consider necessary. For example, a wholesaler may make supplies to individual retailers every week and then allow a discount based on the total volume purchased over a six month period. At present a credit note is required to be issued with respect to each weekly supply to each retailer. The amendment allows, where the Commissioner’s approval has been granted, for a single credit note to be issued to each retailer in respect of the entire six months period. NEW START GRANTS - Section 13 Section 48A of the GST Act allows the Commis- sioner to remit any amount of GST payable by a registered person where that person has received 7 a New Start Grant in respect of drought relief. This amendment extends the scope of that relief to include New Start Grants paid to farmers in the Kerikeri area which have been affected by extreme rainfall. The Commissioner is also provided the discretion to determine the amount of tax relief allowed. This is to ensure that a farmer accepting a New Start grant receives the full amount of the grant intact. This amendment is deemed to come into force on the 4th of November 1988. REGISTRATION - Section 14 This amendment amends section 51 of the GST Act which deals with registration for GST purposes. It provides that where an application for registra- tion for GST purposes has been made for or on behalf of any person that application shall be deemed to have been authorised by the person on whose behalf the application was made unless the contrary is proved. Previously, the onus was placed on the Commissioner to prove that the application for registration was made with ap- proval of the registered person. KEEPING OF RECORDS - Section 15 Section 75 of the GST Act sets out the records keeping requirements for registered persons. The section is amended to ensure that registered persons are required to retain copies of all docu- ments issued by them. The wording of the section prior to this amendment potentially left the provi- sion open to the interpretation that only those records necessary to “enable ready ascertainment ... of that person’s liability to tax” were required to be kept. AMENDMENTS TO RATE CHANGE PROVISIONS Section 16 Section 17 Section 18 The GST Act 1985 was amended by the Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act (No. 3)1988 and the Finance Act (No. 4) 1989 to introduce provisions to facilitate a GST rate change. In particular, the following provisions were introduced: Section 78A: This section requires a registered person whose taxable period spans the date on which the change in the rate occurs to file a return in two parts for that taxable period. Section 78B: This section provides for an adjustment to be made by registered persons who account for GST on a payments basis in respect of particular supplies. This adjustment applies in respect of supplies made or received prior to the change in the rate of GST which have not been accounted for in a taxable period ending prior to that date. When such supplies (referred to as qualifying supplies) are ac- counted for subsequent to the rate change, they are accounted for at the new rate. This adjust- ment ensures that the effective rate for output tax or input tax is the old rate. Section 78C: This section deals with changes in accounting basis that either coincide with a rate change or occur after a rate change. The above provisions are discussed in detail in the Department’s Public Information Bulletins 177 and 181. Adjustment: Bad Debt Relief/Change in Accounting Basis - Section 16 This section amends section 78B of the GST Act which provides for an adjustment to be made by persons accounting for supplies on a payments basis as at the time of a GST rate change. In particular, subsection (6) of section 78B requires the above adjustment to be reversed where a taxable supply made prior to the rate change (referred to as a qualifying supply) is written off as a bad debt. This is to ensure that the registered person does not obtain a tax advantage in respect of qualifying supplies written off. However, where a registered person has changed accounting basis subsequent to a rate change and writes off taxable supplies made before the rate change a tax advantage can be gained or a tax loss suffered. Two new subsections are enacted to overcome these difficulties. The new subsection (6A) applies where a regis- tered person has changed from the invoice basis of accounting to the payments basis after a rate change. It provides that in relation to any qualify- ing supplies made which are subsequently written off as a bad debt the person is deemed to have made an adjustment pursuant to section 78B(1) in respect of that qualifying supply. As a result subsection (6) applies to recover that deemed adjustment made. This ensures that the registered person does not obtain a tax advantage. 8 The new subsection (6B) applies where a regis- tered person has changed from a payments to an invoice basis of accounting after a rate change. The effect of subsection (6B) is to deem the adjustment in terms of section 78B(1) never to have been made. This means that where qualifying supplies are written off after the rate change there is no recovery of the adjustment made on the rate change. This ensures that such persons do not suffer a tax loss. These amendments took effect from 1 July 1989 to coincide with the date the rate of GST was changed. Adjustment: Credit and Debit Notes - Section 17 This section inserts a new section 78BA into the GST Act. This new provision applies in respect of debit and credit notes issued in respect of qualify- ing supplies made or received which have not been accounted for at the time of issue or receipt of that debit or credit note. It ensures that a regis- tered person does not obtain a tax advantage or suffer a loss in such circumstances. As mentioned in relation to section 16, a person who accounts for GST on supplies made or re- ceived on a payments basis is required to make an adjustment in respect of qualifying supplies following a rate change. The effect of this new section in relation to qualifying supplies for which a debit or credit note is issued or received is to ensure that the adjustment made on the rate change is on the basis of the amended considera- tion of the supply shown on the debit or credit note. The new section provides that where a registered person being a supplier issues a debit or credit note in respect of a qualifying supply, an adjust- ment is required to be made to the tax payable by that person. This only applies where payment for the qualifying supply has not been received at the time of the issue of the debit or credit note. This adjustment is made in the taxable period in which the debit or credit note was issued. Also, a registered person, being the recipient of a debit or credit note in respect of a qualifying supply, is required to make an adjustment to the tax payable in the taxable period in which the debit or credit note is received. The adjustment is required to be made only where payment for the qualifying supply has not been made at the time the debit or credit note is received. A registered person must make this adjustment where a debit or credit note has not been issued, but written (or other) notice or knowledge has been received that a tax invoice held in respect of a qualifying supply is incorrect. The amount of the adjustment in each case is determined by subtracting from the consideration originally payable or receivable the amount now payable or receivable in terms of the debit or credit note. The resultant amount is multiplied by an amount equal to the old tax fraction (1/11th) subtracted from the new tax fraction (1/9th). Where the amount of the adjustment, in the case of the registered person who issues a debit or credit note is (a)A positive amount, it is treated as output tax; and (b)A negative amount, it is treated as input tax. Where the amount of the adjustment, in the case of a registered person who receives a debit or credit note, is: (a)A positive amount, it is treated as input tax; and (b)A negative amount, it is treated as output tax This amendment took effect fro m 1 July 1989 to coincide with the date the rate of GST was changed. Change in Accounting Basis - Section 18 This section amends section 78C(2) of the GST Act which deals with the situation where a change in the accounting basis occurs after a rate change. The intention of this section was (a)The calculations required to be made in terms of section 19(7) and 19(8) (change in accounting basis) by a registered person would be at the new rate; and (b)The registered person would account for all supplies after the change in accounting basis when payment was received or made at the new rate notwithstanding that supply may have had GST imposed at the old rate. However, when this section was enacted it did not explicitly require the registered person to account for all supplies at the new rate when payment was made or received This deficiency in the legislation lead to a registered person either gaining a tax windfall or suffering a loss depending on the circumstances. This amendment rectifies this deficiency. 9 All such payments received or made after a change in accounting basis are deemed to be consideration for a supply made or received by the registered person on or after the rate change. Input tax or output tax in respect of such supplies is calculated on the basis of the new rate. This amendment took effect from 1 July 1989 to coincide with the date the rate of GST was changed. 10 APPENDIX B TO TIB NO. 8, FEBRUARY 1990 EXPLANATION OF GOODS AND SERVICES TAX AMENDMENT ACT (NO. 2)1989 CONTENTSPage Supplies by Public Authorities1 Service Occupancy Agreements2 Financial Services2 Goods sold in Satisfaction of a Debt3 Race Betting4 Time of Supply5 Value of Supply of Goods and Services5 Taxable Periods5 Tax Invoices6 Credit and Debit Notes6 New Start Grants6 Registration7 Keeping of Records7 Amendments to Rate Change Provisions7
1 POLICY STATEMENT ON SECTION 99 INTRODUCTION The Commissioner has reviewed the policy in relation to the application of section 99 of the Income Tax Act 1976 (the Act). The purpose of this statement is to set out the new policy. The state- ment presents the Commissioner’s view on section 99 - the need for the section, its function in terms of the Act, the impact and relevance of the recent legislative reforms and previous case law, the process of application, and some examples showing the effect of the new policy. It is not intended to be a detailed textual analysis of the provision. Rather it will provide guidance to both Departmental officers and taxpayers on the application of the section. The focus of the Commissioner’s new policy will be to evaluate arrangements in terms of whether they frustrate the underlying scheme and purpose of the relevant provisions of the Act. This new policy will apply from the date of release of this statement to all cases, including those cases which are presently under review. Section 99 Section 99 is the general anti-avoidance provision in the Act which renders void against the Commis- sioner any arrangement entered into for the pur- pose of avoiding tax. Section 99 is designed to protect the Government’s revenue from tax avoidance devices. To effectively achieve its objective the section is enacted in a general form, without reference to specific tax avoidance devices. This preserves flexibility to cope with new devices, but a consequence of this gener- ality is a degree of uncertainty. This uncertainty is the cause of much of the criticism levelled at the section. This uncertainty can be remedied, to some extent, by outlining the Commissioner’s opinion on section 99. The main points of this opinion are as follows - •the Commissioner’s view as to the function of the section; •the effect on the recent reforms to the income tax system; •the relevance of case law; •the process undertaken when considering invoking section 99; and •some specific examples demonstrating the effect of the new policy. Function of Section Section 99 is designed to protect the integrity of the tax system from tax avoidance devices implemented to frustrate it. It is not an independent charging section except insofar as section 99(3) provides for the reconstruction of an arrangement to counteract any tax advantage obtained, and section 99(5) provides for the reconstruction of dividend stripping arrangements. It does not itself create a liability for income tax. Its function is to protect the liability for income tax established under other provisions of the Act. Section 99 supports the more specific provisions of the Act to prevent their frustration by those who would avoid their impact. Impact of the Legislative Reforms The recent legislative reforms have significantly altered the income tax system. The lowering of the tax rate, broadening of the tax base, introduction of new regimes in the areas of international tax, trusts, accruals and dividend imputation have made significant structural changes to the system. The reforms have reduced the availability of schemes which some taxpayers used to avoid their liability to income tax. Many of these schemes utilise legis- lative gaps in the Act and, in terms of the Commis- sioner’s previous practise on section 99, the provi- sion was applicable. In light of the reforms the Commissioner has reconsidered the application of section 99. As discussed above the section does not itself create a liability to income tax but is intended to protect the liability for income tax established under the other provisions of the Act. Accordingly it is considered more appropriate that legislative gaps be filled by Parliamentary action to amend the law rather than by invoking section 99. The role of section 99 is to support the other provisions of the Act where the underlying scheme and purpose of the Act and the specific provision under review has been frustrated. The recent legislative reforms offer significant guidance in discerning the scheme and purpose of the Act and section 99 will actively be used to buttress the intent of the Act where that intent has been frustrated. Relevance of Case Law There are a number of interpretive guidelines, on section 99, of general application which have been judicially developed. Some relate to particular factual situations. Cases involving alienation of income, transfer of income earning assets on a short term basis, payments to relatives and family trusts claimed as a deduction give clear guidelines on the application of section 99 in these situations. 2 In addition certain broad interpretive principles have also evolved. The Newton predication test, for example, is regarded as fundamental to the process of section 99 application. In Newton v FC of T \[1958\] AC 450 the test was set out by Lord Denning. “In order to bring the arrangement within the section you must be able to predicate by looking at the overt acts by which it was implemented - that it was implemented in that particular way so as to avoid tax.” There was also the series of cases in the 1960’s involving constructional arguments primarily designed to ascertain the scope and the application of the predecessor to section 99. For example whether the section applies only to sham transac- tions or has fiscal effect - effect, that is, as against the Commissioner or just between the parties to the arrangement. CIR v Challenge Corporation \[1986\] 2 NZLR 556 is another example of the judicial development of section 99. In Challenge the taxpayer acquired a company (Perth) having no assets or debts but with a large deductible loss. After the acquisition, in compliance with s 191 of the Tax Act Perth gave notice of the transfer of its loss to the taxpayer’s other subsidiaries, thereby reducing the group’s assessable income. The Privy Council made it clear that s 99 is of general application and may apply notwithstanding that specific anti-avoidance provi- sions exist within a particular section. All of these cases have added to the knowledge of what the section was intended to do and how it achieves this purpose. They will continue to assist both the Commissioner and taxpayers in ascertain- ing the boundaries of the provision. Process of Application While application of the section is not dependent on any discretionary decision by the Commissioner, the Commissioner recognises that it will be of considerable assistance to taxpayers if they know the process undertaken in considering the invoca- tion of the section. The Commissioner’s approach requires a careful and thorough analysis of - (a)the underlying scheme and purpose of the Act as a whole and of the specific provision under review; (b)the arrangement to ascertain its purpose or effect; (c)whether a fair and reasonable inference can be drawn that tax avoidance is one purpose of the arrangement (other than merely inci- dental); (d)whether following this analysis it can be inferred that the arrangement frustrates the underlying scheme and purpose of the legislation. These four steps are cumulative - that is, it is necessary to undertake each step before the deci- sion is made as to whether section 99 is applicable. The following is an explanation, in general terms, of the constituent elements of this process. Scheme and purpose A succinct and practical guide to the “scheme and purpose” approach was given by Mr. Justice Richardson in his paper “Appellate Court Responsi- bilities and Tax Avoidance” delivered at Monash University in 1984. The approach was described as follows: “The twin pillars on which our approach to statute rests are the scheme of the legislation and purpose of the legislation. Consideration of the scheme of the legislation requires a careful reading in its historical context of the whole Act including the long title, analysing its structure and examining the relationship between the various provisions, and recog- nising any discernible themes and patterns and underlying policy considerations. It presupposes that in that way the study of the statute or of a group of sections may assist in the interpretation of a particular provision in its statutory context. It may provide a de- tailed guide to the intentions of the framers of the legislation and in so doing may cast light on the meaning of the provision in question.” His Honour considered that the scheme and pur- pose approach may not furnish an answer to all the interpretation problems which may arise. However he was satisfied that the emphasis on trying to discern the scheme and purpose of the legislation is likely in many cases to lead to the resolution of interpretation problems in the tax field that best reflects the intention of Parliament as expressed in the statute. The Commissioner concurs with this view. In trying to discern the scheme and purpose of the legislation primary regard must be had to the words of the legislation. It is Parliamentary intent, as expressed in the statute, which is crucial. The increased complexity of tax legislation has resulted 3 in some instances of ambiguity leading to confusion as to the meaning of particular provisions which makes the ascertainment of the true Parliamentary intent difficult. The Government’s consultative documents, the various consultative committee reports, Parliamentary discussion and debate, and Departmental interpretive guidelines may provide assistance in interpreting the legislation under review. The Purpose or Effect of the Arrangement The test to be applied in ascertaining the purpose or effect of an arrangement is objective. In short the word “purpose” means, not motive, but the effect which it is sought to achieve - the end in view. The word “effect” means the end accomplished or achieved. The whole set of words denotes con- certed action to an end - the end of avoiding tax. This is the well-known passage from Lord Denning in the Newton case. The section is not concerned with the motives of taxpayers. It is not concerned with the desire to avoid tax. Rather the section is only concerned with the means employed to avoid tax. In the Newton case Lord Denning said - “In applying the section you must, by the very words of it, look at the arrangement itself and see which is its effect - what it does - irrespective of the motives of the persons who made it. Williams J put it well when he said - ‘The purpose of a contract agreement or arrangement must be what it is intended to effect and that intention must be ascer- tained from its terms. Those terms may be oral or written or may have to be inferred from the circumstances but, when they have been ascertained, their purpose must be what they effect.’ Inference Having established the purpose of the arrangement as implemented by the taxpayer, it is necessary to effect a fair and balanced evaluation of that ar- rangement. The evaluation will be with a view to concluding whether one can predicate whether the arrangement was implemented in its particular way so as to achieve an income tax advantage. That advantage may arise in one or more of a variety of ways. These include the reduction, avoidance, or postponement of income tax. They also include an alteration in the incidence of income tax, or relieving persons from income tax. If there is an income tax advantage, it is necessary to identify whether or not that advantage is merely an incidental purpose or effect of the arrangement. In CIR v Challenge Corporation, Mr. Justice Woodhouse acknowledged that the meaning of this qualification is all important and stated: “... The issue as to whether or not a tax saving purpose or effect is “merely inciden- tal” to another purpose is something to be decided not subjectively in terms of motive but objectively by reference to the arrange- ment itself.” “... The phrase “merely incidental purpose or effect” in the context of section 99 points to something which is necessarily linked and without contrivance to some other purpose or effect so that it can be regarded as a natural concomitant. Many taxpayers when considering a course of action are likely to appreciate and welcome an opportunity provided by the Act for achieving some tax benefit as an aspect of it. But this should not bring the transaction or transactions almost automatically within the avoidance provi- sions of s 99. By itself conscious recognition and acceptance that a commercial transaction will be accompanied by a degree of tax relief is not the issue.” “... In the end the breadth of the qualifying phrase and so the ambit of the section itself will be discovered as a matter of fact and degree on a case by case basis.” “... When construing s 99 and the qualifying implications of the reference to “incidental purpose” the questions that need to be framed in terms of the degree of economic reality associated with a given transaction in contrast to artificiality or contrivance or what may be described as to the extent to which it appears to involve exploitation of the statute while in direct pursuit of tax benefits. To put the matter in another way, there is all the difference in the world between the prudent attention on one hand that can always be given sensibly and quite properly to the tax implications likely to arise from a course of action when deciding whether or not to pursue it and its pursuit on the other hand simply to achieve a manufactured tax advan- tage.” In some circumstances, an evaluation having regard to the view expressed by Mr. Justice Woodhouse may conclude that the securing of a tax advantage 4 is a non-incidental purpose or effect of the arrange- ment. In this case, it is necessary to consider whether that non-incidental tax advantage is one that constitutes tax avoidance as contemplated by section 99. Frustration This requires the synthesis of the other facets of the process. Section 99 is used to support the rest of the Act. Its function is to protect the liability for income tax established under other provisions of the Act. Accordingly the section will apply to void those arrangements where an evaluation of the arrange- ment results in the inference that a non-incidental purpose or effect is tax avoidance and the resulting tax advantage frustrates the intent of the Act. The Commissioner considers that this new four- step approach to the application of section 99 gives the provision its proper status within the Act, enabling it to do its work in a balanced but effective way. Pretence Many tax avoidance arrangements involve an element of pretence. Section 99 will be applied to counter this. The Commissioner expects that the provision will be mainly applied to those taxpayers who follow a course of action to achieve a manufac- tured tax advantage which is essentially void of any economic reality. However, economic reality is not of itself the sole determinate of whether section 99 applies. The degree of economic reality associated with a given transaction will be contrasted to any artificiality, contrivance, or exploitation of the Act while in direct pursuit of tax benefits. This analysis will focus on determining whether the underlying scheme or purpose has been frustrated. Invoking Section 99 The section may be applied in conjunction with other provisions of the Act but only where the merits of application have been properly consid- ered. The process requires the careful and thorough analysis described above. This analysis will be undertaken independently from the consideration of the transaction in terms of the more specific provisions of the Act. Section 99 will not be used without this analysis having been undertaken. In other words Departmental Officers are not empow- ered to invoke section 99, or indicate that it is intended to invoke the section, without having completed the analysis. Section 99 will be invoked by the Department against arrangements intended to frustrate the underlying scheme and purpose of the relevant provisions of the Act. Rulings The Department recognises as an important aspect of tax administration that the tax consequences of entering into any particular transaction be known with the greatest degree of certainty possible. To achieve this objective the Department will do its best within its current resource constraints to provide timely, accurate and adequate advice on the possible application of section 99 to specific situations subject to the following conditions: (a)the full facts and documentation (including proposed documentation) of the transaction and associated transactions must be disclosed; (b)the names of the parties, including the parties to the associated transactions, must be disclosed; (c)the taxpayer’s full arguments as to - (i)why section 99 does not apply; and (ii)the purpose and effect of the transaction; (d)any subsequent amendments to the proposals must be brought to the Department’s attention and presented with an analysis of whether the amend- ments affect the ruling given; (e)the ruling is not legally binding on the Com- missioner but the Commissioner will normally follow his ruling unless the taxpayer has failed to comply with one or more of these conditions; (f)the Commissioner may use the factual situa- tion submitted to amend or supplement his general guidelines on the application of the section but this would be done in such a way as to preserve the confidentiality of the taxpayer concerned. Requests for rulings on the application of section 99 should be made in the first instance to: Director (Taxpayer Services) Head Office P O Box 2198 Wellington. Examples of Application of Section 99 The Annex to this statement sets out some exam- ples of the application of this new policy. 5 ANNEX TO POLICY STATEMENT APPLICATION OF POLICY The examples set out below illustrate how the Department will in practice apply the new policy described above. It is important to note that the following examples are indicative only of when section 99 is considered by the Department to apply in the specific circumstances as described in each example. The examples should not be viewed as delineating the line between when section 99 will or will not be applied by the Department. It is assumed that the arrangements described below comply with the literal terms of the provisions of the Act concerned and that the transactions are legally valid.

PERMANENT TRANSFER OF IN- COME PRODUCING ASSETS YZ is an individual who derives income from salary and interest from a portfolio of interest bearing securities. YZ had some years ago estab- lished a discretionary trust for the benefit of YZ’s family and had from time to time made settlements to the trust. YZ’s income is at a level which attracts the highest marginal rate of tax. The income de- rived by the trustee during an income year is normally paid or applied to or for the benefit of the beneficiaries of the trust. The beneficiaries currently earn income at a level below the highest marginal rate of tax. YZ recognises the opportunity to reduce YZ’s liability to income tax on income that would other- wise be assessable to YZ and to reduce YZ’s expo- sure to estate duty. In pursuit of this goal YZ transfers absolutely the portfolio of interest bearing securities to the family trust. YZ grants to the trust an interest free loan repayable on demand to effect the sale of the portfolio and forgives a portion of the debt over several years. The effect of this arrangement is that YZ is no longer subject to income tax on the interest income and YZ’s estate has been considerably reduced. Assuming that the trustee pays or applies the income to or for the benefit of the beneficiaries during or within six months of end of the income year the overall effect is a reduction in the income tax paid. INTERPRETATION (a) Scheme and Purpose A trust is an equitable obligation, binding on persons referred to as trustees to deal with the trust property over which they have control for the benefit of the beneficiaries of the trust. A comprehensive scheme for the taxation of trus- tees and beneficiaries of trusts is contained in sections 226 to 233 of the Act. These provisions were substantially redrafted as a result of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No.5) 1988. The new regime generally takes effect from the income year commencing 1 April 1988. The former regime drew a distinction between “specified” and “non speci- fied” trusts. In broad terms, a non specified trust included trusts created by will or on intestacy and inter vivos trusts created before 19 July 1968. Specified trusts were inter vivos trusts created on or after that date. The distinction was brought about by an amendment to the Land and Income Tax Act 1954. The policy behind the distinction was an effort to frustrate income splitting through the use of trusts by creating a harsher tax regime which would apply to specified trusts. For example, trustees of a non specified trust were taxed at the normal individual rates after taking into account the $100 exemption. Whereas, trustees of a speci- fied trust were taxed at a minimum rate of 35c in the dollar. The specified trust regime was designed to deter but not prohibit the use of trusts for income split- ting purposes. As part of the introduction of the new trust regime, the distinction between specified and non specified trusts was removed. The continued inclusion in the Act of a specific regime for the taxation of trusts and the existence of the former trust regime, although drawing a dis- tinction between specified and non specified trusts, clearly indicates that the Act contemplated and still contemplates the likelihood of permanent transfers of income producing assets to a trust for the benefit of its beneficiaries. The inference that permanent transfers of income producing assets are consistent with the scheme of the Act is further reinforced by the presence of section 96 in the Act. Section 96 of the Act provides in general terms that where an assignment of income or income from settled property is for a period of less than seven years, and the assignor or settlor remains the owner or beneficial owner respectively of the income producing asset, or the property/corpus reverts to or otherwise remains under the control of the assignor/settlor, then the income, notwithstanding the assignment or settle- ment, is deemed for income tax purposes still to be derived by the assignor or settlor. By implication the Act contemplates as acceptable tax planning the permanent transfer of income producing assets without reservation, reversion or the right to control the disposition of the asset. The possibility of tax savings arising from the permanent transfer of income producing assets is contemplated by the Act, in that it provides for the taxation of beneficiary income at the beneficiary’s ordinary income tax rate. (b) The Purpose of the Arrangement On an objective evaluation of the arrangement it has several purposes: to reduce YZ’s potential estate duty liability, the setting aside of income earning assets for the benefit of YZ’s family, and the minimisation of income tax. 7 (c) Inference The taxpayer in this case has chosen to transfer the portfolio of investments to a trust, subject to the provisions of the Act as they apply to trusts. Such a transfer would have been influenced by domestic and economical factors which may have included a wish to secure income tax savings. A reduction in taxation has occurred. Although the tax saving may be significant, it is a natural consequence of the disposition of the assets to the trust. The inference to be drawn is that the tax saving is an incidental purpose or effect of the arrangement. (d) Frustration The Department does not consider that the scheme and purpose of the Act has been frustrated in the above circumstances. If a taxpayer permanently disposes of income producing property to another taxpaying entity so as to reduce the taxpayer’s burden of taxation the Act contemplates that the new owner will be liable for the tax on that income. The incidence of the tax and the burden of tax falls precisely as the Act intends, namely, upon the new owner. The Department would accept the above arrange- ment as acceptable tax and estate planning and would not apply section 99 to the arrangement. 2. INTERNATIONAL TAX REGIME FACTS A is a New Zealand resident and B is a non-resi- dent. A and B are involved in a joint venture operation. A joint venture company is incorporated in Panama with the following share structure. The pint venturers each hold 49.5% and a non-resident Managing Director holds the remaining 1%. The Managing Director’s shares carry limited voting rights. Additionally, the shares provide for limited entitlement to participate in the distribution of profits or the value of net assets on a winding up (or other distribution). The share structure adopted is not a requirement of the law of Panama, New Zealand, or the country in which B is resident. The Managing Director is neither a ‘nominee’ or ‘associ- ated person’ of resident A, as those terms are defined in sections 245A and 245B of the Act. (a) Scheme and Purpose One of the primary objectives of the International tax regime is to prevent the deferral/avoidance by New Zealand residents of New Zealand income tax on foreign sourced income earned through non- resident companies. The Controlled Foreign Company (CFC) regime was enacted as part of a trilogy of measures to ensure that foreign income derived by New Zea- land residents is subject to New Zealand tax as it is earned. The CFC regime only applies where five or fewer New Zealand residents have a 50% or greater control interest in a foreign company. The control tests contained in section 245C are the cornerstone of the CFC regime. Recognising the importance of this section, the legislature have included a specific anti-avoidance provision in section 245C(9). In general terms the provision provides that where two residents enter into an arrangement whereby any control interests in a foreign company are held by any other person or persons, where the arrangement has the purpose or a purpose of defeating the effect of section 245C, then the control interests are deemed to be held by those persons equally. (b) The Purpose of the Arrangement An objective evaluation of the arrangement is required to establish whether resident A effectively holds a 50% control interest in the joint venture. For example, the Managing Director may hold 0.5% of his shareholding on behalf of resident A in a man- ner intended to frustrate the control test require- ments of section 245C. (c) Inference It cannot be automatically inferred that the struc- ture like that outlined was designed to avoid the effect of the CFC regime. There may be a number of non tax related reasons for adopting the arrange- 8 ment, such as, accommodating the commercial or tax needs of the non-resident joint venturer. However, having considered all the relevant factors it may be that the only proper inference which can be drawn from the arrangement and surrounding circumstances is that it was implemented in this particular way so as to avoid tax. Once it has been identified that the arrangement provides for tax benefits, an evaluation must be made as to whether they are a more than merely incidental consideration in the implementation of the arrangement. (d) Frustration The control interest requirements of section 245C are designed to ensure that the CFC regime applies to those New Zealand residents who control a foreign company. If the reality is that resident A owns a 50% interest in the joint venture operation, the Department will apply section 99 to the ar- rangement, on the basis that the 1% holding by the Managing Director is an attempt to circumvent the provisions of section 245C. This is notwithstanding that the specific anti-avoidance provision in section 245C(9) has no application because the arrangement is not entered into between two or more New Zealand residents. The Department considers that section 99 can still apply notwithstanding that a specific anti-avoid- ance provision has been avoided. This is clear from the Privy Council decision in Challenge. The facts of the Challenge case were that Challenge acquired the shares in a tax loss company for the sole purpose of grouping those losses against Challenge’s assess- able income. One of Challenge’s arguments was that as section 191 of the Act contained its own specific anti- avoidance provision and that as Challenge had not temporarily acquired the shares in Perth and were not therefore within the ambit of the activities proscribed by section 191(1)(c)(i), then section 99 could not apply. Section 191(1)(c)(i) provided, in general terms, that in determining whether the requisite proportions had been met at the end of the year for the pur- poses of the tax grouping provisions, the Commis- sioner could disregard any temporary alteration in shareholding or constitution of a company. The taxpayer’s submissions on this point were firmly rejected by the majority of the Privy Council in the Challenge case. To reiterate, the Department considers that the existence of a specific anti- avoidance provision within a section e.g.,. the export incentive provisions, will not bar the appli- cation of section 99. Similarly, section 99 operates side by side with sections such as section 96, which have an anti-avoidance function. In this example the mere fact that resident A has settled for less than a 50% interest in the joint venture company does not in itself create a pre- sumption that the intention of the legislation has been frustrated. A detailed analysis must be under- taken as to the true capacity in which the shares owned by the Managing Director are held, in order to determine if they are held on behalf of resident A. Section 99 will not have application, where that section has been expressly excluded from operation e.g., section 336Y of the Act excludes section 99 from application in the context of fringe benefit tax. 3A. PREPAYMENT OF INTEREST (PRIOR TO ACCRUALS REGIME) FACTS For the purposes of this example, the transaction occurs prior to the introduction of sections 64B to 64M of the Act ( the “accruals regime”). PI Ltd need to borrow $100,000 to finance their assessable income earning activity. The capital is to be fully employed in the production of PI Ltd’s assessable income earning process. Bank Ltd offer two alterna- tive funding proposals. Proposal one, a five year loan of $100,000 at 10% simple interest per annum (the current market interest rate for loans of this term). For years one to four, interest of $10,000 is payable annually in arrears. At the end of five years PI Ltd is required to pay $110,000 to Bank Ltd, being interest of $10,000 and principal of $100,000. Proposal two, a five year loan of $100,000 with interest required to be prepaid. The loan agreement also provides that there is no right of refund of the prepaid interest in the event of the loan being repaid early. The prepaid interest is calculated as the present value of the future stream of interest payments of $10,000, that is, the interest payable in arrears in proposal one. Applying a 10% discount rate, the prepayment amounts to $37,907. At the end of five years, PI Ltd is required to repay the principal of $100,000 to Bank Ltd. 9 PI Ltd selects proposal two because it can obtain a tax deduction in terms of section 106(1)(h)(i) at the time of payment of the interest in year one. PI Ltd funds the interest payment out of existing cash resources. INTERPRETATION (a) Scheme and Purpose The statutory scheme in relation to the tax deduct- ibility of interest has not been conclusively re- solved. However, it is the Department’s policy that in order to qualify for a deduction in terms of section 106(1)(h)(i) the following criteria must be met: (i)The taxpayer’s purpose in borrowing the capital is relevant at the threshold stage of considering whether the statutory nexus has in fact been met: Pacific Rendezvous Ltd v CIR (1986) 8 NZTC 5146, 5154, (ii)The terms of section 104 must be satisfied as well as section 106. (iii)Interest is a prohibited deduction unless it comes within the exceptions contained in section 106(1)(h)(i), (ia), (ii). (iv)The paragraphs of section 106(1) provide cumulative proscriptions i.e. is the interest deduction prohibited by the other provisions of section 106(1) e.g. section 106(1)(j). Aspects of the Department’s policy were recently confirmed by Barber J in Taxation Review Author- ity Case No. 83/33. His Honour held that a tax- payer must cumulatively satisfy sections 104 and 106(1)(h) to qualify for an interest deduction. Specifically, in terms of this example, the Depart- ment considers that provided the tests as pre- scribed in section 106(1)(h)(i) are satisfied then the interest will be deductible for tax purposes. In other words, where the terms of section 106(1)(h)(i) have been met then that will be sufficient to satisfy section 104. In the circumstances section 104 is not considered to impose a more stringent test than section 106(1)(h)(i). This issue is largely academic in regard to interest tax deductions post 1 April 1985 because of the close similarity between sections 104 and 106(1)(h). Prior to 1 April 1985 section 106(1)(h) provided for a deduction for interest where: (i)It was payable on capital employed in the production of assessable income; or (ii)It was payable by one group company in respect of money borrowed to acquire shares in another group company. With effect from 1 April 1985 the section was significantly redrafted. The Income Tax Amend- ment Act 1987, inserted a proviso to section 106(1)(h) to the effect that accrual expenditure is deemed to be “interest payable”. The Income Tax Amendment Act (No.2) 1987, replaced the former section 106(1)(h)(i) as it existed prior to 1 April 1985 and introduced new subparagraphs (i) and (ia) in similar form to section 104. Commencing from 1 April 1985, section 106(1)(h) provides for the deductibility of interest in the following terms, where: “(i)It is payable in gaining or producing the assessable income for any income year: or (ia)It is necessarily payable in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or pro- ducing the assessable income for any income year; or (ii)It is payable by one company included in a group of companies in respect of money borrowed to acquire shares in another com- pany included in that group of companies: Provided that for the purposes of this para- graph expenditure deemed to be incurred pursuant to sections 64B to 64M of this Act shall be deemed to be interest payable.” Prepaid interest loans entered into between 1 April 1985 and 31 July 1986 (the earliest implementation date for the accruals regime) are dealt with in terms of the new section 106(l)(h)(i), (ia), and (ii). How- ever, the proviso is inoperative as prepaid interest schemes entered into before 31 July 1986 will not be subject to the accruals regime. In this example the capital is fully employed in the assessable income earning process so that sections 106(1)(j) or 106(1)(a) have no application. (b) The Purpose of the Arrangement On an objective evaluation of the arrangement its principle purpose is to provide PI Ltd with funds and to do so in a tax effective manner. (c) Inference The inference to be drawn from the facts of this case is that PI Ltd primarily required further working capital The tax-avoidance purpose is considered to be merely incidental. 10 (d) Frustration The Department considers that the scheme and purpose of section 104 and section 106(1)(h)(i) has not been frustrated in the circumstances described above. More specifically, the Act did not prior to the introduction of the accruals regime prohibit the deductibility for tax purposes of interest paid in advance. Additionally, the transaction is not artificial, the borrower has incurred real interest expenditure calculated by discounting to present value interest payable in arrears at the market interest rate. The prepaid interest is deductible in these circum- stances. The Department considers that section 99 would not apply to this arrangement because the scheme and purpose of section 104 and section 106(1)(h)(i) has not been frustrated and the taxpayer has been involved in genuine commitments and expenditure. 3B. PREPAYMENT OF INTEREST (PRIOR TO ACCRUALS REGIME) FACTS The transaction occurs prior to the introduction of sections 64B to 64M of the Act (the “accruals re- gime”). PI Ltd is a company which has substantial assessable income for the income year ending 31 March 1985. Bank Ltd is a financial institution whose activities include borrowing and lending money. PI Ltd enters into the following tax saving arrange- ment. On 29 March 1985 Bank Ltd advances $750,000 for 3 years to PI Ltd. The terms of the loan require an upfront payment of interest of $287,675 (17.5% annual compounding) payable one day after the drawdown of the loan Although it is not a term of the loan agreement that Bank Ltd or PI Ltd can make early repayment of principal, it is expected and anticipated that the loan will be repaid at a discounted value of $462,325 shortly after drawdown. A fee of $30,000 is payable by PI Ltd for this loan facility. PI Ltd deposits the $750,000 received on drawdown on call at 18% per annum. On 30 March 1985 PI Ltd recalls the sum of $287,675 and uses this to make the upfront payment of interest of $287,675 to Bank Ltd. PI Ltd claims an interest deduction in terms of section 106(1)(h)(i) of $287,675 for the income year ending 31 March 1985. On 31 March 1985 PI Ltd recalls the $462,325 remaining on call and uses this to fund the dis- counted repayment of principal of $462,325. The “gain” to PI Ltd of $287,675 (i.e., the gain arising from the discharge by PI Ltd of its debt of $750,000 by a payment of $462,325) is treated as capital and consequently non assessable. Interest is credited daily on the outstanding balance and the investment earns PI Ltd $598 of assessable income for the year ending 31 March 1985. Bank Ltd return the interest of $287,675 as assess- able income for the year ending 31 March 1985. The net tax effect to Bank Ltd of this arrangement is nil (ignoring the facility fee), the loss on loan of $287,675 (arising from the acceptance of a payment of $462,325 from PI Ltd in discharge of the debt of $750,000 owed to Bank Ltd) being set off against the assessable interest income. The arrangement can be illustrated as follows: INTERPRETATION (a) Scheme and Purpose The statutory scheme in relation to the tax deduct- ibility of interest is set out in example 3A above. (b) The Purpose of the Arrangement On an objective evaluation of the arrangement its sole purpose is the avoidance of income tax. It is considered that the income earning purpose is inconsequential to the tax avoidance purpose. (c) Inference The only inference that can be drawn from this arrangement and surrounding circumstances is that it was implemented in this particular way to avoid tax. The arrangement is economically neutral to all parties except for the interest deduction and loan facility fee. 11 (d) Frustration The Department considers that the interest is not deductible in terms of sections 104 and 106 as the deduction does not satisfy the statutory test for deductibility in so far as the nexus to assessable income has not been established. On the contrary the only purpose of this arrangement is the avoid- ance of tax. This arrangement is clearly intended to frustrate the scheme and purpose of the Act as it relates to the tax deductibility of interest and the Department would apply section 99 to this arrangement. The following dictum from Lord Templeman in the Challenge (PC) case is binding authority that such arrangements constitute tax avoidance: “In an arrangement of tax avoidance the financial position of the taxpayer is unaf- fected (save for the costs of devising and implementing the arrangement) and by the arrangement the taxpayer seeks to obtain a tax advantage without suffering the reduc- tion in income, loss or expenditure which other taxpayers suffer and which Parliament intended to be suffered by any taxpayer qualifying for a reduction in his liability to tax.” 4. SECTION 160A: AMOUNTS PAID ON SHARES IN PETROLEUM MINING COMPANIES FACTS P is a petroleum mining company in terms of section 214B of the Act. In order to continue its petroleum mining operations m New Zealand, it decides to raise further capital by way of an issue of ordinary shares to the public. E, a New Zealand resident individual considers that the shares will rise in the short term after the public issue. On the basis of this expectation, E borrows to subscribe to the shares and concurrently enters into a sale agreement with non-resident purchaser L. The sale agreement provides that the sale to L is to occur two weeks after acquisition of the shares by E, at the then prevailing market rate. Pursuant to this plan, E subscribes to the shares in P on 25 July 1986 and claims a one third deduction against E’s assessable income pursuant to section 160A of the Act. INTERPRETATION (a) Scheme and Purpose The Income Tax Amendment Act 1979 introduced into the Act a new taxation regime for petroleum mining companies. The regime provided for taxa- tion incentives to petroleum mining companies e.g., section 214B(5) provides for the deduction of exploration expenditure (this term being defined to include what would otherwise be considered to be capital expenditure); and to investors in petroleum mining companies e.g., section 160A. This section allows a New Zealand resident shareholder to claim a deduction of one-third of the amount paid as subscriptions or calls on petroleum mining shares, subject to the following limitations: (a)The money is used by the company in the exploring or searching for petroleum in New Zealand. (b)The shares are ordinary shares in the com- pany. (c)The deduction being disallowed if the petro- leum mining company does not use the money for the prescribed purposes within a reasonable time. The section 160A deduction only applies to pay- ments made on or before 30 September 1986 pursu- ant to calls made on or before 31 July 1986. (b) The Purpose of the Arrangement On an objective evaluation of the arrangement, it is entered into for the purpose of deriving a taxable profit. An incidental consequence of the arrange- ment is the availability to E of the section 160A deduction. (c) Inference The inference to be drawn from the arrangement is that the tax consequences are merely incidental to E’s profit making objective. (d) Frustration The Department considers that the plan falls within the underlying policy considerations for the provi- sion; being to encourage capital contributions to companies whose business is the mining of petro- leum in New Zealand. Additionally, the plan is neither artificial nor unreal. The Department considers that section 99 would not apply to this arrangement because the scheme 12 and purpose of section 160A has not been frus- trated, more specifically, the section does not specify any period of time that a resident share- holder must hold the petroleum mining company shares in order to qualify for the deduction. The taxpayer has also been involved in genuine commit- ments and expenditure. 5. REDEEMABLE PREFERENCE SHARE FINANCING FACTS Issuer Co is a company which is currently in a tax loss situation which is expected to subsist in the foreseeable future. Issuer Co needs to raise further finance to fund its assessable income earning activities. Issuer Co realising that it is currently unable to utilise an interest tax deduction calculates that the cost of its borrowings can be reduced by raising equity finance in the form of redeemable preference shares as opposed to debt financing. A suitable subscriber to the redeemable preference shares is identified. Investor Co is attracted to the redeemable preference share financing as it can achieve a better after tax return on the redeemable preference shares in comparison to a similar debt investment. The following arrangement is entered into. Investor Co borrows externally and uses the fresh capital to subscribe to redeemable preference shares issued by Investor Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary. The interest is claimed by Investor Co in terms of section 106 (1)(h)(ii). Investor Sub, in turn uses the capital to subscribe to redeemable preference shares issued by Issuer Co. Dividends are subsequently paid by Issuer Co and Investor Sub. The dividends are exempt income to Investor Co and Investor Sub in terms of section 63 of the Act. Additionally, Investor Co requires security in respect of the redemption of the redeemable prefer- ence shares. Accordingly, another company in Issuer Co’s group e.g. Issuer’s parent company, guarantees Issuer Co’s obligations to redeem the redeemable preference shares. Investor Sub allows Investor Co to pledge this guarantee as security for the debt raised from its own lender. INTERPRETATION (a) Scheme and Purpose The Act marks a line between the taxation treat- ment of debt and equity investments. Sections 64B to 64M (the “accruals regime”) provides for a comprehensive regime for the taxation of financial arrangements (a term which expressly includes a “debt instrument”). The accruals regime was not intended to affect the taxation treatment of equity instruments. This intent is reflected in the legisla- tion, where in general terms shares are an “ex- cepted financial arrangement”, as that term is defined in section 64B(1) of the Act. Equity investments have in general terms always been treated differently to debt investments for tax purposes e.g., interest is deductible but dividends are not. This difference has recently been further accentuated by the introduction of a full imputation system. Additionally, the Act had previously contained provisions which deemed certain debt instruments to be taxed as equity e.g., section 192 dealing with floating rate debentures and certain equity instru- ments to be treated as debt e.g., section 194 dealing with deductions for dividends on specified prefer- ence shares. As far as possible these deeming provisions have been refined or removed. Section 192 was further clarified to ensure that floating rate debentures that were to be treated as equity were those where there was a direct relationship between the company’s profits and the debenture payment. Secondly, section 192(3) expanded the exemption from treatment as equity where the interest on the debenture is calculated in terms of indices inde- pendent of the company’s performance. The deduction for dividends on section 194 speci- fied preference shares has been removed for post accruals regime issues. The intent of these amendments has been to ensure the delineation between debt and equity instru- ments for tax purposes is maintained as far as possible, without undermining the integrity of the tax system e.g., the tax treatment of debentures issued in substitution for shares was retained (section 195) and accordingly to tax financial instruments according to their true legal form. By drawing and recently reinforcing the distinction between debt and equity instruments for tax pur- poses, the scheme of the Act is clear in its intent to provide to taxpayers a choice of raising or investing in capital by way of debt or equity instrument. 13 The interest deduction is claimed in terms of section 106(1)(h)(ii) which provides for a tax deduc- tion for interest on money borrowed to acquire shares in another group company. (b) The Purpose of the Arrangement On an objective evaluation of the arrangement its purpose is to raise finance and to do so in the most tax efficient manner. (c) Inference The inference to be reached on evaluating the arrangement is that the tax considerations are merely incidental to the purpose of fund raising. (d) Frustration The scheme of the Act contemplates that taxpayers may raise finance through either the debt or equity market. The scheme of the Act has not been frus- trated when a taxpayer simply selects an option that the Act clearly contemplates that the taxpayer might choose. Section 106(1)(h)(ii) provides a special deduction outside the general scheme of the Act, which has its own nexus, not between expenditure and assessable income, but between expenditure and the acquisi- tion of shares in a group company. Investor Co has incurred genuine expenditure and both Investor Co and Investor Sub are members of the same group of companies. The terms of section 106(1)(h)(ii) are therefore satisfied. The Department considers that section 99 would not apply to this arrangement because the scheme and purpose of the relevant provisions of the Act have not been frustrated and Investor Co is in- volved in genuine commitments and expenditure. 6. VALUATION OF TRADING STOCK FACTS J Company is in the business of importing and selling computers. For the income year ending 31 March 1988, the corporate tax rate was 48 cents per dollar reducing to 28 cents per dollar for the income year ending 31 March 1989. J Company ordinarily adopts the cost price alterna- tive for valuing its closing stock for tax purposes. J company realises that it can achieve a tax saving by reducing its assessable income for the income year ending 31 March 1988 via the use of the trad- ing stock valuation options contained in section 85(4). In pursuit of this goal, J Company elects in terms of section 85(4) to value its closing stock of computers at replacement price. J Company evaluates the other options but this valuation represents the lower of the three permissible alternatives of cost price, market selling value and replacement price. J Company accepts the risk of an increase in assess- able income for the year ended 31 March 1989 (primarily because of the reduced value of the trading stock adopted in the previous year) because of the reduction of the corporate rate to 28 cents per dollar. INTERPRETATION (a) Scheme and Purpose Section 85 of the Act provides for a comprehensive regime for bringing to account trading stock for tax purposes. In particular, section 85(4) provides a taxpayer with three different options for valuing trading stock at year end i.e., cost price, market selling value, or replacement price. In addition section 85(4A) provides for a different regime for livestock, not used in a dealing operation. Section 85(6) requires a taxpayer to include in assessable income the value of the trading stock at the end of the income year. Section 85 provides for certain valuation options which are unique to the Income Tax Act i.e., they do not reflect any external busi- ness norm. Specifically, the tax options can be usefully contrasted to options available for account- ing purposes. Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No. 4 (SSAP 4) “Accounting for Invento- ries”, provides that inventories should be valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, whereas the tax options are cost price, market selling value, and replacement price. The only similarity that the tax options have with accounting standards is the option to value trading stock at cost price. Sec- ondly, it is important to note SSAP 4 requires the adoption of the lower of the two values specified, whereas, section 85(4) provides for a choice of options irrespective of their comparative value. Section 85, by providing for options for valuing stock which are not commercially available i.e., at market selling value or replacement price and the provision of an unqualified choice as to which option to adopt, creates a unique tax norm. (b) The Purpose of the Arrangement On am objective evaluation of the arrangement, its purpose is to reduce J Company’s liability to tax. 14 (c) Inference The prima facie inference to be drawn from the arrangement is that it was implemented in this particular way to avoid tax. The expression “tax avoidance” is defined in section 99(1) and includes “reducing or postponing any liability to tax”. (d) Frustration Section 85 creates trading stock valuation options which are unique to the Act, against which there is no external commercial yardstick that they can be judged. The Department does not consider it as tax avoidance for taxpayers to adopt an option created by the Tax Act and which exist only for the pur- poses of the Act. Section 85 is clearly intended to provide taxpayers with an unfettered choice as to how to value their trading stock at year end for tax purposes. The ability to achieve the type of tax saving described above is clearly contemplated by section 85. The Department considers that section 99 would not apply to this transaction because the scheme and purpose of section 85 has not been frustrated. 7. DIVIDEND STRIPPING FACTS Invest Co is an investment company with a sub- stantial portfolio of interest bearing investments and retained earnings. The shareholders of Invest Co wish to have the retained earnings distributed to them in a tax free form. In accordance with a plan, the shareholders of Invest Co arrange for the incorporation of DS Co and subscribe to all of the share capital. The shareholders in DS Co cause DC Co to acquire all their shares in Invest Co for a consideration equal to the Invest Co retained earnings of $1,000,000. DS Co funds the purchase of the shares by causing Invest Co to pay a dividend out of and equivalent to Invest Co’s retained earnings. The effect is that the original shareholders of Invest Co have had distributed to them the retained earnings of Invest Co in a tax free form whilst still retaining effective control of Invest Co. INTERPRETATION (a) Scheme and Purpose Section 99(5) is a specific provision included in the Act which deals with dividend stripping arrange- ments. In general terms the section provides that where the Commissioner considers that any consid- eration received by a taxpayer as a result of the sale of shares, is in substitution for a dividend that would otherwise have been received, the Commis- sioner may deem such consideration to be a divi- dend. A precondition for the application of section 99(5) is that the arrangement satisfy the criteria of section 99(2). As a result the normal sale of shares (not having a tax avoidance purpose) will not be caught by the section. (b) The Purpose of the Arrangement On an objective evaluation of the arrangement, it has been entered into solely to convert assessable dividend income into a non assessable receipt. The purpose of the arrangement is tax avoidance. (c) Inference The inference to be drawn from the arrangement is that it is entered into solely to avoid tax. 15 (d) Frustration The Department considers that section 99(5) of the Act applies to this arrangement and would treat the consideration received by the shareholders of Invest Co for the sale of their shares in Invest Co to DS Co as an assessable dividend. Section 99(5) is clear in its intent to defeat arrangements intended to recharacterise assessable dividends into non taxable receipts. 8. DUAL RESIDENT COMPANY LOSSES FACTS Res Co is a company resident in New Zealand. It has a subsidiary company, B Co, which in turn has a subsidiary company, C Co. Both B Co and C Co have been intentionally established so that they are resident of both Australia and New Zealand for income tax purposes. C Co has a wholly owned subsidiary in Australia, Oz Co. In order to finance investments by the group, dual resident company B Co, borrows to subscribe to shares issued by dual resident company, C Co. The interest deduction results in a tax loss in the dual resident company for New Zealand income tax purposes which is able to be grouped against assessable income derived by Res Co. Due to the dual resident status of B Co, the loss is also able to be grouped against the assessable income of Australian company, Oz Co. This results in the dual resident’s tax loss being able to be utilised twice, once in each tax jurisdiction. C Co advances funds to Oz Co and other associated group companies. Section 191 was amended in 1987 by the insertion of section 191(7E) and in 1988 by the insertion of section 191(7F). In general terms, the effect of these provisions are to quarantine dual resident company and non dual resident company losses from New Zealand group company assessable income. The following interpretation applies to losses incurred by dual resident companies prior to the introduc- tion of section 191(7E) and 191(7F). INTERPRETATION (a) Scheme and Purpose The Act as it was structured prior to the introduc- tion of section 191 (7E) and 191 (7F) did not con- template or address the problem of dual resident company losses. As no comprehensive scheme existed for the treat- ment of dual resident company losses, the analysis of the arrangement must proceed on the basis of analysing the scheme and purpose of the relevant taxing provisions affecting the different steps making up the arrangement. The arrangement described above generally relies on an interest tax deduction in terms of section 106(1)(h)(ii) for its effectiveness This section pro- vides for a deduction outside the general scheme of the Act, which has its own nexus, not between expenditure and assessable income, but between expenditure and the acquisition of shares in a group company. Section 191 of the Act provides for a comprehensive scheme for the offset of losses within groups of companies. The method by which losses may be offset depends on whether the group is character- ised as a “group of companies” or “specified group”. In general terms, a company is a part of a group of companies where there is a 66 2/3% commonality of shareholding. Companies are a part of a specified group where the shareholders hold all the paid up capital in all the companies in the same proportions. A group of companies may transfer losses by subvention payment, whereas a specified group may choose between a subvention payment or notice of election. There are a multiplicity of tests which must be satisfied before a taxpayer can avail himself of the grouping provisions. Section 191 creates a unique concept in a tax group, against which there is no external commercial yardstick. In other words, a tax group of companies is created by the Income Tax Act and exists only for the purposes of the Income Tax Act. (b) The Purpose of the Arrangement On an objective evaluation of the arrangement it has several purposes: the financing of group com- pany investments, the obtaining of a deduction in New Zealand and Australia for the incurring of a single expense, and to enable the dual resident company losses to be grouped against Res Co’s income. The latter purpose would prima facie amount to “tax avoidance” as that expression is defined in section 99, being to relieve “any person from liability to pay income tax”. 16 (c) Inference The inference to be drawn from this arrangement and surrounding circumstances is that the tax deductibility of the interest by B Co and the subse- quent grouping of B Co’s losses against Res Co’s assessable income is merely incidental to the pur- pose of funding the group’s investment activity. (d) Frustration The Department has identified several multina- tional companies which have utilised the dual resident structure described above. The Depart- ment does not consider that the scheme of the Act as it was prior to the introduction of sections 191(7E) and 191(7F) has been frustrated in these circumstances. The Department does not consider that section 99 applies to the above arrangement for the following reasons: (a)The terms of section 106(1)(h)(ii) have clearly been satisfied by this arrangement. (b)The scheme of section 191 has not been frustrated by this arrangement. Through section 191 the Act creates a tax group which exists only for the purpose of the grouping of tax losses. The Department does not consider that an arrangement can constitute tax avoidance where a taxpayer has simply satisfied the statutory form which the Act has purposely created. Although Res Co has been relieved to some extent of its liability to tax; that is one of the purposes of every offset of loss by one company against the profits of another; indeed it may be concluded that it is the only reason for the presence of section 191. (c)The Department considers that the mere ability to utilise losses in two separate tax jurisdictions is not of itself sufficient to trigger the operation of section 99. Europa Oil (NZ) Ltd v CIR \[1976\] 1 NZLR 546, 556, remains good law on this point; section 99 is not concerned with the fiscal consequences of the disputed arrangement in another tax jurisdiction. Section 99 is only concerned with the avoidance of New Zealand income tax. 9. CONTRIVED DEDUCTIONS FACTS F Corp is a company operating a business with substantial assessable income. The two major shareholders are a husband and wife, H and W respectively. F Corp enters into the following tax saving arrangement. F Corp acquire a household fridge from W for $100,000. The fridge is only worth $400. The purchase price is immediately lent back by W to F Corp on an interest free repayable on demand basis. The fridge is used by F Corp to store refreshments for entertaining clients. Two weeks after the purchase, F Corp sell the fridge to H for $500. F Corp claim the loss on disposal of $99,500 against its assessable income. INTERPRETATION (a) Scheme and Purpose The Income Tax Act provides a code in relation to deductibility. Section 101 provides that no deduc- tions are available otherwise than in terms of the Act. Section 104, the general deductibility provision of the Act provides for a deduction for any ex- penditure or loss incurred, or necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income. Expenditure otherwise deductible in terms of section 104 may be restricted by the provisions of section 106 e.g., section 106(1)(a) prohibits deductions for capital expenditure. Section 108 provides the test for deductibility for depreciation. (b) The Purpose of the Arrangement On an objective evaluation of the arrangement it has been implemented in this way for the sole purpose of avoiding income tax. (c) Inference The only inference which can be drawn from the arrangement and surrounding circumstances is that it was implemented in this particular way to avoid tax. 17 (d) Frustration The basis for deductibility of losses of this nature is unclear, the alternatives are section 104 or section 108. Where the claim is made in terms of section 104 the Department considers that the loss is not deductible as the arrangement has been entered into for the sole purpose of avoiding tax and thus lacks the nexus to assessable income. It is also considered by the Department that losses incurred in the above circumstances clearly fall outside the scheme of section 104. Where the claim is in terms of section 108 the Commissioner would similarly disallow the deduc- tion on the basis that it lacks the nexus to assessable income. The Department would also challenge the deduc- tion on the basis that it amounts to capital expendi- ture in terms of section 106(1)(a). Additionally, the Department would also invoke section 99 as the sole purpose of the arrangement is the avoidance of tax. The arrangement is artificial and is intended to frustrate the scheme and pur- pose of section Act. As from 1 October 1988 the excess over the market value of the fridge i.e., $99,600 is deemed to be a dividend to W in terms of section 4(1)(d) of the Act. If an arrangement as described above were entered into by a taxpayer, the Department would give serious consideration to treating the arrangement as tax evasion. 18 APPENDIX C TO TIB NO. 8, FEBRUARY 1990 EXPLANATION TO THE APPLICATION OF SECTION 99 OF THE INCOME TAX ACT 1976 CONTENTSPage POLICY STATEMENT1 APPLICATION OF SECTION 99 OF THE INCOME TAX ACT 19765 ANNEX TO POLICY STATEMENT - EXAMPLES OF APPLICATION5
1 CASINO CONTROL ACT 1990 - AMEND- MENTS TO THE GOODS AND SERVICES TAX ACT 1985 SUMMARY This item explains the amendments contained in the Casino Control Act 1990 which amend the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to provide the GST treatment for gaming conducted within a casino. INTRODUCTION The Casino Control Act 1990 provides for the licens- ing, supervision, and control of casinos. It also con- tains amendments to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to provide the GST treatment of gaming activi- ties conducted within a casino. This treatment reflects the recommendations of the Committee of Enquiry into the Establishment of Casinos in NZ in that GST will apply to the casino’s “win”. The treatment is consistent with that afforded to other forms of gaming such as games of chance and lotteries conducted in terms of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1977. These amendments to the GST Act will have no application until casinos become operational and commence to make supplies in respect of their gaming activities. The Casino Control Act comes into force on 1 July 1990. GST AMENDMENTS Section 5 of the GST Act, which deals with the mean- ing of supply, is amended by the insertion of two new subsections. The amendment deems a supply of services to occur where a person pays money to purchase a chip or otherwise to participate in a game played or conducted in a casino. This deemed supply is made by the holder of the casino licence. Section 9 of the GST Act, which sets out the time of supply rules, is amended by the insertion of a new time of supply rule in respect of the deemed supply described above. The new time of supply rule deems the supply to occur at the time a “casino count” occurs. A “casino count” is a defined term and means a count of money or money’s worth paid for the right to participate in gaming. Such counts will occur on a regular basis in terms of the conditions that will be attached to a casino licence. Section 10 of the GST Act, which determines the value of a supply, is amended by the insertion of two new subsections. The amendment deems the value of the supply to be the amount of money paid by persons to purchase chips or otherwise to participate in games less the amount of money paid out in winnings by the casino in respect of those games. The amount paid to participate in a game is GST inclusive. These amendments only provide the GST treatment for gaming activities played or conducted within a casino. In respect of other goods and services sup- plied by a casino the normal GST provisions of the GST Act will apply. Reference: LA GST 1990 Leg. Vol. TRANSFER OF DUTIES WORK FROM WELLINGTON TO PALMERSTON NORTH INLAND REVENUE From 1 April 1990, the Stamp, Estate and Gift Duty work which is presently handled by the Wellington District Office of Inland Revenue will be transferred to the Palmerston North Office. This change will affect all Taxation Districts in the Central Region, which are: NapierNew Plymouth GisbornePalmerston North WanganuiMasterton Lower HuttPorirua Wellington The procedures for sending documents and returns to Palmerston North under the document exchange system will be the same as those which currently apply for the Wellington office. The address to which documents should be sent is: District Commissioner Inland Revenue Department PO Box 1147 PALMERSTON NORTH GST - SCOPE OF THE TERM "RESIDENT" SUMMARY This item clarifies the scope of the term “resident” for the purposes of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. BACKGROUND It has become apparent that there is some confusion as to the scope of the proviso to the definition of the term “resident” as defined in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The confusion relates to whether a person with a fixed or permanent place in New Zealand is resident for the purposes of all activities carried on in New Zealand, 2 or whether they are resident with respect to only those activities the fixed or permanent place relates to. RULING Where a person is not a resident in New Zealand, in terms of section 241 of the Income Tax Act 1976, the proviso to the definition of the term “resident” as contained in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 provides that that person is a resident, for the pur- poses of the GST Act, only with respect to those activities related to a fixed or permanent place in New Zealand. EXAMPLE An overseas construction company is not resident in New Zealand in terms of section 241 of the Income Tax Act 1976 because their place of incorporation, centre of management, Head Office, and control by Directors is not in New Zealand. The construction company has two contracts to perform in New Zea- land. The first is managed from a fixed or permanent place in New Zealand and the second contract is not. Since the second contract is managed from overseas with no connection or relation to a fixed or permanent establishment in New Zealand the proviso to the definition of the term “resident” provides that the overseas construction company is a resident with respect to the first contract but not with respect to the second. LOCAL AUTHORITY ELECTED AND APPOINTED MEMBERS’ REMUNERA- TION— PART EXEMPTION FROM INCOME TAX SUMMARY This item discusses the taxation of the remuneration paid to members of local authorities with effect from 1 April 1990. BACKGROUND For many years the Department has allowed a portion of the remuneration of elected members of local authorities to be exempt from income tax. This was a carry over from the days when the remuneration paid to Mayors, Chairmen and councillors of local bodies was no more than an honorarium. It was recognised at that time that the fees received no more than defrayed the expenditure that the elected members incurred in carrying out the duties of the office held. With the recent revision of local government and the increase in remuneration of elected members there is no longer any justification for treating part of that remuneration as being exempt from tax. The elected members now receive remuneration that more closely reflects the time and effort the positions require. They are also entitled to receive reimbursement for any expenditure they incur in carrying out their duties, just like any other salary and wage earning employee. Local government reform took effect from 1 Novem- ber 1989 with changes in the format of local authori- ties and changes in the remuneration packages for most elected members. RULING As from 1 April 1990 the remuneration received by elected members will be subject to PAYE tax in full. The income received by the members are withholding payments in terms of the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979. The current rate of tax deductions for payments to local authority elected members is 33 cents in the dollar. This rate will be the most appropriate rate for the majority of elected members who have income from other sources. Where the remuneration from the local authority is the only income, or any other income is relatively small, the tax deduction rate of 33 cents may be too high. In these cases members can obtain a special tax code certificate, on application to their local Inland Revenue office, to reduce the rate of tax deductions. The existing exemptions will apply up to 31 March 1990. Where an elected member has changed from one authority to another because of the 1 November restructuring, the member will only be entitled to the exemption applicable to his or her new position as from that date. The remuneration of appointed members of local authorities is also taxable in full. H.O. Ref10.A.8.3. RECENT DETERMINATIONS ISSUED BY THE COMMISSIONER Four determinations were issued by the Commis- sioner on the 9th of February 1990. Below is a short explanation of each. The full determinations are printed in Appendix A to this TIB item. Determination G16A: This determination differs from Determination G16 in that the interest rate used to determine the discounted value is determined on the supply date rather than on the date of entry into the contract, which is more difficult to ascertain. This determination also extends 3 G16 by requiring the discounted value to be used to calculate income derived or expenditure incurred. Determination G17A: This determination has essentially the same changes as were made to Determination G16, except that it relates to deferred property settlements rather than trade credits. Determination G20: This is the foreign currency version of Determination G16A. This determination prescribes the discounted value of amounts payable under a trade credit where amounts payable are expressed in a base currency other than New Zealand dollars. Determination G21: This is the foreign currency version of Determination G17A. This determination prescribes the discounted value of amounts payable under a deferred property settlement where the amounts payable are expressed in a base currency other than New Zealand dollars. With the changes made to Determinations G16 and G17 the approach taken in all the above determina- tions is consistent. What is the Land Value? Who is Liable for Land Tax?

A full explanation of these items is contained in Appendix B to this Bulletin. LAND TAX In Appendix C to this TIB the land tax provisions and how they work are outlined. Included are the amend- ments made by the Land Tax Amendment Act 1989 which included the changes announced by the Minis- ter of Finance’s 1989 Budget and also the Land Tax Amendment Act (No.2) 1989 which requires taxpay- ers to pay land tax as calculated in their land tax return and to pay that tax without the Commissioner having to first issue an assessment. Issues covered are: What is Land Tax? What is the Land Tax Year? THE ACCRUAL TAX ACCOUNTING RE- GIME AND GOVERNMENT STOCK TRANSACTIONS Appendix D of this bulletin deals with the calculation of income and expenditure in respect of Government stock under the Accrual Tax Accounting Regime. THE TAXATION OF EXCHANGE TRADED OPTIONS CONTRACTS INTRODUCTION This TIB item sets out the Department’s policy on the tax treatment of exchange traded options, and in particular how Determination G7B: New Zealand Futures and Options Markets, Determination G18: International Futures and Option Markets, and Deter- mination G19: Exchange Traded Option Contracts, apply. The policy set out in this TIB item relates to - (a)New Zealand residents; and (b)The fixed establishment in New Zealand of any non-resident. The full text of this policy statement is contained in Appendix E to this Bulletin. NOTIFICATION TO EMPLOYERS: FBT PRESCRIBED RATE OF INTEREST FOR QUARTER COMMENCING 1 APRIL 1990 The prescribed rate of interest used to calculate the fringe benefit value of low interest employment- related loans has been retained at 14.8 percent for the quarter commencing 1 April 1990. 4 A brief press statement was released by the Office of the Minister of Revenue on 13 February confirming the rate.

INCOME TAX ( WITHHOLDING PAY- MENTS) REGULATIONS 1979 The No. 8 Amendment to The Income Tax (Withhold- ing Payments) Regulations 1979 will become operative from the 22nd of March 1990. The Amendment is to Regulation 2 of the principal Regulations and provides for the insertion, after paragraph (a) of the definition of the term “contract activity”, the following paragraph: “(ab) The performing or rendering of any work or contract service in New Zealand, whether or not that work or contract service is carried on or carried out in connection with, or in relation to, any contract project:” The Amendment, which is effective from the 22nd of March 1990, thus expands the definition of “Specified Contract Activities” in the Regulations so as to ex- pressly bring within the scope of the Regulations the performance or rendering in New Zealand of any work or any service of any kind, by a non-resident contractor. The Amendment thus removes any doubt as to whether non-resident consultancy fees, in particular, are within the scope of the Regulations. DUE DATES REMINDER April 1GST Return and payment for period ended 28 February 1990 due. April 7First instalment of 1991 Provisional Tax due for taxpayers with December balance dates.

1 DETERMINATION G16A: DISCOUNTED VALUE OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE IN RELATION TO TRADE CREDITS DENOMINATED IN NEW ZEALAND CURRENCY This determination may be cited as “Determina- tion G16A: Discounted Value of Amounts Payable in Relation to Trade Credits Denominated in New Zealand Currency”. 1. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) (1)This determination rescinds and replaces Determination G16: Discounted Value of Amounts Payable in Relation to Trade Credits Denominated in New Zealand Currency made by the Commissioner on 10 July 1989. This determination differs from Determination G16: Discounted Value of Amounts Payable in Relation to Trade Credits Denominated in New Zealand Currency by - (a)Requiring that the interest rate used to determine the discounted value of amounts payable in relation to a trade credit be ascertained as at the supply date of the specified goods or services rather than as at the date of entry into the trade credit (which can be difficult to determine); and (b)Requiring the discounted value of the amounts payable to be used to calculate income derived or expenditure incurred in an income year (which is an extension made to the method for completeness). (2)This determination provides the method to be used to calculate the core acquisition price for a trade credit under section 64BA(1)(b)(iii) of the Act where - (a)The trade credit is not a short term trade credit; and (b)The amounts payable in respect of the trade credit are denominated in New Zealand dollars; and (c)In relation to the trade credit all amounts payable and the dates on which they are payable are known at the first balance date after supply date; and (d)The term of the trade credit is known at the first balance date after supply date. (3)A short term trade credit, where payment is required within 63 days after supply of the specified goods or services, is exempted from the scope of the accrual provisions by the definitions in section 64B(1) of the Act. (4)Any other trade credit is subject to the accrual provisions of the Act and relevant determinations. In such cases the core acquisition price must be determined as at the supply date of the specified goods or services. (5)Sections 64BA(2) and (3) of the Act define acquisition price in terms of the core acqui- sition price, which is itself defined in section 64BA(1). Paragraphs (b)(i) and (ii) of that section provide two ways of determining the amount “u” which is required for calcu- lating the core acquisition price. Where neither of these apply, paragraph (b)(iii) provides that “u” shall be “the discounted value of the amounts payable for the speci- fied goods or services, as determined pursu- ant to a determination made by the Com- missioner under section 64E(1)(f) of this Act”. (6)This determination requires an interest rate to be ascertained in accordance with Deter- mination G13: Prices or Yields, as at the supply date of the specified goods or serv- ices. This interest rate is the market yield applying to bank bills of a similar term to the term of the trade credit; if the term of the trade credit is longer than twelve months the market yield on New Zealand Govern- ment securities must be used. (7)The amounts payable are then discounted to the supply date using the yield so ascer- tained and the present value calculation Method A in Determination G10: Present Value Calculation Methods, or an alterna- tive method producing not materially different results. The present value so calculated is the amount of “u” to be used for calculating the core acquisition price. (8)The core acquisition price is used to deter- mine the acquisition price of a trade credit in accordance with sections 64BA(2) or (3) of the Act. 2 (9)Once the acquisition price is known, income derived or expenditure incurred in relation to a trade credit shall be calculated as if the value of the specified goods or services were equal to the amount of the core acquisition price using the yield to maturity method which could be that determined in Determi- nation G3: Yield to Maturity Method or Determination G11: Present Value Based Yield to Maturity Method or an alternative method producing a result that is not mate- rially different. The acquisition price is also required for the base price adjustment. 2. Reference (1)This determination is made pursuant to sections 64E(1)(a), 64E(1)(f) and 64E(6) of the Income Tax Act 1976. (2)Determination G16: Discounted Value of Amounts Payable in Relation to Trade Credits Denominated in New Zealand Currency is hereby rescinded with effect from the day on which this determination is signed. 3. Scope of Determination This determination shall apply to every trade credit denominated in New Zealand currency in relation to which a person is a holder or an issuer, but it shall not apply - (a)To a short term trade credit; or (b)To a trade credit to which paragraph (b)(i) or paragraph (b)(ii) of the definition of “core acquisition price” in section 64BA(1) of the Act applies; or (c)Where in relation to the trade credit any amount payable or the date on which any amount is payable is not known at the first balance date after supply date; or (d)Where the term of the trade credit is not known at the first balance date after supply date. 4. Principle (1)The discounted value of amounts payable for the specified goods or services is calcu- lated as at the supply date using - (a)The market yield to maturity available on traded debt securities of a similar term to the term of the trade credit, ascertained in accordance with Determi- nation G13: Prices or Yields; and (b)Present value calculation Method A provided in clause 6(2) of Determination G10: Present Value Calculation Methods, or an alternative method producing not materially different results. (2)The discounted value of the amounts pay- able for the specified goods or services enables the acquisition price of a trade credit to be ascertained for the purposes of determining income derived or expenditure incurred in any period and the base price adjustment. (3)The discounted value so calculated is taken into account in determining the income or expenditure accruing from the trade credit in any income year, and where the dis- counted value and the amount of future payments under the trade credit are known the yield to maturity method is to be ap- plied. 5. Interpretation (1)In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires - Expressions used have the same meanings as in the Act and where a word or expres- sion is given a particular meaning for the purposes of sections 64B to 64M of the Act it shall have the same meaning as in the said sections 64B to 64M: “The Act” means the Income Tax Act 1976: “Bank bill” means an order to pay, denomi- nated in New Zealand currency to pay and drawn upon, and accepted by - (a)A registered bank as defined in section 2(1) of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1964; or (b)Any person referred to in part A of the first schedule to the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1964: “Final payment” in relation to a trade credit means the last payment required to be made by the issuer of the trade credit under the trade credit, other than any amount that is not material in relation to the total consid- eration required to be given by the issuer under the financial arrangement: 3 “Paid”, in relation to any amount paid to or paid by any person, includes distributed, credited, or dealt with in the interests of or on behalf of or to the order of the person; and, in relation to any amount, “pay”, “payable” and “payment” have correspond- ing meanings: “Specified goods and services” in relation to a trade credit means the goods and services to which the trade credit relates: “Supply date” means the day on which the specified goods or services are supplied under the trade credit: “Term” in relation to a trade credit means the period commencing on the day after the supply date and ending on the day on which final payment is required to be made. (2)Any reference in this determination to another determination made by the Com- missioner shall be construed as including a reference to any fresh determination made by the Commissioner to vary, rescind, restrict, or extend that determination. 6. Method (1)For the purposes of subparagraph (iii) of the definition of “u” in section 64BA(1)(b) of the Act, the discounted value of the amounts payable for the specified goods or services in relation to any person shall be the present value as at supply date of amounts payable to or, as the case may be, by the person for the specified goods or services after the supply date. (2)For the purposes of this determination, the present value as at supply date of amounts payable shall be calculated, subject to subclause (3) of this clause, using Method A provided in clause 6(2) of Determination G10: Present Value Calculation Methods, or an alternative method producing not mate- rially different results. The present value so calculated is the amount “u” to be used to determine the core acquisition price. (3)For the purposes of subclause (2) of this clause the annual rate of interest at which the present value of the amounts payable is required to be calculated shall be - (a)Where the term of the trade credit is twelve months or less, the yield for bank bills of a similar term to the term of the trade credit: (b)In any other case, the yield for New Zealand Government Stock of a similar term to the term of the trade credit - determined as at the supply date of the specified goods or services and according to Determination G13: Prices or Yields. (4)The core acquisition price is used to deter- mine the acquisition price of a trade credit in accordance with sections 64BA(2) or (3) of the Act. (5)Income derived or expenditure incurred in relation to a trade credit shall be calculated as if the value of the specified goods or services were equal to the core acquisition price, and using the yield to maturity method. 7. Example (1)A trade credit is entered into on 1 December 1988. Under the trade credit, goods supplied on 17 February 1989 are to be paid by $400,000 in New Zealand currency on 14 July 1989. The term of the trade credit (period from day after supply date to final payment date) is therefore 147 days. (2)The market yield on 17 February 1989 of bank bills maturing in 147 days is 13.5% ascertained in accordance with Determina- tion G13: Prices or Yields. (3)In this case, the purchaser is the “issuer” for purposes of the accruals legislation. (4)The purchaser has a 31 March balance date. (5)Method A of Determination G10: Present Value Calculation Methods, is applied to calculate the present value as at 17 February 1989 (the “specified date”) as follows - A=0 B=$400,000 (payable by the issuer or receivable by the holder) C=0 (payable by the holder or receivable by the issuer) R=13.5% (the specified rate) N=365/147 =2.48299 F= R =0.05437 100 x N Present Value = A + B - C = $379,373 1 +F This is “u” to be used in calculating the core acquisition price. 4 (6)For purposes of recognising income derived or expenditure incurred in relation to the trade credit Determination G3 is used (alternatively, G11 could be used) where - R=13.5%, N=2.48299, and F=0.5437. The expenditure incurred for the 147 day period is, $379,373 x 0.05437 = $20,627 This is apportioned for the period 17 Febru- ary to 31 March using Determination G1A - 1989 income year42 days$ 5,893 Expenditure for the 1990 income year is determined using the base price adjustment where, a=$400,000 b=$379,373 c=$ 5,893 a - (b + c)=$14,734 As this amount is positive it is deemed to be expenditure incurred by the issuer. This determination is signed by me on the 9th day of February in the year 1990. R D Adair Deputy Commissioner of Inland Revenue DETERMINATION G17A: DISCOUNTED VALUE OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE IN RELATION TO DEFERRED PROPERTY SETTLE- MENTS DENOMINATED IN NEW ZEALAND CURRENCY This determination may be cited as “Determina- tion G17A: Discounted Value of Amounts Payable in Relation to Deferred Property Settlements Denominated in New Zealand Currency”. 1. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) (1)This determination rescinds and replaces Determination G17: Discounted Value of Amounts Payable in Relation to Deferred Property Settlements Denominated in New Zealand Currency made by the Commis- sioner on 10 July 1989. This determination differs from Determination G17: Discounted Value of Amounts Payable in Relation to Deferred Property Settlements Denominated in New Zealand Currency by - (a)Requiring that the interest rate used to determine the discounted value of amounts payable in relation to a deferred property settlement be ascertained as at the transfer date of the specified property rather than as at the date of entry into the contract (which can be difficult to deter- mine); and (b)Requiring that the discounted value of the amounts payable be used to calculate income derived or expenditure incurred for any income year (which is an exten- sion made to the method for complete- ness). (2)In this determination an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or a specified option, where payment in full is not made at the time at which the first right in the specified property is to be transferred, will be called a “deferred property settlement”. Where the first right in the property is transferred at the time of payment of the purchase price in full, the purchase price will be the lowest price determined for the purposes of section 64BA(1)(c)(i) and the discounting provisions described in this determination will not apply. (3)This determination does not apply - (a)To short term agreements for the sale and purchase of property; or (b)To short term options; or (c)To private or domestic agreements for the sale and purchase of property; or (d)To deferred property settlements where any amount payable is denominated in foreign currency; or (e)To deferred property settlements where the total deposits and other amounts payable more than 31 days prior to the transfer date exceed 20% of the total purchase price; or (f)Where in relation to the deferred prop- erty settlement any amount payable or 5 the date on which any amount is payable is not known at the first balance date after transfer date; or (g)Where the credit term of the deferred property settlement is not known at the date of entry into the deferred property settlement. (4)Short term agreements for the sale and purchase of property and short term options are agreements or options under which settlement is required within - (a)93 days of entry into the contract in the case of real property; or (b)63 days of entry into the contract in the case of other property. Such short term agreements or options are excepted from the accruals provisions of the Act. A private or domestic agreement for the sale and purchase of property as defined in section 64B(1) is also an excepted financial arrangement. (5)For all deferred property settlements, a core acquisition price must be determined as at the date on which the first right in the property is transferred; for ease of reference, this date is called the “transfer date” in this determination. Sections 64BA(2) and (3) of the Act define “acquisition price” in terms of the “core acquisition price”, which is itself defined in section 64BA(1). In section 64BA(1)(c)(i) an amount “w” is defined as the lowest price that the buyer and seller would have agreed upon for the property on the basis of payment in full at the time at which the first right in the specified prop- erty is to be transferred. If there is no such lowest price, paragraph (c)(ii) provides that “w” shall be “the discounted value of the amounts payable for the specified property as determined pursuant to a determination made by the Commissioner under section 64E(1)(f) of this Act”. (6)This determination requires that an interest rate be ascertained in accordance with Determination G13: Prices or Yields, as at the transfer date of the specified property. This interest rate is the market yield apply- ing to bank bills of a similar term to the credit term; if the credit term is longer than twelve months the market yield on New Zealand Government securities must be used. (7)The amounts payable are then discounted to the transfer date, using the yield so ascer- tained and the present value calculation Method A in Determination G10: Present Value Calculation Methods, or an alterna- tive method producing not materially different results. The sum of the discounted amounts and any deposit or other amounts paid on or before the transfer date is the amount of “w” to be used for calculating the core acquisition price. (8)The core acquisition price is used to deter- mine the acquisition price of a deferred property settlement in accordance with sections 64BA(2) or (3) of the Act. (9)Income derived or expenditure incurred in relation to a deferred property settlement shall be calculated as if the value of the specified property were equal to the amount of the core acquisition price using the yield to maturity method which could be that determined in Determination G3: Yield to Maturity Method, or Determination G11: Present Value Based Yield to Maturity Method, or an alternative method produc- ing a result which is not materially different. 2. Reference (1)This determination is made pursuant to sections 64E(1)(a), 64E(1)(f) and 64E(6) of the Income Tax Act 1976. (2)Determination G17: Discounted Value of Amounts Payable in Relation to a Deferred Property Settlement Denominated in New Zealand Currency is hereby rescinded with effect from the day on which this determina- tion is signed. 3. Scope of Determination This determination shall apply to any deferred property settlement in relation to which a person is a holder or an issuer, but shall not apply (a)To any deferred property settlement where any amount payable (other than the prop- erty that is the subject of the deferred prop- erty settlement) is not denominated in New Zealand dollars; or (b)To any deferred property settlement where more than 20% of the amounts payable is required to be paid more than 31 days prior to the transfer date; or 6 (c)Where in relation to the deferred property settlement any amount payable or the date on which any amount is payable is not known at the first balance date after transfer date; or (d)Where the credit term of the deferred prop- erty settlement is not known at the date of entry into the deferred property settlement. 4. Principle (1)The discounted value of amounts payable for the specified property is calculated as at the transfer date using - (a)The market yield to maturity available on traded debt securities of a similar term to the credit term of the deferred property settlement, ascertained in accordance with Determination G13: Prices or Yields; and (b)Present value calculation Method A provided in clause 6(2) of Determination G10: Present Value Calculation Methods, or an alternative method producing results which are not materially different. (2)The discounted value of the amounts pay- able for the specified property enables the acquisition price of a deferred property settlement to be ascertained for the purposes of determining income derived or expendi- ture incurred in any period and the base price adjustment. (3)The discounted value so calculated is taken into account in determining the income or expenditure accruing from the trade credit in any income year, and where the dis- counted value and the amount of the future payments under the trade credit are known the yield to maturity method is to be ap- plied. 5. Interpretation (1)In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires Expressions used have the same meanings as in the Act and where a word or expres- sion is given a particular meaning for the purposes of sections 64B to 64M of the Act it shall have the same meaning as in the said sections 64B to 64M: “The Act” means the Income Tax Act 1976: “Bank bill” means an order to pay, denomi- nated in New Zealand currency and drawn upon and accepted by - (a)A registered bank as defined in section 2(1) of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1964; or (b)Any person referred to in part A of the first schedule to the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1964: “Credit term” means the period commenc- ing on the day after the transfer date and ending on the day on which the final pay- ment is required to be made: “Deferred property settlement” means an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or a specified option under which any amount is payable after the date on which the first right in the specified prop- erty is transferred: “Final payment” in relation to a deferred property settlement means the last payment required to be made by the issuer of a deferred property settlement under the agreement, other than any amount that is not material in relation to the total value of consideration required to be given by the issuer under the financial arrangement: “Paid”, in relation to any amount paid to or paid by any person, includes distributed, credited, or dealt with in the interests of or on behalf of or to the order of the person; and, in relation to any amount, “pay”, “payable” and “payment” have correspond- ing meanings: “Specified property” in relation to a de- ferred property settlement means the prop- erty that is the subject of the deferred prop- erty settlement: “Transfer date” in relation to a deferred property settlement means the day on which the first right in the specified property is transferred. Any reference in this determination to another determination made by the Com- missioner shall be construed as including a reference to any fresh determination made by the Commissioner to vary, rescind, restrict, or extend that determination. 7 6. Method (1)For the purposes of subparagraph (ii) of the definition of “w” in section 64BA(l)(c) of the Act, the discounted value of the amounts payable for the specified property in rela- tion to any person shall be calculated by summing - (a)Every amount payable to or, as the case may be, by the person for the specified property on or before the transfer date; and (b)The present value as at the transfer date of amounts payable to or, as the case may be, by the person for the specified prop- erty after the transfer date. (2)For the purposes of this determination, the present value as at the transfer date of the amounts payable shall be calculated, subject to subclause (3) of this clause, using Method A provided in clause 6(2) of Determination G10: Present Value Calculation Methods, or an alternative method producing results which are not materially different. (3)For the purposes of subclause (2) of this clause the annual rate of interest at which the present value of the amounts payable is required to be calculated shall be - (a)Where the credit term is twelve months or less, the yield for bank bills of a simi- lar term to the credit term: (b)In any other case, the yield for Govern- ment stock of a similar term to the credit term - determined as at the transfer date of the specified property and according to Deter- mination G13: Prices or Yields. (4)The present value of the amounts payable together with any deposit or amounts paid on or before the transfer date is the amount “w” to be used to calculate the core acquisi- tion price. (5)The core acquisition price is used to deter- mine the acquisition price of a deferred property settlement in accordance with sections 64BA(2) or (3) of the Act. (6)Income derived or expenditure incurred in relation to a deferred property settlement shall be calculated as if the value of the specified property were equal to the core acquisition price, using the yield to maturity method. 7. Example (1)A commercial property is sold for $1,500,000 under a sale and purchase agreement, subject to certain planning consents being obtained. A deposit of $150,000 is paid on 20 Decem- ber 1988, when the agreement is entered into. The balance of $1,350,000 is payable in two equal instalments due 3 and 6 months after the date of possession. Under the agreement, possession passes to the purchaser on the date the sale becomes unconditional; the purchaser has no other prior rights. The seller’s balance date is 31 March. On 3 March 1989 the planning consents are obtained and the sale becomes uncondi- tional. The credit term of the agreement (3 March 1989 to 4 September 1989) is 185 days (or 2 quarters). As this is under twelve months the yield on bank bills must be ascertained. (2)The yield on bank bills of a similar term to the credit term ascertained on 20 December 1988 pursuant to Determination G13: Prices or Yields, is 13.2%. (3)In this case, the seller is the “holder” for purposes of the accruals legislation. (4)Method A of Determination G10: Present Value Calculation Methods, is applied to calculate the present value as at 3 March 1989 (the “specified date”) as follows - R=13.2% (the specified rate) N=4 (since the payments are at quarterly intervals) F= R 100 x N =0.03300 (a)At 3 June 1989: A=0 B=$675,000 (payable by the issuer or receivable by the holder) C=0 (payable by the holder or receivable by the issuer) 8 whence present value at 3 June 1989 = A + B - C 1 +F =$653,437 (b)At 3 March 1989: A=$653,437 B=$675,000 C=0 whence present value at 3 March 1989 =A + B - C 1 +F =$1,285,999 (c) To this must be added the $150,000 deposit, giving a total present value of $1,435,999 which is the item “w” used in calculating the core acquisition price. (5)For the purposes of recognising the income derived in the 1989 and 1990 income years Determination G3 is used (alternatively, G11 could be used), where - R=13.2% N=4 F=0.0330 The income derived for the first 3 months is $1,285,999 x 0.0330 = $42,437.96 This income is allocated to the 1989 income year in accordance with Determination G1A - 1989 income year - 28 days = $12,915.90 (6)On the maturity of the financial arrange- ment, in the 1990 income year, a base price adjustment is calculated to arrive at the income deemed to be derived. Base Price Adjustment = a - (b + c) where - a=all consideration paid =$1,500,000 b=the acquisition price =$1,435,999 c=income derived in previous income years =$12,915.90 bpa=$51,085.10 As this is a positive amount it is deemed to be income derived by the holder in that income year. This determination is signed by me on the 9th day of February in the year 1990. R D Adair Deputy Commissioner of Inland Revenue DETERMINATION G20: DISCOUNTED VALUE OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE IN RELATION TO TRADE CREDITS DENOMINATED IN A FOREIGN CURRENCY This determination may be cited as “Determina- tion G20: Discounted Value of Amounts Payable in Relation to Trade Credits Denominated in a Foreign Currency”. 1.Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) (1)This determination provides the method to be used to calculate the core acquisition price for a trade credit under sub-paragraph (iii) of the definition of “u” in section 64BA(1)(b) of the Act where - (a)Any right or obligation of the parties is expressed in a “base currency” other than New Zealand dollars; and (b)All amounts payable in relation to the trade credit and the dates on which they are payable are known at the first bal- ance date after the supply date; and (c)The term of the trade credit is known at the first balance date after the supply date; and (d)Section 64BA(1)(b)(i), the cash price of the goods or services to which the trade credit relates as determined in the Credit Contracts Act 1981, is not applicable and (e)Section 64BA(1)(b)(ii), the lowest price at which the specified goods services could be purchased under short term trade credit, is not applicable. The core acquisition price is a component of the acquisition price, which is - (i)Required to calculate income derived or expenditure incurred in an income year in accordance with the Income Tax Act 1976 and relevant determinations (and for this purpose the acquisition price must be expressed in the base currency); and (ii)Converted to New Zealand dollars for the purposes of the base price adjust- ment. 9 (2)A short term trade credit, where payment is required within 63 days after supply of the specified goods or services, is exempted from the scope of the accrual provisions by the definitions in section 64B(1) of the Act. This determination cannot apply to a short term trade credit. (3)Any other trade credit is subject to the accrual provisions of the Act and relevant determinations. Where paragraph (iii) of the definition of “u” applies the acquisition price (and therefore the core acquisition price) must be determined as at the supply date of the specified goods or services. (4)Sections 64BA(2) and (3) of the Act define acquisition price in terms of the core acqui- sition price, which is itself defined in section 64B(1). Paragraphs (i) and (ii) of the defini- tion of “u” in that section provide two ways of determining the amount “u” which is required for calculating the core acquisition price. Where neither of these apply, para- graph (iii) of the definition of “u” in section 64BA(1) provides that “u” shall be “the discounted value of the amounts payable for the specified goods and services, as deter- mined pursuant to a determination made by the Commissioner under section 64E(1)(f) of this Act”. (5)For these purposes any amount determined in a currency other than New Zealand dollars is required to be discounted using an interest rate appropriate to the currency. This determination allows the use of - (a)A foreign currency interest rate ascer- tained using a method consistent with Determination G13: Prices or Yields as at the supply date - this interest rate is the interbank offer rate for the currency and term of the trade credit; or (b)An implied foreign currency interest rate calculated by reference to appropriate forward and spot exchange rates and the New Zealand bank bill or New Zealand Government Stock rates appropriate to the term of the trade credit. (6)The interest rate appropriate to the term of the trade credit is selected by the taxpayer, and once chosen the rate is required to be used in respect of every income year in which the taxpayer is a holder or an issuer of the trade credit. (7)The amounts payable under the trade credit are discounted to the supply date using the interest rate so ascertained and present value calculation Method A in Determination G10: Present Value Calcula- tion Methods, or an alternative method producing not materially different results. (8)The discounted value of the amounts payable is the amount “u” to be used for calculating the core acquisition price. (9)The core acquisition price is used to deter- mine the acquisition price of a trade credit in accordance with sections 64BA(2) or (3) of the Act. (10)Once the acquisition price is known in the base currency, income derived or expendi- ture incurred in relation to a trade credit shall be calculated, as if the value of the specified goods or services were equal to the amount of the core acquisition price, using the yield to maturity method, and Determination G9A: Financial Arrange- ments that are Denominated in a Currency or Commodity other than New Zealand Dollars. The yield to maturity method chosen may be that determined in Deter- mination G3: Yield to Maturity Method or Determination G11: Present Value Based Yield to Maturity method or an alternative method producing a result that is not materially different. (11)For purposes of the base price adjustment as defined in section 64F, the acquisition price must be converted to New Zealand dollars on the supply date of the specified goods or services. Reference This determination is made pursuant to sec- tions 64E(1)(a) and 64E(1)(f) of the Income Tax Act 1976. 3. Scope of Determination This determination shall apply to every trade credit where any amount payable is denomi- nated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars, but it shall not apply - (a)To a trade credit to which paragraph (b)(i) or paragraph (b)(ii) of the definition of “core acquisition price” in section 64B(1) of the Act applies; or 10 (b)Where in relation to the trade credit any amount payable or the date on which any amount is payable is not known at the first balance date after supply date; or (c)Where the term of the trade credit is not known at the first balance date after the supply date. 4. Principle (1)The discounted value of amounts payable for the specified goods or services is calcu- lated - (a)In the base currency as if it were New Zealand currency; (b)Using an interest rate appropriate for the currency, the rate being either - (i)A rate ascertained using a method consistent with Determination G13: Prices or Yields, that is the foreign interbank offer rate appropriate to the term of the trade credit; or (ii)A rate calculated by reference to appropriate spot and forward ex- change rates and the bank bill or New Zealand Government Stock rates appropriate to the term of the trade credit; and (c)Using present value calculation Method A provided in clause 6(2) of Determination G10: Present Value Calcu- lation Methods, or an alternative method producing results which are not materi- ally different. (2)The discounted value of the amounts pay- able for the specified goods or services enables the acquisition price of a trade credit to be ascertained for the purposes of determining income derived or expenditure incurred in any period and the base price adjustment. For the latter purpose the discounted value of the amounts payable is converted to New Zealand dollars on the supply date of the specified goods or serv- ices. (3)The discounted value so calculated is taken into account in determining the income or expenditure accruing from the trade credit in any income year, and where the dis- counted value and the amount of future payments under the trade credit are known the yield to maturity method is to be ap- plied. 5. Interpretation (1)In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires - Expressions used have the same meanings as in the Act and where a word or expres- sion is given a particular meaning for the purposes of sections 64B to 64M of the Act it shall have the same meaning as in the said sections 64B to 64M: “The Act” means the Income Tax Act 1976: “Acceptable present value calculation method” means Method A of Determination G10: Present Value Calculation Methods, or an alternative method producing results which are not materially different. “Bank bill” means an order to pay, denomi- nated in New Zealand currency and drawn upon and accepted by - (a)A registered bank as defined in section 2(1) of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1964; or (b)Any person referred to in part A of the first schedule to the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1964: “Base currency” in relation to a financial arrangement means the currency in which rights and obligations under the financial arrangement are fixed: “Currency” includes any commodity used as a medium of exchange or account, whether in general use or for the purpose of an arrangement: “Final payment” in relation to a trade credit means the last payment required to be made by the issuer of the trade credit under the trade credit, other than any amount that is not material in relation to the total consid- eration required to be provided by the issuer under the financial arrangement: “Forward exchange rate” means the price at which foreign currency can be bought or sold for delivery at a specified future time: “Interbank offer rate” in relation to a term means the rate at which a bank makes funds available to another bank which is a highly reliable credit risk and a trader in the mar- ket for such funds and for such a term; and includes, according to the circumstance, the 11 rates collectively referred to as “LIBOR” and “SIBOR”: “Specified goods and services” in relation to a trade credit means the goods and services to which the trade credit relates: “Spot rate” means the price at which foreign currency can be bought or sold for delivery in 2 days: “Supply date” means the day on which the specified goods or services are supplied: “Term” in relation to a trade credit means the period commencing on and including the day after the supply date and ending on and including the day on which the final payment is required to be made. (2)Any reference in this determination to another determination made by the Com- missioner shall be construed as including a reference to any fresh determination made by the Commissioner to vary, rescind, restrict, or extend that determination. 6. Method (1)For the purpose of paragraph (iii) of the definition of “u” in section 64BA(1)(b) of the Act, the discounted value of the amounts payable for the specified goods or services in relation to any person shall be the amount of New Zealand dollars equal in value to the present value as at the supply date of amounts payable to or, as the case may be, by the person for the specified goods or services after the supply date. (2)For the purposes of this determination, the present value as at supply date of amounts payable shall be calculated, using the interest rate determined under subclause (3)(a), or (b), or clause (4), as appropriate, and an acceptable present value calculation method. The present value so calculated is the amount “u” to be used to determine the core acquisition price. (3)In the first income year in which a person is a party to and derives income or incurs expenditure in respect of a trade credit, the annual rate of interest at which the present value of the amounts payable is required to be calculated shall be, at the option of the person, either - (a)The interbank offer rate for the base currency and the term of the trade credit at supply date of the specified goods or services, being a market yield deter- mined in a manner consistent with Determination G13: Prices or Yields; or (b)A rate derived by - (i)Converting the amount of the final payment from the base currency to New Zealand currency at the forward exchange rate for a term similar to the term of the trade credit and ascer- tained as at the supply date of the specified goods or services; and (ii)Calculating the present value of the amount thus calculated, using an acceptable present value calculation method and (A)Where the term of the trade credit is twelve months or less, the yield for bank bills of a similar term to the term of the trade credit; (B)In any other case the yield for New Zealand Government Stock of a similar term to the term of the trade credit the rate being determined as at the supply date of the specified goods or services and determined according to Determination G13: Prices or Yields; and (iii)Converting the amount thus calcu- lated to the base currency at the spot rate for the currency on the supply date of the specified goods or serv- ices; and (iv)Calculating the base currency interest rate R for the purposes of applying Method A in Determination G10: Present Value Calculation Methods such that, if the said Method A were applied to the final payment over the term of the trade credit, the present value so calculated would be equal to the amount calculated in sub-para- graph (iii) of this paragraph and for this purpose the exchange rate and the forward exchange rate are to be 12 determined in accordance with Determi- nation G6A: Foreign Exchange Rates - and in all subsequent income years during the term of the trade credit the annual rate of interest for that purpose in respect of the trade credit shall be the rate first used in respect of the trade credit pursuant to this sub-clause. (4)Where an amount payable is expressed in a foreign currency and is required to be converted to New Zealand dollars Determi- nation G6A: Foreign Currency Rates shall be used. If the base currency is not approved in Determination G6A: Foreign Currency Rates, a spot rate at which an arm’s length dealing would be expected to take place at the supply date shall be used. (5)The core acquisition price shall be used to determine the acquisition price of a trade credit in accordance with sections 64BA(2) and (3) of the Act. (6)Income derived or expenditure incurred in relation to a trade credit shall be calculated as if the value of the specified goods or services were equal to the amount of the core acquisition price using the yield to maturity method and Determination G9A: Financial Arrangements that are Denomi- nated in a Currency or Commodity other than New Zealand Dollars. For this calcula- tion the acquisition price shall be expressed in the base currency. (7)For the purposes of the base price adjust- ment, the acquisition price of the trade credit shall be converted to New Zealand dollars at the spot rate as at the supply date of the specified goods or services. 7. Example (A)Calculation where foreign interbank interest rate ascertained. A trade credit is entered into on 1 December 1988. Under the trade credit, goods supplied on 17 February 1989 are to be paid by $400,000 USD on 14 July 1989. The term of the trade credit (period from day after supply date to final payment date) is there- fore 147 days. For the purposes of calculating income derived or expenditure incurred and the base price adjustment it is necessary to calculate the core acquisition price. The US dollar interbank offer rate (LIBOR or SIBOR) on 17 February 1989 for 147 days is 9.625% ascertained using a method consist- ent with Determination G13: Prices or Yields. Foreign currency spot rates ascertained in accordance with Determination G6A: For- eign Currency Rates, for various dates are: 17 February 19890.6300 31 March 19890.6250 14 July 19890.6400 In this case, the purchaser is the “issuer” for purposes of the accruals legislation. Method A of Determination G10: Present Value Calculation Methods, is applied to calculate the present value as at 17 February 1989 (the “specified date”) as follows - A=0 B=US$400,000 (payable by the issuer or receivable by the holder) C=0 (payable by the holder or receivable by the issuer) R=9.625% (the specified rate) N=365/147 =2.48299 F=R= 0.038763 100 x N Present Value = A + B - C = US$385,073 1 + F This is converted into NZD at supply date using the spot rate of USD/NZD .6300 = NZ$611,227 and is the amount “u” for the purposes of calculating the core acquisition price. For purposes of recognizing income derived or expenditure incurred in relation to the trade credit Determination G3 is used, where R=9.625%, N = 2.48299, and F = 0.038763 and the acquisition price is US$385,073. The expense for the period 17 February to 14 July is therefore US$400,000 - $385,073 = US$14,927. This is apportioned between periods using Determination G1A as follows: 1988/8942 daysUS$ 4,265 1989/90105 daysUS$10,662 At balance date the expense for the period must be revalued to reflect exchange rate 13 movements and subsequent gains or losses on the transaction using Determination G9A. Closing tax book value is a = e + f + g - h - i where, e=0 f=0 g=0 h=US$385,073 (the acquisition price) i=US$4,265 (expense incurred during year) Closing tax book value (CTBV) is therefore - US$389,338 Expenditure for the year is calculated in New Zealand dollars using the formula in Determination G9A of a + b - c - d where, a=NZ$622,941 ( CTBV/ spot rate at balance date) b=NZ$611,227 (acquisition price/opening spot rate) c=0 d=0 As the result is negative it is deemed to be expenditure incurred of NZ$11,714. At the end of the financial arrangement on the 14 July 1989 the base price adjustment a - ( b + c ) is calculated where, a=total consideration paid by issuer =total amount of credit/ closing spot rate =NZ$625,000 (US$400,000/ 0.6400) b=acquisition price/ opening spot rate =NZ$611,227 c=total expenditure incurred previous year =$11,714 bpa=NZ$2,059 As this is positive it is expenditure incurred in the 1990 income year. Total expenditure claimed in relation to the credit is: NZ$ (11,714 + 2,059) = NZ$13,773 (B)Calculation of interest rate where foreign interbank interest rate is not used. The purchaser must calculate an implied foreign interest rate by the steps below. Convert payment US$400,000 using FWD Rate to NZ dollars. Forward rate ascertained 17 February 1989 in regard payment in 147 days is USD/NZD .6200. $400,000/.6200 = NZ $645,161. Assume that the yield for NZ bank bills of a 147 day term is 13.5% p.a., ascertained at 17 February 1989 in accordance with Determi- nation G13: Prices of Yields. Foreign currency spot rate ascertained in accordance with Determination G6A: For- eign Currency Rates, as at 17 February 1989 is USD/NZD .6300. Method A of Determination G10: Present Value Calculation Methods, is applied to calculate the present value as at 17 February 1989 (the “specified date”) as follows - A=0 B=NZ$645,161 (payable by the issuer or receivable by the holder) C=0 (payable by the issuer or receivable by the holder) R=13.5% (the specified rate) N=365/147 =2.48299 F= R = 0.05437 100 x N Present Value = A + B - C = NZ$611,892 1 +F This amount is converted into US dollars using the spot rate on 17 February 1989, NZ$631,892 x .6300 = US$385,492. The foreign interest rate is that which results in the US$400,000 when discounted being equal to US$385,492. The rate calculated in accordance with Determination G3: Yield to Maturity Method, is 9.344% per annum. The present value as at supply date, calculated using this interest rate in the same way as shown in example (A), will give NZ$611,892 as above. The importance of deriving this foreign currency interest rate is that it allows the calculation of expenditure using Determination G9A, as above. This determination is signed by me on the 9th day of February in the year 1990. R D Adair Deputy Commissioner of Inland Revenue 14 DETERMINATION G21: DISCOUNTED VALUE OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE IN RELATION TO DEFERRED PROPERTY SETTLEMENTS DENOMINATED IN A FOREIGN CURRENCY. This determination may be cited as “Determina- tion G21: Discounted Value of Amounts Payable in Relation to Deferred Property Settlements Denominated in a Foreign Currency”. 1. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) (1)In this determination an agreement for the sale and purchase of property, or specified option, where payment in full is not made at the time at which the first right in the specified property is to be transferred, will be called a “deferred property settlement”. Where the first right in the property is transferred at the time of payment of the purchase price in full, the purchase price will be the lowest price determined in accordance with section 64BA(1)(c)(i) and the discounting provisions described in this determination will not apply. (2)A short term agreement or option for the sale and purchase of property is defined as an agreement or option under which settle- ment is required within - (a)93 days in the case of real property; or (b)63 days in the case of other property - after the date on which the agreement was entered into or the option was granted. Such short term agreements or options are ex- cepted from the accruals provisions of the Act. A private or domestic agreement for the sale and purchase of property as defined in section 64B(1) of the Act is also an excepted financial arrangement. (3)Any other agreement for the sale and pur- chase of property or specified option is subject to the normal accrual provisions of the Act and relevant determinations. (4)For all deferred property settlements, a core acquisition price must be determined as at the date on which the first right in the property is transferred; for ease of reference, this date is called the “transfer date” in this determination. (5)Sections 64BA(2) and (3) of the Act define acquisition price in terms of the core acqui- sition price, which is itself defined in Section 64BA(1). In subparagraph (c)(i) of that section an amount “w” is defined as being the lowest price that the buyer and seller would have agreed upon for the property had all rights and consideration passed at transfer date. If there is no such lowest price stipulated in the agreement, subparagraph (c)(ii) provides that “w” shall be “the dis- counted value of the amounts payable for the specified property as determined pursu- ant to a determination made by the Com- missioner under section 64E(1)(f) of this Act”. (6)For these purposes any amount determined in a currency other than New Zealand dollars is required to be discounted using an interest rate appropriate to the currency. This determination allows the use of - (a)A foreign currency interest rate ascer- tained using a method consistent with Determination G13: Prices or Yields as at the transfer date - this interest rate is the interbank offer rate for the currency and the term of the deferred property settle- ment; or (b)An implied foreign currency interest rate calculated by reference to appropriate forward and spot exchange rates and the New Zealand bank bill or New Zealand Government Stock rates appropriate to the term of the deferred property settle- ment. (7)The interest rate appropriate to the term of the deferred property settlement is selected by the taxpayer, and once chosen the rate is required to be used in respect of every income year in which the taxpayer is a holder or an issuer in respect of the deferred property settlement. (8)The amounts payable are then discounted to the transfer date, using the interest rate so ascertained and present value calculation Method A in Determination G10: Present Value Calculation Methods or an alternative method producing not materially different results. (9)The discounted value of the amounts pay- able, together with any deposit or other amounts paid on or before the transfer date is the amount “w” to be used for calculating the core acquisition price. 15 (10)The core acquisition price is used to deter- mine the acquisition price of a deferred property settlement in accordance with sections 64BA(2) or (3) of the Act. (11)Once the acquisition price is known in the base currency, income derived or expendi- ture incurred in relation to a deferred property settlement shall be calculated as if the value of the specified property were equal to the amount of the core acquisition price, using the yield to maturity method and Determination G9A: Financial Ar- rangements that are Denominated in a Currency or Commodity other than New Zealand Dollars. The yield to maturity method chosen may be that determined in Determination G3: Yield to Maturity Method, or Determination G11: Present Value Based Yield to Maturity Method, or an alternative method producing a result which is not materially different. (12)For the purposes of the base price adjust- ment, as defined in section 64F of the Act, the acquisition price must be converted to New Zealand dollars on the transfer date. 2. Reference This determination is made pursuant to sec- tions 64E(1)(a) and (f) of the Income Tax Act 1976. 3. Scope of Determination This determination shall apply to any agree- ment for the sale and purchase of property and to any specified option held or issued by a person, where payments are expressed in a “base currency” other than New Zealand dollars. This determination shall not apply - (a)To any deferred property settlement where the amounts payable are denomi- nated in New Zealand currency; or (b)To any deferred property settlement where more than 20% of the sum of all the amounts payable is due before 31 days prior to the transfer date; or (c)Where in relation to any deferred prop- erty settlement any amount payable, or the date on which any amount is pay- able, is not known at the first balance date of the person after the transfer date; or (d)Where the term of the deferred property settlement is not known at the first balance date after the transfer date. 4. Principle (1)The discounted value of amounts payable for the specified property is calculated - (a)In the base currency as if it were New Zealand dollars; (b)Using an interest rate appropriate for the currency, the rate being either - (i)A rate ascertained using a method consistent with Determination G13: Prices or Yields, that is the foreign interbank offer rate appropriate to the term of the deferred property settle- ment; or (ii)A rate calculated by reference to appropriate spot and forward ex- change rates and the bank bill or New Zealand Government Stock rates appropriate to the term of the de- ferred property settlement; and (c)Using present value calculation Method A specified in clause 6(2) of Determina- tion G10: Present Value Calculation Methods, or an alternative method producing not materially different results. (2)The discounted value of the amounts pay- able for the property or specified option enables the acquisition price of a deferred property settlement to be ascertained for the purposes of determining income derived or expenditure incurred in any period and the base price adjustment. For the latter purpose the discounted value of the amounts pay- able is converted to New Zealand dollars on the transfer date of the specified property. (3)The discounted value so calculated is taken into account in determining the income or expenditure accruing from the deferred property settlement in any income year, and where the discounted value and the amount of future payments under the deferred property settlement are known the yield to maturity method is to be applied. 16 5. Interpretation (1)In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires Expressions used have the same meanings as in the Act and where a word or expres- sion is given a particular meaning for the purposes of sections 64B to 64M of the Act it shall have the same meaning as in the said sections 64B to 64M: “The Act” means the Income Tax Act 1976: “Acceptable present value calculation method” means calculation Method A in Determination G10: Present Value Calcula- tion Methods, or an alternative method producing not materially different results: “Bank bill” means an order to pay, denomi- nated in New Zealand currency and drawn upon and accepted by - (a)A registered bank as defined in section 2(1) of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1964; or (b)Any person referred to in Part A of the First Schedule to the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1964: “Base currency” in relation to a financial arrangement means the currency in which rights and obligations under the financial arrangement are fixed: “Currency” includes any commodity used as a medium of exchange or account, whether in general use or for the purpose of an arrangement: “Deferred property settlement” means an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or a specified option under which any amount is payable after the date on which the first right in the property is transferred: “Final payment” in relation to a deferred property settlement means the last payment required to be made by the issuer under the deferred property settlement, other than any amount that is not material in relation to the total consideration required to be provided by the issuer under the financial arrange- ment: “Forward exchange rate” means the price at which foreign currency can be bought or sold for delivery at a specified future time: “Interbank offer rate” in relation to a term means the rate at which a bank makes funds available to another bank which is a highly reliable credit risk and a trader in the mar- ket for such funds and for such a term; and includes, according to the circumstance, the rates collectively referred to as “LIBOR” and “SIBOR”: “Specified property” means property that is acquired or sold pursuant to a deferred property settlement: “Spot rate” means the price at which foreign currency can be bought or sold for delivery in two days: “Term” in relation to a deferred property settlement is the period from the transfer date to the date on which final payment is required to be made under the deferred property settlement: “Transfer date” of a deferred property settlement means the date on which the first right in the specified property is transferred. (2)Any reference in this determination to another determination made by the Com- missioner shall be construed as including a reference to any fresh determination made by the Commissioner to vary, rescind, restrict, or extend that determination. 6. Method (1)For the purposes of paragraph (ii) of the definition of “w” in section 64BA(1)(c) of the Act, the discounted value of the amounts payable for the specified property in rela- tion to any person shall be calculated by summing - (a)Every amount payable to or, as the case may be, by the person for the specified property on or before the transfer date expressed in New Zealand dollars; and (b)The amount of New Zealand dollars equal in value to the present value as at the transfer date of amounts payable to or, as the case may be, by the person for the specified property after the transfer date. (2)For the purposes of this determination, the present value as at transfer date of amounts payable shall be calculated, using the interest rate determined under subclause 17 (2)(a) or (b) as appropriate and an accept- able present value calculation method. (3)In the first income year in which a person is a party to and derives income or incurs expenditure in respect of a deferred prop- erty settlement, the annual rate of interest at which the present value of the amounts payable is required to be calculated shall be, at the option of the person, either - (a)The interbank offer rate for the base currency and the term of the deferred property settlement at transfer date, being a market yield determined in a manner consistent with Determination G13: Prices or Yields; or (b)A rate derived by - (i)Converting the amount of the final payment from the base currency to New Zealand currency at the for- ward exchange rate for a term similar to the term of the deferred property settlement and ascertained as at the transfer date; and (ii)Calculating the present value of the amount thus calculated, using an acceptable present value calculation method and - (A)Where the term of the deferred property settlement is twelve months or less, the yield for bank bills of a similar term to the term of the deferred prop- erty settlement; (B)In any other case the yield for New Zealand Government Stock of a similar term to the term of the deferred property settlement - the rate being determined as at the transfer date, and determined in accordance with Determination G13: Prices or Yields; and (iii)Converting the amount thus calcu- lated to the base currency at the spot rate for the currency on the transfer date; and (iv)Calculating the base currency inter- est rate R for the purposes of apply- ing Method A of Determination G10: Present Value Calculation Methods such that, if the said Method A were applied to the final payment over the term of the deferred property settle- ment, the present value so calculated would be equal to the amount calculated in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph - and for this purpose the exchange rate and the forward exchange rate are to be determined in accordance with Determi- nation G6A: Foreign Exchange Rates - and in all subsequent income years during the term of the deferred property settlement the annual rate of interest for that purpose in respect of the deferred property settle- ment shall be the rate first used in respect of the deferred property settlement pursuant to this sub-clause. (4)Where an amount payable is expressed in a foreign currency and is required to be converted to New Zealand dollars, Determi- nation G6A: Foreign Currency Rates must be used. If the base currency is in a market not approved in Determination G6A, a spot rate at which an arm’s length dealing would be expected to take place on the transfer date must be used. (5)The present value of the amounts payable together with any deposit or other amounts paid on or before the transfer date is the amount “w” to be used to calculate the core acquisition price. (6)The core acquisition price shall be used to determine the acquisition price of a deferred property settlement in accordance with sections 64BA(2) or (3) of the Act. (7)Income derived or expenditure incurred in relation to a deferred property settlement shall be calculated, as if the value of the specified property were equal to the amount of the core acquisition price, using the yield to maturity method and Determination G9A: Financial Arrangements that are Denominated in a Currency or Commodity other than New Zealand Dollars. For this calculation the acquisition price must be expressed in the base currency. 18 (8)For the purposes of the base price adjust- ment, the acquisition price of the deferred property settlement shall be converted to New Zealand dollars at the transfer date of the specified property. 7. Example (1)A commercial property is sold for US$1,400,000 under a sale and purchase agreement subject to certain repairs being made to the building. An initial deposit of $140,000 is made on 1 February 1989. On 1 March 1989 repairs on the building are complete and the sale becomes uncondi- tional. The balance of US$1,260,000 is due six months after the date possession passes. Possession of the property passes on 15 March 1989. Therefore the term of the arrangement is 15 March 1989 to 15 Septem- ber 1989 - 184 days. The purchaser’s balance date is 31 March. The USD/NZD exchange rates for the various dates are 1 February 19890.5600 15 March 19890.5800 31 March 19890.5750 15 September 19890.5700 In this case the purchaser is the “issuer” for the purposes of the accruals legislation. (2)The US interbank offer rate on 15 March 1989 for a period of six months is 8.0 percent ascertained using a method consistent with Determination G13: Prices or Yields. (3)Method A of Determination G10: Present Value Calculation Methods, is applied to calculate the present value as at 15 March 1989 (the “specified date”) as follows R=8.0 percent (the specified rate) N=2 (since the payments are at half yearly intervals) F= R 100 x N =0.04 (a)At 15 March 1989: A=0 B=$1,260,000 c=0 Therefore present value at 15 March 1989 =A + B - C 1 + F =US$1,211,538 (b)To this total must be added US$140,000 deposit, giving a total present value of US$1,351,538, which is the item “w” used in calculating the core acquisition price. (4)For the purposes of recognising as an ex- pense that part of the deferred property settlement which is subject to the accruals legislation Determination G3: Yield to Maturity Method is used. It will be found that expenditure is as follows, apportioned on a daily basis in accordance with Determi- nation G1A: 1988/8916 daysUS$ 4,214 1989/90168 daysUS$44,248 (a)At balance date the expenditure for the period is revalued in accordance with Determination G9A. Closing tax book value is a = e + f + g - h - i where - e=0 f=0 g=0 h=US$1,351,538 (the acquisition price) i=US$ 4,214 (expense incurred during year) The closing tax book value is - US$1,355,752 Expenditure for the year is calculated in New Zealand dollars using the formula from Determination G9A of - a + b - c - d where - a=- NZ2,357,830 (CTBV/ spot rate at balance date) b=NZ$2,330,238 (acquisition price/ opening spot rate) c=0 d=0 As the result is negative it is deemed to be expenditure incurred of NZ$27,592 in the 1989 income year. (b)At the end of the arrangement on 15 September the base price adjustment a - (b + c) is calculated to determine income or expenditure for the 1990 financial year where - 19 a=NZ$2,460,526 (deposit/ spot rate date paid plus balance of consideration/ closing spot rate) b=NZ$2,330,238 (acquisition price/open- ing spot rate) c=NZ$27,592 (expenditure incurred in the previous income year) Therefore bpa = NZ$102,696 As this is positive it is deemed to be expenditure incurred in the 1990 income year. Total expenditure claimed in relation to the deferred property settlement is NZ$(27,592 + 102,696) = NZ$130,288. This determination is signed by me on the 9th day of February in the year 1990.

1 APPENDIX B TO TIB NO 9, MARCH 1990 GST AND SHIPOWNERS' AGENTS 1. This item provides - (a)A brief discussion of the implications of section 60 of the GST Act (“Agents and Auctioneers”) for shipowners’ agents, and (b)An explanation of the GST treatment of fees charged to overseas shipowners by ship- owners’ agents in New Zealand. 2. In general there is an agent/principal relation- ship and therefore GST on purchases on behalf of the principal are likely to be available as a credit to the agent (section 60(2) and (6) of the GST Act). Recovery of the cost of such purchases from the principal is not a taxable supply. Agents fees are generally zero-rated, the exception being fees for arranging the provision of services to passengers or crew. The Industry 3. IRD staff dealing with shipowners’ agents should take care to familiarise themselves with the industry, and with the contractual arrangements entered into by the taxpayer with whom they are dealing. In particular care should be taken to distinguish contractual arrangements from prac- tices of convenience. For example, although there may be particular contractual terms for billing and payment, the agent may circumvent these by simply deducting fees and commissions from amounts held on behalf of the principal - although not in accord with the terms of the contract this may be acceptable to both parties as a means of avoiding exchange transaction costs. Disbursements 4. A brief explanation of the effect of section 60 in respect of New Zealand agents for shipowners outside New Zealand has been requested. 5. A shipowner’s agent will be the recipient of supplies of goods and services in the agent’s capacity as agent for the shipowner. Section 60(2) of the GST Act includes a proviso that allows an agent to request that GST invoices for those sup- plies be issued to and in the name of the agent in such circumstances. 6. In addition, if the non-resident shipowner is not a registered person and the supply in question - (a)Is not zero-rated; and (b)Is directly in connection with the export or import of goods, or arranging the export or import of goods, including the transport of those goods - and the agent and the principal agree that section 60(6) of the GST Act is to apply, the GST Act is to be applied as if the supply were made to the agent rather than to the principal. For this purpose some evidence of the agreement is necessary. It is anticipated that shipowners’ agents will be able to show this to be a part of the written terms of the agency contract. 7. Where section 60(2) and (6) of the GST Act apply, they should reflect in shipowners’ agents’ GST liability calculations as follows: Output tax debits For non-zero-rated supplies to the shipowner or operator In respect of fees and commissionsnormal rates (see paragraph 20 below re apportionment) In respect of supplies secured acting as agent for the principalno liability Input tax credits For supplies relating to the agency businessnormal rates For supplies secured acting as agent for the principalnormal rates (see paragraphs 16 & 17 above re statutory references). Agents’ Commissions and Fees 8. The fees dealt with in this item are the commis- sions and fees charged by agents for services performed for persons outside New Zealand in relation to - (a)Transport vessels; and (b)Non-transport (e.g. fishing) vessels - in New Zealand. 9. In particular the services dealt with in this item are not - (a)The transport of passengers or goods into, through, or out of New Zealand; (b)International carriage of passengers by air; 2 (c)Ancillary transport of goods within New Zealand in relation to transport of goods or passengers into or out of New Zealand; (d)Insuring or arranging the insurance or transport of goods or passengers being transported into, through, or out of New Zealand; (e)Services supplied directly in connection with land outside New Zealand; (f)Services supplied directly in connection with movable personal property situated outside New Zealand when the service is performed; (g)Services physically performed outside New Zealand; (h)Services relating to the protection of trade marks; or (i)The acceptance of an obligation to refrain from doing outside New Zealand a thing that can only be done outside New Zealand - but see paragraph 16(e) below. 10. It is clear that the services are not zero-rated unless - (a)They are within section 11(2)(c)(ii) of the Goods and Services Act 1986 - i.e., they are supplied directly in connection with vessels that are goods referred to in either section 47(2) or section 181 of the Customs Act 1966; OR (b)The services are within section 11(2)(e) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1976 - i.e., they are supplied for and to a person who is not resident in New Zealand and is not in New Zealand when the service is performed and are not supplied directly in connection with (i)Land in New Zealand; or (ii)Movable personal property in New Zealand when the service is performed (other than goods referred to in either section 47(2) or section 181 of the Cus- toms Act 1966) except that there is no zero-rating for the acceptance of an obligation to refrain from carrying on a taxable activity in New Zea- land. 11. Whether the vessels are goods referred to in either section 47(2) or section 181 of the Customs Act 1966 is a question of fact. Although there has been some discussion of whether vessels can be goods referred to in either section 47(2) or section 181 of the Customs Act 1966 it is clear that the intention of the legislature was that vessels pass- ing through New Zealand in service should not give rise to a GST liability. This is achieved in section 12 of the Goods and Services Tax Act. Vessels passing through New Zealand are never imported within the meaning of section 12(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act. 12. Whether such vessels are goods referred to in either section 47(2) or section 181 of the Customs Act 1966 is a different question. Section 47(2) of the Customs Act requires that the goods in ques- tion be capable of being removed from the ship or aircraft in which they arrived. Thus it cannot include the ship itself. Section 181 requires that the goods have been temporarily imported and by virtue of section 56(2) of the Customs Act vessels are within section 181 for the purposes of the Customs Act. 13. Although there is some doubt regarding the situation for GST purposes, the background to the GST legislation indicates that it was always in- tended that services supplied directly in connec- tion with transporting ships and aircraft through New Zealand should be zero-rated. As a result it is the Department’s intention to continue to inter- pret the GST Act as if - (a)Vessels dealt with by temporary import entry are goods referred to in section 181 of the Customs Act 1966; and (b)Vessels simply passing through New Zea- land on voyage (including passenger and cargo vessels transporting passengers or cargo to New Zealand) are goods referred to in section 181 of the Customs Act 1966. 14. The question of the meaning of “directly in connection with” has apparently given rise to some doubt. The IRD’s view is that - (a)The meaning of this phrase depends upon the context in which it is used; (b)The words “in connection with” require a relationship of more than remote degree; (c)That relationship must be direct (i.e., in the case of services, directly with the goods and not with some other person or thing); and 3 (d)The following questions are useful in deter- mining the matter in particular cases: (i)What is the service supplied in connec- tion with, if anything? (ii)Is the connection direct - does anything interpose between service and object? (iii)Is the service merely incidental to the object? 15. The words “for and to” in section 11(2)(e) of the Goods and Services Tax Act require some explanation. The word “for” requires that the goods or services be supplied for the benefit of the person to whom the goods or services are sup- plied. 16. Applying this to particular examples where the vessel is in New Zealand but is operated by a person (i.e., the owner or charterer) outside New Zealand, the view of the IRD is that - (a)Services supplied to the owner or operator of a vessel in relation to the vessel and to the actions of other persons (suppliers, repair- ers, etc) are not supplied directly in connec- tion with the vessel (e.g. arranging painting, arranging mechanical or hull repairs); These services - (i)Are zero-rated under section 11(2)(e) (whether the vessel is goods referred to in either section 47(2) or section 181 of the Customs Act 1966 or not) because they are supplied to and for the benefit of the owner or operator; and (ii)Are not zero-rated under section 11(2)(c). (b)Services supplied to the owner or operator of a vessel that are things done to the vessel are supplied directly in connection with the vessel (e.g. painting, mechanical or hull repairs); These services are zero-rated under section 11(2)(c)(ii). (c)Services supplied to the owner or operator of a vessel that amount to the satisfaction of the owner's or operator's liabilities as such are not supplied directly in connection with the vessel (e.g. arranging payment of statu- tory fees); These services - (i)Are zero-rated under section 11(2)(e) because they are supplied for and to the owner or operator; and (ii)Are not zero-rated under section 11(2)(c). (d)Services supplied to the owner or operator of a vessel that are the physical operation of the vessel are supplied directly in connec- tion with the vessel (e.g. navigating the vessel); These services are zero-rated under section 11(2)(c)(ii). (e)Services supplied to passengers or crew of a vessel are not supplied directly in connec- tion with the vessel (e.g. provision of inter- nal transport, medical services); and These services are - (i)Not zero-rated under section 11(2)(c)(ii) as they are not supplied directly in connection with the vessel; (ii)Not zero-rated under section 11(2)(e) as they are not supplied "for and to" a person outside New Zealand; and (iii)Zero-rated under section 11(2)(a) if they comprise the transport of passen- gers of goods (A)From a place outside New Zealand to another place outside New Zealand; (B)From a place in New Zealand to a place outside New Zealand; or (C)From a place outside New Zealand to a place in New Zealand - and the services are not simply ancillary to the transport (such as loading, un- loading or handling). Note that arranging the transport of passen- gers or goods is not sufficient to qualify for zero-rating under section 11 (2)(a) - it is the service of transporting only that is zero- rated. However the service of arranging transport is zero-rated under section 11(2)(ac) where the transport is of the types referred to in section 11 (2)(a) to (ab). In 4 addition it is not sufficient that the goods or passengers be departing from an interna- tional voyage. If that is the case they have ceased that voyage and are embarking upon a new one. It is the new voyage that must be considered. Thus if a passenger on an international voyage for some reason leaves the voyage in New Zealand and transport home is arranged by the shipping agent, it is the transport home that must be considered in terms of section 11(2)(a). Similarly where a crew member departs an international voyage in New Zealand, the crew member’s voyage home (at which stage the crew member is presumably a passenger) must be considered in terms of section 11(2)(a). (f)Services supplied to the owner or operator of a vessel for the benefit of passengers or crew of a vessel are not supplied directly in connection with the vessel (e.g. provision of internal transport, medical fees); These services are - (i)Not zero-rated under section 11(2)(c)(ii) as they are not supplied directly in connection with the vessel; and (ii)Not zero-rated under section 11(2)(e) as they are not supplied “for and to” a person outside New Zealand. 17. It should be noted that where the owner or operator of the vessel is in New Zealand (e.g. owner or charterer of a private yacht on voyage aboard the yacht in New Zealand) section 11(2)(e) cannot apply. 18. A further class of services that is understood to have been a matter of dispute is the supply of a berth for a vessel owned or operated by a person who is not resident in New Zealand and is not in New Zealand when the berth is supplied. This is the right for a vessel to occupy specified space at the wharf. As such it relates directly to the wharf space rather than to the vessel. The IRD view is that the supply of a berth (a)Is not zero-rated under section 11(2)(c)(ii) as it is not supplied directly in connection with the vessel; and (b)Is zero-rated under section 11(2)(e) as it is supplied for and to a person outside New Zealand and (not being supplied directly in connection with the vessel) does not fall within the exception in section 11(2)(e)(ii). 19. It should be noted that every case must be considered on its facts. The examples above should provide some guidance. Basis of apportionment 20. The appropriate basis of apportionment for calculating output tax liabilities will be a question of fact in any particular case. However it is antici- pated that (a)In general it will be sufficient to apply the GST rate to the fees and commissions for non-zero-rated goods and services; (b)Where a fixed fee is charged for availability of the agent there will be no apportionment; and (c)Where commissions and fees are charged for a variety of services in a single block and there are no differential rates, apportion- ment on the basis of the following fraction will generally be acceptable: cost (excluding agents’ commissions and fees) of non-zero-rated goods & services for which the commission or fee is charged total cost (excluding agents’ commissions and fees) of goods & services for which the commission or fee is charged
1 1. What is Land Tax? Land Tax is a tax payable by landowners based on the “land value” of land held at noon on 31 March each year. 2. What is the Land Tax Year? For the purposes of land tax the year of payment is a year commencing 1 April and ending on 31 March. The land tax payable in a year of payment is based on the land value of land owned by the taxpayer on the 31st March immediately preced- ing the start of the year of payment. For example, for land valued on 31 March 1990 the year of payment is the year from 1 April 1990 to 31 March 1991. 3. What is the Land Value? The value of land for land tax purposes is that which appears on the current district valuation roll at 31 March in the year preceding the land tax year. The current valuation of the land must be used. Where land is used for both taxable and non- taxable purposes, land tax is only payable on the value of land used for taxable purposes. For example, take the case of a corner dairy where part of the land/buildings comprises the shop- keeper’s residence. The value of the land will be required to be apportioned on the basis of the land used as a residence (being exempt from land tax under section 27(1)(q) of the Act) and land used for “dairy” purposes (being taxable). In general the Commissioner will accept a “just and reasonable” apportionment of the land values in terms of section 7 of the Act. If agreement cannot be reached the Commissioner will request the Valuer-General to make the apportionment and the assessment will be based on that appor- tionment. 4. Who is Liable for Land Tax? Any owner of land including local and public authorities, government departments, companies, partnerships, estates, trusts and individuals who own or hold an interest in land held at noon on 31 March shall pay land tax on the total land value of all land owned other than land that is exempt. “De Minimis Rule” (or $10,000 Threshold) - Land tax will not be payable where the total land value owned (that land value not including exempt land) does not exceed $10,000. Where the total land value exceeds $10,000 the exclusion does not apply. The $10,000 rule applies to land owned jointly as if the land were owned by one person. 5. Joint Ownership Section 13 of the Act provides that where “2 or more persons own land jointly or in common, whether as partners or otherwise, they shall be liable for land tax”. Joint owners will be liable on the interest held in land together with any other land owned either jointly or individually. Section 14(2) of the Act allows a deduction for the land tax payable under a joint liability against any land tax payable otherwise. Example: Coy A + B in Partnership Own Land Jointly (50% each)1,000,000 Land Tax Payable -1% 10,000 Coy A - Land Tax Payable5,000 Coy B - Land Tax Payable 5,000 Coy A - Land Value Owned Individually500,000 Add Value of Joint Ownership 500,000 Taxable Balance1,000,000 Land Tax Payable - 1% 10,000 Less Credit Share of Joint Ownership 5,000 Tax to Pay 5,000 Coy B - No other taxable land held Coy A - Total land tax payable$10,000 Coy B - Total land tax payable$ 5,000 6. Companies/Shareholders Shareholders The joint ownership provision extends to company shareholders (refer Section 16 of the Act). Al- though the company pays land tax in its own right, the land owned by the company is deemed to be owned by the shareholders in the same proportion that their interest in the paid-up capital of the company bears to the total paid-up capital. The shareholders will be liable for their shareholding proportion of the land owned by the company amalgamated with their other land holdings. A credit will be allowed in the same manner for their proportion of the company’s land tax pay- ment. 2 This provision will only apply to any shareholder where the shareholder’s interest in the land owned by the company (not including business premises) is $1,000 or over. The $1,000 test is used to determine whether the shareholder’s share is liable. If the $1,000 amount is exceeded the share- holder’s proportion of the whole land, including the business premises, will be taken into account in calculating the land tax payable by the share- holder in the same manner as a joint liability. The term “business premises” broadly means the building used for business purposes and any land which adjoins the building and is used and occu- pied in connection with the building. Companies Section 17 of the Act provides that companies which have more than two-thirds common shareholding at noon on 31 March shall be deemed to be a single company and liable for land tax accordingly. Where there is less than a 66 2/3% common shareholding the provisions of Section 16 of the Act may apply by apportioning any land tax liability to the individual shareholders. 7. Leasehold Land The holder of an interest in leasehold land is the owner for land tax purposes. A lessee’s interest is usually found in connection with long term leases and is the difference between the agreed rental and the inflation adjusted rental which would be charged if not for the long term lease. This would be combined with any freehold land to obtain the total land value. Points to note in relation to leasehold land: -There is no liability for land tax on an interest in land where the lease is of build- ings only; -A lease with a compulsory purchase clause is treated as an agreement for sale and purchase. The lessee is deemed to be the owner of the land and becomes liable for land tax as soon as possession has taken place. For a full explanation of Lessee’s Interest in Land refer to the Annexe to this appendix. This informa- tion was provided by Valuation New Zealand Ltd. 8. Absentee owners Previously, absentee owners of land were charged a penal rate of land tax. This provision has been repealed (refer Section 5 of the Land Tax Amend- ment Act 1989) and absentee owners are now treated in the same manner as other land taxpay- ers. 9. Trustees Liability A trustee is liable for land tax as if the trustee were the owner of the land. Where a trustee is the trustee of several trusts each trust will be sepa- rately liable in its own right unless the trustees are joint occupiers and subject to a joint liability. Where the same trustees hold land under 2 or more trusts but on behalf of the same beneficiar- ies, the trustees will be jointly liable. Where the trustee is the owner of other land liable for land tax in the trustee’s own right it shall be imposed separately from any land liable for which the person is a trustee, unless it is jointly occupied and therefore subject to a joint liability. 10. Maori Land No Maori is liable for land tax in respect of his/ her interest in Maori land (defined as Maori freehold land within the meaning and for the purposes of the Maori Affairs Act 1953) unless the land is occupied by a person other than the Maori owner or a trustee of him/her. Where the land is occupied by some person other than the Maori owner, the Maori owner is liable for land tax at half of the normal rates. The tax imposed is limited to one tenth of the revenue derived from the land. If the occupier is not a Maori, but has an interest in Maori land then he/she will be liable for land tax on that interest in the usual way. 11. Buyer or Seller of Land - Who is Liable? Section 19 of the Act provides where an agreement has been made for the sale of land, the buyer is deemed to be the owner for land tax purposes when possession (refer below for explanation of possession) is obtained, irrespective of whether conveyancing has been completed. Section 20 of the Act provides that the seller shall be deemed to remain the owner for land tax purposes until possession of the land has been delivered and at least 15% of the purchase money has been paid. This provision will not apply where the land value owned by the seller of the land at the date of the agreement for sale, includ- ing the land being sold, is less than $80,000. 3 There is a proviso allowing the Commissioner not to apply these provisions where an agreement was made in good faith and not for the purposes of evading land tax. 12. Mortgagee in Possession Where a mortgagee takes possession of land from the mortgagor, the mortgagee, pursuant to Section 24 of the Act, is deemed to be the beneficial owner of the land and liable for land tax. A deduction is allowed for the land tax paid in respect of the land by the mortgagor. 13. Exemptions from Land Tax The Land Tax Amendment Act 1989 substitutes a new Section 27 to the Act which exempts certain classes of land from land tax. Further changes were included in the Land Tax Amendment Act (No.2) 1989. The land tax base has been broadened to apply in the main to all commercial and industrial land and includes land owned by public and local authorities including government departments. The following list of exemptions will however apply for the land tax year of payment commenc- ing 1 April 1990: (a)Land forming any National Park within the meaning of the National Parks Act 1980. (b)Land owned by the Crown or any Local or Public Authority which is used as a domain, recreation, historic, scenic, nature, scientific or Government purpose reserve or any other type of reserve within the meaning of the Reserves Act 1977; wildlife management reserve, wildlife refuge or wildlife sanctu- ary; flood ponding area, any foreshore areas and the bed of the territorial sea and any navigable lake or river. If the land is used for the pecuniary profit of any person then the exemption will not apply. Land tax will be payable. (c)Land on which is situated any vice-regal residence or Parliament buildings. (d)Land owned and used by the Crown or any Public or Local Authority which is used as the site of a public library, museum, cem- etery or burial ground, recreation ground, garden, domain or reserve; land used solely or principally for games or sports and not used for the private pecuniary profit of any individual. If the site of the public library, etc., is reserved land the private pecuniary profit test of individuals applies. (e)Land used for a national or public road. (f)Land occupied by NZ Railways Corporation and used as part of the permanent railway. This exemption does not include land used for: -Railway or marshalling yards; -Loading/unloading areas; -Administrative or other ancillary pur- poses. (g)Land owned by the Crown or land reserved and occupied for pastoral purposes, e.g., land used for sheltering livestock which is being moved by a drover from the farm to the freezing works. (h)Maori customary land within the meaning of the Maori Affairs Act 1953. (i)Land owned by or in trust for any society or trustees and used as the site of a public library, museum, cemetery or burial ground, recreation ground, garden, domain or reserve. Provided that the activity is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual. (j)Land owned by or in trust for any charitable society or institution if the land is used as a site for the purposes of the charitable body and not for the private pecuniary profit of any individual. This exemption is limited to 7 hectares of land. (k)Land owned, occupied or in trust for any society or association of persons, whether incorporated or not used solely or princi- pally for games or sports other than horse or greyhound racing or trotting and not used for the private pecuniary profit of an indi- vidual. (l)Land owned or occupied by any racing club or company, all the shares of which are owned by the racing club or clubs, if such land is used solely or principally for horse or greyhound racing or trotting. (m)Land owned by or in trust for a society incorporated under the Agricultural and Pastoral Societies Act 1908 and used as a showground or meeting place. (n)Land owned by or in trust for a society incorporated under the Libraries and Me- chanics Institute Act 1908 and used as a site for its purpose. 4 (o)Land used for the purpose of a university, college, high school, secondary school or public education institute not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of an indi- vidual. (p)Land owned solely or principally for any of the following or combination of the follow- ing: -Animal husbandry - includes poultry and bee keeping and the breeding of horses; -Growing fruit, vegetables or other crop producing plants; -Horticulture; -Viticulture; -Forestry or silviculture. Hobby farmers will not be subject to land tax in relation to land owned for that pur- pose. This is due to the removal of the business test from this exemption. The exemption will not apply where land is used for the above purposes as a temporary measure, e.g., growing vegetables on a city lot planned for development. (q)Land used principally as the site of any residential dwelling (being a house, flat, townhouse, home unit, or similar dwelling) and any vacant residential land intended to be used as the site of any dwelling. Where the area of land on which the residence is situated or is to be situated is greater than: -4,500 square metres; or -An area which is considered appropriate having regard to the size and character of the residence or residences; The Commissioner may determine that a proportion of the land is not attributable to the residence and the exemption will there- fore not apply to that portion. (r)Land used principally as the site of a boardinghouse, lodginghouse, hostel or private residential hotel. This exemption does not apply to any establishment that caters principally for temporary or transient accommodation (one month is considered outside of temporary or transient accommo- dation) or premises for which a hotel premises or tourist-house premises licence is in force. (s)Land used as the site for any home of the aged within the meaning of Section 120A(3) of the Health Act 1956. (t)Land used as the site of a building that is classified by the NZ Historic Places Trust in terms of paragraph (a) or (b) of Section 35(1) of the Historic Places Act 1980. This exemp- tion does not apply where the classification relates solely to the facade of a building. (u)Land used as the site of any hospital includ- ing servicing and landscaped areas directly associated with the operation of the hospi- tal. A hospital means any public or private hospital. (v)Land used by an Area Health Board to provide health services. This exemption reflects the wider operations now expected of area health boards. Section 27(2) of the Land Tax Act 1976 stipulates that the exemptions provided by section 27(1)(a) to 27(1)(n) be limited to the “owner” specified in those sections of the Act. The situation that occurs predominantly is when a land owner who is exempt from land tax (say a charitable organisation exempt in accordance to section 27(1)(j) of the Land Tax Act 1976) who is leasing land to a non exempt organisation on a commercial basis. The exemption is limited to the lessor (owner) and cannot be transferred to the lessee (tenant) because of section 27(2) of the Act. The other situation which can occur is when an exempt organisation (say a sporting organisation which is exempt with accordance to section 27(1)(k) of the Land Tax Act 1976) who leases land from a non exempt organisation on a commercial basis. The exemption in this case is limited to the lessee (tenant) and cannot be transferred to the lessor (owner). In both cases a lessee/lessor interest assessment is required to be carried out by Valuation New Zealand. This will determine the exempt and liable portions (given the circumstances above) within the land in question with the two portions totalling the land value. 14. Rate of Land Tax The rate of land tax is as follows: (a)1.5% for every dollar of taxable land value for the 1989 year of assessment; (b)1% for every dollar of taxable land value for the 1990 and subsequent years of payment. 5 15. Returns and Payments The annual land tax returns (form IR 2) are to be sent to Inland Revenue no later than 7 May for the year of payment (i.e., for the 1990 year of payment the return is due on 7 May 1990). Both the land tax return and payment are to be sent to the Upper Hutt Processing Centre at P O Box 40141, Upper Hutt. All land tax enquiries will remain with Masterton office. Land tax payment dates have been amended and differ for the 1990 year of payment and 1991 and subsequent years of payment. For the 1990 year of payment, land tax will be due and payable in 2 equal sums on 7 May 1990 and 7 October 1990 (previously payment was due in one sum on 7 October). For the 1991 and subsequent years of payment full payment will be required on 7 May, the same date for furnishing of the land tax return. As a result of the advancement of the payment date, the Department has adopted a self-assess- ment approach to processing land tax returns, similar to that adopted to GST processing. A taxpayer will now be required to pay land tax as calculated in the return and pay that amount without the Commissioner being required to first issue an assessment. An assessment is only issued where the taxpayer requests such an assessment, where the return is incorrectly calculated, where no return is furnished or where the Commissioner considers it necessary. An assessment is normally only requested when the taxpayer wishes to seek adjudication by the Courts. NOTE: As there are two payment dates for 1990, the first payment is to be sent with the land tax return which is also due to be furnished by 7 May. A notice will be issued after the return is received. This will include a replacement pay-in slip for the 7 October 1990 payment together with a self- addressed envelope. 16. Late Payment Penalty for non or late payment has been changed with effect from the 1990 year of payment. Addi- tional tax for late payment is charged at 10% on the overdue account. Further additional tax of 2% is then charged on a compounding basis for every subsequent month that the tax is overdue. It should be noted that the Commissioner has the authority to register a charge against the land where a default in payment has occurred (refer Section 50 of the Act). 17. Non-Furnishing of Return If a land tax return is not furnished by the due date a default assessment will be issued in ab- sence of a return and additional tax for late pay- ment will apply as outlined above. 18. Income Tax Deductibility Section 140 of the Income Tax Act deems land tax payable for any year of payment in respect of land used in the production of assessable income to be an expense incurred during the year in which the land tax is paid. Example 1: 1990 Land Tax Year of Payment Land Tax Payable7 May 1990 7 October 1990 The land tax paid is deemed to be an expense for the taxpayer’s 1991 income year (i.e., it is an expense incurred during the 1991 income year). Example 2: For a late 1990 income tax balance date, e.g., 30 June. 7 May 1990 instalment deemed a 1990 expense 7 October 1990 instalment deemed a 1991 expense 7 May 1991 payment for 1991 land tax is deemed to be a 1991 expense - the last 2 payments in this example being made during the taxpayer’s 1991 income year. 6 ANNEX TO APPENDIX C, TIB NO. 9, MARCH 1990 Lessees’ Interest in Land Background: Within the terms of Section 5 of the Land Tax Act 1976, the land value of a taxpayer’s land which appears on the district valuation roll, is to be used as a base for land tax. Section 8(1) relates to an estate or interest in land which does not appear on the district valuation roll, whereby the Valuer-General will assess a special valuation of that estate or interest. Section 8(3) allows a right of objection to the taxpayer to this special valuation, which includes the right for the valuation to be determined by the Land Valuation Tribunal. It is therefore the Valuer-General’s responsibility to assess the value of the estate or interest at the appropriate market level as at the effective date. However, the Valuer-General has in the past accepted that the value of all the interests will not add to more than the assessed freehold value appearing on the district valuation roll, and makes appropriate checks and adjustments to ensure that this is the case. Assessment of Lessee’s Interest In most centres of New Zealand there is some sales evidence on which to base the assessments of this interest. In general terms the interest is assessed on the basis of: (i)The benefit of a low ground rental for the balance of the lease term - before renewal. (ii)An assessment for the value of the “right to occupy” generally reflecting the degree of benefits of the lease terms, i.e., fixed leases with limited review periods, and with rentals assessed at lower than first mortgage or comparable investment rates normally confer significant advantages to the lessee. The premium paid varies throughout the country, but is primarily related to local demand in the market place for such lease- hold interests when they are offered for sale. Lessee’s Interest in Land by Valuation New Zealand Ltd. The lessee’s interest value in ground leased prop- erty for land tax purposes is determined by the land value component as appearing on the valua- tion roll as at 31 March in any year, and by the rights conferred to the lessee by the terms of the lease. In any lease a lessee “owns” the right to occupy the land subject to paying a contract rent for that occupancy benefit. In addition many leases nor- mally confer a right of renewal of a further fixed term or longer, i.e., “Glasgow” leases which are in perpetuity. In establishing the rental for the ground most leases ensure that there is to be no rental payable or ascribed to the value of improvements which any lessee has made on the land, or has purchased as a benefit from a previous lessee. When determining the value of a lessees’ interest it is necessary to make an assessment of what the likely rental would be based on the land value appearing on the district valuation roll for the year in question, if the rental were to be reviewed or renewed at that date as the case may be, in order to ascertain the current benefit that the lessee has left to enjoy in terms of the existing ground rental below a full contract rental level. The present value of that financial benefit, is discounted at a rate of interest. The appropriate rate will balance the typical prudent lessee’s opportunity cost of capital against the risks of leasehold investment compared to freehold invest- ment. This discounted annual benefit will deter- mine the value of the benefit to run in the lease. Added to that benefit will be some allowance for the value of the rights of renewal which the lessee can exercise at the expiry of each term. If these are perpetual rights, the value of these may be quite significant and are affected by the following factors: •The degree to which the rental basis on renewal is likely to produce a rental which is advantageous to the lessee compared to the opportunity cost of long term owner- ship. •The term of the rent review periods, with 21 year terms generally regarded as being more valuable than say 7 year terms over which any rental benefits from a renewed fixed annual rent will apply. •The degree to which it is perceived that Government may by legislation interfere with the terms and conditions of leases to reduce or enhance the lessee’s benefits or rights, such as rent freeze regulations, changing freeholding rights, or altering statutory or negotiated ground rental per- centages. 7 •The likely level of any variations in ex- pected inflation over a term of the next renewal that would act to reduce the real cost of rental payments and in turn affect the perceived financing opportunity costs and benefits. •The likelihood that land values will increase more (or less) than the inflation rates, giving an added advantage (or disadvantage) to the lessee in comparison to the alternative of freehold ownership financing opportunity costs. The benefit of renewal will therefore vary from lease to lease, as well as from urban and rural properties, and from one location to another, as the case may be, but is finally dependent on the terms of each individual lease document. 8 APPENDIX C TO TIB NO. 9, MARCH 1990 LAND TAX CONTENTSPage 1.What is Land Tax?1 2.What is the Land Tax Year?1 3.What is the Land Value?1 4.Who is liable for Land Tax1 5.Joint Ownership1 6.Companies/Shareholders1 7.Leasehold Land2 8.Absentee Owners2 9.Trustees Liability2 10.Maori Land2 11.Buyer or Seller of Land2 12.Mortgagee in possession3 13.Exemptions from Land Tax3 14.Rate of Land Tax4 15.Returns and payments5 16.Late payment5 17.Non-furnishing of return5 18.Income Tax Deductibility5
1 APPENDIX D TO TIB NO 9, MARCH 1990 THE ACCRUAL TAX ACCOUNTING REGIME AND GOVERNMENT STOCK TRANSACTIONS 1.Introduction 1.1This item deals with the calculation of income and expenditure in respect of Government stock under the accrual tax accounting re- gime. 1.2New Zealand Government stock purchased from the Reserve Bank or anyone else on or after 8.30 pm on 31 July 1986 (the “Imple- mentation date”) is a financial arrangement in terms of section 64B(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976. The tax consequences for a taxpayer arise from a taxpayer being a holder or an issuer in respect of that financial arrange- ment. Government stock purchased after the implementation date is subject to the accruals legislation. This also applies to mortgage bonds, local authority stock and similar debt instruments. 2.What is Govemment Stock? 2.1Government stock is a fixed interest security offered by the Reserve Bank at a fixed coupon (i.e. interest payment) paid semi-annually. Government stock is issued to the market by periodic tender every few weeks. Each tenderer for the stock must state the yield to maturity sought and the amount of Govern- ment stock they are tendering for. The yield required must be stated to 2 decimal places. All tenders are submitted to the Reserve Bank. After the tender closing date, allotment is made in ascending order of yields bid. Generally the interest rate received from Government Stock is lower than that received from other similar debt instruments as Gov- ernment Stock is considered to be a relatively risk-free investment. 2.2If the bidder is successful, the Government Stock will be issued to the taxpayer for the purchase or “settlement” price. Irrespective of the date of settlement, holders of Tender stock will receive a full semi-annual coupon payment on the first and subsequent coupon dates. 2.3A secondary market exists where taxpayers may buy or sell Government Stock at below par (discounted) or above par (at a premium) value, depending on the movement of inter- est rates subsequent to the purchase of the Government Stock. Therefore the price paid on the secondary market for Government Stock will reflect current interest rates against the coupon rate applying to the stock held, plus the amount of interest which has ac- crued on the stock since the last coupon payment date. Thus secondary market deal- ings will almost always occur at a premium or a discount. The owner of the stock at the time the coupon payments are due is the person who will receive the coupon payment. Similarly the owner of the stock at the time of maturity will receive the redemption amount. 2.4Where the yield required by an investor is greater than the coupon rate the stock will be issued or acquired at a price below its re- demption (or par) value, i.e. at a discount. 2.5Government stock is issued at a premium where the issue or acquisition price of the stock is greater than its redemption price i.e., the yield required is less than the coupon rate. 3.Accruals Treatment of Government Stock 3.1Taxpayers investing in Government Stock are holders as defined in section 64B(1) of the Act. Holders (except cash basis holders) are required to return interest income in accord- ance with section 64C of the Act. 3.2Where the taxpayer is in the business of dealing in Government stock, section 64C(4) allows calculation of income (or expenditure, i.e. loss due to market yield fluctuations) using a method that has regard to market valuation. Certain other conditions set out in section 64C(4) must also be satisfied. As section 64C(4) is available only to dealers, any unrealised loss under section 64C(4) will be deductible under section 106(1)(h). 3.3Where section 64C(4) does not apply, income must be calculated - (a)In accordance with section 64C(2) in every lncome year except the income year in which the Government stock matures, is sold, or otherwise transferred by the holder; or (b)According to section 64F (i.e base price, or cash base price adjustment) in the income year in which the Government stock matures or is sold, or otherwise transferred by the holder. 2 If the Government stock is bought and sold within the same income year only the base price adjustment or cash base price adjustment is required. 3.4Determination G3: Yield to Maturity Method, made by the Commissioner on 13 May 1987 and Determination G11: Present Value Based Yield to Maturity Method, made by the Commissioner on 21 November 1988 apply to Government stock (among other things). Where section 64C(2) applies taxpayers must use (i)Determination G3; or (ii)Determination G11; or (iii)An alternative method that has regard to the principles of accrual accounting, and (a)Conforms with commercially accept- able practice; and (b)Is adopted and applied by the person consistently in respect of all such financial arrangements; and (c)Gives a result which is not materially different from Determinations G3 or G11: The accrual rules for interest aim to spread income and expenditure over the term of the financial arrangement. 4.Treatment of Holders (not being cash basis holders) 4.1During the life of the financial arrangement gains are deemed to be income derived under sections 64C(2) or 64C(4), and are assessable under section 65(2)(j). On sale, transfer, or maturity of the Government stock section 64F(4)(a)(i) deems a positive amount result- ing from the base price adjustment to be income derived in that income year. 4.2Any loss, calculated under the base price adjustment, resulting from the sale or transfer of Government stock for less than the acquisi- tion price, is deemed to be an allowable deduction under section 64F(4)(a)(ii). 5.Cash Basis Holders 5.1Where the stock is held by someone who is a cash basis holder (as defined in section 64D(1) of the Act), income from that stock will be recognised on a cash basis, except in the year in which the stock matures, is sold, or otherwise transferred by the holder. In that year a cash base price adjustment is required in terms of section 64F(3). 5.2A cash basis holder may take into account interest income which has accrued on the Government stock before the stock was acquired by the cash basis holder. The pro- viso to section 65(2)(j) applies where any securities have been acquired by purchase or otherwise during the year and allows the Commissioner, where he considers it equita- ble to do so, to apportion between the transferor and the transferee any interest due or accruing at the date of the transfer. 5.3However this provisioh is available only when the apportionment of the interest is indicated on the contract note, or where other evidence is available to support the appor- tionment. The apportionment on the contract note for the first periodic interest payment is to be treated on the basis that the coupon interest accrues evenly on a straight-line daily basis over the full period to which it relates (360 or 365 day basis is acceptable). This is the treatment followed prior to the introduction of the accrual tax accounting regime, and it is not intended to alter except in the year in which section 64F applies. The cash basis holder will be required to recog- nise as periodic interest only that proportion of the payment which accrued after the date of acquisition. 5.4In the final year a cash base price adjustment is necessary. A positive amount calculated under the cash base price adjustment is deemed to be income derived by the cash basis holder in that income year under sec- tion 64F(5)(a) of the Act. A negative amount caIculated under the cash base price adjust- ment is deemed to be an allowable deduction for the cash basis holder in that income year. 6. Withholding Tax 6.1Where withholding tax deductions are with- held by the issuer of the debt, yield to matu- rity calculations are to be made as if the amount withheld was paid - (a)To the person entitled to the credit of withholding tax; and (b)On the day the payment from which the deduction is withheld is made. 3 7.Example 7.1Between coupon payment dates a taxpayer purchases Government stock in the second- ary market. The taxpayer has a 31 March balance date. The example below applies Determination G3. Purchase price:$9,700(A) Redemption value (face value):$10,000(D) Coupon rate: 10% per annum paid semi- annually Purchase date:9 March 1991 Coupon payment dates: 15 April and 15 October Redemption date:15 April 1992 The dealers note shows the interest apportionment as: Vendor$398 Purchaser$102 Payments (for the new holder) 9 March 1991($ 9,700)(A) 15 April 1991 (coupon)$ 500(B1) 15 October 1991 (coupon)$ 500(B2) 15 April 1992 (coupon and redemption)$10,500(B3) 7.2lncome Position for a Cash Basis Holder Year ending 31 March 1991: No interest received or receivable, therefore none assessable. Year ending 31 March 1992: lnterest received or receivable: 15/4/91$ 500(B1) 15/10/91$ 500 (B2) $1,000 Less apportionment of first interest$ 398 payment to vendor Income returned$ 602(C) Year ending 31 March 1993: Cash base price adjustment: a-(b+c) (B1) 500-(A) 9,700+(C) 602 (B2) 500 (B3) 10,500 $11,500-( $9,700+$602) = + $1,198.This is a positive amount and is therefore income derived in the year ending 31 March 1993. 7.3Holders (Other than Cash Basis Holders) The yield to maturity calculation in line with Determination G3 gives the following results: IRR per period.085688 IRR per annum.171377 PeriodDayMonthYearCashflowEnd of PeriodPeriodNo. Days in BalanceInc/Expperiod 0931991(9,700)(9,700) 115419915009,368.51168.5137 2151019915009,671.28802.77183 3154199210,5000828.72183 4 Income Calculation: Allocating period income to income years (31 March balance) on a 365 Day basis in terms of Determination G1.

Losses are an allowable deduction for income tax purposes in terms of section 64F, or section 106(1)(h).
1 APPENDIX E TO TIB NO 9, MARCH 1990 THE TAXATION OF EXCHANGE TRADED OPTIONS CONTRACTS INTRODUCTION This item sets out the Department’s policy on the tax treatment of exchange traded options, and in particular how Determination G7B: New Zealand Futures and Options Markets, Determination G18: International Futures and Option Markets, and Determination G19: Exchange Traded Option Contracts, apply. The policy set out in this item relates to - (a)New Zealand residents; and (b)The fixed establishment in New Zealand of any non-resident. 1.0What is an Option Contract? 1.1An option contract gives the purchaser the right, but not the obligation to buy or to sell something to another party, at a predeter- mined exercise or strike price on a future date. For this right the purchaser of the option will pay a premium, which is quoted on the exchange in points, to the seller/writer of the option. The purchaser of the option may exercise the option (a)At any date during the term of the option (referred to as an “American” option); or (b)Only at a time specified in the contract (referred to as a “European” option). 1.2Option contracts take two basic forms: (i)Call options give the purchaser of the option the right to assume a “long position” in the underlying futures contract i.e., the right to enter into the buy side of the futures contract at a fixed price (Refer to TPC 90/3/1 for explana- tion on futures contracts). (ii)Put options entitle the purchaser to assume a “short position” in the under- lying futures contract i.e., the right to enter into the sell side of the futures contract at a fixed price. 1.3There are two parties to an option contract. The writer of the option is the person who sells the other party rights to exercise an option over a futures contract at a specific exercise price. The other party is the pur- chaser of the option, who pays the premium for the rights under the option. 1.4Options presently traded on the New Zea- land Futures Exchange: -Barclays Share Price Index Option Contract -Five Year Government Stock Option Contract -New Zealand Dollar Option Contract -Three Year Government Stock Option Contract -90 Day Bank Bill Option Contract Approved option contracts traded on over- seas exchanges are scheduled in Determina- tion G18: International Futures and Option Markets (refer TIB No.7 January 1990). 3.0Pre-accruals Taxation Treatment of Option Contracts 3.1 Although the Department has not previously considered the issue it is expected that before the introduction of the accruals regime the taxation treatment of option contracts de- pended on the taxpayer’s extent of trading. The assessability of profits was governed by section 65(2)(a) and (e) of the Income Tax Act 1976. The deductibility of losses was consid- ered under section 104, and 106(1)(a) of the Act. 3.2If the taxpayer was a dealer in traded options profits were assessable as business profits in terms of section 65(2)(a) and (e). Purchases were deductible to the dealer under section 104. Options were valued as trading stock pursuant to section 85 at cost price, market selling value, or replacement price. Therefore unrealised gains or losses could be accounted for at balance date. 3.3If the taxpayer was a hedger, profits were assessable along with other business profits under section 65(2)(a). Losses were deduct- ible under section 104. It should be noted, however, that there is authority to suggest that where an option is hedged on a capital item, any gain or loss on that option was also on capital account. 3.4If the taxpayer was a speculator who entered into a series of option contracts which amounted to an ‘undertaking or scheme’ any profits were assessable under the third limb of section 65(2)(e) of the Act, which includes as assessable income: “... all profits or gains derived from the carrying on or carrying out of any under- 2 taking or scheme entered into or devised for the purpose of making a profit:” If the options were acquired merely for the purpose of resale, profits were assessable under the second limb of section 65(2)(e) which includes as assessable income: “All profits or gains derived from the sale or other disposition of any personal prop- erty or any interest therein ... if the prop- erty was acquired for the purpose of selling or otherwise disposing of it ...” Speculators’ losses were deductible to the extent that there was sufficient nexus be- tween income and the loss (or expenditure), and that had a profit been made that it would have been taxable. Such losses were consid- ered deductible under section 104. Losses of a capital nature were not deductible in terms of section 106(1)(a). 4.0Accruals Treatment of Options Contracts 4.1From 8.30 pm New Zealand Standard Time on the 31st day of July 1986, (the implementa- tion date), options became subject to the accrual tax accounting regime, in particular sections 64B to 64M and the amended sec- tions 106(1)(a) and (h) of the Act. Sections such as 65(2)(e), and 104 have no bearing on the tax treatment of option contracts entered into after the implementation date. Options profits are now assessable under section 65(2)(jb). 4.2A taxpayer who purchases a put option is the holder (as defined in section 64B of the Act) under the financial arrangement, while a taxpayer who purchases a call option is the issuer under that financial arrangement. Conversely a taxpayer who writes a put option is an issuer in respect of that financial arrangement and a taxpayer who writes a call option is the holder in respect of that option. Hedgers, dealers and speculators may either be holders or issuers under an option contract. The following table will assist in determining whether a taxpayer is a holder or an issuer in respect of an option - PURCHASERWRITER PUTHolderIssuer CALLIssuerHolder 4.3Determination G7B: New Zealand Futures and Options Markets, and Determination G18: International Futures and Option Mar- kets (both signed on 4 December 1989), set out the approved markets, sources of infor- mation, and method used for determining prices of option contracts. To ascertain the value of an option at balance date for tax purposes reference must be made to Determi- nation G7B or G18, whichever is relevant. 4.4Determination G19: Exchange Traded Option Contracts (also signed on 4 December 1989), sets out the method to be used to calculate income and expenditure on an exchange traded option contract at balance date, this determination or an alternative method may be used under section 64C(3)(a). Alternative methods may be used if they have regard to the principles of accrual accounting, and (i)Conform with commercially acceptable practice; and (ii)Are adopted by the person and are or will be consistently applied in respect of all such financial arrangements for financial reporting purposes; and (iii)Result in the allocation to each income year of amounts that are not materially different from amounts that would be calculated if the method set out in Determination G19 were adopted. 4.5Where the option contract was entered into before Determination G7B; New Zealand Futures and Options Market, Determination G18: International Futures and Option Mar- kets, or Determination G19: Exchange Traded option Contracts, were signed, Determination G12: Accounting for a Financial Arrangement in the Absence of Determination, will be relevant. 4.6Where Determination G12 does not apply, section 64C(3)(b) requires that the taxpayer use a method that satisfies subparagraphs (i) and (ii) set out in paragraph 4.4 above, and results in the allocation to each income year of an amount that, having regard to the tenor of section 64C(2), is fair and reasonable. This means that the method must have regard to the principles of accrual accounting and, to the extent possible, use the yield to maturity method. A method which reflects Determina- tion G19 will be acceptable to the Commis- sioner in respect of contracts entered into before the date on which Determination G19 was signed. 5.0The Cash Basis Holder 5.1In terms of section 64C(5) a taxpayer who is a cash basis holder does not bring to account 3 any unrealised gains or losses on financial arrangements held at balance date. To be a cash basis holder in terms of section 64D(1) the taxpayer must be a natural person; and (a)The difference between calculating the income in terms c-of section 64C or on a realisation basis must not exceed $15,000; and (b)Either (i)The income derived by the holder, in respect of those financial arrange- ments, must not exceed $50,000; or (ii)The total value of all financial ar- rangements held at any time in the income year must not exceed $400,000: A cash basis holder cannot claim a deduction for any unrealised loss at balance date. 6.0The Holder who is not a Cash Basis Holder 6.1If the holder is not a cash basis holder section 64C applies. Unrealised gains are assessable. Unrealised losses are, in terms of section 64C, “expenditure deemed to be incurred” and will be deductible at balance date if section 106(1)(h) is satisfied. For section 106(1)(h) to be satisfied the expenditure has to be: “(i)... payable in gaining or producing the assessable income for any income year; or (ia)... necessarily payable in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing the assessable income for any income year; or (iii)... payable by one company included in a group of companies in respect of money borrowed to acquire shares in another company included in that group of companies:” 7.0Holders Generally 7.1On the exercise, closing out, or lapse of an option contract a base price adjustment (cash base price adjustment for cash basis holders) is calculated under sections 64F(2) and (3). The base price adjustment takes into account any income derived or expenditure incurred in any previous income year. In relation to a holder, a negative amount resulting from a base price adjustment is an allowable deduc- tion under section 64F(4)(a)(ii). If the tax- payer is a cash basis holder then the expendi- ture is an allowable deduction under section 64F(5)(b). It is not necessary for the holder’s expenditure to satisfy section 106(1)(h) for the holder to claim a loss on the realisation of the option contract. 7.2The reason that a holder’s expenditure is not subject to section 106(1)(h) is that section 106(1)(h) deals with “expenditure deemed to be incurred” under the accruals legislation, whereas sections 64F(4)(a)(ii) and 64F(5)(b) deem the amount calculated as a result of the base price adjustment to be “... an allowable deduction in calculating the assessable income ...”. Therefore the holder’s loss per the base price adjustment or cash base price adjustment is deductible in the income year (or equivalent accounting year) in which the option contract is exercised or lapses. 7.3Where the base price adjustment is a positive amount, sections 64F(4)(a)(i) and 64F(5)(a) deem that amount to be “.... income derived by the holder in the income year”. 8.0The Issuer 8.1Under the accruals rules the issuer has to include in assessable income any unrealised gains at balance date. Any unrealised losses at balance date are deductible if section 106(1)(h) is satisfied. 8.2On the closing out, exercising, or lapsing of an option a base price adjustment is calcu- lated under section 64F to ascertain the income or expenditure. Section 64F(4)(b)(i) states that in relation to an issuer, where the base price adjustment is a positive amount it is deemed to be expenditure incurred by the issuer. Therefore, unlike the holder, on realisation of the option contract it is neces- sary for the issuer’s expenditure, calculated according to section 64F(2), to satisfy section 106(1)(h) for it to be deductible. It is not possible for the issuer in the contract to be a cash basis holder in respect of that contract. 8.3Where the base price adjustment is a negative amount, section 64F(4)(b)(ii) deems that amount to be “... income derived by the issuer in the income year”. 9.0The Dealer 9.1Also known as an arbitrageur, the dealer may be a holder and an issuer in respect of differ- ent contracts. Under the accruals rules the dealer must account for any unrealised gains or losses at balance date where the dealer is the issuer. Profits are assessable under sec- tion 65(2)(jb), (the profits may also fall within 4 the words of section 65(2)(a), but it is clear from section 64L(1) that only the amounts calculated according to section 64B to 64M are to be brought to account for tax purposes, and section 65(2)(jb) explicitly includes such amounts as assessable income). However whether the dealer accounts for the unrealised gains or losses on financial ar- rangements in relation to which the dealer is the holder at balance date, will depend upon whether the dealer is a cash basis holder or not. 9.2If the dealer is not a cash basis holder all unrealised gains or losses on options con- tracts must be taken into account for taxation purposes at balance date. On the closing out, exercise, or lapse, of these contracts a base price adjustment is calculated to determine the amount that is assessable/deductible in the year in which the option is exercised, lapses, or closed out. 10.0The Hedger 10.1The hedger may be a holder or an issuer in respect of different option contracts. As with the dealer, whether the hedger accounts for the unrealised option contracts in which the hedger is the holder at balance date depends on whether the hedger is a cash basis holder. Unrealised contracts in which the hedger is the issuer must be taken into account at balance date. A base price adjustment is calculated on closing out, exercise, or lapse, of the option. Profits are assessable under section 65(2)(jb) and, because the hedger’s expenditure will satisfy section 106(l)(ia), unrealised losses are deductible at balance date for holders (not being cash basis holders) and issuers. Any loss on the closing out, exercise, or lapse, of the option incurred by a hedger who is a holder, and calculated pursuant to section 64F, will be deductible under section 64F(4)(a)(ii), (64F(5)(b) for a cash basis holder). 11.0 The Speculator 11.1The speculator’s unrealised gains on an option contract in respect of which the specu- lator is the issuer, are assessable at balance date in terms of section 64C. However unrealised losses on an option in which the speculator is the issuer, are only deductible if section 106(1)(h) is satisfied. On the exercis- ing, lapsing, or closing out of the option contract a base price adjustment is calculated in terms of section 64F(4)(b). A positive amount is deemed to be expenditure incurred and must satisfy section 106(1)(h) to be deductible. A negative amount is deemed to be income derived and therefore assessable. 11.2If the speculator is a holder (but not a cash basis holder) at balance date all unrealised gains would be assessable, and unrealised losses, subject to the satisfaction of section 106(1)(h), deductible. On the exercise, lapse, or closing out of the option a base price adjustment is calculated and a positive amount is deemed income and a negative amount an allowable deduction. 1.3If the speculator is a cash basis holder only realised profits are assessable income under section 65(2)(jb). On the exercise, lapse, or closing out of the option a cash base price adjustment is calculated and the positive amount is deemed income under section 64F(5)(a). Realised losses are deemed an allowable deductible under section 64F(5)(b). 11.4Section 106(1)(a), which prohibits any deduction for capital losses, has a proviso which ensures that it does not deny a deduction for expenditure deemed to be incurred under sections 64B to 64M. Therefore option losses are not subject to section 106(1)(a) 12.0Base Price Adjustment 12.1As mentioned previously, in the year in which the taxpayer exercises, lapses, or closes out the option, a base price adjustment is calculated in accordance with section 64F. 12.2The base price adjustment is calculated using the following formula: a - (b + c) Where a is: “(i)In the case of a holder, the sum of: (A)The amount of all consideration that has been paid, and all further consid- eration that has or will become payable, to the person; and (B)Any amounts that have been remit- ted by the person and that are not included in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph: 5 (ii)In the case of an issuer, the amount of all consideration that has been paid, and all further consideration that has or will become payable, by the person - in relation to the financial arrangement;” Therefore ‘a’ will be all amounts paid and to be paid to the holder in case of the holder, and it will be all amounts paid and to be paid by the issuer in the case of the issuer. “b is the acquisition price of the financial arrangement in relation to the person;” From paragraph (d) of the definition of core acquisition price in section 64BA(1): “(i)In relation to a holder of the financial arrangement, the value of all considera- tion provided by the holder in relation to the financial arrangement; or (ii)In relation to an issuer of the financial arrangement, the value of all considera- tion provided to the issuer in relation to the financial arrangement.” Therefore ‘b’ will be all amounts of consid- eration paid by the holder in the case of the holder, and ‘b’ will be all amounts of consid- eration paid to the issuer in the case of the issuer. “c is: (i)In the case of a holder, all amounts that are income derived, less the aggregate of amounts of expenditure deemed to be incurred under section 64C or section 64I of this Act or deemed to be an allowable deduction under section 64D of this Act by the person in respect of the financial arrangement in all previous income years since the acquisition of the finan- cial arrangement; and (ii)In the case of an issuer, all amounts of expenditure incurred in respect of the financial arrangement in all previous income years since the issue of the financial arrangement, less the aggre- gate of: (A)All amounts that are income deemed to be derived under section 64C or section 64D or section 64I of this Act by the person in respect of the financial arrangement in all previous income years since the issue of the financial arrangement; and (B)All amounts that are dividends (within the meaning of section 4(1) (ba) of this Act) derived by the person in respect of the financial arrangement.” Therefore ‘c’ will be the amount of income derived less expenditure incurred in all previous income years in the case the holder. In the case of the issuer ‘c’ will be the amount of expenditure incurred less income derived in all previous income years. 13.0An Example Situation: On 10 March 19X9 a taxpayer believes that there will be a fall in interest rates. The taxpayer purchases ten call options on 90 Day Bank Bill Option Contracts at a strike price of 8650, so as to limit the risk. The futures price for a June 19X9 90 Day Bank Bill Contract on that day is 8650. The option premiums for the ten contracts total $4,950. The taxpayer is required to pay an initial margin of $4,000 \[$400 per contract x 10 contracts\]. The taxpayer also pays brokerage and Clearing House fees on purchase totalling $390. Balance Date: The taxpayer has a 31 March bal- ance date. The price of a 90 Day Bank Accepted Bill Futures Contract has fallen reflecting a rise in interest rates to 8600. The value of the premiums, as ascertained in accordance with Determination G7B: New Zealand Futures and Options Market, has fallen to $2,080. Further margin calls have been met by the taxpayer of $870. The cost of closing out the contracts is $390. Income/expenditure for 19X9 income year: Using the formula from Determination G19 - a - b a = $5,340.00 (4,950 + 390) b = $1,690.00 (2,080 - 390) Therefore: $5,340.00 - $1,690.00 = $3,650 deemed to be expenditure incurred in the 19X9 income year. Result: In May 19X9 interest rates fall resulting in the corresponding rise in value of the call options. On 15 May the taxpayer closes out all ten call options for $9,025, reflecting the underlying 90 Day Bank Bill Futures Contracts trading at 8725. 6 Variation margins received since balance date totalled $4,800, while margins paid since balance date were nil. The remaining $3,755, still owing to the taxpayer (after taking into account the initial deposit and margin requirements and commission etc on sale), is credited into the taxpayer’s account held with the broker. Application of base price adjustment: Using: a- (b + c) As the taxpayer is an issuer: a = initial deposit of $4,000 plus brokerage, etc., relating to the purchase of the options $390 plus margin calls paid out of $870. b = margins received of $4,800 plus the $3,755 credited to the taxpayer. c - $3,650 Therefore: $5,260 - ($8,555 + $3,650) - $6,945 deemed to be income derived by the issuer under section 64F(4)(b)(ii) in the l9X0 income year. 14.0The Department’s Policy 14.1Timing For income tax purposes all options must be accounted for at balance date except those contracts in respect of which the taxpayer is a cash basis holder. Options in respect of which the taxpayer is a cash holder are required to be accounted for in the income year in which they lapse or are closed out or exercised. 14.2Assessability and Deductibility The Department considers that a taxpayer’s expenditure on options in relation to which the taxpayer is an issuer, will almost inevitably satisfy section 106(1)(h) and is therefore deductible at balance date. Therefore all gains on an option contract will be treated as assessable income for income tax purposes, and all losses (whether realised or not) will be treated as deductible. The only exception is expected to be where the option contract is entered into for private or domestic purposes.

Taxation position of shareholder on subsequent sale12 2 INTRODUCTION The Department has been asked to clarify the implications under various Inland Revenue Acts of a distribution in specie to shareholders upon the liquidation or dissolution of a company (“distribu- tion in specie”). This statement does not cover the distribution in specie of assets during the life of a company. This statement is written in two parts. The first part sets out the various revenue implications of distri- butions in specie upon the winding-up of a com- pany. The second part sets out in some detail the Commissioner’s interpretation on several leading cases in this area which form the basis to the state- ment. The statement on Goods and Services Tax is issued in substitution of the policy item issued in TIB No.4. The statement is essentially a repeat of the earlier statement. The main difference is that the item now covers the GST implications of an in specie distribution where a debt owed by a third party is taken over by the shareholder to whom the goods have been distributed. PART 1 1.STAMP DUTY 1.1A distribution in specie by a company to its shareholders of land or shares in a flat or office owning company (where section 24 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 (“SD Act”) does not apply) upon a winding-up of that company or upon a dissolution of the company under section 335A of the Companies Act 1955, is exempt from conveyance duty as being an instrument of conveyance by a trustee to a beneficiary - section 17(f) of the SD Act. This only applies if the distribution is in the course of a winding-up or dissolution of a company. 1.2However, if land distributed is of more value than that to which the shareholder is entitled, conveyance duty is payable on the excess value. 1.3Where land is distributed in specie by a com- pany to its shareholders upon a winding up or dissolution of the company, and the sharehold- ers agree to assume liabilities owed by the company to the third parties, conveyance duty is payable on the amount of the liabilities assumed. 1.4By contrast if debts owed to the shareholders to whom the property is to be distributed are not discharged before distribution in specie there are no stamp duty consequences. 2GOODS AND SERVICES TAX 2.1An in specie distribution may be made by a company that is not registered for GST pur- poses (and has never had a liability to be regis- tered) or by a company that is (or was) regis- tered for GST purposes, either before or after its registration is cancelled. Each situation is dealt with below. In each case the Department’s position is that an in specie distribution is a supply of goods for GST purposes and that there is no consideration given by the share- holder in return for the goods. In Specie Distribution by Company After GST Deregistration 2.2Any goods forming part of the assets on hand relating to the company’s taxable activity at the time of deregistration are deemed by section 5(3) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (“GST Act”) to be supplied in the course of the taxable activity. The supply is valued in terms of section 10(8) of the GST Act. The value is deemed to be the lesser of the cost of the goods, including any GST, or their open market value. 2.3Any subsequent supply by the company by way of in specie distribution does not have any GST implications for the company. 2.4Even if the recipient is registered for GST purposes and the goods will be used in that person’s taxable activity the recipient is unable to claim an input tax credit for those goods. The goods have not been acquired from a registered person. Therefore the provisions of paragraph (c) of the definition of “Input tax” in section 2 of the GST ACT must be met if a secondhand goods input tax credit is to be allowed. Under this paragraph input tax includes an amount equal to the tax fraction of the consideration in money for the supply to a registered person of secondhand goods situated in New Zealand. The amendment to this definition in the Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act 1989 requires there to be a supply by way of sale, and an in specie distribution is not a sale unless a debt owed to a third party is taken over by the shareholder to whom the goods have been distributed. Prior to the amendment, the pro- viso to the definition of “Input tax” would have excluded a claim as where the supplier and the recipient are associated persons the considera- tion in money is deemed to be limited to the lesser of the purchase price or the open market value of the supply. In the case of an in specie distribution there would not have been a purchase price (except where a debt owed to a third party was taken over by the shareholder). 3 Therefore the lesser of the two values would be Nil. 2.5Where a debt owed to a third party is taken over by the shareholder to whom the goods are distributed an input tax credit will be able to be claimed to the extent of an amount equal to the tax fraction of the amount of the debt taken over. In Specie Distribution by Company Before GST Deregistration. 2.6The supply from the company to the share- holder is a supply to an associated person (this is a result of the trustee relationship that arises once the company is in liquidation, and the effect of the “associated persons” definition in section 2 of the GST Act). Therefore, if the recipient is not a registered person and the goods are not to be used in the person’s taxable activity, the supply will be valued in terms of section 10(3) of the GST Act, i.e., the supply is valued at the open market value of the goods. This will determine the company’s output tax liability. 2.7 When the supplier and recipient are registered persons and the goods are acquired by the recipient for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies, the provisions of section 10(3A) of the GST Act apply. The supply is valued at the consideration given (section 10(2) of the GST Act). In the case of an in specie distribution the consideration given by the shareholder is Nil so the supply has Nil value. The output tax liability and input tax deduction are Nil. However if a debt owed to a third party is taken over by the shareholder the considera- tion will be the amount of the debt taken over. The tax fraction of the amount of the debt taken over will be the output tax liability and the input tax deduction unless supply is the supply of a taxable activity as a going concern where the supply will be zero rated. As the supply is a taxable supply it cannot come within paragraph (c) of the definition of “Input tax”. In Specie Distribution by Company not Registered for GST (and not any time liable to be registered for GST purposes). 2.8 There are no GST implications for either party. If the recipient is registered for GST purposes, a secondhand goods input tax credit is not available for the reasons stated above at para graph 2.4 (in the absence of the recipient assum- ing liability for a debt owed to a third party where the consequences would be as in para graph 2.5). 3INCOME TAX - DISTRIBUTION IN SPECIE FOLLOWING DEPRECIATION ALLOW- ANCE 3.1Section 117 of the Income Tax Act (the “Act”) provides that, where a taxpayer has been allowed a deduction in respect of the deprecia- tion of any asset and that asset is sold for a price which exceeds the value to which it has been written down following allowance for depreciation, the excess (to the extent of the depreciation “recovered”) is to be included in the assessable income of the taxpayer (subject adjustment if the asset has not been wholly used in the production of assessable income). 3.2Where an asset in respect of which an allowance for depreciation has been claimed is distributed in specie it is deemed to have been sold at and to have realised its market price or if there is no such price a price determined by the Commis- sioner (section 117(5)(b) of the Act). Thus the difference between the written down value of the asset and the lesser of that market price and historical cost will be assessable income to the company. 3.3Section 111 of the Act applies to a shareholder to whom an asset in respect of which deprecia- tion has been allowed is distributed in specie. Section 111(1) provides that no greater deduc- tion shall be allowed to the taxpayer acquiring the asset in respect of depreciation than would have been allowed to the person from whom the asset was acquired except where the pro- viso to section 111(1) applies or where the Commissioner exercises his discretion under section 111(2) of the Act. 3.4Where any amount of depreciation allowed to the company which made the distribution in specie has been dealt with under section 117, the proviso to section 111(1) means that as of right the depreciation base of the shareholder in respect of the asset equals the sum of the depreciated value of the asset and the amounts dealt with under section 117. In most circum- stances the Commissioner will exercise his discretion under section 111(2) and allow depreciation to be based on the market value of the asset as the Commissioner is not entitled to ignore the separate legal personality of a com- pany, except in exceptional circumstances Pioneer Laundry and Drycleaners Ltd v Minister of National Revenue \[1934\] 4 All ER 254, 259. 4INCOME TAX - TRADING STOCK AND LAND SALES 4.1Where the trading stock of a company is distrib- uted to any shareholder upon winding up, the 4 trading stock is deemed to have been sold by the company to the shareholder for: (a)its market price at the date of distribution; or (b)where there is no market price, at a price determined by Commissioner. The proceeds of this deemed sale are included in the company’s assessable income. 4.2For the purpose of calculating the shareholder’s assessable income, a shareholder is deemed to have purchased the trading stock at the market price or price determined by the Commissioner (section 197(2) of the Act). 4.3Where and to the extent to which the market price or price determined by the Commissioner exceeds an amount which is or is equivalent to a return of share capital, such a distribution may be a dividend (section 197(3) of the Act). The consideration for a distribution in specie is nil (where there is no debt taken over by the shareholder). Thus the difference between nil and the market price will be a dividend unless it comes within any of the exemptions in section 4A of the Act. This is discussed more fully in paragraph 8. 4.4For the purposes of section 197, “trading stock” includes any land where: (a)the land falls within the definition of “land” in section 67 (1); and (b)if the land were sold or disposed of, section 67 would apply to any profit or gain. Where there is a distribution in specie of land which satisfies this “trading stock” definition, section 197 will apply and consequences will be as discussed in paragraphs 4.1 - 4.3. 5INCOME TAX - SALE OF LAND WITHIN 10 YEARS OF ACQUISITION 5.2Section 129 of the Act applies where certain land is “sold or otherwise disposed of” by a taxpayer within 10 years from the date of the taxpayer’s acquisition of that land. Where land owned by a company is distributed in specie to a shareholder it is not “sold or otherwise disposed of” by the company. Section 129 is not triggered, therefore, by a distribution in specie upon a winding up or dissolution of a company. . 5.2Where land is distributed in specie to a share- holder the date of the distribution is the “date of acquisition” of the land for the purposes of applying section 129 to the shareholder. 5.3The purchase price of the land, for the purpose of applying section 129 to the shareholder on a subsequent sale if the shareholder has claimed any deductions for interest, for example, is the market value of the land as at the date of distribution. 6ACCRUALS 6.1Where a financial arrangement was acquired by a company for the purpose of sale or where the business of a company comprises dealing in such financial arrangements, and that financial arrangement is distributed in specie to a share- holder for no consideration (which will be the normal case upon a distribution in specie) or a consideration which is less than the market price or true value of the financial arrangement, the financial arrangement is deemed to have been sold for its market price at the date of distribution or, where there is no market price, for a price determined by the Commissioner (section 64J(3) of the Act). 6.2The result of deeming the financial arrangement to have been sold is that the base price adjust- ment must be performed by the company in relation to the financial arrangement. The consideration for which the financial arrange- ment is deemed to have been sold is included in the base price adjustment calculation. 6.3The shareholder is deemed to have acquired the financial arrangement for its market price or for a price determined by the Commissioner and this will be the acquisition price of the financial arrangement in relation to the shareholder. 7INCOME TAX - PROPERTY SALES AND POSITION OF SHAREHOLDER 7.1Section 65(2)(e) of the Act deals with the assess- ability of profits from personal property sales and profits and gains from profit-making schemes. Section 67 and section 65(2)(f) deal with the assessability of profits and gains from land sales. 7.2It is recognised by the Commissioner that profits from the sale of property which has been acquired by a shareholder after a distribution in specie upon the winding-up or dissolution of a company will not, in the vast majority of cases, be acquired for the purpose of selling or other- wise disposing of the property. Nor will there normally be any question of there being a 5 profit-making undertaking or scheme in rela- tion to the property. However, the first limb of section 65(2)(e) could apply as could the provi- sions of section 67(4), apart from sections 67(4)(a), 67(4)(b)(i), 67(4)(ba)(i) and 67(4)(c)(i) which will normally not apply unless the purpose of selling the property distributed was present at the time of purchasing the shares. 7.3For the purposes of section 67 and for the purposes of section 65(2)(e) in relation to a shareholder to whom property has been distrib- uted in specie, the date when that property was acquired is the date of the distribution in specie. 7.4For the purpose of determining the profit or gain under section 65(2)(e) or under section 67 in respect of the subsequent sale or other disposition of distributed property by a share- holder, the market value of the property at the date of the distribution in specie is to be taken as the cost price to the shareholder (except in exceptional circumstances - for example, where shares in a company were acquired with the express purpose of liquidating the company, distributing the property of the company in specie and on selling that property, in which case the cost price of the property would be the purchase price of the shares). 8INCOME TAX - DIVIDENDS 8.1The value of an asset distributed in specie will prima facie be a dividend as the value of any property of the company distributed among all or any of the shareholders, to the extent that the market value of the property exceeds the consideration provided to the company by the shareholder for the distribution, is a dividend (section 4 (1)(c) of the Act). There is normally no consideration provided to the company by the shareholder for a distribution in specie unless the shareholder assumes liability for a debt owed to a third party in which case the consid- eration equals the amount of the debt taken over. There will also be no dividend to the extent that a debt owed by the company to the shareholder is cancelled. 8.2Where an asset is distributed in specie on or after 1 October 1989 this is a “non-cash” divi- dend (section 2 of the Act). A non-cash divi- dend is deemed to be a fringe benefit (section 336N(8) of the Act), except where it comes within subparagraphs (ii) to (vii) of section 327B(2)(b) of the Act - e.g., most intercorporate dividends. Fringe benefit tax is payable in respect of it by the company. Imputation credits will normally not be able to be attached to non- cash dividends as they will generally be divi- dends arising in accordance with paragraphs (b) to (e) and (k) of section 4(1) of the Act. 8.3Where the asset distributed in specie is a capital asset of the company the amount by which the asset’s value exceeds the sum of its cost to the company plus capital losses arising from the realisation of assets will not be a dividend (section 4A(1)(g) of the Act). 8.4The value of an asset distributed in specie will also be excluded from the definition of divi- dend where the distribution comes within one of the other exemptions contained in section 4A such as being a return of capital or a distribu- tion of a capital gain amount as defined. The following is an example of a distribution of a capital gain amount. Section 4A(1)(f) provides that the term dividend does not include a capital gain amount distributed to a share- holder of a company upon the winding up of the company. X Limited with an authorised capital of $100,000 purchased a building to derive rental income. Authorised capital$100,000 Building (cost price)$100,000 Several years later, following an approach from an unrelated party, X Limited realised the building for $500,000. Authorised capital$100,000 Capital reserve$400,000 Cash$ 500,000 X Limited subsequently purchased several assets. Authorised capital$100,000 Capital reserve$400,000 Buildings$200,000 Cars$100,000 Airplane$200,000 X limited went into liquidation and an in specie distribution of the assets was made to the shareholders. The issue for the shareholders is whether the distribution constitutes a dividend. It is considered that in this instance the distri- bution is excluded from the definition of “divi- dend”. 6 The in specie distribution in this case consists of two amounts. •An amount constituting a return of share capital - authorised capital $100,000. •A capital gain amount - capital reserve $400,000. The fact that the capital reserve amount has been transformed from one form of asset (cash) to other assets (buildings, cars, airplane) does not alter the fundamental character of the amount distributed to the shareholders upon the wind-up. The character of the amount distributed remains a capital gain amount. 8.5The practice of the Commissioner will be to treat any distribution in a winding up to be applied first in satisfaction of a return of share capital. Thereafter the liquidator may nominate from which fund the distribution is being made. In the absence of any such nomination each distribution will be treated, after the return of share capital, as having been made pro-rata from the company’s various accounts. PART 2 BACKGROUND A.STAMP DUTY 1.The case of Shaw Savill and Albion Company Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1956\] NZLR 211 (“Shaw Savill”) dealt with the question of stamp duty when property is distributed in specie to a shareholder on the liquidation of a company. The facts of the case are relatively straightfor- ward. The respondent in the case had acquired all the shares in a company in 1947. In 1951 a resolution for the voluntary winding up of the company was passed and a liquidator ap- pointed. The liquidator paid all the debts of the company and the respondent requested the transfer to it of the land owned by the com- pany. A memorandum of transfer to the re- spondent of the land was duly executed. On presentation of the memorandum of transfer the District Commissioner of Stamp Duties ruled that it was assessable with stamp duty. The respondent objected to the assessment and required the Commissioner to state a case. VOLUNTARY WINDING-UP 2.The Court of Appeal held that, once resolution had been passed for a voluntary winding-up of the company and the appointment of a liquida- tor and the liabilities of the company had been discharged, that company stood charged with the obligation of distributing the property of the company among the shareholders according to their rights and interests in the company (see section 293 of the Companies Act 1955). Where the articles or memorandum of association of the company permitted the property of the company to be transferred in specie to the shareholders and those shareholders became entitled to call upon the liquidator to transfer such property in specie, and did call for it, a relationship of trustee and beneficiary arose between the company and the shareholders. 3.Consequently it was held that the conveyance was exempt from stamp duty under the equiva- lent of section 17(f) of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 (“SD Act”) as being a transfer from a trustee to a beneficiary. SECTION 335A COMPANIES ACT - DISSO- LUTION OF SOLVENT COMPANIES 4.The question has arisen whether the situation in relation to stamp duty is any different where companies are dissolved under section 335A of the Companies Act 1955. This section provides an alternative procedure for dissolving solvent companies. In simple terms where a company has ceased to operate and has discharged all its debts and liabilities any officer or member may apply to the Registrar for a declaration of dissolution. 5.The Commissioner is not aware of any case law on this issue. However, it is considered that, in policy terms there should be no difference between a dissolution and a more formal winding-up. The dissolution process was intended only to provide a fast track procedure. Section 335A(6) is in the form of an empower- ing provision rather than a mandatory provi- sion like section 293 (which deals with the winding up a company). Section 335A(6) pro- vides that a company is entitled to distribute its surplus assets among its shareholders according to their respective rights rather than imposing a duty to so distribute. However, although section 293 imposes a statutory duty to distrib- ute, it is not a statutory duty to distribute in specie. The trust relationship arises only where the shareholders have called for a distribution in specie. In a section 335A dissolution the shareholders also have the right to call for distribution in specie. For this reason it is considered that once the shareholders call for the distribution in specie it would be analogous to the section 293 position discussed above. A 7 trust relationship would equally arise. Any distribution in specie, therefore, upon the dissolution of a company is exempt from stamp duty under section 17(f) of the SD Act, as is any distribution under a winding up. LIABILITIES AND DEBTS OWED TO SHAREHOLDERS OR THIRD PARTIES 6.Shaw Savill was a case where all of the liabilities of the company had been met and it was only a matter of distributing the assets to the sole shareholder. The more usual situation is where debts are still owing to shareholders or to third parties. The Supreme Court of Victoria exam- ined such a situation in Comptroller of Stamps (Vic) v Rylaw Pty Ltd (1981) ATC 4411 (“Rylaw”). 7.The following is a summary of the facts in the Rylaw case. A company in liquidation owed a large debt to its shareholders, the debts being owed pro rata in accordance with the number of shares held by each shareholder. All other debts of R Pty Ltd had been paid or provided for out of monies set aside for the purpose, except for a mortgage debt on a piece of land. The shareholders executed an agreement to which they were the only parties and by which they agreed that, as the debts owed to them by the company were in proportion to their share- holdings, the debts were thereby cancelled and that all the parties to the agreement would acknowledge to the company and its liquidator that the debts were cancelled. A second agree- ment was entered into between the sharehold- ers and the company in which the acknowledg- ment was made. This second agreement also requested the liquidator to transfer to the shareholders in specie the mortgaged land. The liquidator executed a transfer by which the company transferred the land to the sharehold- ers subject to the mortgage. The Comptroller of Stamps assessed duty on the first agreement as a deed of gift and assessed stamp duty on the transfer of the land on the basis that it was a conveyance on sale in which the consideration was the amount of the mortgage debt subject to which the land was conveyed. DECISION 8.It was held that the transfer of land by the company to the shareholders was a distribution to the shareholders on the winding up of the company and was not a sale. It was held that the covenant implied under the Transfer of Land Act 1958 (Vic) that each transferee would indemnify the transferor against all liability under the mortgage over the land was not consideration for the transfer and did not transform a distribution in specie by a liquida- tor into a sale. The Comptroller advanced the argument that the agreement that the debts be cancelled was a gift. The Court held that, at the time of the agreement, the shareholders had the right to have the land sold, their debts paid from the proceeds (after payment of the mort- gagee) and to have any balance paid over to them as shareholders. Under the agreement the shareholders had the right to have the land sold and the proceeds paid to them (after payment to the mortgagee) as shareholders or to have the land conveyed to them in specie subject to the mortgage. The position was exactly the same. There was thus no element of gift to the com- pany. APPLICATION 9.The Commissioner considers that the decision in Rylaw applies in New Zealand insofar as it relates to the matter of the cancellation of debts owed to the shareholders. The fact that there were debts owed to shareholders would not require conveyance duty to be paid where the property is distributed to the shareholders. The conveyance still comes within the exemption in section 17(f) of the SD Act. There would be no difference in the Commissioner’s view, if debts owed to shareholders were not explicitly cancelled but the property was merely trans- ferred to the shareholders. 10.The Commissioner considers, however, that Rylaw is not applicable to New Zealand insofar as it relates to the transfer of land subject to a mortgage not being subject to stamp duty. In the Commissioner’s view the taking over a debt owed to a third party does constitute considera- tion for the transfer. In any event, there is no distinction in our present SD Act between a conveyance on sale and any other type of conveyance. Conveyance has a wide meaning and includes any type of transfer or assignment of any property by any means. Under section 10 stamp duty is payable to the Crown in respect of conveyances and leases of land and convey- ances of shares in a flat or office owning com- pany on every instrument issued on or after 17 March 1988 unless the conveyance is specifi- cally exempted. 11.A distribution in specie upon the liquidation of a company is exempt from conveyance duty because of the trustee/beneficiary relationship that arises when the shareholders call for the distribution. However, it is only exempt from stamp duty to the extent that the shareholder is entitled to the property under the trust. 8 12.Under section 293 of the Companies Act 1955 a shareholder is entitled to the distribution of the property of the company only after payment of the liabilities. Consequently the Commissioner considers that a shareholder is only entitled under the trust to the property of the company after payment of the liabilities and not before payment of the liabilities. Thus conveyance duty is payable to the extent of the mortgage taken over. This view is consistent with the cases Morrison v Commissioner of Stamps (1907) 26 NZLR 1009 and Drapery and General Import- ing Company of New Zealand Limited v Minister of Stamp Duties \[1925\] GLR 58. ACCRUALS 13.The Commissioner considers, on the basis of the Rylaw decision, that there would be no prob- lems under the accruals regime in relation to any arrangement whereby such debts are cancelled. The following sets out the basis of this view. 4.A summary of the facts of the Rylaw case are set out in paragraph 7. It was argued that the agreement between the shareholders to dis- charge the debts owed to them by the company and that none of them would make a claim against the company for those debts was a deed of gift. The Court found that in order to be a gift there had to be an element of benefaction to the donee. However in this situation there was no such benefaction because there was an exact equivalence between the company’s obligation to liquidate the land and, upon discharging all of the debts, to pay the balance to the share- holders and simply distributing the land to the shareholders without having to discharge the debts to them. Accordingly this arrangement was not a gift. 15.The accrual issue is whether the agreement between the shareholders to discharge debts owed to them by the company amounts to the remission of the financial arrangement. It is considered that in circumstances analogous to those in the Rylaw case there is no remission. The issuer (the company) has been discharged from making all remaining payments in relation to the debt owed. However that discharge was not “without fully adequate consideration”. The facts of the case establish that the discharge of the debts enabled the company to make the distribution in specie of the mortgaged land. Furthermore it is clear that without the dis- charge the company would not have been able to distribute in specie. The land would need to have been sold in order to satisfy the debts owed to the shareholders. Accordingly the holders (the shareholders) have received adequate consideration from the issuer - the distribution in specie of the mortgaged land. B.CONSIDERATION 1.Underlying much of the discussion in relation to distributions in specie upon the winding up or dissolution of a company is the question of whether there is any consideration by the shareholder for the distribution. The question is a very difficult one and one which has no clear answer. There are at least three lines of author- ity, all decided in different contexts: (i)Consideration provided and received is nil; (ii)Consideration is the purchase price of shares; (iii)Consideration is the market value of the property distributed. The Commissioner considers, however, that these lines of authority can be reconciled. CONSIDERATION PROVIDED AND RECEIVED IS NIL 2.The leading case (Shaw Savill), which holds that a shareholder gives no consideration for a distribution in specie upon a winding up, was discussed earlier in the context of stamp duty. As Shaw Savill is a decision by the New Zealand Court of Appeal the Commissioner is bound by this decision. It is considered relevant in the context of GST, stamp duty, in calculating the amount of income tax payable by a company (where there are no statutory modifications) and in calculating the amount of any dividend received by a shareholder. It is to be noted that, as discussed in the context of stamp duty earlier, where a debt owed to a third party is taken over by a shareholder upon a distribution in specie, the amount of consideration for the above purposes will be the amount of the debt taken over. CONSIDERATION IS THE PURCHASE PRICE OF SHARES 3.This line of authority is one which was arguably favoured by one judge in Archibald Howie Pty Ltd and Others v The Commissioner of Stamp Duties (New South Wales) (1948) 77 CLR 142 (“Archibald Howie”) and by the majority in Steinberg v FCT (1975) 75 ATC 4221 (“Steinberg”) in the special circumstances of that case. The Commissioner considers that taking considera- tion as the purchase price of the shares would apply only in limited circumstances. In particu- 9 lar for the purpose of ascertaining the cost price to a shareholder of property acquired on the distribution in specie upon a winding up of a company in circumstances analogous to those in the Steinberg case - i.e., where the shares of the company were acquired for the express purpose of placing the company in liquidation and on selling the property distributed. CONSIDERATION IS THE MARKET VALUE OF THE PROPERTY DISTRIBUTED 4.This line of authority is relevant in most other circumstances when assessing the cost price to a shareholder of an asset if it is necessary to ascertain the cost price for the purposes of determining any profit or gain made on a subsequent sale by that shareholder. The cost price to the shareholder is normally to be taken as the market value of the property at the date of distribution. It is considered that any other approach would be inconsistent with the under- lying purpose of the Income Tax Act - to tax income. Essentially any other approach would constitute a wealth tax where a taxpayer is taxed on the whole of the value of assets rather than on any changes in value of those assets. It may also lead to double taxation as at least some part of the amount distributed in specie could already have been treated as a dividend. The various lines of authority are now exam- ined in some detail. CONSIDERATION PROVIDED AND RECEIVED IS NIL 5.In the case of Shaw Savill, the issue before the court was whether stamp duty was payable in respect of a distribution in specie or whether the distribution came within the exemption in section 81(d) of the Stamp Duties Act 1923 (now section 17(f) of the SD Act). It has been sug- gested that the Shaw Savill decision is not authority for the proposition that the considera- tion in a distribution in specie is nil. Shortland J., with whom the other two judges of the Court of Appeal agreed, held that section 81(d) ap- plied only to “voluntary conveyances”, defined in section 77 of the legislation as a conveyance of property otherwise than for valuable consid- eration. It was thus essential for the decision of the Court that section 81(d) applied only where the conveyance was otherwise than for valuable consideration. Thus it is implicit in the decision that the shareholder provides and the company receives no consideration upon a distribution in specie. The decision from the New Zealand Court of Appeal is binding on the Commis- sioner and therefore must be followed. 6.There are three circumstances where the In- come Tax Act 1976 (“the Act”) deems the consideration received by a company to be the market value of the property distributed •where trading stock or land which would have been subject to section 67 is distributed (section 197); •where property in respect of which a depre- ciation allowance has been claimed is distributed (section 117(5)(b) of the Act); and •in certain circumstances, where financial arrangements are distributed (section 64J(3) of the Act). Such sections are necessary as without them, no or a lesser consideration would be taken into account by a company. CONSIDERATION IS THE PURCHASE PRICE OF SHARES 7.In the case of Archibald Howie the High Court of Australia had to decide whether, for the pur- poses of stamp duty, transfers to shareholders were transfers made upon a bona fide consid- eration in money or money’s worth not less than the unencumbered value of the property conveyed. In Archibald Howie the company, pursuant to a resolution for a reduction of capital which had been confirmed by the Court, returned capital to holders of paid up shares to the extent of 19/6 per £1 share by distributing in specie at the value in the company’s books certain paid up shares in other companies. The actual value of these shares was considerably greater than the value showing in the company’s books. The Court held unanimously that the considera- tion provided to the shareholders was a consid- eration in money or money’s worth of not less than the unencumbered value of the property conveyed. This decision is a little confusing as the two judges who gave full written judgements differed slightly in their reasoning and the third judge agreed with them both. 8.Dixon J. found two respects in which a share- holder provides adequate consideration in money or money’s worth for a distribution in specie upon a reduction of capital. (1) The first was that the distribution upon reduction of capital was an effectuation of the contract embodied in the articles of the company and a realisation of rights obtained by acquiring shares. The consideration given is the payment up of the share capital in satisfaction of the liability for the amount of the share incurred on 10 allotment (page 153). (2) The second respect in which Dixon J. found adequate consideration in money or money’s worth was the reduction in the value of the shares held by the shareholder upon the reduction of capital (page 154). Thus, the consideration provided would equal the market value of the assets distributed. 9.Williams J. held that the amounts payable to a company upon subscribing for shares or the assumption of liability to pay for the shares provides full consideration of money or assets which the shareholder subsequently receives from the company. This has been taken as meaning (notably by Hutchison J. in Shaw Savill) that the amount of consideration equals the amount of the share capital. The third judge, Rich J, agreed with both Dixon J. and Williams J. 10.All three judges, however, held that the trans- fers to the shareholders were made upon a bona fide consideration of money or money’s worth of not less than the unencumbered value of the property conveyed. It is considered that this means that even Williams J. held that the shareholder had provided an amount equal to the value of the shares distributed. The case of Archibald Howie was examined subsequently by the High Court of Australia in the case Davis Investments Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Stamp Duties (New South Wales) (1957-1958) 100 CLR 392. In that case the majority decided that Archibald Howie was not relevant to the facts before them but none of the judges threw any doubt upon the decision as such. 11.Archibald Howie was distinguished in Shaw Savill on the basis that it was a decision in the context of a reduction of capital rather than a decision in the context of a liquidation of a company. In Shaw Savill Stephen J. and Shortland J. found that, insofar as any consideration was to be found in the original purchase price for the shares the consideration was too remotely connected with the later transfer to allow it to be regarded as consideration for that transfer. Hutchison J. was attracted to the view that the consideration provided was the original share capital, even though in that case the original share capital was not provided by the share- holder who had purchased the shares from the original subscriber, but he was not prepared to dissent on that point. 12. Insofar as the consideration was found in the subsequent transaction itself, all three judges found that the same reasoning and results did not apply in the case of a transfer made in the course of liquidation. Shortland J. also referred to the difficulty of reconciling two English decisions of Wigan Coal & Iron Co. Ltd v Revenue Commissioners \[1945\] 1 ALL ER 392 and the case of Associated British Engineering Ltd v Inland Revenue Commissioners \[1941\] 1 KB 15 which indicates that he may not have come to the same decision as in Archibald Howie even if Shaw Savill had been a case in the context of a reduc- tion of capital. 13. Another case where the cost of shares was held to be relevant is Steinberg. In that case the question was how to measure the profit or gain made by a shareholder upon the selling of land acquired upon the liquidation of a company. It was found as a matter of fact by the majority that the shareholder in question had purchased the shares in order to place the company into liquidation, to acquire the land held by the company and to sell that land . The majority judges Gibbs and Stephen J.J. held that the cost price, for the purpose of calculating the profit or gain, was the original purchase price of the shares. Gibbs J. held that the acquisition of the land was for the purpose of profit making by sale because the shares were bought to enable the purchasers to obtain the land with the main or dominant purpose of selling the land at a profit. Stephen J. did not consider that it was possible to accept such an analysis as the taxpayer bought only shares. In so doing the taxpayer received no land but only those rights to which a shareholder is entitled. He con- cluded, however, that there was a profit making scheme in relation to the purchase and that consequently the difference between the cost price of the shares and the sale price of the land was taxable to the shareholder in question. 14. Both Gibbs J. and Stephen J. however, indicated that in a normal case where the shareholder had not acquired shares with the purpose of liqui- dating the company and selling the assets which had been distributed in specie any cost price to the shareholder would be the market value of the property distributed. Gibbs J. states on page 4,233 that: “It is also true that since the distribution in specie was made in satisfaction of the rights of the shareholders, the “consideration” for the acquisition by the shareholders of the land from the company would be the full value of the land at the time of distribu- tion.” Stephen J. indicated also that it was the distri- bution in specie that would have been relevant had he not held that there was a profit making scheme (page 4,242). Thus, the view of the majority in the Steinberg case was that in normal case the cost to the shareholder will be the value of the asset at the date of distribution. 11 CONSIDERATION IS THE MARKET VALUE OF THE PROPERTY DISTRIBUTED 15.The third line of authority indicates that consid- eration upon distribution in specie is equal to the market value of the assets distributed. This view was favoured by at least one judge in Archibald Howie and by both judges in Steinberg if the requisite intention to liquidate the com- pany and sell the land had not been present in that case. It was also favoured by Menzies J. in the case of Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Williams (1972) 3 ATR 283. (“Williams”). That case dealt with the question of whether a profit realised upon the sale of land acquired by gift was assessable. It was held that it was not. Menzies J. (pp 288-9) stated that it would be only in very special circumstances that land acquired by gift could be regarded as having been acquired by the donee for the purposes of profit by sale. If that was the case, however, he stated it would be the difference between the value of the gift when given and the price received upon sale that would be the profit which was subject to tax. 16.Another relevant case is a decision of the full High Court of Australia in Official Receiver in Bankruptcy (Trustee Estate of William Fox, known as Rankin deceased) v FCT (1956) 96 CLR 370. In that case the deceased had been reclaiming and selling certain low lying land according to a scheme approved by the Council and involving substantial expenditure. He died before the completion of the project and sometime after his death his executors, not having done any work in connection with the project, obtained an order for the administration of his estate in bankruptcy. The Official Receiver was ap- pointed trustee. The creditors authorised the trustee to complete the project and the trustee proceeded with the work and subdivided and sold fully reclaimed allotments of land. The Commissioner of Taxation assessed the trustee for tax calculating that tax on the gross pro- ceeds from the sale of the allotments with deductions for an amount calculated by an apportionment of the deceased’s expenditure over the whole area and for the expenses incurred by the trustee. The trustee’s objection to the assessment was disallowed and he appealed to the High Court. Webb J. submitted certain questions for the Full Court by way of case stated. It was held that the official receiver did carry out a profit making undertaking or scheme but that the basis for assessment was erroneous. The court said (page 384) that the official receiver was not in the same situation as the deceased. It stated: “If he has made a gain or profit in his capacity as trustee of Rankin’s estate by the realisation of the assets that came to his hands, it must be because on a comparison, on the one hand, of the value of the assets and the condition in which they came to his hands when the order for administration of Rankin’s estate in bankruptcy was made with, on the other hand, the net proceeds of sale after the deduction of all expenditure, it appears that owing to his activities there has been a real gain or profit.” Thus the difference between the market value of the land at the time it came into the trustee’s hands and the sale proceeds which was to be brought to tax. 17.The approach taken in these cases is similar to that which seems to prevail where there is a gift of trading stock. The case of Craddock v Zero Finance Co Ltd \[1944\] 1 A11 ER 566 involved a fairly complicated company restructuring. The question was the value at which certain invest- ments should be entered into the books of the company. Counsel for the Crown opened the argument with an analogy whereby he stated that, when a trader who receives by way of legacy an article of a kind in which he deals and brings it into his trading stock, the value at which it must be brought in is its market value, the reason for this being that the article not having been acquired at any cost to the trader, some basis other than cost must be taken and the only possible basis would be that of market value. It was argued that analogy applied to the case before the court. Lord Greene did not confirm the principle as it related to trading stock but stated that the analogy was totally misleading in the context of the case. The trading stock analogy was picked up again by Gibbs J. in Curran v FCT (1974) 5 ATR 61. The question in the case was the cost of certain bonus shares issued to an existing shareholder of a company. The shareholder was a share trader and argued that the cost to him was the paid up value of the shares received. The High Court of Australia upheld the taxpayer’s con- tention. Two of the members of the Court were of the view that the shareholder had paid for the bonus shares by accepting the bonus issue in terms of the company resolution to issue them and thus the shareholder pays for the shares. By accepting the bonus issue the shareholder has agreed to the application to the capital of the company of the amount of the distributable profits so credited to the shareholder, thus effecting payment of the shares. Gibbs J., how- ever, adopted the trading stock approach. He stated (page 82) that the appellant’s trading accounts would not reveal shares which were in 12 fact valuable because the amount they would then show as income would include the value which the shares possessed when they were first brought into stock. He stated that the situation was analogous to that of a trader who takes into trading stock articles received by way of gift or under a bequest. Not allowing the articles to be brought in at market value would mean in effect that the trader would pay income tax on the value of the gift or bequest itself, which would not be the correct result. The approach outlined in these two cases is also consistent with the cases Sharkey v Wernher \[1955\] 3A11 ER and Taylor v Good \[1973\] 2 A11 ER 785. C.TAXATION POSITION OF SHAREHOLDER ON SUBSEQUENT SALE 1.Section 67, section 65(2)(e) and section 129, for example, all require property to be acquired by a taxpayer before they operate. The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary gives two meanings of the word “acquire”. The first is to “gain or get as one’s own (by one’s own exertions or qualities)”. The second is to “receive, to come into possession of”. Wilson J. in the case of A G Healing & Co Ltd v CIR \[1964\] NZLR 222, held that for the purposes of the predecessor to section 65(2)(e) the term ‘acquired’ connotes some positive step by the taxpayer which is absent from the passive receiving of an outright gift. Gibbs J. in Williams (page 291) also threw doubt upon whether a donee who passively receives property the subject of a gift can be said to acquire the property in the sense re- quired for the purposes of the Australian equivalent of section 65(2)(e). However, in McClelland v FC of T (1970) 2 ATR 21 (McClelland) the Privy Council implied that it was possible for land to be acquired through the bounty of the testator but that in the circum- stances of the case, it was not acquired with any purpose which was necessary for the equivalent of section 65(2)(e) to operate. 2.The Commissioner considers that the comments of the Privy Council in McClelland indicate that the meaning of the term “acquire” is not limited to acquisitions by a person’s own exertions but extends to acquisitions where a person has come into possession of the land - for example upon a distribution in specie by a company to its shareholders. 3.Consequently, section 129, section 67 and section 65(2)(e) can apply to shareholders who receive property after a distribution in specie by a company. As discussed earlier, the purchase price or cost price to the shareholder, for the purpose of calculating any profits of gains, is to be taken as equal to the market value of the property at the time of distribution except in exceptional circumstances such as prevailed in Steinberg. The Commissioner recognises, how- ever, that on the authority of McClelland and Williams, the second and third limbs of section 65(2)(e), sections 67(4)(a), 67(4)(b)(i), 67(4)(ba)(i), and 67(4)(c)(i) will normally not apply unless the purpose of selling the property distributed was present at the time of the purchasing of the shares. 13 APPENDICES TO TIB NO. 11, JUNE 1990 APPENDIX A -DISTRIBUTIONS IN SPECIE UPON LIQUIDATION OR DISSOLUTION OF A COMPANY - INCOME TAX, STAMP DUTY AND GST IMPLICATIONS APPENDIX B -EXPLANATION OF INCOME TAX AMENDMENT ACT 1990 AND ESTATE AND GIFT DUTY ACT 1990 APPENDIX C -DETERMINATIONS ISSUED RECENTLY BY THE COMMISSIONER UNDER THE ACCRUALS REGIME APPENDIX D -INCOME TAX (WITHHOLDING PAYMENTS) REGULATIONS 1979 - AMENDMENTS

The amendment applies as from 1 April 1989. 2.LOCAL AUTHORITIES - Sections 4,13 and 15 These sections clarify parts of the Income Tax Act in relation to the tax treatment of local authority trading enterprises, port companies and the transfer of losses incurred by Harbour Boards. Income Tax Position of Local Authority Trading Enterprises and Port Companies Section 2 of the Income Tax Act provides that: “Local authority” means a local authority within the meaning of the Local Government Act 1974 and any Harbour Board, Hospital Board, Education Board, or other incorpo- rated instrument of local government in New Zealand, whether possessing rating powers or not. Local authority trading enterprises and port companies fall within the definition of a “local authority” because they are “incorporated instruments of local government”. Local Authority Trading Enterprises The Local Government Amendment Act (No 2) 1989 allows local authorities to incorporate certain trading activities. A “local authority trading enterprise” is defined in section 594B of the Local Government Act 1974 as follows: “Local authority trading enterprise” - (a)Means - (i)A company in which a local authority holds equity securities that carry 50 percent or more of the voting rights at any general meeting of the company; or (ii)A company in which any combination of local authorities holds equity securi- ties that carry 50 percent or more of the voting rights at any general meeting of the company; or (iii)Any organisation through which a local authority or local authorities operate a trading undertaking with the intention or purpose of making a profit (being an organisation over which the local authority or local authorities have significant control); but (b)Does not include (i)Any airport company within the meaning of the Airport Authorities Act 1966; or (ii)Any port company within the meaning of the Port Companies Act 1988; (iii)Any energy supply operation to which section 197C of the Income Tax Act 1976 applies. Other relevant definitions in section 594B are: “Organisation” means any partnership, trust, arrangement for the sharing of profits, union of interest, co-operation, joint venture, reciprocal concession or other similar ar- rangement; but does not include a company or a committee or joint committee of a local authority. “Significant control” means, in relation to an organisation, (a)Control of 30 percent or more of the votes at any meeting of the members or control- ling body of the organisation; or (b)The right to appoint trustees, directors, or managers (howsoever described) of the organisation, - whether or not jointly with other local au- thorities or persons. Section 35 of the Local Government Amendment Act (No 2) amended section 61(2A) of the Income Tax Act 1976 to provide that income (other than rates) derived by a local authority from a local authority trading enterprise should be excluded from the income tax exemption. 3 Section 4 of the Income Tax Amendment Act t990 provides that income derived by a local authority trading enterprise is also excluded from the exemption. Port Companies The Port Companies Act 1988 requires Harbour Boards to form port companies for the purposes of operating ports. The Act provides for Estab- lishment Units to be set up to, among other things identify and value “port related commer- cial undertakings” and transfer these undertak- ings to the port company. “Port related commercial undertakings” are defined in section 2 of the Port Companies Act as follows: “Port related commercial undertaking”, in relation to any Harbour Board, (a)Means the property and rights of the Harbour Board that - (i)Relate to the activities of commercial ships and other commercial vessels, and commercial hovercraft and com- mercial aircraft, or to the operation of facilities on a commercial basis for ships, vessels, hovercraft, and aircraft of any kind; or (ii)Facilitate the shipping or unshipping of goods or passengers; and (b)Without limiting the generality of para- graph (a) of this definition, includes - (i)The provision by a Harbour Board of any building or facility wherever situated for use in connection with the handling, packing, or unpacking of goods for shipping or unshipping through any port; and (ii)Items such as breakwaters and dredges and other items that, although they may not themselves be revenue pro- ducing and may have a number of purposes or uses, are nevertheless related to the operation of the port on a commercial basis; but (c)Does not include any undertaking that is a statutory function or duty of the Harbour Board relating to safety or good naviga- tion. Most Harbour Boards set up port companies during the 1989 and 1990 income years. There is one exception however. Although port compa- nies have been registered in respect of all New Zealand ports, at one port the port operations have not yet been transferred to that company. The operations are instead being managed by a subcommittee of the Regional Council for the area concerned. Finally, all Harbour Boards were disbanded as at 1 November 1989. Section 4 of the Income Tax Amendment Act 1990 amends section 61(2A) of the Income Tax Act 1976 to exclude from the income tax exemp- tion applying to local authorities, income de- rived by: •A port company, and •A port operator. The reference to a port company is self explana- tory. Port operator is defined in section 15 of the Amendment Act. The definition refers to the situation at the port where operations are being managed by a subcommittee of the Regional Council. The reference to port operator ensures that income derived at that port is treated in exactly the same way as at other ports where port companies are operating. Transfer of Losses from Harbour Boards Initially it was considered that losses incurred by Harbour Boards should be carried forward by the Harbour Board concerned, and should not be allowed to be transferred to the port companies. However with the demise of the Harbour Boards it has been decided that these losses will be able to be transferred to port companies. The rationale for this decision is that effective ownership of the Harbour Boards and port companies are the same, and that if the transfer is not allowed, the benefits of the tax losses would be lost. Section 15 of the Amendment Act provides for the transfer. Losses relating to the transfer of assets from a Harbour Board to the port company or port operator which replaces it, cannot be trans- ferred. The same applies to the transfer of assets from the port operator to the eventual port company. This rule ensures that tax advantages cannot be gained by manipulating values of assets. Section 13 of the Income Tax Amendment Act 1990 provides that the rate of tax applying to income derived by local authorities, where that income is taxable, is 33 cents in the dollar. 4 3.RESIDENT WITHHOLDING TAX- Section 5 The section clarifies the operation of the resident withholding tax regime as it applies to divi- dends paid by building societies to their mem- bers on withdrawable shares. These dividends will be classified as interest for the purposes of resident withholding tax, as the payments are in the nature of interest rather than dividends payable in respect of equity capital held in companies. The amendment takes effect from the com- mencement of the withholding tax regime. 4.PAYE SYSTEM - Sections 6 to 12 These sections provide for two changes to the legislation regarding the payment of twice monthly PAYE deductions. Before the Income Tax Amendment Act 1990, the then legislation, which would have come into effect on 1 May 1990, provided that employ- ers whose PAYE deductions were less than $50,000 in the previous year could continue to pay PAYE and SSCWT deductions once a month. The legislation as now amended pro- vides that in order to qualify for payment once a month the aggregate of PAYE and SSCWT deduc- tions must be less than $50,000. The second change is that, the payment date for PAYE deductions, specified superannuation contributions and overpayments of family support made in the previous month may, where the employer falls below the $50,000 threshold, be deferred from the 5th, to the 20th of the month. 5.FIRST SCHEDULE - Section 13 This section repeals and reinserts clause 9 of the First Schedule to the Income Tax Act 1976. The newly inserted clause 9 differs from the original clause in 2 ways. An obsolete reference to specified trusts from the heading of the clause has been deleted as the distinction between specified and non-specified trusts was removed from the legislation upon the introduction of the current trust regime. The clause further differs in that the wording of the clause has been amended to ensure that income which is assessable to a beneficiary and also assessable to a trustee as agent for the beneficiary is not taxable at the rate of tax applicable to trustees. This amendment is necessary to align the wording of the clause with the other sections of the Act and is to apply from the date on which the trust regime came into effect, being 1 April 1988. 6.TAXATION OF TRUSTS - Section 14 This section amends the application provision of the trust taxation regime to ensure that distribu- tions made from superannuation funds after 1 April 1990 are exempt from income tax in the recipient’s hands. 7.RATES OF INCOME TAX - Sections 16 and 18 These sections confirm that the annual rates of income tax for the year commencing on 1 April 1989 shall be those specified in the First Sched- ule to the principal Act. 8.RATES OF EXCESS RETENTION TAX - Section 17 This section confirms the annual rate of excess retention tax for the year commencing on 1 April 1989 at the rate specified in Clause 11 of Part A of the First Schedule to that Act. PART II - SECTION BY SECTION DISCUSSION OF ESTATE AND GIFT DUTIES AMENDMENT ACT 1990 1.INTERPRETATION - Section 2 Raises the charitable allowance for Estate Duty purposes from $25,000 to $100,000. 2.EXEMPTION FROM GIFT DUTY - Section 3 Section 3 inserts an exemption from gift duty for the transfer of assets made under section 23 and 24 of the Waikato Electricity Authority Act 1988. This amendment ensures that the amalgamation of the Waikato electricity authorities, which is being undertaken in accordance with the Waikato Electricity Authority Act 1988, does not result in those authorities being subject to gift duty.
