Administration Act 1994 give effect to the debt and hardship proposals outlined in the discussion document Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review , released in August 2001. The amendments aim to correct deficiencies in the current rules and to provide guidance to both taxpayers and Inland Revenue on the appropriate treatment of a person in debt. The rules outlined in the bill provide a framework. Inland Revenue is preparing more prescriptive administrative guidelines that will provide the necessary balance needed to ensure that each taxpayer’s circumstances are taken into account. Five submissions on the bill contained comments on the new taxpayer financial relief rules. The submissions were generally very supportive of the new rules, considering that they provide more guidance to taxpayers and Inland Revenue. Officials agree with many of the submissioners’ proposals, including extending the period for taxpayers to respond to requests from Inland Revenue from ten working days to 20 working days, removing the definition of “dependent” from the definition of “serious hardship”, to allow Inland Revenue to determine on a case-by-case basis whether a person is a dependent of the taxpayer, and removing two of the criteria available to the Commissioner to decline to enter an instalment arrangement. Officials have also proposed changes to ensure that the rules work more efficiently. 4 GENERAL Issue: Administration of proposals Submission ( 4W – BusinessNZ ) Better Inland Revenue debt management procedures, combined with better relief from penalty rules for taxpayers that have obviously been complying with tax laws over the years would assist taxpayers before they get into the situation when it is necessary to contact Inland Revenue regarding debt write-offs. Comment Officials agree with the sentiments expressed in the submission. Inland Revenue has recently adopted a compliance strategy which is aimed at increasing flexibility, helping those trying to comply and ensuring that firm action is taken against those who do not. The taxpayer financial relief rules provide a framework for Inland Revenue to consider how best to provide relief for taxpayers in financial difficulties. Administrative guidelines are being prepared and will provide the necessary balance needed to ensure that taxpayers have their specific circumstances taken into account. These guidelines are being prepared in consultation with the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand and various budgetary advisors. A taxpayer’s previous compliance is a factor that is taken into account when imposing penalties. For example, the initial late payment penalty was amended to be imposed in two stages: 1 percent the day after the due date and 4 percent a week later. This amendment is aimed at reducing the penalty on taxpayers whose payment is only a few days late. The submission raises administrative issues that are outside the legislation and therefore officials recommend that the submission be declined. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 5 Issue: Application of the new taxpayer financial relief rules to existing debts Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) On the request of either Inland Revenue or the taxpayer, existing instalment arrangements that would not comply with the new criteria should be able to be brought within the new rules. Comment Recent changes to the Tax Administration Act mean that from 1 April 2002 taxpayers who are a party to an instalment arrangement do not have incremental late payment penalties imposed for any month that the taxpayer has met all of the terms of their instalment arrangement. Therefore there is no benefit for an existing instalment arrangement to be brought automatically within the new rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application of the new rules to existing “parked” debts Clause 78 Submission (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Any debt subjected to “write-off” under the current rules should be automatically deemed to be fully written off pursuant to the new rules. Comment Tax debts that have been written off under the old rules may have been written off for reasons that do not exist under the new rules. For example, under the current rules if a taxpayer is overseas a debt may be written off, whereas under the new rules the debt would continue to accumulate use-of-money interest and late payment penalties. Officials are also concerned that automatically deeming the debts to be fully written off could be seen as unfair by those taxpayers who have got into financial difficulties and repaid their debt. Officials see merit in applying the new rules to debts that have been written off when those debts are reinstated after 1 July 2002. The reinstatement of the “written-off” debt is done manually, and officials consider that when the debt is reinstated Inland Revenue should then consider what, if any, financial relief should be given. 6 Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part in that the new rules apply to reinstated “written off” debts. Issue: Maximising the amount recovered Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The correct approach should be as follows: Income less committed and appropriate expenses, including all current and ongoing tax and liabilities = funds available for repayment of (all) outstanding debt. Decision as to: • write-off, instalment arrangement or suspension for up to (say) three years (or a combination of the latter); or • bankruptcy/liquidation is then based on that data. The focus should then be, as proposed, to maximise the amount collected over time. This analysis will take into account the implications of (for example) business continuity vs liquidation. Comment Broadly, this is what will happen in practice. The legislation will make clear the broad principle, with the administrative guidelines providing detail. Officials consider legislating for issues such as “committed and appropriate expenses” is likely to lead to disputes between taxpayers and Inland Revenue as to what meets this definition. Officials are also concerned that the approach proposed by the Institute does not cover the fact that the taxpayer has assets that can be sold. The only substantive area of difference between the submission and the intention of the legislation is that, under the legislation, the Commissioner’s role is clearly to maximise the collection of the outstanding tax. The submission places greater emphasis on business continuity. Officials still consider that the emphasis should be placed on the Commissioner maximising the collection of outstanding tax. Nevertheless, the rules provide Inland Revenue considerable flexibility. The outcome of early discussion is more likely to be positive, with reduced stress and cost for taxpayers. The need for other approaches to debt recovery and measures of last resort such as bankruptcy, will reduce. 7 Recommendation That the submission be declined but that the submission be considered as part of the administrative guidelines. Issue: Response period Clause 78 Submission (7 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 9W – National Council of Women of New Zealand (Inc.), 12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The legislation should specify: • a response period for Inland Revenue; and • a response period for taxpayers of no less than 20 days. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The bill proposes ten working days for a taxpayer to provide information sought or to respond to a counter-offer. The bill does not impose the same ten days on the Commissioner to respond. Ten days is insufficient time if there are postal delays or the taxpayer needs to communicate or visit their accountant. One month is more appropriate, and the same time limit should be imposed on the Commissioner. (National Council of Women of New Zealand (Inc.)) Inland Revenue should be required within 20 days of receiving a request to advise the taxpayer of the following: • when the request was received; and • who the officer will be who will be handling the request. If Inland Revenue has not responded within 20 working days, use-of-money interest stops (to equate with incentives on the taxpayer). The taxpayer should have a minimum of 20 working days to respond. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Comment The discussion document proposed that when Inland Revenue requests information, or makes a counter-offer, the legislation will provide that the taxpayer should be given at least ten working days, from the date of Inland Revenue’s request or counter-offer, to respond. On reflection, officials agree with submissioners that taxpayers should be given 20 days to respond to requests for information or for responding to counter- offers. 8 In respect of the legislation specifying a response period for Inland Revenue, officials consider that there are already sufficient incentives for Inland Revenue to respond in a timely manner to a taxpayer’s request. Stopping the imposition of use-of-money interest is contrary to the policy underlying the use-of-money interest rules in that the Crown is not being compensated for not having the use of its money. These taxpayers have not met a fundamental tax obligation to pay tax on time. Officials remain of the view that the best way to ensure a timely response from the department is to establish appropriate standards as part of Inland Revenue’s annual reporting process. Officials agree with the Institute’s submission that taxpayers be advised when the request was received and who the officer will be who will be handling the request. We recommend, however, that this proposal be included in the administrative guidelines and that there be no time limit imposed on the Commissioner for providing this information. Recommendation That: • the submission be accepted to the extent that the response period for taxpayers be extended to 20 days; and • the administrative guidelines require the Commissioner to respond to taxpayer requests as quickly as possible, but that this be achieved through reporting requirements. Issue: Information provided by the taxpayer outside the timeframe allowed for in section 177(3) Clause 78 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The legislation should provide specific rules to clarify how the legislation will apply in cases where the information requested by Inland Revenue is provided outside the response period provided for in section 177(3). Comment Section 177(3) of the bill provides that the taxpayer has ten working days, or a longer period allowed by Inland Revenue, to provide the information sought by Inland Revenue or to respond to a counter-offer. As noted previously, officials recommend that this time period be extended to 20 working days. Inland Revenue has a discretion to allow the taxpayer further time to respond. If taxpayers were unable to respond because of circumstances beyond their control, that discretion would be exercised. 9 If the delay was the result of taxpayers inaction the legislation does not provide clear rules as to what should happen. Officials recommend that the legislation provide that if the taxpayer responds after the expiry of the response period provision of the required information should be treated as a new request for an instalment arrangement. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Definition of “outstanding tax” Clause 61 Submission (Matter raised by officials) A definition of “outstanding tax” should be inserted. Comment The taxpayer financial relief rules apply to “outstanding tax”. It has been suggested by the people working on the administrative guidelines that for tax to be outstanding then the due date for the payment of the tax must have passed. However, the legislation refers to taxpayers contacting Inland Revenue seeking financial relief before the due date. It was always intended that the provisions apply to amounts owing to Inland Revenue before or after the due date, and that the amount can include core tax (except child support or student loans), interest or civil penalties. Officials recommend that, in order to remove any doubt, a definition of “outstanding tax” be inserted. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 10 SERIOUS HARDSHIP Issue: Legal entities and hardship Submission (7 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Criteria should be introduced that allow Inland Revenue to consider the financial impact of debt collection on a company in determining whether to enter into an instalment arrangement. Comment Officials disagree with the submission. The role of Inland Revenue should simply be that of maximising the amount of debt recovered as this maximises the efficiency and equity of the tax system. Not collecting debt from taxpayers who threaten bankruptcy or liquidation as a consequence of recovery action is equivalent to providing a tax subsidy. Officials note that, under the proposals, consideration of serious hardship is considered in relation to principal shareholders. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Look-through Clause 78 Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) On application by the taxpayer, Inland Revenue should be obliged to look through to the effect on all shareholders. Comment Officials disagree that Inland Revenue should be obliged to look through to the effect on all shareholders. This would be administratively unfeasible and also raises the issue that debt recovery from a company may cease simply because of the impact of that recovery on one shareholder. For example, if a shareholder has invested his or her life savings in a public company, the tax recovery, in this case, should not be influenced by the impact of the recovery on that one taxpayer. 11 During consultation with the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, officials were asked to consider whether the provision could be extended to apply also to shareholder-employees. We agree with the Institute that extending the look- through rule to shareholder-employees has merit. This type of taxpayer typically works for the company and reinvests any earnings in the company. The definition of “shareholder-employee” in the Income Tax Act refers to “close company”. There are basically two definitions of “close company”: the first refers to a company which has five or fewer natural persons whose voting interests or market value interests exceed 50 percent, and the second refers to a company with 25 or fewer shareholders. Officials consider that the look-through rule should apply to shareholder-employees of close companies that fall within the first part of the definition. We are concerned that if the rule also applied to companies of 25 or fewer shareholders then the rule could be open to manipulation. That is, if any one of the 25 shareholders faced serious hardship because Inland Revenue was collecting a tax debt from the company then the tax debt may end up being written off. Recommendation That the submission be accepted but limited to shareholder-employees of close companies where the close company has five or fewer natural persons whose voting interests or market value interests exceed 50 percent. Issue: Drafting of section 177A(1)(b) Clause 78 Submission (7 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Section 177A(1)(b) is not well worded. The exclusion should reflect that the taxpayer should not put their tax debt last, then decide that they in a difficult position and look to the Inland Revenue Department for help. Comment The proposal in the submission is harsher than the current wording in the bill. For example, a taxpayer owes Inland Revenue money and also has other debts some of which relate to basic community standards, say, a fridge on hire purchase. If the legislation provided that serious hardship did not include “financial difficulties that arise solely because the taxpayer is obligated to pay tax” then the taxpayer’s obligations under the hire purchase agreement would not be taken into account, which may result in the fridge being repossessed. During the hearing of evidence concern was also expressed in relation to business debts, in that taxpayers may pay suppliers ahead of Inland Revenue in order to maintain their business. Officials acknowledge that this does happen but note that this submission relates to the definition of serious hardship, which applies to natural 12 persons and at the Commissioner’s discretion to principal shareholders. To determine whether taxpayers are facing serious hardship, their total financial position should be considered and each taxpayer considered on a case-by-case basis. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Definition of “serious hardship” and expensive education Submission (9W – National Council of Women of New Zealand (Inc.)) An additional circumstance should be included where the provision of expensive education for the taxpayer or their dependents should not be a consideration when determining if serious financial difficulties would arise if tax liabilities were met. Comment Officials consider that expensive education would be excluded under paragraph (b)(iv) of the “serious hardship” definition, which states “the taxpayer is unable to afford goods or services that are expensive or of a high quality or standard according to normal community standards”. The definition of “serious hardship” gives the Commissioner flexibility to consider the specific circumstances of the taxpayer. For example, if the taxpayer had a child who is hearing impaired and who required special schooling then the cost of that schooling would be considered appropriate under the definition. The administrative guidelines will provide more guidance on this issue. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Definition of “serious hardship” Clause 78 Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Child support and other non-discretionary obligations should be taken into account in determining resources available to repay debt. 13 The effect on a family (as opposed to just the taxpayer) should be explicitly considered. It will be difficult to define and measure “normal community standards”. Consistency committees should be set up to review Inland Revenue’s decisions. Comment In practice, the administrative guidelines will consider “child support and other non- discretionary obligations” in determining the resources available to repay debt. In relation to the submission that the effect on the family as opposed to just the taxpayer should be considered, the definition of “serious hardship” generally applies to the “taxpayer or their dependent”. “Dependent” has been defined in section 177A(2) as being “a person within one degree of relationship”. Officials are concerned that this definition may be too narrow and recommend that the definition be repealed and that whether a person is a taxpayer’s dependent be determined on a case-by-case basis. In relation to defining and measuring “normal community standards”, the legislation provides a framework for Inland Revenue to consider how best to provide relief for taxpayers in financial difficulties. Administrative guidelines are being proposed, which will provide the necessary balance needed to ensure specific circumstances are taken into account. Inland Revenue will set up consistency committees. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part in that the definition of “dependent” in section 177A(2) be removed. Issue: Serious hardship applies only to natural persons Clause 78 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The legislation should be clarified to make it clear that only natural persons can suffer serious hardship. Comment As the legislation is currently drafted, it could be argued that legal entities, for example companies, partnerships or trusts, could suffer serious hardship. This was never the intention of the legislation. Legal entities cannot suffer hardship. Officials 14 recommend that the legislation be clarified to provide that only natural persons can suffer serious hardship. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 15 INSTALMENT ARRANGEMENTS Issue: Criteria for declining to enter an instalment arrangement Clause 78 Submission (7 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 9W – National Council of Women of New Zealand (Inc.), 12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Inland Revenue should not be able to decline requests to enter an instalment arrangement if either: • the taxpayer is requesting an instalment arrangement to stop the Commissioner taking action to recover tax; or • the taxpayer has previously made a request to enter into an instalment arrangement and the request has been declined. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) While requests for instalment arrangements should not be used as a device in reducing penalties, taxpayers should not be limited to only one application for an instalment arrangement. Personal circumstances often change and it is reasonable for taxpayers to be able to request instalment arrangements on more than one occasion. It may be that a time period (say, within six months) be inserted if the Committee is concerned that this clause will be abused. (National Council of Women of New Zealand (Inc.)) As the purpose is impossible to determine and being declined or not complying in the past is irrelevant, the following three criteria should be removed: • the purpose of the request for an instalment arrangement is simply to stop recovery action; • the taxpayer has not complied with a previous instalment arrangement; and • the taxpayer has previously made a request to enter an instalment arrangement and the request has been declined. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Comment Section 177B(2) sets out the circumstances where the Commissioner may decline to enter an instalment arrangement. The fourth criterion is where “the taxpayer is requesting an instalment arrangement to stop the Commissioner taking action to recover the outstanding tax”. The discussion document Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review proposed that when taxpayers contacted Inland Revenue seeking financial relief then Inland Revenue would “suspend any late payment penalties and recovery action currently underway”. In drafting the legislation officials overlooked the recommendation to suspend recovery action. On reflection, officials consider that any recovery action underway should continue. The administrative and compliance costs of suspending 16 the action would be great, and would outweigh any benefit of suspending the action. As recovery action will not be suspended a taxpayer could not request an instalment arrangement in order that recovery action be suspended. Officials therefore agree with submissioners that this criterion should be removed. In relation to the fifth criterion that “the taxpayer has not complied with a previous instalment arrangement”, officials disagree with submissioners. We consider that previous non-compliance is a good indicator as to whether a taxpayer will comply. We also note that all of the criteria for declining to enter an instalment arrangement are discretionary. If, for example, the taxpayer had not complied with a previous arrangement and that non-compliance was some time ago and the taxpayer had complied with all of their other tax obligations, Inland Revenue would probably enter an instalment arrangement. The administrative guidelines will provide more guidance on this issue. The Institute of Chartered Accountants also recommended that the sixth criterion where “the taxpayer has previously made a request to enter an instalment arrangement and the request has been declined” be removed. Officials agree with the submissioner. Officials were concerned that taxpayers who had their requests for an instalment arrangement declined could repeatedly request an instalment arrangement in relation to the same debt. Officials consider that if the taxpayer asks for an instalment arrangement in relation to the same debt and the taxpayer’s circumstances have not materially changed then the reason given for declining the arrangement the first time will remain relevant and the arrangement can be declined for that reason. In relation to the submission from the National Council of Woman that taxpayers not be limited to only one application for an instalment arrangement, officials agree. If the taxpayer requests relief, it is not granted, the taxpayer’s circumstances worsen and another request is made for relief, relief may be granted. As noted above, all of the criteria are discretionary, allowing the taxpayer’s specific circumstances to be taken into account. It was never intended that the taxpayer could be a party only to one instalment arrangement at a time. If the taxpayer had a tax debt and entered an arrangement, and then got into difficulties in relation to a new tax debt the taxpayer could request financial relief in relation to that second debt. That relief could be in the form of write-off, or the taxpayer may have their first arrangement varied to include the second debt or the taxpayer and Inland Revenue could enter a second arrangement. As with all of the taxpayer financial relief rules, the outcome will be determined on a case-by-case basis taking the circumstances of the taxpayer into account. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part in that paragraphs (d) and (f) of section 177B(2) be removed. 17 Issue: Renegotiation of instalment arrangements Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The Institute agrees with the renegotiation of instalment arrangement proposals, except for Inland Revenue’s proposed power to decline an instalment arrangement when a previous arrangement has not been adhered to. Comment Officials disagree with this submission. If the taxpayer has a past history of non- compliance, officials consider that such behaviour could indicate that the taxpayer would not comply with the requested arrangement. The power to decline to enter an instalment arrangement is a discretion that allows the taxpayer’s specific circumstances to be taken into account. For example, if the taxpayer’s circumstances worsen, the taxpayer misses a few instalments and the taxpayer then requests that the arrangement be renegotiated, a new arrangement may be entered into. On the other hand, if the taxpayer did not notify Inland Revenue for a year, say, renegotiation of the arrangement might be declined on the basis that the previous arrangement was not complied with. As noted previously, administrative guidelines will be issued on this matter and will be publicly consulted on. Recommendation That the submission be declined and that Inland Revenue continue to look at the taxpayer’s past compliance when determining whether to enter an instalment arrangement or not. Issue: Use-of-money interest Submission (7 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) During the course of an instalment arrangement either: • no use-of-money interest; or • a reduced level of use-of-money interest, equivalent to the secured mortgage lending rate should apply to the debt. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) 18 The legislation should be amended so that no interest will apply. Imposing use-of- money interest does not assist the recovery of more tax. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Comment Use-of-money interest compensates the recipient for not having the use of their money. Rather than not charging use-of-money interest during the term of an instalment arrangement, officials consider that a better approach, with very likely the same outcome, is for Inland Revenue to determine the amount the taxpayer can afford to repay, including use-of-money interest, and write off the balance. Charging use-of- money interest provides taxpayers with an incentive to repay their debt as soon as possible. This is specifically important in cases where a taxpayer’s circumstances change. It also enables taxpayers to see the consequences of delaying payment – the interest they are incurring for not paying their tax on time. Not charging use-of-money interest during the term of an instalment arrangement or charging interest at a lower rate would encourage all taxpayers to contact Inland Revenue stating that they cannot pay their debts on the due date and requesting to enter instalment arrangements instead. The norm would become one of requesting an instalment arrangement in the hope that use-of-money interest and penalties will not apply. In addition, not charging use-of-money interest undermines the policy underlying the use-of-money interest rules, that is, that the Crown is not being compensated for not having the use of its money. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Taxpayers defaulting on instalment arrangements Clause 78 Submission (Matter raised by officials) If taxpayers default on instalment arrangements Inland Revenue may cancel the instalment arrangement. Comment If taxpayers do not comply with their repayment obligations under instalment arrangements, late payment penalties will be imposed. Officials are concerned that taxpayers may enter instalment arrangements and not comply with their obligations, and because the legislation does not allow Inland Revenue to renegotiate 19 arrangements for a two-year period, the department has entered an arrangement that cannot be overturned. Officials therefore recommend that if a taxpayer is not adhering to the arrangement Inland Revenue should have the power to cancel the arrangement and take the necessary action to recover the outstanding debt. The administrative guidelines will set out how this proposal will work in practice. This provision is in no way aimed at providing Inland Revenue with the opportunity to renegotiate instalment arrangements within the two-year time period. It is designed to ensure that where a taxpayer is not adhering to an arrangement, action can be taken to recover the outstanding tax. If a taxpayer’s financial situation worsens, the taxpayer always has the option of renegotiating their arrangement with Inland Revenue. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Bankruptcy/liquidation of taxpayers who are party to an instalment arrangement Clause 78 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The legislation should state that if a taxpayer who is a party to an instalment arrangement is bankrupted or liquidated, the amount outstanding under the arrangement and any other amounts outstanding are included in the department’s proof of debt. Comment Officials consider that the legislation should clearly state that if the taxpayer is bankrupted or liquidated then any proof of debt should be for the entire amount owing to Inland Revenue, including any amount subject to an instalment arrangement. Officials are concerned that if an amount is subject to an instalment arrangement and the taxpayer is complying with the arrangement there may be an opportunity for the amount owing under the arrangement to be omitted form the proof of debt. This was never the intention of the legislation and officials recommend that the legislation be clarified to ensure that the proof of debt is for the entire amount owing. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 20 WRITE-OFF Issue: Rate for extinguishing tax losses Submission ( 9W – National Council of Women of New Zealand (Inc) ) In subclause (4) the extinguishing of a taxpayer’s net loss should be at the taxpayer’s marginal tax rate, not 33 percent. If the taxpayer were to use the tax loss against current taxable income it would start at 19.5 percent, not 33 percent. The use of tax losses against outstanding tax is advantageous to taxpayers not just for financial reasons but for physiological \[sic\] reasons in that it lessens the financial pressure felt by owing Inland Revenue, which can be greater than owing other people. Comment The point being made is understandable. However, we have opted to use a simple rate which will generally either be accurate or taxpayer-friendly. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Section 177C(4) Clause 78 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The drafting in section 177C(4) is not clear. Comment Officials consider that the drafting in section 177C(4) is unclear. The section does not set out clearly that the amount the taxpayer’s net loss should be reduced by is the amount of the outstanding tax written off, divided by 33 percent. We recommend that the bill be amended to make this clear. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 21 Issue: Section 177C(6) Clause 78 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 177C(6) should apply to both bankruptcies and liquidations, and the section should apply regardless of who took the action to bankrupt or liquidate the taxpayer. Comment Under the new section 177C(6), Inland Revenue will be able to reinstate a written-off debt if within a year of the debt being written off the taxpayer becomes bankrupt. This section is in response to a submission received on the discussion document Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review . The submissioner was concerned that the taxpayer’s other creditors could encourage the taxpayer to have an amount owing to Inland Revenue written off so that when the taxpayer is subsequently bankrupted the dividend paid to those other creditors is greater. On reflection, officials are concerned that such a scenario could also occur when a taxpayer is liquidated. Officials therefore recommend that the section be amended to apply also to liquidations. As drafted, the reversal of the write-off occurs only if the taxpayer declares bankruptcy. Officials consider that the write-off should be reversed if the taxpayer or any creditor takes bankruptcy action. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Abusive tax position and evasion Clause 78 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 177C(3) should refer to shortfall penalties for abusive tax position or evasion or similar act, and it should be made clear that that amount that cannot be written off includes the shortfall penalty. Comment Under the new section 177C(3), Inland Revenue cannot write off outstanding tax if the taxpayer was liable to pay in relation to the outstanding tax a shortfall penalty for an abusive tax position or evasion or similar act. This section is aimed at ensuring 22 those taxpayers who take such tax positions face the entire consequences of their actions. However, the taxpayer financial relief rules restate the definition of “abusive tax position”. As the shortfall penalty is imposed under sections 141D or 141E, officials consider that there is no need to restate the definition. As the section is currently drafted, it could be argued that the amount that cannot be written off excludes the shortfall penalty itself. To remove any doubt, officials consider that the section be clarified to ensure that the amount that cannot be written off includes the shortfall penalty. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Imposition of penalties when an amount written off is reinstated because false or misleading information was provided Clause 78 Submission (Matter raised by officials) If an instalment arrangement is cancelled because Inland Revenue entered the arrangement based on false or misleading information provided by the taxpayer, any late payment penalties not imposed should be imposed when the arrangement is cancelled. Comment Under the new section 177B(6), Inland Revenue will be able to cancel an instalment arrangement if Inland Revenue entered the arrangement based on false or misleading information provided by the taxpayer. Officials consider that as Inland Revenue would not have entered the arrangement had the false or misleading information not be provided, those late payment penalties that were suspended because the taxpayer was a party to an instalment arrangement should be imposed when the arrangement is cancelled. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 23 Issue: Remove cross-reference to section 176(2) in section 177C(1) Clause 78 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 177C(1) should be amended to allow write-off of debt in cases other than serious hardship and inefficient use of Inland Revenue’s resources. Comment The taxpayer financial relief rules make it clear that the Commissioner’s role is to maximise the amount of debt recovered. In order to fulfil this role, Inland Revenue should be given the discretion to write off amounts when the amount cannot be collected, and not just when the taxpayer faces serious hardship or it is an inefficient use of the Commissioner’s resources. Officials therefore recommend that the reference to section 176(2) in section 177C(1) be removed Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Reinstatement of amounts that should not have been written off Clause 78 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The legislation should provide that if an amount is written off under section 177C(2) it can be reinstated if a further dividend or distribution is made. Comment Section 177C(2) provides that the Commissioner must write off outstanding tax that cannot be recovered if the taxpayer is made bankrupt or liquidated or the taxpayer’s estate has been distributed. The legislation does not provide rules for reinstating the amount written off when a previously unknown asset is identified later. For example, after a taxpayer’s estate has been distributed a bank account is identified as the taxpayer’s, officials consider that the amount written off should be reversed to the extent of the department’s share in the newly identified asset. We are concerned that because the debt has been written off, Inland Revenue would not be in a position to claim any portion of the newly identified asset. 24 Officials recommend that an amendment be made to ensure that if a new asset is identified after an amount has been written off that the amount written off may be reversed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Imposition of the 4 percent initial late payment penalty Clause 75 Submission (Matter raised by officials) If a taxpayer enters an instalment arrangement on or after 1 April 2002 and then defaults on the arrangement the 4 percent late payment penalty should not be imposed. Comment The late payment penalty legislation was recently amended to impose the initial late payment penalty in two stages. One of the changes made at the same time relates to the imposition of late payment penalties when the taxpayer enters an instalment arrangement. From 1 April 2002, if a taxpayer enters an arrangement before the due date the 1 percent initial late payment penalty is imposed. If the taxpayer defaults on the arrangement, the 4 percent late payment penalty is imposed at the time of the default. Under the taxpayer financial relief rules, if a taxpayer enters an arrangement before the due date the 1 percent initial late payment penalty is imposed, but if the taxpayer defaults the 4 percent initial late payment penalty is not imposed. Officials consider that the provisions should be consistent. We recommend that the legislation be amended so that from 1 April 2002 the 4 percent initial late payment penalty is not imposed if the taxpayer defaults on the arrangement. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Transfers of excess tax 27 OVERVIEW OF SUBMISSIONS Clause 77 of the bill inserts into the Tax Administration Act 1994 a comprehensive set of rules governing the transfer of tax that has been overpaid. The general principle underlying the transfer rules is that a taxpayer who has overpaid tax is entitled to a refund. In some cases, the taxpayer might ask Inland Revenue to transfer that overpayment to another period or type of tax of the same taxpayer, or to another taxpayer, rather than issue a refund cheque. The proposed new rules authorise Inland Revenue to do this. The rules therefore allow excess tax to be transferred to any other taxpayer as at a date that is a proxy for the date on which the tax would be refunded. The proxy is the later of the date after the return is filed and the date of the transfer request. This recognises that, once the return is filed, the taxpayer has no control over the length of time it takes to process the return. The new rules also allow transfers to a limited category of taxpayers to be effective at the date the tax is overpaid. Such transfers are allowed when the transfer is made: • to another period or tax type of that taxpayer; • between taxpayers who are, or consider themselves to be, one economic entity; and • between taxpayers who share an income stream where the income is allocated after the end of an income year. Six submissions have been received on the proposals (from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG, the Whyte Group, Business New Zealand and the Retail Association). All submissions welcome the proposed new rules. They are seen as providing certainty where the existing rules are not clear and have been inconsistently applied. They are also in many respects more generous than existing rules. There are two key issues arising out of submissions – the effective date of transfer, and the application date of the new rules. Effective date of transfer The effective date of transfer is a critical issue because of the differential use-of- money interest rates. Credit use-of-money interest on overpayments of tax is currently 4.83%, while the rate for underpayments is 11.93%. We have reported to you separately on how these rates are calculated. 28 The ability to transfer excess tax as at the date of overpayment enables the transferor to forgo any credit use-of-money interest that would otherwise be payable on the overpayment in order to relieve the transferee of late payment penalties and a higher rate of interest on an underpayment. As long as the right amount of tax has in aggregate been paid, the transfer can be arranged so that there is no interest or late payment penalty charged. As noted earlier, tax that is transferred to the same taxpayer or between certain associates may be transferred as at the date of overpayment. These transfers are referred to in submissions and this report as “backdated” transfers – that is, the transfer can be backdated to the date of overpayment of the tax. If, in aggregate, the same taxpayer or two associates pay the correct amount of tax, there are no late payment penalties or use-of-money interest. One submission argues for all transfers to be backdatable, while most argue for some extension of the list of taxpayers who may backdate a transfer to the date of overpayment. Application date of the new rules Broadly, the new rules apply to tax that is overpaid in the 2002-2003 year, and tax overpaid in earlier years that is assessed after enactment of the proposed legislation. The Institute of Chartered Accountants strongly recommends retrospective application of the new rules. 29 APPLICATION DATE Clause 77(2) Submission (12, 12B and 12C – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The new rules relating to transfers of overpaid tax must have retrospective application. This is because taxpayers should not be paying use-of-money interest at a high rate on underpayments of tax while simultaneously they (or an associate) are receiving use-of-money interest at a lower rate on overpayments of tax. The bill removes that problem prospectively for taxpayers associated as set out in the bill, but for credits arising before the 2002-03 year the problem remains. In particular, in relation to transfers requested from 21 April 2001 until the application date of the new legislation, taxpayers are disadvantaged, being charged simultaneous debit and credit interest from payment date until the first day of the next income year. Instead of the proposals applying from the date of enactment, the proposals should be applied to: • transfer requests documented in writing before 21 April 2001; and • transfers of tax credits arising in statements issued after 21 February 2001. These application dates are the same as those applying to an amendment made to the transfer rules last year. Comment Broadly, the new rules apply to tax paid in the 2002-2003 year and to excess tax arising on assessments made after enactment. One feature of the new rules that is welcomed by taxpayers is that provisional tax that is overpaid can be transferred as at provisional tax dates (instead of the first day of the next income year). The essence of the Institute’s submission is that it wants transfers at provisional tax dates to apply retrospectively because it ensures that a taxpayer will not be receiving use-of-money interest on overpaid provisional tax at a low rate while it or an associate is paying use-of-money interest at a higher rate on underpayments of provisional tax or another tax type. Under Inland Revenue guidelines issued in 1994, excess provisional tax can be transferred no earlier than the date after balance date, once tax has been assessed for the year. The Institute argues that before 1998, this was not enforced so taxpayers in practice could transfer at provisional tax dates. It also argues that, in developing administrative guidelines in relation to an amendment to the transfer provisions last year, the department has allowed such transfers if taxpayers had requested them before 21 April 2001. The Institute is therefore mostly concerned about the inability to transfer at provisional tax dates between 21 April 2001 and the date of enactment of the proposed legislation. 30 Officials’ response Officials strongly oppose the retrospective application of the new rules. Legislation should have retrospective application only in exceptional circumstances, and we do not consider that it is warranted in this case. First, while we agree that there is considerable uncertainty about aspects of the existing rules, and inconsistent application of them, it is clear in the guidelines that transfers of provisional tax may only be made on the day after balance date once tax is assessed. It may well be true that some taxpayers have obtained transfers at provisional tax dates in contravention of the guidelines, but Inland Revenue’s administrative policy is clear in this respect. We consider that, as current policy is clear in relation to transfers of provisional tax, retrospective application to permit taxpayers to transfer provisional tax at an earlier date is wrong in principle. Inland Revenue does not agree that it has administratively authorised transfers at provisional tax dates if requests are made in writing before 21 April 2001. If this were the case there would be no need for retrospective application to apply to these cases, as the Institute proposes. Secondly, retrospective application would involve high administrative and compliance costs and add to the confusion over the existing rules. Under the Institute’s proposal, for example, transfers requested in writing as far back as 1994 would be dealt with under rules that have not yet been decided. Previous transfers would need to be unwound, use-of-money interest and late payment penalties adjusted, and amounts refunded. To action such requests represents an inefficient use of Inland Revenue’s resources. Thirdly, the effective date of transfer under the proposed new rules may be later than the date on which the transfer was made under existing practice. For example, under the new rules, the transfer of an excess to a taxpayer that is not included in the list of close associates is effective at the later of the day after filing the return and the day of the request. Under the current rules, taxpayers may have had the excess transferred earlier than this. For example, a transfer between unrelated taxpayers, or taxpayers not included in the list of close associates, may have been made at the day after balance date under the existing rules. In that case, retrospective application of the new rules would disadvantage the taxpayer. The Institute has argued for the new rules to be applied retrospectively in the same way as the amendment last year to the transfer rules. That amendment ensured that transfers of excess tax could be made to a period in which there was no outstanding liability for tax. This was a minimal amendment intended to create some certainty in relation to one aspect of the rules that had been particularly problematical. It was much more limited in scope, and was deliberately silent on the effective date of transfer. The transfer provisions in this bill create a new set of comprehensive rules. In our view, the analogy between the two sets of amendments is not appropriate. 31 Administrative issues raised in supplementary submission The Institute also states in its supplementary submission 12B that one of the Inland Revenue service centres had provided incorrect training to staff on the effective date of transfer under existing rules. Inland Revenue agrees that this occurred but notes that, as soon as the department found out about the problem, it was rectified. The Institute has acknowledged this in its subsequent letter to you on 21 March 2002 (submission 12C). Submission 12B added that it appeared that the Inland Revenue head office did not have adequate control over service and call centres. Its letter of 21 March clarifies that the Institute is not inferring that the incident is evidence of lack of control. It states that this is not the case, and was not the intended message. Inland Revenue agrees that because of the uncertainty over existing rules, there has been inconsistent application of them. Mistakes will be made, as is only to be expected in an organisation as large and diverse as Inland Revenue. To put the criticism into perspective, Inland Revenue has actioned in excess of 103,000 transfers for clients of agents since 1 January 2002. However, over the last 12 months the organisation has worked very closely with the Institute representatives to find both legislative and operational solutions to issues relating to transfers of excess tax. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 32 EXTENSION OF PROPOSED RULES TO OTHER TAX TYPES Clauses 61(7)(a), 77 Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Income tax credits should be able to be offset retrospectively against other tax obligations, and vice versa, at the original payment date. At a minimum, this should apply to transfers within a taxpayer’s account. Comment The transfer provisions in the bill generally already allow transfers between tax types at the original payment date for transfers within the same taxpayer’s account and to certain close associates. However, student loan and child support obligations are not “tax” as that term is defined in the Tax Administration Act 1994. The provisions should be extended to apply to transfers of excess tax to student loan and child support obligations, and transfers of overpaid student loan obligations to other tax types. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in that the transfer provisions should be extended to apply to transfers of excess tax to student loan and child support obligations, and transfers of overpaid student loan obligations to other tax types. Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Under the bill, taxpayers are only able to transfer “tax”, which specifically excludes use-of-money interest paid under Part VII of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The new rules should provide for the transfer of credit use-of-money interest. Under existing practice, taxpayers are able to transfer credit use-of-money interest to offset against other tax liabilities. Taxpayers should be able to transfer use-of-money interest at the same date as the core tax to which it relates. Comment We agree that credit use-of-money interest should be able to be transferred. However, we do not agree with the Institute that the interest should be transferable on the same day as the core tax to which it relates. For policy and administrative reasons, it should be transferable only on the day on which it would otherwise be paid out to the taxpayer. 33 Under the bill, core tax that is overpaid may be transferred to the same taxpayer or listed associates as at the date of overpayment. Broadly, this is so that taxpayers that are, or consider themselves to be, one economic entity, and that in aggregate have paid the right amount of tax, are not receiving use-of-money interest at one rate on overpayments and paying late payment penalties and a higher use-of-money interest rate on underpayments. These arguments apply in relation to core tax, not use-of- money interest. Interest should not be transferred as at the same date as core tax because when use-of- money interest is transferred, it converts to core tax in the hands of the transferee. This has two consequences. First, use-of-money interest could be payable to the transferee on the use-of-money interest transferred, thereby avoiding the rule that no use-of-money interest is payable on use-of-money interest. Second, interest could also be transferred back and forth between associated taxpayers’ accounts, each time converting interest into core tax and compounding the core tax on which interest is payable. The Institute accepts that this is possible but considers that taxpayers would not bother doing this unless there are large amounts at stake and the compliance cost of doing so is outweighed by the benefit. Transfers could, from a policy perspective, be transferable at the date applicable to transfers to unrelated taxpayers – the later of the day after the return is filed and the day of the transfer request (which often coincide). However, currently Inland Revenue can transfer interest only at “process date” – that is, the date on which the interest would be paid out to the taxpayer following assessment of the return for the period to which it relates. The system for calculating credit interest is discussed below. Credit use-of-money interest is payable on tax that is overpaid by the taxpayer. It is most frequently applied in relation to overpaid provisional tax. The interest owing in relation such tax is first calculated only after an assessment of the tax owing in that year, and is recalculated to take account of any subsequent adjustments in that year (such as transfers). Interest that has accrued up to the process date is then paid out to taxpayers or transferred at their request. It is not administratively feasible to change this in the short term. We understand that such a change, even if feasible in the longer term, would require the complete redesign of the interest calculation process. We therefore recommend that credit use-of-money interest continue to be transferred on the day on which the use-of-money interest would be paid out to the taxpayer in the absence of a transfer request. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part, so that the new rules be amended to permit transfers of credit use-of-money interest but that the effective date be the date on which the use-of-money interest would be paid out to the taxpayer in the absence of a transfer request. 34 EFFECTIVE DATE OF TRANSFER – TECHNICAL ISSUES Issue: Specific rules required for determining when tax is overpaid Submission (17W – KPMG) A key issue to the success of the rules is determining when an overpayment exists. It is fundamental that the date an overpayment of tax arises is clearly set out in legislation and the rules permit a transfer of any excess from that time. Taxpayers should be entitled to transfer amounts to another year or another taxpayer in a manner consistent with the new two-way use-of-money interest rules. Comment Excess tax that is paid directly to Inland Revenue can be transferred within a taxpayer’s own account, and to certain associates, as at the date of overpayment of the tax. In many cases, it will be clear when tax is overpaid – for example, when a duty or GST or terminal tax is paid. However, there are options for determining when provisional tax is overpaid, and we agree that the legislation should set out in detail how much provisional tax is “excess” and when this can be transferred to the same taxpayer or a listed associate. The rules are in two parts – transfers before and after assessment of the transferor’s tax liability for the year. Before assessment, the relevant excess that can be transferred is the amount paid in excess of provisional tax liability. After assessment, the relevant excess that can be transferred is the amount paid by way of provisional tax that exceeds the residual income tax liability for the year. The discussion below sets out the formulae for calculating at what date the excess is transferable in each case. 1.Transfer of excess over provisional tax liability before assessment (a) Basic rule Taxpayers should be able to transfer at any time before assessment an amount of provisional tax paid that exceeds their provisional tax liability. Such a payment was not required under the provisional tax rules – it is refundable and should be transferable. Essentially, the excess that is transferable as at a date is the net provisional tax paid by that date less the provisional tax owing by that date. This is expressed in the formula below, which calculates the excess that is available for transfer as at a particular date (“date x”) as 35 “a – b – c – d” where a = the provisional tax paid by date x (including voluntary payments made under section MB 6 of the Income Tax Act 1994 and tax transferred to the taxpayer) b = refunds paid out up to date x (including transfers out 1 ) c = the provisional tax liability payable by date x d = when the taxpayer has, on a date (“date y”) in the year that is after date x, either (i) paid less tax on date y than the provisional tax due on that date or (ii)received a refund of provisional tax paid in the year and there is no offsetting excess of tax paid arising before date y and after date x (iii) the provisional tax liability due on date y less the amount of tax paid on that date where (i) applies and (iv) the amount of the refund where (ii) applies. In a situation in which item d applies, the Commissioner will allow the amount calculated under item d to be transferred at or after date x provided that it is transferred back to the taxpayer in time to prevent late payment penalties applying in relation to the taxpayer’s payments of provisional tax for that year. Item d prevents taxpayers transferring an excess at a date that would trigger late payment penalties in relation to a subsequent underpayment of a provisional tax liability. However, temporary transfers of overpaid provisional tax are allowed to reduce late payment penalties or use-of- money interest in relation to other unpaid tax liabilities provided this does not result in late payment penalties for underpaid provisional tax. Example 1 A estimates provisional tax at $150,000 ($50,000 at each provisional tax payment date) but pays $75,000 at each provisional tax instalment date. A requests a transfer of excess provisional tax on 31 March. The formula calculates when the excess is available for transfer. P1 P2P3 Amount paid $75k$75k$75k PT liability$50k $50k$50k a = $75k $150k$225k b = $0k$25k$50k c = $50k$100k$150k d = $0k$0k$0k Tax overpaid$25k$25k$25k 1 by the taxpayer or by the Commissioner under the offset provisions 36 $25,000 is transferable at P1. A transfers it at this date (which is reflected in item b at P2). (If nothing is transferred before P2, $50,000 would be transferable at P2.) $25,000 is transferable at P2. A transfers it at this date (which is reflected in item b at P3). The remaining $25,000 is transferable at P3. Example 2 – taxpayer pays excess provisional tax at P1 and misses payments on P2 and P3 A pays provisional tax on the uplift basis and is required to pay $50,000 at each instalment. She pays $150,000 at P1, nothing on P2 and nothing on P3. If A’s request for a transfer is made after P3, there is no transferable excess. P1 P2P3 Amount paid $150k$0k$0k PT liability$50k$50k$50k a = $150k $150k$150k b = $0k$0k$0k c = $50k$100k$150k d = $100k$50k$0k Tax overpaid$0k$0k$0k (b) Where taxpayers revise their estimated provisional tax, or estimate after paying on the uplift basis Taxpayers can revise their provisional tax liabilities up to and on the third provisional tax instalment date. Where the amount of provisional tax payable by a provisional taxpayer is reduced, under section MB 8 of the Income Tax Act 1994 the taxpayer can apply for a refund of the difference between the provisional tax paid and the amount that would have been payable had the reduced amount of provisional tax applied at all earlier provisional tax instalment dates. Section MB 8 could apply when: • taxpayers who pay provisional tax based on an estimate of their tax liability, re-estimate their liability at the second or third provisional tax payment dates; • taxpayers who pay provisional tax on the uplift basis for the first, or first two, provisional tax instalment dates estimate for the remaining instalment date/s; and • taxpayers who have paid the first instalment, or first two instalments, of provisional tax on the basis of 110% of their residual income tax liability for the year-before-last pay the remaining instalments on the basis of 105% of their residual income tax liability for the previous year. 37 We propose a transfer rule that would apply in the first two situations, but not the third. The rule would allow taxpayers who have paid more provisional tax than their estimate or revised estimate to transfer the excess. The formula for calculating how much excess may be transferred at a particular date is essentially the same as that applying to transfers after assessment discussed in the next section. However, item c of the formula would refer to the estimated residual income tax liability of the taxpayer rather than actual residual income tax liability. There are two reasons for excluding the third category of taxpayers from this rule. • First, we are concerned that small, unsophisticated taxpayers, for whom in any year the uplift method may be quite inaccurate, will transfer an “excess” based on a change in uplift basis and expose themselves to late payment penalties if the tax liability turns out to be higher than the revised provisional tax. Those who estimate at the third instalment date may also be subject to late payment penalties if they transfer at provisional tax dates based on a revised estimate and their tax liability is higher than that estimate. However, they will have turned their minds to the likely amount of the tax liability in the current year and the estimation at P3 (3 weeks away from year-end) could be expected to be more accurate than a third provisional tax instalment based on last year’s residual income tax. Taxpayers who pay all three instalments on the uplift basis can still transfer any excess above residual income tax at a provisional tax payment date, but they must wait to do so until after assessment. • Second, most taxpayers who pay provisional tax on the uplift basis are not subject to use-of-money interest. Taxpayers who are not subject to use-of-money interest, and whose income fluctuates, would be able to take advantage of those fluctuations by transferring out excesses (and earning interest elsewhere on them) in years where provisional tax was reduced as a result of changing the base of the uplift from one year to another. 2.Transfer of excess provisional tax after assessment We propose that the total excess that may be transferred is the net provisional tax paid for the year less the residual income tax (RIT) for the year. Net provisional tax is tax paid (including voluntary payments made under section MB 6 and tax transferred to the taxpayer) less refunds of that tax (including tax transferred out by the taxpayer) paid out prior to assessment. 38 The formula below calculates the amount that may be transferred as at a particular date. Essentially, the amount that is transferable as at a date is the difference between the net provisional tax paid by that date and the tax that would be due by that date for the purposes of the use-of-money interest rules in the Tax Administration Act 1994 (calculated as if there was no safe-harbour 2 provision in those rules). However, under item “d” that amount is reduced when there is a subsequent underpayment of tax relative to what would be due for the purposes of calculating use-of-money interest. Item d prevents taxpayers transferring an amount when that would trigger late payment penalties or use- of-money interest at a subsequent date. However, temporary transfers that do not have this effect are permitted. Formula for calculating when excess tax is paid The excess available for transfer as at a particular date (“date x”) is a – b – c – d where a = the amount of tax paid up to and including date x 3 b = refunds of that tax paid out up to and including date x 4 c = the RIT that would be due and payable by date x for the purposes of calculating use-of-money interest under section 120K of the Tax Administration Act 1994 calculated as if section 120K(4) did not apply d = when the taxpayer has, on a date (“date y”) in the year that is after date x, either (i) paid less tax on date y than the amount of RIT due on date y under section 120K 5 or (ii) received a refund 6 , prior to assessment of RIT, of provisional tax paid in the year and there is no offsetting excess of tax paid arising before date y and after date x, (iii) the RIT due on date y less the amount of tax paid on date y where (i) applies and (iv) the amount of the refund where (ii) applies. In a situation in which item d applies, the Commissioner will allow the amount calculated under item d to be transferred on or after date x provided it is transferred back to the taxpayer in time to prevent use-of-money interest or late payment penalties applying in relation to the taxpayer’s payments of provisional tax for that year. 2 The safe harbour rules in section 120K(4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provide that natural person taxpayers with an RIT of under $30,000 are not subject to use-of-money interest on under- and over-payments of provisional tax from provisional tax instalment dates. In such cases RIT is not spread over the provisional tax payment dates for the purposes of calculating use-of-money interest. However, to accurately calculate excess tax transferable at a date, the RIT should be spread over provisional tax payment dates in all cases. 3 This includes transfers in which are deemed to be tax paid. 4 This includes transfers out which are deemed to be refunds. 5 Also calculated as if section 120K(4) did not apply. 6 Includes transfers out. 39 Example 3 – taxpayer pays provisional tax liability at all instalments and incurs loss A Co pays $20,000 provisional tax at each of P1, P2, P3 on the uplift or estimation basis. A Co is assessed as having a loss for the year. The total credit available for transfer is $60,000, being the difference between the provisional tax paid ($60,000) and the residual income tax ($0). The amount that may be transferred at the first, second and third provisional tax dates is calculated as follows. (Item b at P2 and P3 assumes that the excess tax is transferred as soon as it is available.) P1 P2P3 Amount paid $20k$20k$20k RIT due$0k $0k$0k a = 20k$40k$60k b =$0k$20k$40k c = $0k$0k$0k d = $0k$0k$0k Tax overpaid$20k$20k$20k $20,000 is transferable at each of P1, P2 and P3. If amounts are not transferred at those dates, they can be transferred at subsequent dates. Example 4 – taxpayer misses provisional tax instalment A pays provisional tax on the uplift basis, but he is subject to use-of-money interest. He paid his liability of $20,000 on P1, missed the payment due on P2, and paid $20,000 on P3. His RIT is $15,000. The total excess that may be transferred is $25,000 (being tax paid of $40,000 less the residual income tax of $15,000). P1P2P3 Amount paid$20k$0k$20k RIT due$5k$5k$5k a = $20k$20k$40k b = $0k$10k$10k c = $5k$10k $15k d = $5k$0k$0k Tax overpaid$10k$0k$15k A can transfer $10,000 on or after P1 and in this example transfers the $10,000 at P1 (which is reflected in item b at P2). A can transfer the balance of $15,000 on or after P3. A could also transfer at P1 the $5,000 calculated under item d at that date provided he transferred that amount back in by P2. This would enable him to reduce late payment penalties and use-of-money interest in relation to other tax liabilities paid late during this period. 40 Recommendation That the submission be accepted and the legislation be amended to include the rules set out above that specify the amount of excess provisional tax that may be transferred and the date at which it can be transferred. Issue: Transfer should be effective when tax is paid Clause 77, section 173L(2)(c) Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Proposed section 173L(2)(c) provides that a taxpayer may elect a transfer date that is after the date the excess tax is paid. This should be amended to a date that occurs on or after the date the excess tax is paid. Comment Officials agree that excess tax should be transferable on the date that the excess was paid. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 41 EFFECTIVE DATE OF TRANSFER – TRANSFERS AT DATE OF OVERPAYMENT Clause 77 Issue: Should all transfers be backdatable? Submission 1 (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The proposed rules allow a transfer to be backdated to the date of overpayment when the transfer is to the same taxpayer or between associates listed in the legislation. This ensures that taxpayers within this group who have paid the correct amount of tax in aggregate will not be paying interest at a high rate on underpayments at the same time as they receive interest at a lower rate on overpayments. There is no need for any limitation on the parties to whom a backdated transfer may be made. The purpose of the use-of-money interest rules is to compensate the Crown for the loss of the use of funds from taxpayers paying too little tax, to compensate taxpayers for the loss of use of funds through paying too much tax and to encourage taxpayers to pay the correct amount of tax on time. If tax is paid at the relevant dates, the Crown has not lost the use of funds and it should allow transfers between taxpayers to minimise use-of-money interest. Submission 2 (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) If the primary submission is not accepted, a taxpayer should be permitted to make a backdated transfer to any taxpayer to cover a shortfall that has been voluntarily disclosed within, say, two months or one return period. Comment Submission 1 Officials disagree with submission 1 for the following reasons. Administration costs First, allowing all transfers to be backdated to the date of overpayment would significantly increase the administrative workload of Inland Revenue as it would have to field transfer requests and recalculate late payment penalties and debit use-of- money interest on underpayments of provisional tax, or other tax types, often several years after the tax is overpaid. The proposed new rules require the Commissioner to do this for certain associates, but to do it for any two taxpayers would significantly increase administrative costs. The unwinding of late payment penalties and debit use- of-money interest also increases the complexity of the tax system. 42 The Institute considers that allowing backdated transfers to all taxpayers will not result in imposing high administrative costs on Inland Revenue because taxpayers will only make transfer requests if the interest (and presumably late payment penalty) impact exceeds the compliance cost to the taxpayer. It also argues that Inland Revenue costs should be less than those facing the taxpayer. We agree that there will be compliance costs for a taxpayer in making the request and monitoring Inland Revenue’s actioning of the retrospective transfers to ensure that the consequences of the transfer are correct. We do not agree that Inland Revenue’s costs will be less than that facing the taxpayer. If all transfers can be retrospective there will be a sufficient number of taxpayers requesting such a transfer to increase significantly Inland Revenue’s administrative workload. The Government is currently considering a pooling proposal which would go a significant way to addressing the Institute’s concern over the difference in use-of- money rates for underpayments and overpayments of tax. In effect, it would allow the transfer of overpayments of one taxpayer to satisfy underpayments of another through an intermediary or “pool”. Taxpayers who had overpaid tax would, through this mechanism, receive an interest rate higher than the statutory credit use-of-money interest rate, and taxpayers who had underpaid could “buy” overpaid tax at an interest rate lower than the statutory debit use-of-money interest rate. The proposal, set out in a Government discussion document in 2001, is designed in such a way as to minimise administration costs to Inland Revenue. Cancellation of late payment penalties Secondly, transfers of excess tax to satisfy a tax liability of the same taxpayer, or a close associate, not only minimise use-of-money interest but can result in the cancellation of late payment penalties incurred by the transferee. This is appropriate when tax is transferred within a taxpayer’s account – if taxpayers have paid the right amount of tax in aggregate, they should not be subject to late payment penalties. By extension, it is also justifiable when taxpayers are the same economic entity, or see themselves as one economic entity, or where taxpayers share in an income stream and do not allocate income between themselves until year end. To allow a taxpayer to “buy” excess tax from an unrelated taxpayer so as to cancel late payment penalties reduces the incentive for taxpayers to pay the right amount of tax on time and undermines the integrity of the tax system. Manipulation of backdated transfers The ability to backdate a transfer can be manipulated to enable use-of-money interest to be payable where it is intended that none should. Allowing backdated transfers to all would expand this opportunity. Submission 2 Officials also do not support submission 2. The Institute argues that a backdated transfer should be allowed to anyone to cover a shortfall that has been voluntarily disclosed within, say, two months or one return period by the transferee. It suggests that this would allow voluntary disclosure with no penalty, but prevent careless or deliberate shortfalls. The Institute subsequently noted that shortfall penalties may still apply, but consider that the transfer should be allowed to prevent any late payment penalties and use-of-money interest applying. The Institute proposes a backdated 43 transfer be permitted to recognise that taxpayers who voluntarily disclose shortfalls are less culpable than those who do not. The rules in relation to shortfall penalties already recognise and deal with this, as shortfall penalties are reduced by 75% if the shortfall is voluntarily disclosed before audit. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Transfers to taxpayers within one degree Submission (Matter raised by officials) The transfer provisions allow excess tax to be transferred to taxpayers within one degree of relationship as at the date of overpayment. The concept of “degrees of relationship” is used elsewhere in the Revenue Acts, and where this occurs the concept is clarified so that it is clear that this means a person connected with another by blood relationship, marriage, a relationship in the nature of marriage, or adoption. We propose that a similar provision be included in the transfer rules and that it be clear that “taxpayers within one degree” includes a spouse, de facto spouse and same sex partner. Recommendation That the transfer provisions be amended to clarify that a person is related to another when they are connected by blood relationship, marriage, a relationship in the nature of marriage, or adoption and that “taxpayers within one degree” therefore includes a spouse, de facto spouse and same sex partner. Issue: Extension of list of taxpayers eligible for retrospective transfers Submission 1 The list of those associates to whom backdated transfers can be made should be extended to include transfers between: • shareholder/employees (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) ; • family members to within two degrees to cover normal family dealings (7 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) ; 44 • family members to within three degrees (for example, uncle/nephew) (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) ; • taxpayers with common control as described in section 2A(1)(i) of the GST Act 1985 (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) ; • taxpayers who are commonly managed, such as superannuation funds and unit trusts (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) ; • superannuation funds, group investment funds and unit trusts that are commercially or practically connected (7 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) ; • a trust and a company where the trust runs its trading through the company and the trust owns at least 66% of the shares in the company (7 – Pricewaterhouse Coopers) ; • family trusts (7 – Pricewaterhouse Coopers) ; • associated persons as defined in section 2A of the GST Act 1985 (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) . Submission 2 (2 – Retail Merchants Association) The class of associated persons that may make backdated transfers should be broadened. Comment Framework for determining who may make backdated transfers As with the Income Tax Act generally, the late payment penalty provisions apply on taxpayer-by-taxpayer basis to encourage the taxpayer to pay the right amount of tax on time. Therefore an individual taxpayer who has paid the right amount overall should be able to transfer overpayments to offset underpayments as at the date the excess is paid so that there is no late payment penalty. They also should not be receiving interest on overpayments at one rate and paying interest on underpayments at a higher rate. This rationale can be extended to those who are one economic entity – for example, companies that are 100% commonly owned. Beyond this, there is an element of pragmatism – if the list is too restrictive and there is no other means to avoid the difference in use-of-money interest rates, taxpayers will consider the use-of-money interest rules unfair and they may not be sustainable in the long run. Balanced against this are the costs of extending this category of taxpayers in terms of administration and complexity, reducing the incentive for an individual taxpayer to pay the right amount of tax on time, and increasing opportunities to manipulate transfers to obtain use-of-money interest where none would otherwise be payable. Balancing these factors, the right to operate on an aggregate basis for the purpose of the transfer rules is extended to include taxpayers who consider themselves to be one economic entity and taxpayers who share in an income stream and, for commercial 45 reasons, do not allocate income between themselves until after the end of the income year. The list of taxpayers who can operate on an aggregate basis was compiled using these criteria. The bill therefore allows backdated transfers between: • companies in the same group (that is, companies that are at least 66% commonly owned); • a shareholder/employee and company; • partners in the same partnership; • family members within one degree of relationship (spouses, de facto spouses, same sex couples, parent/child); • a family trust and beneficiary. Submissions seek the extension of that list to include transfers between the following categories of taxpayers. PricewaterhouseCoopers does not take issue with the framework but argues that the list is narrower than the framework would suggest – that is, it argues that the entities they propose fit within the framework. Shareholder/employees Backdated transfers may be made between a shareholder/employee and a company because frequently it is not clear how much income will be distributed by the company to the shareholder/employee and in what form (for example, as salary or dividends). This income is often allocated after the end of the year. If backdated transfers can be made between these two, it is not necessary during the year to determine who will derive the income and in what form for the purpose of accurately calculating provisional tax instalments. Two shareholder/employees in the same company are not one economic entity, and, as between themselves, they do not share in an income stream – they each share in an income stream with the company. Family members PricewaterhouseCoopers seeks to allow backdated transfers for family members within two degrees to cover normal family dealings. The Institute seeks an extension for family members within three degrees. Examples of relationships within two and three degrees are: a person and his or her grandparent/grandchild ) within two degrees a person and his or her brother/sister ) a person and his or her parent-in-law ) a person and his or her aunt/uncle (parent’s sibling)) a person and his or her niece/nephew) within three degrees a person and his or her spouse’s grandparent/grandchild) In our view, neither set of taxpayers are the same economic entity or share in an income stream simply on the basis of their degree of relationship. (If they happen to 46 be partners in the same partnership, they can make backdated transfers in that capacity.) Taxpayers with common control as described in section 2A(i) GST Act 1985 Section 2A(i) of the GST Act defines as associated persons A and B if they are each associated with C under the various other tests of association in the definition. The definition is very wide because it is an anti-avoidance provision – for example, a company and the brother of a shareholder with a 25% interest in a company are associated under this test. Such associates are not one economic entity, and do not share in an income stream. Taxpayers who are commonly managed – such as superannuation funds and unit trusts – and superannuation funds, group investment funds and unit trusts that are commercially or practically connected These taxpayers are not one economic entity, nor would they consider themselves one economic entity. They are simply “customers” of the same manager. They also do not share in an income stream. Transfers between them should not be backdated. A trust and a company where the trust runs its trading through the company and the trust owns at least 66% of the shares in the company As noted above, backdated transfers of excess tax can be made between companies in the same group (that is, companies with 66% common shareholding). PricewaterhouseCoopers argues that if a trust trades through and owns 66% of a company, the trust and company should be able to make backdated transfers between themselves. Trading trusts and companies can be substitutable investment vehicles. Therefore, on the face of this, allowing a trading trust and a company in which it owns 66% of the shares to make backdated transfers appears consistent with allowing group companies to make backdated transfers. However, there is no definition of “trading trust” in the Income Tax Act and the concept of “trading through a company” is too vague to be a requirement – arguably all shareholders run their trading through companies. We do not support their inclusion in the list. Family trusts PricewaterhouseCoopers argues that family trusts should be able to transfer excess credits between them in the way that companies in the same group can. They acknowledge that this would require developing a set of deemed ownership rules for trusts, but consider that this should be possible. The rules for determining when companies are owned by the same shareholders and therefore are in the same group are complex, and developing such rules for trusts is likely to be even more complex. This is because discretionary trusts can be set up to potentially benefit a wide range of family members but distributions may be made to a narrow group of those beneficiaries. We therefore do not agree with the submission. 47 Taxpayers who are associated persons within the meaning of section 2A GST Act As noted earlier, the list of taxpayers who are associated under section 2A of the GST Act is wide, and includes companies that are 50% commonly owned, a shareholder owning 25% of a company, and trustees and settlors of a trust. Associated persons tests are used in both the Income Tax Act and GST Act and are broadly drafted because they generally have an anti-avoidance focus. This is not an appropriate basis on which to allow backdated transfers. It includes relationships where the parties are not one economic entity and do not share in an income stream allocated after the end of the year. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Backdated transfers between taxpayers to be in both directions Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) It should be specifically confirmed that the transfers in the bill that may be backdated are effective in both directions – for example, if a transfer from a company to a shareholder/employee may be backdated, then a transfer from a shareholder/employee to a company should be able to be backdated. Comment It is intended that transfers that may be backdated are effective in both directions. This is not clear in all cases. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 48 EFFECTIVE DATE – TRANSFERS THAT MAY NOT BE BACKDATED Clause 77 Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The earliest effective date for transfers other than those to the same taxpayer and listed close associates is the later of the day after the relevant return is filed and the date of the transfer request. The commentary on the bill states that this is broadly a proxy for the date of processing the transfer request. The date of request is in no way a proxy for the date of processing. Comment The submission notes that processing may take place weeks or even months after a return is filed. The Institute adds that, when the policy was being developed, officials initially considered that the effective date for transfers to taxpayers other than the listed associates should be the date of processing the return – that is, the date on which the refund would otherwise be paid out. This was changed to the later of the date of the request and the date after filing the return in response to the point made by the Institute that the processing date could be some time after filing, and that this was in the control of Inland Revenue, not the taxpayer. The Institute considers the date of request is an improvement but is not a proxy for the date of processing. The submission is a comment on a comment and proposes no specific legislative change. Recommendation No recommendation is required. 49 EFFECTIVE DATE OF TRANSFER – DEFAULT DATES Submission (Matter raised by officials) The transfer provisions state that taxpayers may choose to transfer excess tax rather than having it refunded, and the date of transfer is a date that they choose provided it is no earlier than a specified date. There are no default dates for processing transfer requests when the taxpayer does not request a date. They are likely not to specify a date if, for example: • they request a transfer on the 2001-2002 income tax return by ticking the relevant box (the new rules apply to 2002 assessments after enactment of the bill); • they are indifferent to the date the transfer is made (because, for example, they are not subject to use-of-money interest) or they do not know what date to choose and rely upon Inland Revenue to transfer at an appropriate date. Default dates are required to enable Inland Revenue to process these requests efficiently. However, taxpayers would be able to contact the department subsequent to the transfer at a default date, and elect a different transfer date that is within the terms of the transfer provisions. We envisage that once the rules are enacted, tax agents would generally specify a date, so that processing at a default date can be reduced to a minimum. We propose a legislative amendment that would allow Inland Revenue to transfer excess tax at a date the Commissioner considers appropriate, when a taxpayer has elected a transfer but not specified a date. This provides Inland Revenue with as much flexibility as possible to set default dates that minimise subsequent manual adjustments. In order to achieve this, the dates would be those that generally maximise credit use-of-money interest, or minimise differential use-of-money interest, for taxpayers within the constraints of the new rules. The default dates would be discussed with the Institute and published in administrative guidelines. We have discussed this proposal with the Institute, who agrees that default dates are required provided they can be overridden by the taxpayer. However, given the previous debates over transfers with Inland Revenue, the Institute is wary about providing Inland Revenue with flexibility as to the default date. We consider that it is not feasible or desirable to be prescriptive in legislation about which default dates will apply in which circumstances. The protection for taxpayers is that they can override the default date (within the legislative framework). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 50 EFFECTIVE DATE OF TRANSFER – CHARITABLE DONATIONS/CHILDCARE REBATES Issue: Date of transfer Clause 77 Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) It is proposed that a rebate for childcare or charitable donations can be transferred only at the later of the date of the request for the transfer and the date after which the taxpayer applies for the refund (generally these dates will coincide). A taxpayer that has incurred an expense and is entitled to a childcare or charitable donation rebate should be able to retrospectively offset the refund against income tax obligations from the same year. This should apply to related taxpayers as set out in section 173L, but at a minimum to a transfer to the same taxpayer’s account. Comment When the filing of tax returns for many wage and salary earners became optional in 2000, the process for claiming childcare and charitable donations rebates changed. They are no longer claimed in the income tax return, and no longer offset income tax obligations for the year. Instead, taxpayers who are eligible for the rebate file a separate rebate claim form and the rebate is refunded. Broadly, the bill provides that the earliest effective date of transfer of the rebate is the day after filing the claim form 7 . This is because there is no use-of-money interest payable on the rebate, and transfers at an earlier date could be made to an associate in order to avoid this restriction and collect use-of-money interest on the rebate. The Institute argues that these rebates should be retrospectively transferable so as to offset income tax obligations for the year in which the childcare expenses and donations are made. For transfers within the same taxpayer’s account and to listed associates, overpaid tax may be backdated to the date of overpayment of the tax. The problem with applying a similar rule to childcare and charitable donations rebates is that the rebate would be transferable on the date the donations were made or the childcare expenses paid. These amounts may be paid out by the taxpayer numerous times during the year. It is therefore not administratively feasible to allow transfers to be made at each date. The only feasible means of achieving the Institute objective is to reintegrate the rebate claim form into the tax return for those filling in a tax return. This is contrary to Government policy, which is that the claiming of rebates should be a separate, simple process. 7 This is intended to occur after the end of the income year – the officials’ submission on the following page proposes the correction of a defect in the Act that allows the form to be filed earlier than this. 51 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Remedial amendment Submission (Matter raised by officials) The changes made as part of the Taxation (Taxpayer Assessment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001 to remove the six-month deadline for claiming rebates inadvertently repealed the rule that, unless there are special circumstances, taxpayers can claim their refunds only from the year following the one in which they incurred rebatable expenditure. A remedial amendment is required to section 41A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to reinstate the correct rule that: • standard and early balance date taxpayers can apply for a refund for an income year from 1 April next following the end of the taxpayer’s income year; and • late balance date taxpayers can apply for a refund for an income year from the first day of the taxpayer’s next accounting year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 52 EFFECTIVE DATE – EXCESS TAX APPLIED TO MEET LIABILITY Submission (Matter raised by officials) The Commissioner has the right under the Revenue Acts to apply excess tax of a taxpayer to satisfy an unpaid liability of the taxpayer. These provisions have priority over the proposed transfer legislation because excess tax paid by one taxpayer should not be transferred to another taxpayer when the first taxpayer has a tax debt owing. However, the provisions in the Revenue Act do not specify at what effective date the excess tax is transferred to satisfy the liability. We propose that the same dates as apply to requested transfers apply also to transfers that are automatically made by the Commissioner to satisfy arrears. This issue was raised by the Institute in discussions with officials. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 53 TRANSFER NOT COUNTED FOR SHORTFALL PENALTY PURPOSES Clause 77 Submission (7 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Excess tax that is transferred should be treated as tax paid by the transferee on the date of the transfer for the purposes of imposing a shortfall penalty under Part IX of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Comment The bill proposes that overpaid tax that is transferred to a taxpayer is “tax paid” by the taxpayer for all purposes except the shortfall penalty rules. This is because the shortfall penalty rules are intended to penalise taxpayers who fail to take sufficient care in calculating their tax, who take an abusive tax position or who evade tax. This activity should be penalised regardless of whether the taxpayer can arrange a transfer to cover a shortfall from a person who has overpaid their tax. PricewaterhouseCoopers argues that there are a number of situations where short payments would occur on the expectation that a transfer from another taxpayer will soon be forthcoming. It argues that, where this proves to be the case, shortfall penalties should not be imposed. Shortfall penalties can apply only when there is a difference between what the taxpayers calculate as their liability and what their liability is. Therefore if they have correctly calculated their liability, but are relying on a transfer for payment, no shortfall penalty will arise. If transferred tax could eliminate shortfall penalties, taxpayers could undercalculate their liability and rely on a transfer to cover the shortfall in the event that their calculation was shown to be wrong. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 54 DRAFTING ISSUES: EARLY BALANCE DATE TAXPAYERS Clause 77 Submission (7 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Proposed section 173L(3) states that when excess tax is deducted on behalf of an early balance date taxpayer, the taxpayer may transfer the tax on a day after the end of the year in which the deduction occurred. This provision is not necessary because subsection (2) adequately conveys what is intended. If clarification is required, then it should occur within subsection (2)(b) itself, dispensing with the need for subsection (3). Comment The policy intent of proposed section 173L(2) and (3) is that if too much tax is deducted on the taxpayer’s behalf – for example, PAYE – the first day that the credit is available for transfer is generally the day after balance date. So, for taxpayers with a standard balance date (31 March) this is 1 April. However, if a taxpayer has an early balance date (say November 30), because the taxpayer also has business income, salary earned up until 31 March is included in the return to the previous November 30. In this case, deductions may not be made until 31 March. Therefore a taxpayer with an early balance date should also not be able to transfer the excess before 1 April. In subsection 173L(2)(b) “income year” means the year from 1 April – 31 March. This provision should refer to a taxpayer’s accounting year, which will include non- standard balance dates. Subsection (3) is therefore required. Recommendation That the submission be declined but that subsection 173L(2)(b) be amended to refer to a taxpayer’s accounting year, not income year. 55 TRANSFER OF EXCESS TAX RETAINED BECAUSE OF INSUFFICIENT IMPUTATION CREDITS Clause 48(4) Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Clarification is sought that proposed new section MD 2(5A) will permit transfers when there is a terminal tax shortfall, not merely when a taxpayer has underpaid the tax due at a provisional tax instalment on, for example, the uplift method. Comment Clause 48 inserts a new section MD 2(5A) into the Income Tax Act as an adjunct to the amendments relating to transfers of excess tax at the request of a taxpayer. The amendment expands the scope of section MD 2(5), which applies when overpaid income tax is not refunded to a corporate taxpayer because its imputation credit account has insufficient credits. (This means that it has already passed on credit for the tax to its shareholders.) Instead, the overpaid tax is retained and applied in payment of tax that is payable by the company. It is not clear that the excess can be applied as at a date on which there is no liability to pay provisional tax but from which use-of-money interest applies in relation to underpaid residual income tax. The amendment clarifies that the excess can be credited as at a provisional tax date to eliminate use-of-money interest on underpaid residual income tax. The proposed amendment already does exactly what the Institute proposes. We have advised them of this. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 56 EXTENSION OF BILL TO ALLOW “POOLING” THROUGH INTERMEDIARIES Clause 77 Submission (4W – Business NZ) The bill should be widened to permit the pooling arrangements discussed in More Time for Business . While the measures in this bill and the proposed pooling options are endorsed, a better solution is a reduction in the margin between the two use-of- money interest rates. Comment We have reported to you separately on how the use-of-money interest rates for overpayment and underpayment of tax are set. The Government is considering the pooling proposals discussed in More Time for Business . Recommendation That the submission be declined. 57 EXTENSION OF CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH TAX CAN BE REFUNDED (AND TRANSFERRED) Clause 77 Submission (10 – Whyte Group) The bill should be amended to allow taxpayers to estimate their tax liability after the third provisional tax instalment date and before filing a return, and obtain a refund or transfer of the excess tax paid based on that estimate. Comment The submissioner is correct in stating that the law currently does not allow a taxpayer to file an estimate of the taxpayer’s terminal tax liability after the third provisional tax instalment and obtain a refund of any overpaid tax based on that estimate. After the third instalment date has passed, the taxpayer must wait until the tax return is filed and tax for the year is assessed. Only then is a refund payable. The Whyte Group proposes a significant change to the Income Tax Act. It seeks to change the circumstances in which a refund can be paid, so that a taxpayer would be entitled to a refund based on its estimated tax liability rather than wait until a return is filed and tax is assessed. This goes beyond the transfer provisions in the bill, which apply only to the extent that an amount is already refundable under the current law. Such a change would require considerable analysis and consultation. The submission is outside the scope of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Further tax simplification measures 61 OVERVIEW OF SUBMISSIONS The bill introduces a number of initiatives to reduce compliance costs for taxpayers, including: • removing the need to file income tax returns on behalf of deceased taxpayers and for small amounts of income from which tax has not been withheld; • simplifying family assistance by better targeting the payment of the family tax credit and aligning the process for determining family assistance entitlements with the general income tax rules; • removing the need for companies to file multiple imputation returns in order to receive refunds of income tax; • reducing the number of provisional taxpayers who are exposed to use-of-money interest; • making it easier for banks and other interest payers to communicate resident withholding tax information to their customers; and • not requiring small businesses to value and make adjustments for small amounts of trading stock at the end of the year. Six submissions were received on the proposals and they were generally supportive of efforts to further simplify the tax system, although some submissions commented that the proposals did not go far enough. Clearly, any tax simplification and compliance cost reduction initiative must be measured against its impact on other objectives, including the efficiency of the tax system and revenue requirements. 62 $200 THRESHOLD FOR RETURNING INCOME FROM WHICH TAX HAS NOT BEEN WITHHELD Clauses 63(2) and 63(5) Submission (7 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 9 – National Council of Women) The non-withholding income threshold under which a return does not have to be filed is too low and should be increased to a more realistic level such as $2,500 per annum. (National Council of Women) The structure of the amendment is not consistent with the style of the existing legislative provisions and should be clarified so that the description of the type of the income and the threshold match the existing treatment. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment The $200 non-withholding income threshold mirrors the non-filing provision currently in place for withholding income from which tax has not been deducted correctly. Like the withholding income threshold, it is aimed at removing the compliance cost burden for taxpayers who earn small amounts of income during the year from having to return this income. It also removes the risk for these taxpayers of sanctions applying for not filing a return and remitting the appropriate tax deduction. Increasing the threshold to, say, $2,500 would result in a significant risk to the revenue, one that would exceed the compliance cost savings from such a measure. Submissions have also proposed that the amendment in clause 63(2) of the bill be split so that the description of the type of income and the threshold match the treatment for withholding income in sections 33A(1)(a) and 33A(1)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Officials consider that the current drafting style reflects the fact that the proposed threshold for non-withholding income is separate from the $200 threshold for withholding income. That is, if in a year a person has withholding income of $150 from which tax has not been correctly withheld and non-withholding income of $180, the relevant non-filing provisions can be applied in respect of both income types. If the amendment were drafted as suggested by the submissions, however, the non-filing provisions would apply only if the person earned $200 or less in total of both withholding and non-withholding income. Here, in respect of the earlier example, the non-filing provisions would not apply as the person has earned in excess of $200 ($330) from all sources. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 63 ADJUSTMENTS REQUIRED FOR FAMILY ASSISTANCE PURPOSES TO BE REMOVED Clause 41 Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Minor mechanical changes are required in relation to the proposal. Comment The submission proposed that in relation to the treatment of depreciation on buildings and income (and adverse event income) equalisation account deposits for family assistance purposes, clause 41(2) of the bill be removed as it could give rise to a double deduction. Subclause (2) allows depreciation on buildings and income equalisation account deposits to be claimed as a deduction for family assistance purposes from the 2003-04 income year. Currently, these items are not allowable deductions for family assistance purposes but they are for income tax purposes. Officials agree with the submission, that clause 41(2) is unnecessary and could give rise to a double deduction as the family assistance rules are applied on taxable income (that is, income determined after the income tax rules have been applied). The submission also proposed that clauses 41(4) and 41(7) of the Bill be clarified to ensure that deposits to income (and adverse event income) equalisation accounts relate to a specific income year. The submission commented that without such an amendment, an adjustment would need to made for income equalisation account deposits made during or after the 2003-04 income year that relate to years prior to the 2003-04 income year. The submission suggested inserting the words “for a year” before the words “before the 2003-04” in subclauses (4) and (7). Officials agree with the intent of this submission but consider that it would be more meaningful to change the current wording of subclauses (4) and (7) so that any income equalisation account deposit relating to the 2002-03 or a previous income year that is refunded in the 2003- 04 or a subsequent income year is not income for the purposes of determining family assistance. Recommendation That the submission be accepted subject to officials’ comments. 64 REMOVAL OF INTERIM IMPUTATION RETURN REQUIREMENTS Clause 48(1), 48(2), 48(3) and 48(5) Issue: Proposed section MD 2(1A) Submission (17 – KPMG) The proposed section MD 2(1A) need only act as a proviso to section MD 2(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1994, and there should be a link in the proposed section to extension of time arrangements. Comment Officials agree that the proposed amendment only has use as a proviso to section MD 2(1)(a) and can only be applied by companies that have extensions of time for filing their tax returns. The suggested changes should clarify the application of the new provision. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Requirement to disclose changes in imputation ratios Submission (7 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The requirement for taxpayers to disclose in their annual imputation return if two imputation ratios have increased or decreased by more than 20 percent from the preceding income year should be removed, as well as the requirement to explain the change. Comment The submission has commented that the requirement to disclose the ratios be removed owing to widespread non-compliance. This submission is beyond the scope of the current bill, but will be addressed in the taxation bill scheduled for introduction in May. Recommendation That the submission be declined in respect of the Taxpayer (Relief, Refunds and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. 65 GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN COMMUNICATING RESIDENT WITHHOLDING TAX INFORMATION Clauses 62 and 65 Submission (7 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 9 – National Council of Women) The proposal should require the interest payer to advise what withholding tax rates have been applied to interest income. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The gross withholding income threshold for communicating resident withholding tax information to interest earners should not be increased. (National Council of Women) Comment Submissions have requested that clause 62 be amended so that the resident withholding tax rate applied to interest income is disclosed by the interest payer when communicating resident withholding tax information to interest earners. Submissions have commented that this is a quick and easy way for interest earners to determine whether or not the interest payer has deducted withholding tax at the correct rate and is especially useful when taxpayers have multiple bank accounts or have provided their tax number part way through the year. The requirement for interest payers to communicate the amount of withholding income earned and the resident withholding tax deducted should ensure that taxpayers are able to calculate the withholding rate applied with relative ease. However, officials take the point that this may be more difficult when a tax number is provided mid-year (resulting in resident withholding tax being deducted at the non-declaration rate for some of the year) or if interest earners have a number of different accounts or derive withholding income from multiple sources. In these instances, having information relating to the withholding tax rate may reduce compliance costs associated with determining a taxpayer’s tax obligations. A consequential amendment to clause 65(1) has also been requested, in relation to the information the Commissioner of Inland Revenue can require interest payers to provide. In relation to the threshold for communicating resident withholding tax information to interest earners, submissions have commented that this information should be available to all interest earners regardless of the amount of interest and tax deducted at source. For most interest earners, this information is already likely to be provided in other forms, such as a bank statement. The threshold recognises that there are compliance costs for interest payers in providing a separate resident withholding tax deduction certificate to interest earners and these costs are particularly likely to be an issue for small interest payers. 66 Recommendation That: • an amendment be made to clause 62 to include the requirement for interest payers to disclose the resident withholding tax rate applied to withholding income when communicating resident withholding tax information to interest earners. • a consequential amendment be made to clause 65 to require interest payers to also furnish the withholding tax rate to the Commissioner. 67 RAISING THE USE-OF-MONEY INTEREST THRESHOLD Clauses 72, 55(17) and 55(29) Issue: Application date and threshold amount Submission (7 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The proposal should apply from the start of the 2002-03 income year as this date allows Inland Revenue plenty of time to become operationally prepared. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The residual income tax threshold under which a provisional taxpayer is not subject to the use-of-money interest rules should be increased to $50,000. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Comment Submissions have commented that because the use-of-money interest calculation is not performed until the end of an income year and after an income tax return for that year has been filed, a 2002-03 income year application date is viable. That is, Inland Revenue will have ample lead time (the period spanning the income year end, the due date for filing and the time taken to process the return) to implement the amendment. A 2003-04 income year application date was recommended on the basis that Inland Revenue would need time to have the processes in place to properly inform taxpayers of the higher threshold. This application date ensures that all taxpayers, including those with early balance dates, have uniform access to the amendment. The Institute has commented that the tax threshold, under which certain taxpayers are removed from the use-of-money interest rules, has remained unchanged for eight years and inflation would lift it to between $40,000 to $45,000. Concurrently, the 39% tax rate has dropped the level of income at which the $30,000 threshold is reached. It has further submitted that the administration of the use-of-money interest regime has caused huge compliance costs for both taxpayers and Inland Revenue. The amendment will allow eligible taxpayers to earn up to $12,820 in extra income each year before the use-of-money interest rules apply. Increasing the tax threshold to $50,000, as suggested by the Institute, would mean that an extra $51,282 in income would be allowed. Such a threshold would present a significant risk of deferral of tax, one that would exceed any compliance cost savings or reduction in risk for taxpayers. Officials also consider that use-of-money interest issues can be better dealt with through other initiatives. For example, a number of options for removing and reducing use-of-money interest risk have been outlined in the Government discussion document on tax simplification, More time for business . Officials are currently considering the viability of these proposals. 68 Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Drafting error Submission (Matter raised by officials) A drafting error in clause 55(25) of the bill should be corrected. Comment Clause 55(17) of the bill raises the threshold commensurately in respect of the definition of a “new provisional taxpayer”. Subclause (25), however, applies subclause (17) from the date of Royal assent. Officials submit that this is incorrect and subclause (25) should be amended to remove the reference in it to subclause (17). Clause 55(29) of the bill provides the correct application date for the amendment Recommendation That the matter raised by officials be accepted. 69 NO VALUATION REQUIRED FOR TRADING STOCK LESS THAN $5,000 Clauses 22, 55(23) and 55(32) Submission (2, 2A – Retail Merchants Association of New Zealand, 7 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 9 – National Council of Women, 12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The trading stock threshold under which valuation is not required should be increased to $50,000. (Retail Merchants Association of New Zealand) The proposal should be amended to ensure that taxpayers who are not required to register for GST are entitled to apply the proposal. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The trading stock threshold should be increased to $20,000 or, if this submission is not accepted, the threshold should not be based on taxable supplies for GST purposes. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The $1.3 million threshold is fairly high. (National Council of Women) Comment Submissions have commented that very few retailers would have trading stock below the proposed $5,000 threshold for application of the amendment, and given that it is only the movement in stock balances that creates any tax consequences the proposed threshold seems unnecessarily low. Most businesses are likely to value their closing stock as a matter of course for accounting purposes. When taxpayers are not required to do so, generally because the amount of residual stock is negligible, the tax system creates extra work. Consequently, many small businesses do not accurately measure their closing stock and therefore run the risk of sanctions being applied if caught. The relevant amendment is aimed at alleviating this risk and reducing the compliance costs for small businesses from having to account for changes in the value of what is essentially small amounts of trading stock. Officials consider that a significantly higher trading stock threshold would impose a large fiscal cost on the government. For example, under a $50,000 threshold for valuing trading stock, taxpayers with closing stock of $5,000 at the end of year one would not have to value the stock at the end of year two if they are able to reasonably ascertain that the value of stock has not exceeded $50,000. If the actual value of stock at the end of year two were $45,000, the trading stock adjustment (that is, “income” of $40,000 that would otherwise be taxable) would now effectively be deferred. A higher threshold would also make it difficult to ensure that taxpayers are making reasonable estimations about the value of their trading stock. 70 In its supplementary submission, the New Zealand Retailers Association proposed that the threshold amount could be increased to $50,000 with the inclusion of a second criterion that taxpayers be required to value their trading stock if they reasonably estimated that the closing value of the trading stock was at least 50 percent greater than the opening value. As noted in that submission, officials consider that it unlikely that concerns about the Association’s proposal can be resolved in time to support an amendment to the current bill. We will, however, further consult on this issue with the Association. Submissions have also commented that the trading stock threshold should not be based on taxable supplies for GST purposes. They have suggested that this will preclude the smallest taxpayers – that is, those taxpayers that are so small that they are not required to be GST-registered or who make exempt supplies – from being able to apply the amendment. Officials concur with this assessment and recommend that the associated recommendation be accepted. The amendment was intended to apply to all taxpayers with turnover not exceeding $1.3 million in an income year. In relation to the submission by the National Council of Women, officials consider that reducing the $1.3 million turnover threshold would limit the number of taxpayers with trading stock of $5,000 or less at income year-end who are able to apply the proposal. Recommendation That an amendment be made to the relevant clauses in the bill to ensure that taxpayers who are not registered for GST purposes are able to apply the proposal. Issue: New rules for taxpayers with low gross income Submission (17 – KPMG) The introduction of the proposal should be deferred until such time as a proper review of some substantive provisions for taxpayers with low gross income can be established. Comment The submission has commented that while the proposal is supported in principle, a full review of the Income Tax Act should be undertaken and consideration given to developing a set of rules that reduce the burden on taxpayers with gross income below a certain threshold. A review of the Income Tax Act, as suggested by the submission, is beyond the scope of this bill. Officials also consider that the proposal’s introduction is warranted on the basis that this will significantly reduce the compliance burden and the associated risks for taxpayers with small amounts of residual stock. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Transfers of holiday pay 73 OVERVIEW OF SUBMISSIONS Clauses 9 and 18 The eight submissions on the proposals were unanimous in their support for proceeding with the proposal and divided on the method of doing so. The following is a very simplified summary of what is quite a complex issue. Typically, a net deduction is available for monetary remuneration (such as wages and holiday pay) when it is paid to employees. The law is not clear as to which party, if either, obtains a deduction when employees, and the provisions for monetary remuneration (such as holiday pay) associated with those employees, are transferred from one person (the first employer) to another (the second employer). These transfers usually take place as part of the sale of a business but could, as is pointed out by a submissioner, also occur with the transfer of an employee, typically within a group of companies. When both employers are subject to income tax it is clear that one or the other should obtain a deduction. The second employer, who assumes the employee obligations, is reimbursed, at least in an economic sense, for assuming the employee obligations, by the first employer. A recent Privy Council case made it very clear that under current law the second employer does not obtain a deduction in respect of the provisions assumed. The current scheme of the Income Tax Act makes it difficult, but not impossible, for the first employer to obtain a deduction. Even then there is some uncertainty and compliance costs are incurred. The core proposal in the bill is to clarify current law by ensuring the first employer obtains the deduction. Both parties have to have agreed on the amount transferred for the first employer to get the deduction. There is a special rule for associated parties to ensure that associated persons do not restructure to accelerate the timing of the deduction. As the second employer will need to separate these payments from other monetary remuneration payments, this means the second employer will need to continue to track the amounts transferred, thus continuing to incur compliance costs. An alternative would be to structurally change the law so that the second employer obtains the deduction. While this would further reduce compliance costs, it is inappropriate from a fiscal and conceptual perspective. Another alternative that would further reduce compliance costs is possible, but did not find favour during consultation. Submissions were divided on whether the first employer or the second employer should obtain the deduction. There are a number of ancillary matters that also need to be addressed. 74 WHICH PARTY OBTAINS THE DEDUCTION Clause 18 Submission (4W – Business New Zealand, 17W- KPMG, 12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 15 – New Zealand Law Society) The proposal should be changed so that the second employer obtains the deduction. Comment All submissions on this issue agree that certainty is needed, although there are mixed views on which party should obtain the deduction. The Corporate Taxpayer Group, PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Retail Merchants support first employer deduction, whereas the submissioners above support second employer deduction. The National Council of Women argued that both parties should obtain a deduction, without reconciling the apparent double deduction. The reasons proffered for second employer deduction are: • It is simpler. • It lowers compliance costs. • It aligns the main rule and the associated persons rule. • It means there is no acceleration of the deduction. • It puts both parties in the same position as if the transfer had never happened. • Normal accounting practice provides this. A number of these points are interrelated. There are, however, stronger reasons why the first employer should get the deduction: • It means the deduction follows the expense. The first employer is the one that bears the cost of these provisions as an expense. This is consistent with general accepted accounting practice and, as the Institute acknowledges, is conceptually correct. It is not usual tax practice to give one person a deduction for expenditure that, at least in an economic sense, another person has suffered. • There are potential fiscal implications. The point was made during the limited consultation that occurred on this proposal that vendors may not be able to use the deductions because they are in a loss situation or have insufficient other income against which to offset the deduction. Allowing the second employer a deduction in such circumstances is akin to the transfer of (some portion of) a loss without being subject to the usual limitations that apply on the transfer of losses. Government policy is that losses may not be transferred to non-group companies, and we see no reason to change that policy in this case. 75 • It correctly treats transfers across the tax exempt/taxpayer boundary and vice versa. Turning to the points raised in the submissions: Simplicity and compliance costs Overall, the proposal will reduce compliance costs. This is because the first employer ends up being offered total certainty. These compliance costs are the costs of structuring in order to get the deductions. However, it is true that compliance costs could be further reduced if the deduction was generally made available to the second employer. Some submissions correctly recognise that the proposal will not reduce the second employer’s present compliance costs, while others argued, incorrectly, that they will increase them. The compliance cost issue relates to the acquirer having to separate the payments made in respect of monetary remuneration provisions assumed from the first employer from those made to any other employees the second employer might have. This happens under current law and will still continue under the proposal in the bill. PricewaterhouseCoopers, in its verbal submission, suggested that, so long as there were some appropriate rules to enable these provisions to be tracked, its view was that these costs generally should not be material. This is dealt with below. While it is true that giving the deduction to the second employer would reduce these costs, we consider that the advantages of the first employer getting the deduction outweigh the further compliance savings. Alignment of main rule and associated person rule, no acceleration of deduction and parties in the same position as if the transfer had not taken place We agree that alignment of the rules would be useful. However, it is common to have a general rule and an associated persons rule that ensure the tax base is maintained. While we understand the point being made regarding the acceleration of the deduction, we note it is somewhat unusual for taxpayers to disagree with proposals that accelerate the timing of deductions. In other words, the submissioners’ proposals, on the face of it, are taxpayer-unfriendly. The suggestion that second employer deduction leaves the parties in the same position that they would be if the transfer had not taken place is only partially correct. It is correct from a timing perspective. However, it is incorrect to say the second employer would obtain the deduction as if the transfer had not taken place. 76 Normal accounting Generally accepted accounting practice requires the recognition of expenditure and its accrual as it is incurred. The proposed approach of first employer deduction is consistent with this practice. The change, therefore, is only aligning the tax rules with accounting practice, which has happened in a number of instances over the past few years. It appears that the point being made is the simplicity and compliance cost point made above, that the usual taxation treatment of monetary remuneration is that it is effectively only deductible when it is paid to the employee. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Limit transfers from tax exempt entities Clause 18 Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) If the submission that the second employer obtains the deduction is accepted, there need to be special rules where the first employer was tax exempt or the monetary remuneration provisions would not otherwise have been deductible to the first employer. Comment The submission correctly recognises that when the first employer would not obtain a deduction for monetary remuneration the second employer also should not obtain such a deduction. However, if the principle submission that the second employer should not obtain the deduction is not accepted, this submission falls away. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 77 Issue: The amendment should be retrospective Clause 18 Submission (14 – Corporate Taxpayer Group (CTG)) The amendment should be backdated to apply from the introduction of the Core Provision changes (the 1997-98 income year). (15 – New Zealand Law Society) The second employer should get the deduction and this amendment should be backdated. Comment Allowing the second employer a deduction is a fundamental change in law which is covered in the submission above. In any case, making it retrospective, as suggested by the NZ Law Society, would lead to the possibility of double deductions if the first employer has already claimed a deduction. Therefore retrospective legislation would also be needed to deny any deductions previously claimed by the first employer. We believe that this would be unacceptable. It was proposed that the application date be the date of enactment. While retrospective changes should generally be avoided, we can see some merit in the CTG submission to backdate the proposal in the bill to clarify the law that the first employer gets the deduction. In particular, in theory someone should get the deduction. Under current law that person can only be the first employer, even though this person’s entitlement is not totally clear. Therefore allowing some retrospectivity would achieve the right policy result and prevent inappropriate disputes. Officials recommend that to the extent the first employer has claimed a deduction in the 1997-98 or subsequent income years in a filed tax return which relates to a period before the general application date, that deduction should be grandparented if it qualifies under these rules. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part. 78 Issue: Extension of associated parties rule to restructurings Clause 18 Submission (4W – Business NZ) Associated persons should not be treated differently so as not to impede restructuring for commercial reasons. Comment Business NZ argues that it does not seem right that businesses that restructure for commercial reasons, such as to improve the efficiency of their New Zealand operations, should face a different outcome than if they had sold their business to someone else. Our conclusion is that applying the core proposal to associated persons is only likely to encourage tax-driven restructuring to accelerate the timing of the deduction. Under the proposal in the bill, restructuring within a corporate group will result in the deduction being timed exactly the same as if the restructuring had not occurred. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Extend change to other provisions Clause 18 Submission (7 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposed amendment solves the problem only in respect of wage-related provisions. A more inclusive solution is required in respect of other provisions that transfer. Comment The submission correctly points out that other provisions can transfer between taxpayers. Examples would be provisions for bad debts or repairs. Officials agree that similar issues seem to arise. However, it is not appropriate to consider this wider issue at this stage in the progress of the bill. Officials suggest that the issue be added to their work programme so that it can be advanced as appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 79 TECHNICAL ISSUES Issue: Compliance costs of the second employer tracking the provisions Clause 18 Submission (Verbal submission – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The second employer should be offered a simplified mechanism for tracking the non- deductible amounts. Comment Under current law there is a lack of clarity as to how the second employer tracks the non-deductible provisions assumed. This could be on an employee-by-employee basis or on some sort of more global basis. Officials agree that clarification would be helpful. The second employer should be allowed to calculate the amounts, on a first-in-first-out basis on either a per employee or per group of employees basis, so long as once the employer chooses a basis, they cannot change it. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Section CH 4 not appropriate place Clause 9 Submission (17W – KPMG) Part CH is not the appropriate place to include the provision relating to adjustments in business income. Comment Under the new section CH 4, if the amount actually paid out by the acquirer as monetary remuneration is less than the amount transferred, the difference is income to the acquirer. KPMG correctly argues that this deals with business income rather than employment-related income, which is the focus of subpart CH. Subpart CD seems more appropriate for this provision. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 80 Issue: Clarifying timing rule interrelationships Clause 9 and 18 Submission (7 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The current wording of the proposed section DF 10(4) relating to associated party transfers requires amendment to incorporate a timing rule for associated purchasers. Preferably, this would be achieved by a link to section EF 1. Comment We agree that the rule for associated persons needs to link back to section EF 1 to ensure that the purchaser can use that timing rule for the deduction. Additional words in section DF 10(4) along the lines that "for the purposes of section EF 1, the amount is deemed to be monetary remuneration incurred by the purchaser" provide an appropriate result. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (15 – New Zealand Law Society) The legislation should make it clear that the proposed specific timing rules should be excluded from the scope of section EF 1. Comment Officials agree that there is potential for confusion when comparing the words of these proposals and the existing section EF 1. In fact the submission highlights a structural problem with the proposals. The incurred liabilities are already deductible under the core provisions of the Income Tax Act, but the effective deduction is deferred under section EF 1 until such time as they are paid (and there is some uncertainty about the exact mechanism). Thus, contrary to what is proposed in the bill as introduced, there is no need to provide that these incurred provisions are deductible; rather, there is a need to release these provisions through section EF 1 so there is an effective deduction. This second point is the submissioner’s point. However, there is a need to ensure that the contingent liabilities are deductible as is currently proposed. Depending on how this is done, they too may need to be released through section EF 1. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 81 Issue: New section DF 10 linkage to sale price Clause 18 Submission (7 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 9 – National Council of Women) PricewaterhouseCoopers submitted that new section DF 10(2) needs to link the amount parties can agree between themselves for tax purposes to the actual sale price, inclusive of the actual provisions transferred, to avoid potential distortions. Both submissions suggested that the agreement should be reduced to writing. Comment Under section DF 10, the taxpayer can deduct the provisions for monetary remuneration transferred to the purchaser in respect of employees transferred if the taxpayer and the purchaser agree on the transferable amount. There is a subsequent wash-up calculation designed to ensure that differences between the amounts transferred and the actual amounts paid are brought to tax. The submission argues that section DF 10, as it stands, could cause some uncertainty between the parties. We agree that to avoid doubt over what has been agreed, the agreement between the two parties should be in writing. That amount may not be included directly in the sale price but could arise through a side agreement. The key point to ensure certainty is that the amount should be reflected in the consideration that the two parties exchange. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 82 Issue: Cross-references between section DF 5 and DF 10 Clause 18 Submission (7 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The new subsection DF 5(3) should be amended to include a reference to the new section DF 10 so that the relationship between the two sections is explicit rather than implicit. Comment The proposed subsection DF 5(3) refers to lump sum payments made by taxpayers who take on liabilities as part of the purchase of a business. It therefore implicitly refers to the situations contemplated by the proposed section DF 10. We agree that more explicit cross-referencing may be helpful to the reader. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Extension of associated person rule to transferred employees Clause 9 and 18 Submission (7 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The treatment of associated persons should be extended to cover employees transferred between associated persons. Comment Under the proposed legislation, if a sale of a business is between associated persons, the first employer will not qualify for a deduction but the second employer will be able to claim deductions for amounts that would have been deductible had the business not been sold. Transfers of employees between associated parties need not involve the sale of the business. The employees may simply be transferred, along with their leave entitlements. The legislation should cover this situation, which is a normal intra- group activity. We therefore recommend that the proposal concerning a transfer of a business between associated persons be widened to cover the transfer of employees between associated companies if no sale of the business occurs. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Unit trusts and Category A group investment funds 85 OVERVIEW OF SUBMISSIONS The bill contains a number of proposed changes to the taxation of unit trusts and “Category A” group investment funds. They deal with: • an over-taxation problem for the funds by introducing a new system to address the negative dividend issue so that funds can preserve available subscribed capital (ASC) previously lost on redemptions of units; • a base maintenance amendment to ensure unit trust managers do not receive excess imputation credits on redemptions; and • a remedial amendment to correct a double debit to the imputation credit account. Four organisations made submissions on the proposed legislation for unit trusts and Category A group investment funds: PricewaterhouseCoopers, Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, KPMG and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand. All welcomed the changes relating to the negative dividend issue. There were a number of suggested technical amendments to ensure these rules worked appropriately. To a large extent, officials have recommended that they be accepted. Submissions proposed allowing a refund of income tax paid in advance if there was a credit balance in the new supplementary ASC account. This proposal takes the original proposal a lot further and officials believe it will need further consideration. Officials will continue to work with industry representatives on this issue. For the purposes of this bill, we recommend that the proposals contained in the bill are maintained. A further submission on negative dividends was that Inland Revenue issue detailed guidelines on the calculation of an opening balance for the supplementary ASC account. Inland Revenue is working on developing these guidelines and plans to include them in the Tax Information Bulletin covering the enacted legislation. 86 OVER-TAXATION OF QUALIFYING UNIT TRUSTS AND CATEGORY A GROUP INVESTMENT FUNDS Clauses 49(2), (3), (5) and 51 Issue: Operation of the supplementary available subscribed capital account Clause 51 inserts a new subpart MJ into the Income Tax Act 1994, which provides for the establishment and operation of a supplementary ASC account. This account will record amounts of ASC contributed by unit-holders and members of qualifying unit trusts and Category A group investment funds but not returned to them on redemption of their units. The supplementary ASC account balance can then be converted to imputation credits and transferred to the qualifying unit trust’s, or group investment fund’s, imputation credit account at the end of an imputation year or when the qualifying unit trust or group investment fund ceases to operate an imputation credit account. Only a supplementary ASC account balance sufficient to meet the debit balance in the qualifying unit trust’s or group investment fund’s imputation credit account can be converted and transferred. Submission (13 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 7 – Pricewaterhouse Coopers, 17W – KPMG) As the proposed section MJ 1(1) is currently drafted, there is potential for confusion over whether “start date” is the date of assent or the date from which the trust decides to maintain a supplementary ASC account. The start date should be the date from which the trust decides to maintain an account and the wording should be altered to reflect this. Comment Officials agree that the start date should be the date from which the trust decides to maintain a supplementary ASC account. A trust can choose to start to operate this account on any date on or after the enactment of this legislation. The legislation should be clarified to reflect this intention. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 87 Submission (13 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc) The proposed section MJ 1(2) is not necessary. Any trust wanting to apply section MJ 4(1) would presumably decide to establish and maintain its supplementary ASC account on and after a particular date in that period which they will choose, and by virtue of section MJ 1(1) that will be its start date. Comment The proposed section MJ 1(2) is necessary but should be clarified. Under proposed section MJ 4(1) a qualifying unit trust or Category A group investment fund can choose to calculate an opening balance for its supplementary ASC account. This allows for past transactions that gave rise to the negative dividend issue to be taken into account under the new rules. This calculation must be done as at a date anywhere between the date the legislation is enacted and 31 March 2003. This date can be referred to as the effective date. The legislation should be clear that the start date of the supplementary ASC account in this case is the day following the effective date, and not the day after the calculation is actually performed. The legislation should be clarified in this regard. Recommendation That the submission to remove section MJ 1(2) be declined but the legislation be clarified for the start date for a fund that calculates an opening balance. Submission (13 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 7 – Pricewaterhouse Coopers, 17W – KPMG) The proposed section MJ 3(2) should be amended to clarify that the “first imputation year” refers to the income year in which the “start date” for the supplementary available subscribed capital account occurs. Comment It was intended that the “first imputation year” referred to in the new section MJ 3(2) is the imputation year in which the “start date” falls. Officials agree that the legislation should be clarified to reflect this. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 88 Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The proposed section MJ 4(2)(a) should be reworded to insert the word “realised” after “total amount”. Comment The submission states that “the new present tense language can be confusing” and that it would be preferable to clarify that the calculation is of ASC forfeited on previous realisations. Section MJ 4(2)(a) provides an opening balance calculation for the supplementary ASC account. The MJ 4(2)(a) calculation requires the fund to determine the ASC previously lost based on actual redemptions. Officials are concerned that referring to the amount realised may cause confusion. Realisation is likely to be a concept that is more relevant to the unit-holder or member and not the fund. Officials recommend, therefore, that this change is not made as it could result in additional confusion. However, for purposes of clarity, the reference to “available subscribed capital per share” could be changed to “available subscribed capital per share redeemed”. Recommendation That the submission be declined but additional clarity can be made to legislation by referring to “available subscribed capital per share redeemed”. Submission (13 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 7 – Pricewaterhouse Coopers, 17W – KPMG) The proposed section MJ 4(2)(a) should be redrafted to ensure that it aggregates all the “lost” ASC from redemptions, and that the affected trust is able to aggregate the lost ASC from only some redemptions if it chooses (for example, if records do not allow the requisite calculation for redemptions before a certain date). The section should also exclude “lost” ASC from redemptions which occurred prior to the unit trust/GIF establishing an imputation credit account. Comment It was always intended that if a unit trust or group investment fund chose to calculate the opening balance of its supplementary ASC account by reference to actual redemptions, it could choose to take into account redemptions in some years and not in others. This situation can arise if the fund has inadequate records for some years and so is unable to determine the actual redemptions in those years. The legislation should be clear that this is allowed. We agree with the submission that when using actual transactions only redemptions after the establishment of an imputation credit account should be included. Under the notional liquidation calculation only redemptions following the introduction of the imputation credit account are effectively taken into account. 89 Recommendation That both parts of the submission be accepted. Submission (13 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 7 – Pricewaterhouse Coopers, 17W – KPMG) The definition of “further tax on liquidation” in proposed section MJ 4(2)(b) should be replaced with “further income tax on liquidation”. This definition should refer explicitly to further income tax payable (under section ME 9) as a result of a debit balance in the imputation credit account following the notional wind-up calculation. Comment Officials agree that the legislation should clarify that it is income tax that is payable under section ME 9. Section ME 9 of the Income Tax Act 1994 provides for the payment of further income tax when there is an end of year debit balance in a company’s imputation credit account or a company ceases to operate an imputation credit account. This is the relevant amount of income tax for the purposes of the notional liquidation calculation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (13 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 17W – KPMG) The definition of “tax not available to impute dividends” in proposed section MJ 4(2)(b) needs amendment to ensure that this amount arises only to the extent that the structural features have increased the further income tax to pay. Comment Officials agree clarification is necessary. We suggest that to achieve this clarification MJ 4 (2)(b) should refer to section MJ 4(4), which sets out the features of the tax system that will give rise to amounts that do not have tax payable on them. Consequently, credit for income tax paid on them is not allowed under the notional liquidation calculation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 90 Submission (13 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 17W – KPMG) The definition of “maximum imputation ratio” in section MJ 4(2)(b) should be defined as being the “ratio calculated in accordance with the formula”. Comment The suggestion provides further clarification. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (17W – KPMG) The proposed formula for calculating the opening balance of the supplementary ASC account in section MJ 4(2)(b) needs to clarify whether tax payments made to clear imputation credit account debit balances arising from negative dividends can be included in the calculation of “further tax on liquidation”. Under the current legislation these tax overpayments cannot be recognised as an asset owing to insufficient imputation credits. Therefore, they are not distributed in a notional liquidation and ultimately do not give rise to “further tax on liquidation”. Comment This situation may arise, in particular, when a fund is liquidating and it has prepaid tax that it will not be able to use in the future because liquidation means it has no future tax liability. However, the fund will not be entitled to a refund of this prepaid tax because it has already provided the imputation credits gained from the payment of that tax to shareholders. The attachment of these imputation credits may have arisen out of the negative dividend issue. However, the imputation credits may also have been attached to dividends paid out of capital profits or foreign income for which there are no New Zealand tax credits. If it can be shown on liquidation that the prepaid tax was as a result of the negative dividend issue rather than for the other reasons, the refund of the tax should be available on liquidation. Consequently, we recommend that the legislation provides that on liquidation to the extent there is a credit in the supplementary ASC account, and assuming a nil balance in the imputation credit account, the fund can receive a refund of the prepaid tax. In terms of the opening balance calculation, only actual redemptions will be determinative of the supplementary ASC account credits in such a case referred to above. 91 Recommendation That the submission be declined but an amendment be made to allow for a refund of the tax to the extent that there is a credit in the supplementary ASC account on liquidation and a nil balance in the imputation credit account. Submission (13 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 7 – Pricewaterhouse Coopers, 17W – KPMG) The list of structural features of the taxation and imputation systems referred to in the definition of “tax not available to impute dividends” in proposed section MJ 4(2)(b) should be made a finite list, rather than an inclusive list. In the alternative, if the list is to remain inclusive the structural features of the taxation and imputation systems should be defined in a generic way (with the existing list constituting examples). Suggested wording: “....features by virtue of which a company which does not issue shares on terms subject to section CF 3(1)(b)(iv) would not normally be expected to be able to fully impute a distribution made on liquidation of that company....” Comment Officials are concerned that a finite list could be potentially restrictive and therefore prefer the alternative submission. The suggested wording should be modified, however, to refer to a “New Zealand resident company” and to remove the reference to “normally”. Recommendation That the alternative submission be accepted and the generic wording, as modified, be included in section MJ4 (4). Submission (13 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 17W – KPMG) Proposed section MJ 5(1) should be clarified to apply “in respect of any share redeemed or otherwise cancelled in that imputation year”. In addition, the word “provided” should be used rather than “if”. Comment Officials agree with the first suggestion to make reference to “otherwise cancelled” as well as “redemption”. However, we are of the view that it is better drafting to continue to use “if” rather than replace it with “provided”. 92 Recommendation That the submission be accepted in respect of extending the redemptions to other cancellations, but declined regarding a change from “if” to “provided”. Submission (13 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 7 – Pricewaterhouse Coopers, 17W – KPMG) The proposed section MJ 5(3) should be amended to apply to redemptions that occur on or after the start date. Comment Section MJ 5(3), as drafted, appears to ignore redemptions made on the start date when calculating credits to the supplementary ASC account. This was not intended. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (13 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc) Another methodology should be available as an alternative to the need to track “lost” ASC each time a redemption arises. This sub-section could include, as an alternative, a simple annual adjustment to the ASC account at 31 March, using the notional liquidation calculation in accordance with the proposed section MJ 4(2). Alternatively, this could be refined by allowing the taxpayer to complete a notional liquidation calculation as at the time a debit balance arises in the imputation credit account. Each calculation would be replacement for the last notional liquidation calculation. If this were not considered possible, a second-best approach would be to allow the taxpayer to complete the proposed section MJ 4(2) calculation on liquidation. Comment Officials do not accept the first-best approach set out in the submission. This seems to fundamentally change the basis for determining credits to the supplementary ASC account by moving from recording actual redemptions to determine the lost ASC to redemptions with reference to a regular notional liquidation calculation. While we understand that funds may as a matter of course perform these calculations regularly, it is our preference to continue with the proposal to use actual redemptions to determine lost ASC going forward. This basis also appears to have a lower administrative cost. 93 Officials consider that the second-best approach is a better alternative for funds that do not wish to maintain a supplementary ASC account. Recommendation That the submission on the second-best approach be accepted and the first-best approach declined. Submission (13 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 17W – KPMG) The election referred to in section MJ 6 should be cross-referenced as the election under section MJ 7(1). Comment As a matter of drafting it is preferred that the cross-reference is not included. This does not appear to give rise to confusion as there is only one possible election this can refer to. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (13 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 17W – KPMG) Proposed section MJ 7 should be amended to allow an election at any time of the year for the transfer of a credit balance in the supplementary available subscribed credit account at that time. If this amendment is made, a consequential change will be needed to section MJ 6 to keep it consistent with section MJ 7. Comment This does not appear to cause any problems or tax planning opportunities and therefore officials agree to the change. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 94 Submission (17W – KPMG) The wording of section MJ 7 needs to be amended so that a transfer of a credit balance in the supplementary ASC account can occur to provide a sufficient level of imputation credits to allow for a refund of tax overpayments arising because of negative dividends. Comment Section MJ 7 allows for the transfer of a credit balance in the supplementary ASC account where there is a debit in the imputation credit account. In the described situation in the submission there is no debit in the imputation credit account, as the tax cannot be refunded unless there are sufficient credits in the imputation credit account to make the refund. The refundability of tax paid in advance in order to cover a debit in the imputation credit account was not part of the original proposal for solving the negative dividend issue. This solution was developed by officials and industry representatives. If this refundability is to be included, further thought needs to be given as to the need for a supplementary ASC account. Officials recommend that the proposed legislation be enacted and the issue of refundability be given further thought by officials and the industry. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (13 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 7 – Pricewaterhouse Coopers , 17W – KPMG) An amendment should be made to section MD 2(1A) in clause 48 to allow a refund of tax where the refund is not more than the aggregate of the balance of the imputation credit account and the imputation credit value of the balance of the supplementary ASC account. Comment This refund potential would allow the release of tax that has been prepaid in the past because of the negative dividend problem. The refund will create a debit balance in the imputation account which will be able to be “made good” by the transfer of part or all of the balance of the supplementary ASC account. This issue is different from the previous refundability issue in that it relates to prepaid tax arising out of ASC lost prior to the introduction of the supplementary ASC account. Once again, this refundability issue was not included as part of the original solution. As with the previous issue, we recommend that the proposed legislation be enacted, with the recommended amendments, and further thought be given to the appropriateness of refundability. We note that officials are recommending that a 95 refund of prepaid tax is made on liquidation to the extent that it can be shown there is lost ASC. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (13 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 7 – Pricewaterhouse Coopers , 17W – KPMG) Inland Revenue should issue guidelines on the calculation of an opening balance for the supplementary ASC account using the notional liquidation method. Comment Inland Revenue is working with the industry on developing these guidelines. It is intended that these will be included in the Tax Information Bulletin covering the enacted legislation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 96 EXCESS I MPUTATION C REDITS Clause 5 The proposed section CF 7A ensures that when a unit trust manager redeems units with a unit trust in the ordinary course of its business, to the extent that the dividend constitutes a recovery of the purchase price, the manager (and any persons nominated by the manager) will not be able to utilise the imputation credits received. Issue: Excess imputation credits received by managers of qualifying unit trusts Submission (17W –KPMG) The following words in the proposed section CF 7A(2) should be removed. “to the extent that the dividend, exclusive of the imputation credit, recovers the price paid by the unit trust manager, the trustee or the person nominated by the manager or trustee to acquire the units.” Comment The submission appears to raise concerns with the reference to the recovery of “purchase” price and tries to further define the concept of price. The submission preferred alternative wording. Officials are concerned that this wording may apply more widely than intended. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (Matter raised by officials) The new provision should also cover group investment funds that derive Category A income. Comment The base maintenance issue arising for unit trust managers also arises in respect of group investment fund managers in the same circumstances regarding redemptions. It was intended that the amendment apply to these manager redemptions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Carry forward of losses and credits after a spinout 99 OVERVIEW OF SUBMISSIONS Clause 56 provides for tax losses and credits of a subsidiary company to be preserved on the “spinout” of that company by a parent company. A spinout occurs when the parent company sells its interest in a subsidiary to its own shareholders. The diagram below illustrates the effect of a spinout in the absence of the provisions in the bill. In the diagram, company A spins out its interests in company B and company C – that is, company A sells its shares in company B to its own shareholders. Before the spinout, company A holds all voting interests in company C on behalf of its small shareholders under the concessional ownership tracing rule in section OD 5(6)(b) of the Income Tax Act 1994. After the spinout, company B holds these same interests in company C. From an economic perspective, there is no change in the ownership of company C as a result of the spinout. However, if company B wishes to apply section OD 5(6)(b) after the spinout, there will be a 100% change of ownership interests in company C, and company C’s losses or credits would be cancelled. Shareholders < 10%Shareholders < 10% Company A (deemed ultimate shareholder-100% voting interests) Company B (new deemed ultimate shareholder-100% voting interests) Company B Company C Losses or credits to carry forward Company C No losses or credits to carry forward 100% loss of shareholder continuity Structure beforeStructure after Structure before spinout Structure after spinout 100 The bill preserves the losses by treating company B as holding the ownership interests in company C that were, before the spinout, deemed to be held by company A on behalf of the small shareholders. The rule applies only to the extent that the shareholders in company A and company B are the same immediately after the spinout. Submissions Three submissions have been received on the spinout provisions in clause 56 – from the NZ Law Society, Chapman Tripp and the Institute of Chartered Accountants. They propose extensions and minor amendments to the provisions. 101 MINOR DRAFTING CHANGE Clause 55(18) Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The bill provides that the definition of “nominee” in section OB 1 applies for the purpose of section OD 5(6A). As the term “nominee” is also used in section OD 5(6F), the definition of nominee also should apply for that purpose. Comment We agree with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 102 SIMILAR RULE SHOULD APPLY WHEN THE CONCESSIONARY TRACING RULE IN SECTION OD 5(5) IS USED Clause 56 Submission (15 – New Zealand Law Society) The proposed new rule applies only when a breach in continuity would be caused by a change in the person deemed to hold shares under one of the concessionary rules for measuring continuity of ownership (section OD 5(6)(b)). However, there are other concessionary rules for tracing ownership interests in a company. A similar rule to that proposed in the bill should apply where continuity is measured using the concessionary rule set out in section OD 5(5). That provision enables direct interests of shareholders in a company such as company A who hold less than 10% to be grouped together and classified as a “notional single person”. Comment We agree with the submissioner that a similar rule to that in the bill may be appropriate when shareholders in the parent company are a “notional single person”. However, this requires more detailed analysis – for example, a consideration of the circumstances in which companies will be using that concessionary rule, and whether having two companies (the holding company and the spun out company) owned by the same notional single person fits with the scheme of the concessionary tracing rules. The analysis, and any resulting legislation, is likely to be complex. It is therefore best dealt with as a separate policy issue which progresses through the normal tax policy process. Recommendation That the submission be declined but that the issue be noted for consideration at a later date. 103 TWO-STEP SPINOUT Clause 56 Submission (15 – New Zealand Law Society) The proposed legislation should be extended to apply where: • company A holds a less than 10% interest in company C; and • company B holds no interest in company C; and • as part of the spinout restructuring process, company A wishes to transfer its interest in company C to company B prior to transferring company B to its shareholders. Comment The submission argues that the proposed new rules should be extended so that tax losses and credits are preserved in certain circumstances when corporate restructuring occurs before a spinout. The NZ Law Society refers to the example on the following page. The NZ Law Society considers that a breach of continuity may occur, and therefore any losses or credits may be lost, when the restructuring occurs before the spinout. It points out that this is despite the fact that there is, in substance, no change in economic ownership of C Co on the restructuring. We do not agree that the proposed rules in the bill should be extended to cover corporate restructurings prior to a spinout. Preservation of losses and credits on a corporate restructuring when there is no change in economic ownership is a discrete issue that should be considered separately. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 104 I. Position before restructuring and spinout Shareholder A Co 91% 9% B Co C Co 91% T III. Spinout A Co sells its shares in B Co to its own shareholders Shareholder A Co Shareholder B Co 9% C Co 91% T Shareholder A Co 100% B Co 9% C Co 91% T II. Restructuring A Co sells its interest in C Co to B Co 105 INTERESTS HELD BY PARENT COMPANY IN LOSS COMPANY PRIOR TO SPINOUT Clause 56 Submission 1 (15 – New Zealand Law Society) It is clear from subsection (6A) that the new provisions are intended to apply to prevent a breach of continuity when the holding company (company A) has measured its ownership in the loss company (company C) using the concessional tracing rule in section OD 5(6)(b). It should be made clear in the operative subsection (6B) that the only interests in Company C previously held by company A that will be treated as interests of the spinout company (company B) are those treated as interests of company A under section OD 5(6)(b). Comment We agree that company B should be treated as holding only those interests of company A that are held under section OD 5(6)(b) prior to the spinout. However, a corresponding amendment is required to ensure that taxpayers are not penalised where company A holds indirect interests in company C that are not held under section OD 5(6)(b). The problem arises where there is a significant shareholder in company A who is not receiving shares in the spinout company B. In order to avoid double counting that change in shareholding, commonality should be measured only in relation to the shares held under section OD 5(6)(b) by company A and company B immediately after the spinout. Currently, commonality is measured in relation to all shares in company A and company B immediately after the spinout. So, for example, assume Company A is owned by E (20%) and small shareholders holding less than 10% (80%). Company A is treated as holding 80% of the shares in company C under section OD 5(6)(b). E holds the other 20% of the shares. E is not receiving shares in the spun out company B. Paragraph (6B) should treat company B as holding the 80% interest held by company A in company C under section OD 5(6)(b) prior to the spinout. However, because all the small shareholders in company A also hold shares in the same proportion in company B immediately after the spinout, there should be 100% commonality. (The current provision would allow only 80% commonality). We have discussed this with the submissioner, and two practitioners whose clients are contemplating a spinout in a situation in which there is a significant shareholding in the parent company A. They agree with the proposed amendment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted and that commonality be measured only relation to shares held by company A and company B under section OD 5(6)(b) immediately after the spinout. 106 Submission 2 (15 – New Zealand Law Society) It should be made clear (at least for the avoidance of doubt) that, for the purpose of applying the tax loss and credit continuity provisions on and after the spinout, the original holding company (company A) is deemed not to have held the relevant interests in the loss company (company C) prior to the spinout. Comment For the purposes of applying the continuity provisions after the spinout, the new rules deem the spun out company (company B) to have held the relevant interests in the loss company (company C) for relevant periods before the spinout. By deduction, therefore, company A does not hold the relevant interests in the loss company during those periods. We are concerned about the complexity of the provision, and clarifying this point in legislation adds to that complexity. We therefore propose that, for the avoidance of doubt, this point should be clarified in the Tax Information Bulletin that covers enactment of the legislation. Recommendation That the submission be declined but that the Tax Information Bulletin covering enactment of the legislation state that, to the extent that interests are treated as being held by the spun out company B, they are not simultaneously held by company A. 107 REQUIREMENT THAT HOLDING COMPANY IS A LIMITED ATTRIBUTION COMPANY Clause 56 Submission (15 – New Zealand Law Society) The new rules require that the parent company A holding the interests in the loss company C prior to the spinout be a limited attribution company from the time the loss is incurred until the spinout. This fails to take account of a situation in which company A becomes a limited attribution company (for example, by listing) subsequent to a loss being incurred. It does not appear logical to exclude this situation from the proposed amendments. Comment Broadly, a limited attribution company is a widely held or listed company. There is a requirement in the spinout provisions that the parent company A be a limited attribution company for the period between the incurring of the loss and the spinout to minimise fiscal risk. However, we accept the point raised in the submission that company A may be widely held at the time of the spinout but not at the time the loss was incurred. It should be sufficient if company A is a limited attribution company at the time of the spinout. Recommendation That the submission be accepted so that it is sufficient if company A is a limited attribution company at the time of the spinout. 108 DRAFTING OF DEFINITIONS IN SUBSECTION (6E) Clause 56 Submission (15 – New Zealand Law Society) The definitions of “common market value interest” and “common voting interest” that apply for the purposes of this provision are worded slightly differently from the definitions of the same expressions in section IG 1(5) of the Act. The wording of the definitions is perhaps clearer in the provisions in the bill. It may be prudent to amend the definitions in section IG 1(5) so as to remove any suggestion that the different wording results in an unintended difference in meaning. Comment The definitions of “common market value interest” and common voting interest” in the bill may change to reflect a proposed amendment to the spinout provisions recommended in this report. If this is the case, the submission is no longer relevant. If the definitions are retained in the bill in their current form, we do not favour amending the definitions in section IG 1(5). That section contains definitions of “common voting interest” and “common market value interest” that apply generally for the purposes of calculating a common interest in two companies. The spinout provisions contain their own definitions of those terms for the purposes of measuring the common interest of a shareholder in both the parent company and the company that is spun out. Losses and credits are preserved to the extent of the common interest in both companies. The terms are specifically defined for the purposes of the spinout rules in order to better link the definitions with the substantive provisions. However, the specific definitions have the same effect as the general definitions, and the wording is otherwise almost identical. We do not favour an amendment to the general definitions without the opportunity for general consultation. The rewrite of the Income Tax Act will address issues of inconsistency between provisions and definitions that are intended to have the same effect. The consultative process associated with this will allow an opportunity for others to comment on a proposed redraft of the general definitions. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 109 SHAREHOLDERS WHO INTEND TO SELL SHARES IN THE SPUN OUT COMPANY Clause 56 Submission (18 – Chapman Tripp) A minor amendment to the spinout provisions is desirable to accommodate the possibility of a parent company that is spinning out a subsidiary, retaining shares in the subsidiary on behalf of one or more of the shareholders of the parent company and selling the shares on behalf of those shareholders. Comment As the submission points out, the proposed new section OD 5(6A) already accommodates the possibility that shares in the subsidiary company B may be transferred to a sale agent acting on behalf of shareholders who wish to dispose of their shares in the subsidiary company immediately after the spinout. (The new provisions apply if shares in the subsidiary to be spun out “are transferred to a nominee of a shareholder” of the parent company.) The shares in the spun out company that are held by the nominee are treated as being owned by the shareholder who wishes to sell the share. Because that shareholder will own shares in the parent company A and in the spun out company B, any change in continuity of the spun out company will therefore occur not on the spinout but on the subsequent sale of the share by the nominee. The submission argues that, instead of a separate nominee being appointed as sale agent, the parent company may act as the nominee. If this is the case, the shares will be retained by the parent company, although the capacity in which it holds the shares will change from beneficial owner to nominee on behalf of its own shareholder. We agree with the suggested amendment to the provisions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 110 LOSS OF SHAREHOLDER CONTINUITY ON CORPORATE CONVERSION Clause 56 Submission (Matter raised by officials) A new provision should be included in the Income Tax Act 1994 to ensure that shareholder continuity is not broken in circumstances where a company of proprietors that is established by statute converts to a limited liability company. Comment Officials have been made aware of a potential tax problem for New Zealand companies owned by an overseas company that is to be converted from an unincorporated company of proprietors into a limited liability company. The issue relates to the measurement of shareholder continuity in the New Zealand companies following the conversion of its overseas parent. It is possible that as a consequence of the conversion there will be a technical breach of the shareholder continuity rules for the New Zealand companies, resulting in these companies losing their imputation credits and tax losses at the date of conversion. This is contrary to the policy behind the shareholder continuity rules in the Income Tax Act 1994 because there has been no change to the underlying beneficial ownership of the New Zealand companies as a result of the conversion. The Income Tax Act 1994 should be amended so that it is clear that there is no change in the shareholding as a result of the conversion and therefore no breach of the shareholder continuity rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. GST treatment of warranty payments from non-registered offshore warrantors 113 OVERVIEW OF SUBMISSIONS Clauses 80A, 82, 84 The proposed changes relieve non-registered offshore warrantors of a GST impost on payments made under a warranty agreement that has been included in the purchase price of an imported good. A potential double impost of GST occurs when GST is paid by the final consumer on the value of anticipated warranty repairs that is included in the purchase price of the good as a warranty agreement, and an irrecoverable GST impost is also paid by a non- registered offshore warrantor on the actual cost of warranted repairs. The provisions will remove the potential double impost by zero-rating supplies of goods and services made under a warranty agreement when: • the warranty agreement was included in the purchase price of goods which attracted GST on importation into New Zealand; and • consideration for the supply is paid by the non-registered offshore warrantor. The bill proposes applying these changes from the date of enactment. Seven submissioners commented on the bill’s provisions to zero-rate services in respect of warranty payments made by non-residents. All submissioners supported the policy to ensure that potential double taxation does not arise in relation to goods imported with warranties. All submissioners also commented on the application date, all recommending that the proposals apply retrospectively. Four submissioners made various recommendations of a technical nature. 114 SCOPE OF THE ZERO-RATING PROVISIONS Submission (16 – Motor Industry Association) An alternative argument in the Suzuki case was that, rather than there being a supply to the non-resident warrantor, the importer supplies a service to the customer for which the non-resident warrantor pays consideration. If this interpretation were taken, the zero-rating provision would not apply to the payment by the non-resident warrantor because one of the requisites for zero-rating under the proposed amendments is that a supply is made to the non-resident warrantor. Submission (7 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Clarification should be given as to why in clause 82, the zero-rated supply of repair services is deemed to be the only supply for the consideration given by the non- resident. Comment Following the Suzuki decision, it is clear that when the importer provides a service of remedying a defect under warranty to the non-resident warrantor, payment from the non-resident warrantor is consideration for that service. The proposed amendments seek to zero-rate this supply. Clause 82 is intended to ensure that, where this supply occurs, the payment from the non-resident warrantor cannot be treated as consideration for any other supply (such as a supply of services from the importer to the customer). In this way, based on the Suzuki scenario, the proposed amendments remove any argument that there is another supply not covered by the proposed zero- rating provision. However, if the warranty scenario is varied slightly so that, for example, the non- resident warrantor makes payment directly to a third-party repairer as consideration for services supplied by the repairer to the customer, the zero-rating provisions would not apply. In the same way as in the Suzuki scenario, an effective double impost also occurs in this situation as GST is imposed on the value of the warranty embedded in the purchase price of the good and also on the services provided under the warranty. The proposed amendments are intended to remove the effective double tax impost on warranty payments. The identifying feature of the supplies causing this double impost is that consideration for the supply of services provided under the warranty agreement is given by a non-resident warrantor to a registered business, with the non-resident unable to recover any GST cost associated with the consideration. Officials therefore consider that the proposed amendments should be broadened to ensure that when there is no supply of services to the non-resident warrantor, a payment by the non- resident warrantor to a repairer as consideration for repair services provided under the warranty agreement, is also zero-rated. We recommend that the issue of the deemed single supply be clarified in the Tax Information Bulletin that covers the new legislation. 115 Recommendation That the submissions be accepted and that the operation of the deemed single supply in clause 82 be illustrated in a Tax Information Bulletin . 116 INCLUSION OF GOODS Submission (16 – Motor Industry Association, 12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 11W – Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu) The legislation should be clarified to ensure that the provision of goods under a warranty agreement is zero-rated. Comment The proposed amendments apply to the service of remedying the defect covered by the warranty agreement. Remedying the defect may involve a variety of activities, from repairing a part of the good to replacing the whole good. Submissioners are concerned that because the proposed legislation refers only to services it could be interpreted to mean that only the labour content of repair services, and not the provision of replacement parts and goods, is zero-rated. Officials agree that it is desirable to clarify the proposed amendments so that, whether or not replacement parts are included in the supply, provided it meets the other legislative requirements, the supply will be zero-rated. Recommendation The submission be accepted. 117 DEFINITION OF “WARRANTY” Submission (16 – Motor Industry Association) Replacement of and compensation for defective goods should be included in the definition of “warranty”. Comment GST is imposed on supplies of goods and services made in the course of a taxable activity. Compensation is not consideration for a supply. In the absence of a supply to the non-resident warrantor, the issue of a double tax impost does not arise. When the replacement of the good is required to remedy a defect that is covered by a warranty agreement to which the amendment applies, the supply of the replacement will also come within the provisions, provided the other conditions are met. If the replacement is not covered by the warranty, the cost of the replacement cannot be considered to have been factored into the cost of the warranty. The cost of replacement would not therefore have attracted a GST impost by being included in the good when it was sold. Thus there would be no double impost of GST. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (16 – Motor Industry Association) The reference to the “supply agreement” in the definition of “warranty” should be deleted. Comment This term is used in the legislation to distinguish between different warranty arrangements. When the value of the warranty is embedded in the purchase price of the good, GST is paid on that value as part of the GST impost on the total purchase price. However, when a warranty agreement is given separately from the goods and the value is readily identifiable the warranty may not be subject to GST. Alternatively, in the case of a registered purchaser, the warranty may be subject to GST, for which an input tax credit may be claimed. Therefore, repair services performed under such an agreement should not be zero-rated. Officials consider that the term “supply agreement” best describes an agreement that includes a warranty given for the good supplied but may be, for example, contained in various documents other than the sale and purchase agreement. Officials consider it would be beneficial to advise in a Tax Information Bulletin item that “supply agreement” refers to the sale and purchase agreement and other agreements such as the importation and warranty agreements that are interdependent with the sale and purchase agreement. 118 Recommendation That the submission be declined but that what can be regarded as a “supply agreement” be described in the Tax Information Bulletin. Submission (11W – Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu) The reference to the warranty being “given under the supply agreement” should be replaced with “given together with the supply agreement” to include warranty agreements that are given by a separate entity in the supplier group but not separately charged for. Comment The proposed wording would open a potential loophole in relation to offshore warranty agreements that are given with the good but not included in the purchase price of the good and, therefore, do not attract GST. When an offshore warrantor gives a warranty separately from the good both the provision of the warranty and any payment under that warranty will be outside New Zealand’s GST base and, therefore, not subject to GST. As clause 84(1)(ma) requires only that the goods have been subject to tax, the proposed wording would allow zero-rating of repair services performed under warranties which have not been subject to a GST impost. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (16 – Motor Industry Association) Product recalls should be included in the definition of “warranty”. Comment The Motor Industry Association has advised that, in many instances, the cost of product recalls is factored into the price of goods and covered by a warranty agreement included in that price. In that case, the proposed amendment would already apply to the cost of product recalls. Supplies that result from a product recall but are not provided under warranty are, however, outside the scope of the proposed amendments, which are directed at ameliorating the taxation effect of the Suzuki decision on warranties. Officials note that the cost of product recalls may also be provided for in other ways, such as such as under a general insurance contract, and may therefore not attract an effective double tax impost. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 119 Submission (16 – Motor Industry Association, 12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 7 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 11W – Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu) The phrase “without further cost to the recipient” should be deleted. Comment Many warranty arrangements provide for some cost to be met by the warranty holder. This portion of the services should not be zero-rated because it is in addition to the purchase price of the goods and has not therefore attracted a prior GST impost. However, officials agree that a contribution to the cost of warranty repairs by the warranty holder should not preclude the portion of warranty repairs that is met by the warrantor from being zero-rated when that portion has been anticipated in the purchase price and therefore charged with GST. This intention is already met by the phrase “to the extent that”, which contemplates the apportionment of supplies when consideration is paid by more than one person. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (16 – Motor Industry Association) In the definition of “warranty” for the purpose of the zero-rating provisions, the phrase “during a certain period of time after the goods are supplied or before a certain level of usage is reached” should be replaced with “during a specified amount of time, distance or other measure of use”. Comment The term “specified” raises the issue of what would constitute valid specification and would therefore add complexity to the legislation. The primary concern is that the terms of the warranty arrangement are identified and agreed. This intention is met by requiring that the terms be “certain”. It is also important to ensure that only defects that become apparent after the good has been supplied, and are therefore not reflected in a discounted purchase price, be included in the zero-rating provisions. The submissioners proposed wording does not distinguish between defects that are apparent at the time of sale and defects that become apparent after sale. In addition, the use of distance as an example of measured use is redundant and may colour the interpretation in a manner inconsistent with the wide range of products and use that may be covered by warranties. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 120 Submission (16 – Motor Industry Association) The definition of “warranty” should be included in section 2 of the GST Act, the interpretation section. Comment If a definition relates only to a specific section it may be inappropriate to include the definition in a general interpretation section. However, if a term is used in more than one section of the Act it is usual to place the definition in the general interpretation section to ensure it is accessible. In response to submissions discussed above, officials recommend amending the proposed legislation by inserting the term “warranty” into section 5 as well as section 11A. The proposed definition is intended to apply only to these two amendments, and the term is not used anywhere else in the Act. The definition can therefore be moved to section 2, the general interpretation section, without it applying more broadly than intended. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 121 DEFINITION OF “WARRANTOR” Submission (16 – Motor Industry Association) To ensure clarity, the term “warrantor” should be defined as a person providing a warranty. Comment Often the supplier, who is providing the warranty with the supply of the good, will not be the same person who is liable under the warranty. The person liable under the warranty agreement is also providing the warranty. A definition of warrantor would add complexity and may restrict the application of the section unnecessarily. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 122 APPLICATION DATE OF AMENDMENT Submission (16 – Motor Industry Association, 12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 7 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 11W – Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, 17W – KPMG, 4W –Business NZ, 8W – CablePrice) The amendment should apply from the introduction of GST, 1 October 1986, for the following reasons: Integrity of the tax system The current legal position on warranty payments is not ideal as evidenced by the proposed amendment and it is unfair to leave taxpayers exposed to an effective double impost for periods prior to the amendment of the enactment. Failure to remedy this unfairness will undermine the integrity of the tax system and, in particular, taxpayer perceptions of that integrity, to the detriment of compliance. Clear expectation Taxpayers had a clear expectation from the introduction of GST, based on a shared interpretation in the motor industry, that warranty payments were not subject to GST. This interpretation is validated by the proposed amendment and supported by the fact that GST is not generally payable in respect of warranty payments in the UK, Canada or Australia. The Government has legislated retrospectively at other times to validate taxpayers’ interpretation where it was inconsistent with the law but consistent with the correct policy outcome. The recent amendments in relation to inbound tourists are an example of where taxpayers’ understanding of the policy was confirmed. To be consistent, the Government should amend the legislation to comply with taxpayer expectations. Fiscal cost The fiscal impact of retrospectivity, estimated by officials to be up to $10 million in GST that would be refunded and a further amount of up to $25 million that would otherwise be collected, is not material from the Government’s perspective, but is material to the affected taxpayers. Further, the fiscal cost of the amendment is likely to be less than that anticipated by officials. Compliance cost The prospective application of the amendment gives rise to significant compliance cost concerns because of the considerable amount of detail required to respond to the Inland Revenue’s audit activity in this area. 123 Comment Officials agree that the correct policy result is not to impose GST in these cases. The issue is whether GST relief should be retrospective or prospective. The underlying presumption in law-making is that legislation should operate on a prospective basis. Prospective application ensures that taxpayers can make decisions on the basis of laws that are not unexpectedly altered. That is constitutionally proper, fair, and allows for rational economic decision-making. This does not mean that legislation should never be applied retrospectively. Rather, it sets a norm that legislation should be prospective in application unless specific circumstances warrant a departure. When the issue of retrospective legislation has previously been considered by this Committee, officials have argued that retrospective legislation is justified when it restores or at least does not contravene the rational and legitimate expectation of all parties. This principle does not justify retrospective changes in the law to produce an appropriate policy outcome that, had it been considered at the time, would have been reflected in the legislation. Incorrect policy outcomes arising from faults in the legislation should in general be corrected prospectively. Hence, elsewhere in this bill it is proposed to correct expense deductions for petroleum mining on a prospective basis even though no one suggests that this is anything other then the correct policy outcome. Applying a rational and legitimate expectation test Parallels have been drawn in the submissions with the government’s decision to introduce retrospective legislation in relation to the issue concerning GST refunds to inbound tourist operators and educational institutions. In that instance, however, there was wide consultation and full debate from the introduction of GST regarding the correct policy and tax treatment of inbound tourism. Both taxpayers and the government understood that the effect of the law was, as intended, that inbound tourism was subject to GST. This was seen as justifying a retrospective change in the law but not to the extent that taxpayers had filed returns on the basis that no GST was payable. Taxpayers who had not paid GST on inbound tourist operations were deliberately not subject to retrospective law change on the basis that they evidenced an expectation that this was the correct legal position. There was no detailed policy consideration of GST on warranties when GST was introduced. The issue was considered by the Taxation Review Authority in 1996, and it concluded that GST is payable. This was confirmed by decisions of the High Court (in 2000) and the Court of Appeal (in 2001). This requires the Inland Revenue Department to review past GST assessments in appropriate cases but, under Inland Revenue’s interpretation of the law, it can only increase an assessment as far back as four years (from now to 1998). 124 Any retrospective legislation would need to reverse the prior judgement of the Court of Appeal as it affected parties to that litigation. While taxpayers may have interpreted the law as being that GST on warranty payments was not payable, and while this may be the correct policy outcome, it is difficult to conclude that this was other than an interpretation of the law that was proved to be incorrect. To see this as of itself a justification for retrospective application would create a new and expanded precedent for retrospective tax changes, both for and against taxpayers, creating considerable uncertainty as to the future stability of our tax laws. Fiscal cost Officials disagree with the suggestion that the amount of money in question, up to $35 million, is not significant. While the exact amount in issue has been difficult to determine, this figure is officials’ best estimate of tax that would be refunded or not collected through audit activity by Inland Revenue in relation to both the motor vehicle industry and other industries with similar arrangements. Officials can find no basis for the submission that the fiscal costs would be less than the $35 million estimated by officials. Compliance costs While taxpayers may incur some cost as a result of audit activity in this area, it is not anticipated that any cost in addition to that normally incurred in the course of audit activity would arise. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Other policy changes 127 PENSIONS PAID BY PARTNERSHIPS Issue: PAYE and ACC levies Clauses 13 and 16 Submission (7 – PricewaterhouseCoopers , 12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The submissions support the proposal to clarify that partners in a partnership can deduct pensions paid to former partners. However, to alleviate compliance costs, PricewaterhouseCoopers also proposes that pensions paid under the proposed section DF 8A should be subject to PAYE. This change would apply prospectively to allow pension payers time to modify their systems accordingly. This change could be achieved by an addition to the definition of “salary and wages” in the Income Tax Act 1994. PricewaterhouseCoopers recommends that such pensions should not be subject to ACC premiums. Comment Applying PAYE to pensions will mean that pensioners, if they have no other income or have other income that is withheld at the correct rate, will not be required to: • file an income tax return since tax will have already been deducted at source; and • comply with the provisional tax rules in respect of tax payable on the pensions. The point made by PricewaterhouseCoopers is valid in terms of reducing the compliance costs associated with paying these types of pension. However, as the submissions correctly point out, changing the definition of “salary and wages” would result in the pensions being subject to ACC levies. We also note that similar pension payments made by employers to former employees are also subject to ACC levies, which appears to be an inappropriate outcome. We therefore conclude that this area needs wider consideration rather than the separate changes suggested by the submission. Recommendation That the submissions in regard to PAYE and ACC be accepted in principle, but that further work be done on the ACC problem for pensions paid by both employers and by partnerships and that these measures be applied contemporaneously . 128 Issue: Use of section DF 1 for partnership pensions Clause 13 Submission (17W – KPMG) The submission argues that section DF 1 is not the appropriate section to amend as it relates to employee expenditure and, therefore, a new section DF 1A would be more appropriate. Comment Section DF 1 lists certain expenditures that are not allowed as deductions unless there is a specific deduction rule for them in the Income Tax Act. The proposed change merely adds pensions paid to former partners to that list, with the relevant deduction rule being added through the new section DF 8A. The appropriate grouping of these various provisions is an issue that is being addressed as part of the rewrite of the Act. In the meantime, we consider it appropriate to include the change in section DF 1. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: R eference to spouse remarrying in new section DF 8A Clause 16 Submission (17W – KPMG) The submission proposes that new section DF 8A(1)(c) be amended to exclude the reference to a spouse remarrying. Comment The submission argues that such a rule is outdated. Officials note, however, that the inclusion of the reference to remarrying extends the criteria under which pensions are deductible and is, accordingly, taxpayer-friendly. The point is that if the deed under which the pension is payable limits the pension until remarriage, the Tax Act should follow suit. The Income Tax Act 1994 is currently being reviewed for consistency with the Human Rights Act 1993. The terms “spouse” and “remarriage”, which also occur in tax law detailing the payment of employee pensions on which these provisions are based, will be considered as part of that review. 129 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Two-person partnerships Clause 16 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The legislation should allow deductions to sole traders if they pay pensions to former partners. Comment The draft legislation relates to a continuing partnership, but it is possible that a two- person partnership may be wound up on the retirement of one of the two partners and for the remaining partner, as a sole trader, to pay the retiring partner a pension. While we acknowledge this could happen in practice, we believe it would be unlikely. However, on balance, we agree the legislation should allow deductions to sole traders if they pay pensions to former partners. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 130 TAX DEDUCTIONS FOR BRIBES Clause 19 Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 7 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Tax deductions should be allowed for payments to foreign public officials that are not considered illegal under the Crimes Act 1961. The definitions cross-referenced to the Crimes Act 1961 should be repeated in the tax legislation, and several words in the proposed section DJ 22(1) are redundant and should be removed. Comment An amendment in the Crimes Amendment Act 2001 ensured that bribes made to foreign public officials are criminal offences according to the Crimes Act 1961. Payments to foreign public officials are not illegal under the Crimes Act if these payments are legal in foreign public officials’ jurisdictions. This amendment was made in accordance with New Zealand’s obligations under the OECD’s Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions. The proposed amendment to the Income Tax Act 1994 would deny deductions for payments made to foreign public officials that are illegal under the Crimes Act. This amendment would also deny deductions for payments that would not be unlawful acts under the Crimes Act because they were legal in foreign public officials’ jurisdictions. Both submissions suggested it was inappropriate to take a stronger stance than the Crimes Act and that payments to foreign public officials that are legal should be deductible. The Institute of Chartered Accountants also queried whether the draft amendment is consistent with the approach taken in other countries and suggested that differences in the treatment of bribes for tax and criminal purposes could result in greater compliance costs for taxpayers. Officials agree that the amendment should be more closely aligned to the Crimes Act so that payments to foreign public officials that are legal in the foreign country are deductible. Officials note that aligning the criteria for deductibility of payments to foreign public officials more closely with the criteria used to determine illegality in the Crimes Act would be consistent with the approach undertaken by Australia. To claim these deductions, taxpayers must ensure payments made to foreign public officials are not offences under the laws of the officials’ countries. The Institute suggested that the definitions of terms that are cross-referenced to the Crimes Act 1961 should be included. Officials believe that including terms that are cross-referenced would result in unnecessary duplication. Referring directly to the Crimes Act would prevent the need for corresponding legislative amendments to be made to the Income Tax Act should any further amendments be made to the Crimes Act. 131 Officials agree that the words “offers” and “agrees to give” can be removed from the amendment as offering or agreeing to give a bribe would not be sufficient to create an entitlement to a tax deduction. However, officials consider that use of the words “corruptly” and “improper” should be retained as they assist in conveying the nature of payments that would be non-deductible. Removing these terms would also be inconsistent with the wording used in the Crimes Act. Recommendation That the submissions to allow deductions for payments that are not criminal offences under New Zealand law, and to remove words describing the offering of bribes from the proposed section be accepted. That the submission to include terms that are cross-referenced to the Crimes Act 1961 and to remove the words “corruptly” and “improper” be declined. 132 PETROLEUM MINING DEDUCTIONS Clauses 10, 11, 20, 55(5) and 57(1) Issue: Transitional provisions Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 15 – New Zealand Law Society, 7 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The new provisions should apply to contracts entered into on or after 3 December 2001. Comment We agree that transitional provisions should be introduced for clauses 10, 20, 55(5) and 57(1). This will mean that the new provisions apply generally only to contracts entered into on or after 3 December 2001. These transitional provisions will ensure that any petroleum miner that entered into a contract before 3 December 2001 to dispose of a controlled petroleum mining entity will obtain a deduction for the cost of shares or trust interests in that entity. Clause 11 should not have transitional provisions. It removes a drafting error that could provide a petroleum miner with a deduction on disposing of a controlled petroleum mining entity in addition to the deduction for the cost of shares or trust interests in that entity. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in relation to clauses 10, 20, 55(5) and 57(1). Issue: Clause 11 (Section CJ 7) Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Section CJ 7 is no longer required. Comment Officials agree that section CJ 7 is no longer required. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 133 DEBT FORGIVENESS FOR TRUSTS Issue: Resettlements of trusts Clauses 25 and 27 Submission (7 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposed new sections EH 5(2A) and EH 52(2A) should be amended to clarify: • the point in time at which the trust receiving the resettlement distribution must satisfy the tests in sections EH 5(1)(b) and EH 52(1)(b); • that, for the purposes of satisfying these tests, the resettlement distribution should be treated as if it were itself a forgiveness of debt by the creditor. Comment The policy rationale underlying new sections EH 5(2A) and EH 52(2A) is to ensure that a trust that has qualified for the “natural love and affection” concession in relation to past debt forgiveness and resettles its assets on a second trust will not automatically trigger the rules that claw back this concession. The intention is that this claw-back will not occur if the second trust, like the original trust, is established to benefit charities or beneficiaries for whom the creditor had “natural love and affection”. We agree that, under the current drafting, this result is not achieved as clearly as it could be. The problem stems from the fact that the tests for whether the second trust meets the relevant criteria are contained in sections EH 5(1)(b) and EH 52(1)(b). The criteria in these sections do not concern the distribution of assets under a resettlement but, rather, the forgiveness of debt by a creditor. The current wording does not recognise this and provides simply that the claw-back will not apply if the second trust satisfies the criteria in sections EH 5(1)(b) and EH 52(1)(b). This gives rise to the issue of when the second trust is required to satisfy these criteria. As it stands, the drafting is unclear on this point. It could be: • the time the second trust was established; or • the time the debt was forgiven to the first trust; or • the time of distribution. The intention is for the criteria to apply at the time of distribution. Therefore, as the submission notes, the draft provisions should be amended to provide that, upon resettlement, an assessment is required to ensure that the criteria in sections EH 5(1)(b) and EH 52(1)(b) would be met. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 134 Issue: Distributions not taxed twice Clauses 25 and 27 Submission (7 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposed sections EH 5(3A) and EH 52 (3A) should be amended so that their application is limited to gross income arising by application of sections EH 5(3) and or EH 52(3). Comment The proposed sections EH 5(3A) and EH 52(3A) are intended to clarify that distributions that are treated as gross income of the trustee under the claw-back rules cannot give rise to a second layer of tax as beneficiary income. As the submission correctly points out, the current drafting is potentially wider than this and could be read to include all gross income derived by the trustee rather than simply income derived by virtue of the claw-back rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 135 BLOODSTOCK DEPRECIATION RATES Clause 28 Submission (Matter raised by officials) A drafting error in clause 28 should be corrected. Comment Officials have discovered an error in the current drafting of the amendment in clause 28 of the bill. This error precludes broodmare owners with “late balance dates” (for example, 31 July) from applying the amendment in respect of broodmares purchased between 1 April 2001 and that balance date, in respect of the 2001 year (31 July 2001). The Government and officials have previously represented to the bloodstock industry that the amendment will apply in respect of all broodmares either first depreciated or purchased on or after 1 April 2001, irrespective of the balance date of the relevant bloodstock owner. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (19 – New Zealand Thoroughbred Breeders’ Association) An immediate 100 percent specified write-down (depreciation) rate should be allowed for stallions. Similarly, broodmares aged 12 or older (“old broodmares”) should be allowed to be written off in the year of purchase. Comment The submission is beyond the scope of the current bill. Officials have, however, conducted analyses on the depreciation rates for stallions and old broodmares and the results suggest that the current depreciation rates are broadly correct. The relevant data supporting officials’ conclusions was provided to both the Finance and Expenditure Committee and the submissioner at the Committee’s request. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 136 GST – NON PROFIT BODIES Clause 81 Submission (9W – National Council of Women of New Zealand Incorporated, 12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Submissioners agree with the proposed amendment to clarify that non-profit bodies are entitled to claim input tax credits for GST paid in relation to all their activities except the making of exempt supplies. Comment The Government announced in the discussion document Tax and Charities (released June 2001) proposals to clarify the legislative basis for registered non-profit bodies to claim deductions of input tax by allowing deductions in relation to all activities except the making of exempt supplies. The amendment therefore confirms that non-profit bodies are, for example, able to claim input tax credits in respect of the activity of collecting donations. This change will provide greater certainty for charities and other non-profit bodies in relation to their GST obligations and will reduce compliance costs. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Remedial amendments 139 EXCLUSIONS FROM TERM “DIVIDENDS” Clause 4 Submission (3W – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) The submission agrees with the proposed change, but argues that it should be retrospective. Comment Given that the amendment corrects an historical anomaly, there is no reason why it should not be backdated to, say, the application date of the current Income Tax Act 1994. It is officials’ judgement that taxpayers will always have interpreted the law as it is now being amended, so retrospectivity provides absolute certainty. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 140 REFERENCES TO “GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES” Clauses 6, 8, 23, 24, 30 to 32, 45, 55 Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The bill replaces references to “generally accepted accounting principles” with references to “generally accepted accounting practice”. There should be an exclusion for non-resident reporting entities that report using generally accepted accounting principles. Comment The term “generally accepted accounting practice” is defined in the Financial Reporting Act 1993 and encompasses all standards approved by the Accounting Standards Board and those that have authoritative support in New Zealand. This amendment is to clarify the law and is not intended to impose more rigorous standards than those imposed currently. Officials will explain the intention of the amendment in a Tax Information Bulletin once the legislation is enacted. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 141 EXEMPTION FROM SUPERANNUATION FUND WITHDRAWAL TAX Clause 12 Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 17 – KPMG) The application date of the amendment should be altered to apply to withdrawals made on or after the date of Royal assent. Comment The amendment was intended to apply in respect of superannuation fund withdrawals made on or after the date of enactment of the fund withdrawal tax legislation. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 142 ACCOUNTING FOR GST Issue: Consequential amendments to correct cross-referencing errors Clause 17 Submission (Submission – 17W KPMG) Several consequential amendments are required to section ED 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994 following the enactment of the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000. Specifically, the reference to section 21(3) contained in section ED 4(3)(a) should refer to section 21I(1) – (3). Comment Section ED 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994 set out the rules for taking into account GST when calculating taxable income. In general, GST does not factor in determining gross income or in respect of claiming deductions. However, section ED 4(3) allows GST to be included in deductions for items for which a change in use adjustment is required under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The amendments proposed by the submissioner were enacted by the Taxation (Beneficiary Income of Minors, Services-Related Payments and Remedial Matters) Act 2001. Officials note, however, that further clarification is required in respect of the reference to section 21(1) contained in section ED 4(3)(a) and ED 4(4)(b). The reference should be corrected to read section 21. As part of the reforms enacted by the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000, section 21(1) was re-written and expanded to the present section 21(1) – (5). A reference to section 21 will include these new subsections. The amendments should apply from 10 October 2000, the date that the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000 was enacted. Recommendation Note that amendments proposed by the submissioner have already been enacted in the Taxation (Beneficiary Income of Minors, Services-Related Payments and Remedial Matters) Act 2001. Officials recommend that the reference to section 21(1) in sections ED 4(3)(a) and ED 4(4)(b) be corrected to refer to section 21. The amendments should apply from 10 October 2000 the date that the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000 was enacted. 143 Issue: Deductibility of GST on fringe benefits Clause 17 Submission (4 – Business NZ, 17 – KPMG, 12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Clause 17 should be withdrawn from the bill. It would deny an income tax deduction for the GST payable on the taxable value of fringe benefits. Comment It was not intended to deny a deduction for this item of GST. The change underlying clause 17 is the recharacterisation of this GST as fringe benefit tax for the purposes of administration so that it can be paid with fringe benefit tax rather than as a separate item in the GST return. Initially there was concern that the recharacterisation had the potential to create the confusing result that the GST is deductible twice, once as fringe benefit tax under section ED 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994 and again as GST under section ED 4(3). However, officials now consider that this is not the case and agree that clause 17 should be removed. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 144 ABSOLUTE ASSIGNMENT OF A FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENT WITH DEFERRED CONSIDERATION Clause 26 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The proposed change to ensure that absolute assignments of financial arrangements with deferred consideration will not terminate the financial arrangements should also be applied to legal defeasances with deferred consideration. Comment In substance, legal defeasances with deferred consideration have the same effect as absolute assignments with deferred consideration. Therefore terminating financial arrangements when there are legal defeasances with deferred consideration could result in potential double taxation, as it could for absolute assignments with deferred consideration. Double taxation could occur because legal defeasances with deferred consideration create new financial arrangements that will be taxed on an accrual basis consistent with the accrual rules. However, terminating financial arrangements could lead to deferred consideration being taxed under the base price adjustment rule. This is not an intended policy result. Therefore officials consider that this amendment should be extended to legal defeasances with deferred consideration. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 145 THE MINOR BENEFICIARY RULE – CLARIFICATION OF SECTION HH 3D(1)(c) Clause 33 Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Clause 33 is intended to clarify that the $1,000 threshold for application of the minor beneficiary rule relates to the value of the loan(s) provided to the trust, not to the value of the interest forgone on the loan(s). The Institute supports the policy objective of the proposal but considers that clause 33(1) does not clarify the meaning of section HH 3D(1)(c) as intended. It recommends that the wording of clause 33(1) be reconsidered. Comment Officials agree that the proposed amendment to section HH 3D(1)(c) may still leave some uncertainty as to whether the $1,000 value relates to the settlement on the trust (the interest forgone on the loan), or whether it relates to the value of the loan itself. Officials therefore recommend that this provision be clarified by adding an express reference to the loan having a total value of not more than $1,000. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 146 NON-STANDARD INCOME YEAR PROVISIONAL TAXPAYERS Clause 46 Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Taxpayers that were prevented from electing to be provisional taxpayers because of an unintended result of a previous amendment should be allowed to make this election retrospectively. Comment An amendment to section MB 2A in the Taxation (Annual Rates, GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000 had the unintended result of preventing certain taxpayers from electing to become provisional taxpayers. The amendment applied from the 1998-1999 income year. The proposed amendment corrects the unintended result of the previous amendment and allows non-standard balance date taxpayers to elect to be provisional taxpayers when they first furnish a tax return. Although the proposed amendment would apply from the 1998-1999 income year, some non-standard balance date taxpayers that would have otherwise elected to be provisional taxpayers have already furnished returns and, in accordance with the current law, not elected to be provisional taxpayers. Officials agree with the Institute submission that those taxpayers that have already furnished a tax return and were prevented from making this election should be allowed to make it retrospectively. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 147 MULTI-RATE FBT – LOW-INCOME REBATE AND MULTI-RATE CALCULATION Issue: Compliance costs Clause 52 Submission (4W – Business New Zealand) Business New Zealand does not oppose the amendment in the bill but wishes to note its concerns with the greater compliance cost of FBT, which have occurred following the introduction of the top personal rate of 39%. The complexity of the new multi-rate rules means that in certain cases it is uneconomic for businesses to take advantage of paying the lower FBT rates. The compliance costs in collecting FBT are very high in comparison to the total revenue raised from FBT. Business New Zealand asks the Committee to endorse the recommendation of the Ministerial Panel on Business Compliance costs for a first principles review of FBT. Comment The amendment to fringe benefit tax legislation in clause 52 is of a minor nature and ensures that employers are not required to ascertain an employee’s tax residence in calculating the tax on the employee’s cash remuneration. The multi-rate FBT rules allow employers to choose FBT rates that better correspond to the remuneration they provide to the employee receiving the fringe benefit. Employers can either pay 64% on all fringe benefits or use the multi-rate calculation. Their choice of method is a trade-off between compliance costs and accuracy. The multi-rate method of calculating FBT was introduced to ensure that middle and low-income employers were not overtaxed on the value of fringe benefit provided to them. The Government, as part of its tax policy work programme, has announced that a review of the FBT rules will begin later this year. One of the key areas of this review will be to look at options to simplify the administration of FBT and reduce compliance costs. Recommendation Note that Government intends to begin a review of the FBT rules later this year. 148 Issue: Remedial amendment of clause Submission (Matter raised by officials) Clause 52, amending section ND 5(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994, should apply on or after 1 April 2000 for employers paying FBT on quarterly or annual basis. Comment In clause 52 the definition of “tax on cash remuneration” is being amended to ensure that the full low-income rebate applies in the multi-rate calculation, irrespective of the employee’s tax residence. The Taxation (Beneficiary Income of Minors, Services-Related Payments and Remedial Matters) Act 2001, enacted early last year, included an equivalent amendment to section ND 5(2) of the Income Tax Act. However, as a result of an oversight, section ND 5(1) was not amended at the same time. Amending clause 52 corrects this oversight. The amendment as drafted has an incorrect application date from 1 April 2001. The correct application should be from 1 April 2000 to coincide with the amendment to section ND 5(2) Recommendation That clause 52 applies to fringe benefits provided: • on or after 1 April 2000 for employers who pay fringe benefit tax on a quarterly or an annual basis; and • during the 2000-2001 or subsequent income year for an employer who pays FBT on an income year basis. 149 OTHER MINOR TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS Issue: Non-filing taxpayers Clause 55(19) Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The proposed reference to section 33A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in the definition of “non-filing taxpayer” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 should be replaced with a reference to section 33A(1). This change should be done because section 33A includes references to individuals required to file returns and, therefore, referring to the whole of section 33A may have unintended consequences. Comment The reference to section 33A of the Tax Administration Act was included in clause 55(19) of the bill to ensure that the exclusions listed in section 33A(2) were imported into section 33A(1), which lists the natural persons who are not required to furnish a return of income for an income year and will not receive an income statement. There would be a risk that the exclusions in section 33A(2) would not be imported into section 33A(1) if the definition of “non-filing taxpayer” simply referred to section 33A(1). Officials agree, however, that referring to the whole of section 33A in the definition of “non-filing taxpayer” may unintentionally be interpreted as including a reference to natural persons who are required to file returns because some provisions in section 33A refer to filing taxpayers. Officials therefore consider that the reference to section 33A in clause 55(19) of the bill should be changed so that it refers to natural persons to whom section 33A(1) applies after the application of section 33A(2). Recommendation That the submission be accepted to the extent outlined above. Issue: Minor remedial amendment to incremental late payment penalties Clause 75 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Legislation introduced in the Taxation (Beneficiary Income of Minors, Services- Related Payments and Remedial Matters) Act 2001 to reduce the impact of late 150 payment penalties for those who pay just a few days late had two unintended consequences. It: • removes the mechanism for cancelling penalties on a debt if before 1 April 2002 the taxpayer entered into an instalment arrangement or compulsory deduction action started; and • prevents incremental late payment penalties from applying if the initial late payment penalty or incremental late payment penalties were imposed before 1 April 2002. Officials recommend that: • the effect of the former section 183B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 be reinstated in cases where instalment arrangements or compulsory deduction action started before 1 April 2002; and • section 139B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 be amended so that incremental late payment penalties can be imposed regardless of whether earlier penalties were imposed under the current or previous penalty legislation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 151 GST – PENALTY INTEREST Clause 85 Submission (11W – Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu) The proposed change to extend the exempt treatment of penalty interest to charges imposed under statute is supported. However, if the word “interest” is given a narrow interpretation the amendment will not apply to other penalty charges that may arise, particularly late payment charges not in the form of interest. This raises doubts as to whether the amendment achieves its policy intent. Comment The amendment extends the application of section 14(3) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, which treats the payment of interest arising from late payment as consideration for an exempt supply. At present, the legislation applies to interest charged under a contract. The amendment extends this treatment to interest charged by a public or local authority under statute. The question raised by the submissioner concerns where the boundary between exempt and taxable supplies should be drawn. As outlined in the government discussion document GST: A Review (March 1999), and as enacted in the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000, penalty interest should not, in principle, be subject to GST. The change was largely a simplification measure to remove the uncertainty about the treatment of such payments. In most cases penalty interest is equivalent to the payment of interest on the outstanding balance of the purchase price. The charge therefore compensates for the time value of money, and is comparable to other exempt supplies included in the section 3 definition of “financial service”. The submissioner argues that the term “late payment charge” would better reflect the intent of the amendment and avoid concerns that the term “interest” would be read too narrowly. As noted above, the intention of the amendment is to remove payments which compensate for the time value of money from the scope of the tax. However, late payment charges can be used to recover costs in addition to the time value of money, such as the ongoing use of a good or service or administrative costs. To extend the scope of the amendment as suggested would not therefore necessarily be consistent with the original policy intent and would create inconsistencies between penalties charged under contract and those imposed under statute. Drawing the boundary to include supplies beyond “interest” confuses the intent of the legislation and potentially exempts other supplies that should be subject to GST. Officials note, however, that the term interest could be read narrowly and possibly exclude payments in the nature of interest. Officials recommend that clause 85 be amended to include charges, either under statute or contract, that compensate for the time value of money but might not be specifically labelled as interest. An example of this arises under the Rating Powers Act which authorises the imposition of an additional 10 percent levy if payment is not made by the due date. 152 Recommendation That the submission be declined but that clause 85 be amended to include charges in the nature of interest. 153 GST – CHANGE-IN-USE ADJUSTMENTS Clause 87 Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) It would be tidier if the amendment was incorporated as new paragraph 23G(1)(c) rather than the proposed new subsection 21G(1A) of the GST Act. Comment The amendment improves the interpretation of law as it relates to making adjustments for changes in use. Specifically, the amendment changes the placement of the rule allowing one-off adjustments for assets with a value of less than $18,000, to better reflect that the adjustment can indeed only be made once and is not applicable on a period by period basis. Section 21G(1) provides a general rule in respect of the timing of adjustments allowed under section 21F. The general rule requires that adjustments for changes in use be made either on a taxable period by taxable period basis or annually. Consistent with the current drafting style of tax bills, the concession to allow a one-off adjustment for assets with a value of less than $18,000 is separate from the general timing rule and it is appropriate that it is included in a separate section. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 154 ERRORS OR OMISSIONS BY THE COMMISSIONER Submission (5W – Maurice Halligan, 6W – Maurice Marshall) If the Commissioner or his staff makes an error or omission the Commissioner should be required to refer such an omission after a period of twelve months to an ombudsman for settlement, thus ensuring the matter will reach a finality. (Maurice Halligan) The Commissioner should be required to process all returns, say, within fifteen months, with any failure to be reported back to the Finance and Expenditure Committee for action, by the taxpayer, or for there to be an ombudsman to whom such problems could be referred. Comment In relation to the submission from Mr Marshall, officials have discussed the issues raised. In relation to both of the submissions which proposed that issues be settled by an ombudsman, taxpayers have the right to take any issue they have to the Ombudsman for consideration Recommendation That the submission be declined but that officials note that taxpayers may go to the Ombudsman at any time they wish.
1 August 2002 From Inland Revenue’s Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue OVERVIEW OF TAX POLICY Inland Revenue’s Policy Advice Division, jointly with the Treasury, advises the Government on all aspects of tax policy and social policy measures that interact with the tax system. Its other roles include: • forecasting tax revenues • drafting tax legislation • negotiating and maintaining New Zealand’s network of double tax agreements with other countries • providing ministerial services. The Policy Advice Division has a relatively small staff. It includes about 40 policy analysts directly responsible for the management and delivery of the tax policy work programme. The Policy Advice Division aims to be the best possible professional strategic manager and communicator of tax policy and related social policy projects. We achieve this by good management of all aspects of the Generic Tax Policy Process, managing policy projects through from initial identification of issues to final implementation and review. Policy project management The stages of our project management are: 1. Identifying issues in tax and related social policy areas through our linkages and communication with: • our Minister(s) • the taxation profession • the private sector • other parts of Inland Revenue • other government departments such as the Treasury, Ministry of Economic Development and Ministry of Social Development. 2. Developing those issues into policy proposals, taking into account how this will be managed through to implementation and review. This involves early 2 identification of potential problems and options and how these might be handled. 3. Managing the consultation process in accordance with the Generic Tax Policy Process. 4. Supporting the process through to Ministerial and Cabinet stages. 5. Supporting the process through the legislative phase from drafting through to the House, select committees and enactment. 6. Implementation and review of the policy. No policy project is a success until it is successfully implemented and operating. This requires Inland Revenue to provide appropriate information on the new rules to taxpayers and their advisors and Inland Revenue staff. It also requires the new rules to be integrated into existing operational systems by way of form design and necessary changes to the computer system. These issues need to be considered throughout policy development and carried through after legislation is enacted. This means that the Policy Advice Division needs to work closely with all areas of Inland Revenue, and there must be adequate time for operational requirements to be met. An example of a project requiring this coordination are the new, fairer and more consistent debt and hardship rules determining how Inland Revenue should treat taxpayers who are in financial difficulty and cannot immediately meet their tax obligations. A bill introducing the new rules is still before Parliament, awaiting its second reading. It provides for an application date of 1 July 2002, but this will need to be deferred to later in the year to allow for the six or more weeks necessary to implement the final stages of the relevant system and process changes. After a new policy has been implemented and has been operating for a period, it is desirable to review it to identify and correct problems that have emerged in practice. An example of such a review is the progressive, post-implementation review of GST, which resulted in an initial discussion document in 1999, with ensuing legislation in 2000, and a second discussion document last year. The previous Government also announced its intention to begin a post-implementation review of the taxation of fringe benefits later this year. The importance of good tax policy Tax policy necessarily involves complex technical issues. In providing advice on such matters we analyse the technical arguments and communicate the policy consequences of the options. What can appear to be issues of a quite technical nature often have significant implications for: • the Government’s overall fiscal position • businesses and other taxpayers • overall government policy, by altering the incentives to work, save or invest in one activity over another. 3 About 85 % of total government revenue comes from income tax and GST. Both taxes are levied on a broad base, meaning that they affect most things that happen in the economy. One consequence of this is that tax policy issues arise across the broad spectrum of government activity and policy. For example, over the past few years tax policy has had an involvement with about 29 policy areas. Tax policy in wider government activities • Accident compensation reform – Inland Revenue's role as a collector of premia • Agriculture – producer board reform • America’s Cup – taxation of yacht crews • Art and culture – taxation of films • Business – tax compliance cost reduction • Defence – taxation of personnel on active service outside New Zealand • Economic policy – the role of tax in promoting growth and innovation, taxation of savings and protecting the fiscal position • Education – student loans and taxation of school trustees • Electronic commerce – Electronic Transactions Bill • Environment – carbon charge and environmental taxes • Foreign Affairs – OECD work on Pacific Island tax havens, double tax agreements • Gambling – review of gambling taxes • Health – taxation of hospital boards • Immigration – relationship between immigration status and tax residence • Justice – Bill of Rights and human rights issues • Labour – Paid Parental Leave • Local government – taxation of local authority trading enterprises and GST treatment of rates • Mäori policy – Mäori authorities review • Racing – amortisation rates for stallions and broodmares, Racing Bill • Science and research – deductibility of research and development costs • Social policy – Child Support, Family Tax Credit, Paid Parental Leave and taxation of charities • Statistics – use of IRD income and GST data • Sport – taxation of amateur and professional sports • State-owned enterprises – tax status of SOEs • Telecommunications – GST rules • Tourism – GST treatment of tourists • Transport – taxation aspects of shipping review, taxation of toll roads • Treaty of Waitangi – tax treatment of Treaty settlements • Women’s Affairs – deductibility of child care expenses The importance of tax issues and the potential impact of tax on a wide area of government policy means that it is especially important for tax policy to be well managed. 4 The policy development process Since 1995 tax policy has been developed in accordance with the Generic Tax Policy Process. This is a process designed to ensure better, more effective tax policy development through early consideration of key policy elements and trade-offs of proposals, such as their revenue impact, compliance and administrative costs, and economic and social objectives. Another key feature of the process is that it builds external consultation and feedback into the policy development process, providing opportunities for public comment at several stages. Consultation throughout the process contributes to greater transparency of policy- making, allowing the government to set out the policy objectives of proposals and the trade-offs it has made in developing them. Therefore it helps the private sector to understand the rationale behind government policy proposals. Major tax initiatives are now subject to much greater public scrutiny at key stages in their development—from broad proposal through to post-implementation review. As a result, we now have more opportunity to develop workable options for reform by drawing upon information provided to us by the private sector early in the process. The increased opportunity for consulting on tax policy has resulted in increasing numbers of individuals and organisations making submissions on proposals, whether set out in a discussion document or introduced in a taxation bill. Submissions are becoming increasingly technical, lengthy and detailed, which in turn makes the process lengthier and requires greater policy and parliamentary resources. The tax policy work programme One of the first steps for the new Government in relation to the Generic Tax Policy Process is to develop a three-year revenue strategy that is effectively linked with the Government’s economic strategy. It sets out the Government’s tax policy objectives. The next stage is the development of a rolling three-year tax policy work programme that gives effect to the revenue strategy. Developing the three-year work programme involves scoping broad policy proposals and prioritising and sequencing the development of initiatives. We also look at budgeted resource requirements to develop the initiatives, the time needed to develop, legislate for and implement them, and modes of consultation and communication to be employed throughout the process. This stage of the Generic Tax Policy Process culminates in a joint report by Inland Revenue’s Policy Advice Division and the Treasury to the Treasury Ministers and Minister of Revenue that outlines a policy work programme proposed by officials. Once approved, that joint work programme becomes a detailed tax policy purchase agreement between the Government and the two Departments. When it is made public, as it usually is, the work programme is received with much interest by the tax and business communities, to whom it provides certainty and an understanding of the Government’s direction in tax policy. 5 As time passes, it is inevitable that policy initiatives not considered when the work programme was developed will need to be added to it, and there will be more items on the programme than can be progressed during the three-year period. There is a danger, however, that initiatives will be added without reviewing priorities. This places a major strain on finite tax policy resources and parliamentary resources, and results in slower progress for some existing priorities. It is important that when items are added to the work programme, existing priorities are reviewed to ensure that the Government’s expectations across the work programme are met. The management of the work programme will be a key issue for both Ministers and officials in ensuring that priorities are delivered as agreed. The 1999 – 2002 tax policy work programme Following the implementation of Labour’s pledge commitment to increasing the top marginal tax rate, the main themes of the 1999 – 2002 tax policy work programme were: • New Zealand in a world economy. This covers, for example, expanding our network of double tax agreements with other countries, extending the New Zealand and Australian imputation systems to relieve double taxation of companies operating in both countries, and considering issues relating to the taxation of inbound and outbound investment. • The coherent taxation of savings and the entities through which people invest and save. Gathered under this theme, for example, are initiatives such as reviewing the application of GST to financial services and introducing a progressive tax for employment-based superannuation. • Tax simplification and reduction of tax compliance costs. Recent examples include looking at ways to reduce compliance costs for small to medium-sized businesses, modernising the taxation of organisations that manage Mäori assets held in communal ownership and rewriting the Income Tax Act. • Protecting the revenue base. This includes, for example, closing loopholes as they are identified and considering legislation to counter mass-marketed tax schemes. The New Zealand tax system In the tax policy area, the last government put considerable resources into the Tax Review 2001, chaired by Robert McLeod. The main conclusion of that review was that the basic features of our current tax system are sound, a conclusion with which we agree. 6 Fundamental Features of the Tax System: • Reliance for most of our tax revenue on a broadly based income tax and consumption tax (GST). The Government relies on these taxes for about 85% of its revenue. Both tax bases have relatively few concessions by international standards. This enables them to collect relatively high levels of revenue at relatively low tax rates. • An income tax that is moderately progressive in nature. As the Tax Review noted, our income tax rate structure is never likely to be really effective at redistributing income between different New Zealanders. That is because there are few high-income earners, and lower-income earners tend to be on welfare benefits that are set in after-tax terms. The bulk of income tax revenue is collected from the group of middle-income earners. Thus any income redistribution objective is more effectively met through government expenditure. • A company tax system based on imputation. The imputation system, introduced in 1988, provides shareholders with a credit for tax paid at the company level, which offsets tax on dividends. This reduces the cost of new equity raising needed by expanding companies and ensures that companies are not penalised relative to other forms of commercial organisation. Features of our tax system that seem to vary most from those of similar overseas countries: • Our lack of a threshold level of income before tax is payable. We achieve a similar result in net terms through the family tax credit mechanism. The difference between our threshold and those of other countries is that ours is targeted at low-income families and does not, for example, apply to the children of high-income families. This is why a one-income family with three children under 13 pays no net tax until parental income exceeds $30,435. • Our lack of a capital gains tax. The Tax Review 2001 investigated this issue and concluded that such a tax would collect relatively low levels of revenue at a substantial economic and compliance cost. • Our relative lack of special incentives and exemptions in our income tax and GST bases, such as tax incentives or exemptions for retirement savings. This has allowed us to raise a relatively high level of tax revenue at what are, in international terms, moderate marginal rates. This is not to suggest that the tax system is perfect. It can be improved, which needs to be the focus of the next tax policy work programme. 7 Key challenges in tax policy A new work programme A big challenge in constructing the next work programme will be balancing competing demands for the resources of Ministers, Parliament, officials and the private sector. The Generic Tax Policy Process has, in our view, been a success in producing better quality tax policy, although it has led to an ever increasing requirement for consultation and information. Major tax policy initiatives can now require consultation, an issues paper or discussion document, further consultation, a business compliance cost study, a regulatory impact statement, a bill commentary and the release of a lengthy (often 100 or so pages long) officials’ report on submissions on a bill to Parliament’s Finance and Expenditure Committee. This is a very resource-intensive process to which further requirements are continuously being added. Setting priorities There is also a need to balance the resource requirements of maintaining the revenue base and the Government’s main tax policy initiatives against initiatives of non- Finance/Revenue Ministers in, for example, the areas of social policy or sectoral assistance, which can have substantial tax implications. It is also necessary to provide room in the work programme to meet private sector concerns where tax legislation is identified as causing unintended practical problems. Finally, there is an increasing demand for tax policy resources to be allocated to international tax matters such as the OECD and trans-Tasman tax matters. This reflects the increasing extent to which New Zealand needs to take into account international tax trends in setting its domestic rules. Given the breadth of government policy areas that have tax implications, the complexity of tax issues and the limited resources available to deal with them, it is essential for Ministers to discuss and set out their tax policy priorities. Since many areas of government raise important tax policy issues, the allocation of tax policy resources is likely to affect the Government’s ability to pursue non-tax policy objectives. This is especially the case in areas of economic development and social policy. It is therefore desirable for Ministers in those areas to be clear about the implications of the tax policy work programme for policy development in their areas. Budgetary fiscal rules The tax policy work programme can also be affected by any budgetary fiscal rules the government decides to adopt. There is a need to ensure that any fiscal discipline on expenditure also applies in an equal way to initiatives that would reduce tax revenue. Otherwise there is an incentive for expenditure initiatives to be packaged as tax initiatives. 8 On the other hand, if tax initiatives reducing revenue must always be balanced by initiatives increasing revenue, this can force the Government to adopt a tax policy work programme that unintentionally places too heavy a tax burden on the economy. The ability to trade off the costs and benefits of law changes against changes in compliance and enforcement as alternative means of maintaining revenue bases also needs to be accommodated within the fiscal rules. The tax policy implications of any fiscal rule proposals, therefore, need to be considered before such rules are adopted. Tax concessions There has been an increasing trend by those looking to reduce impediments to the growth of priority economic sectors to seek sectoral tax reductions or concessions. This adds to the strain on tax policy resources and could undermine the broad tax bases our tax system and moderate rates rely upon. Inevitably, because tax collects a proportion of any businesses profits, it is an impediment to the development of all sectors of our economy. That, however, is the inevitable cost of raising revenue to meet government expenditure commitments. Sector-specific concessions will increase the impediments faced by other sectors and therefore need a high level of justification. Tax simplification and compliance cost reduction Tax simplification and business compliance cost reduction is another area where there is strong demand for change. The need to raise revenue at low overall cost places limits on the amount of simplification possible, although we consider there is still room for progress. Tax simplification tends to be an incremental process as there is no big, single solution that suits all taxpayers or businesses. Moreover, there are limits on simplification, as a revenue loss is usually involved, and taxpayers often want more accurate, tax calculations, even if they are more complex. A problem for New Zealand in achieving substantial compliance cost reductions is that relative to similar countries overseas, our tax system is already reasonably simple. Much simplification work overseas involves mitigating or removing complexities which do not exist in our system. Officials’ current focus is on reducing compliance costs for small business. Small businesses form a large group, 85% of New Zealand enterprises having fewer than five employees. Each small business faces similar compliance obligations as those of much larger businesses, making their costs high relative to the tax they pay. There is a concern that these compliance costs may be hindering small business growth at critical stages in their development. This can only be to the detriment of New Zealand’s economic development. We are therefore reviewing policy and processes that impose compliance costs and developing a continuing programme for their reduction. Not all compliance costs arise because of legislative requirements— taxpayers may also be incurring unnecessary business costs because of the way Inland Revenue operates. Therefore simplification requires review of both the policy and operational aspects of the tax system. 9 International tax issues Tax policy over the next few years will also need to focus increasingly on international tax matters. The world is becoming more integrated and tax systems more affected by overseas developments. Both capital and labour are becoming more mobile and more sensitive to tax. This makes it necessary to consider the international tax issues raised by the Tax Review 2001 and to monitor our company tax base, which is the most susceptible to threat from international competition. An increasing focus is also needed on trans-Tasman tax issues and developments in liaison with Australia. The growth of electronic commerce also poses risks and opportunities that we need to meet, such as through GST reverse charging. Taxation of savings A final challenge in the tax policy area will be to settle the debate on the future tax treatment of the savings of individuals. On one hand, our tax impost on savings is relatively high by international standards (because of the lack of concessions). On the other hand, it is the very lack of savings tax concessions that allows us to retain moderate tax rates. There is no easy way to reduce our tax on savings without a substantial increase in tax rates applying elsewhere. The legislative programme A heavy tax legislation programme awaits Parliament when it reconvenes. One of the two taxation bills carried over from the previous Parliament has as its main feature the comprehensive reform of the taxation of organisations that manage communally owned Mäori assets; that bill is awaiting select committee consideration. The main feature of the other is the introduction of new rules for the administration of tax debt. The bill has been reported back and is awaiting its second reading. We see the passage of this second bill as a particular priority, given the wide impact of the new debt and hardship rules, which were originally proposed to apply from July 2002. As well, a bill containing the rewrite of the Income Tax Act, to make tax law easier to understand and apply, was scheduled to be introduced this year. Although this bill is not intended to incorporate policy changes of significance, it will probably be the largest bill ever to be introduced and inevitably covers complex technical issues. The Responsible Gambling Bill is before the Government Administration Committee. The Bill is concerned with the regulatory environment for the gaming industry but also introduces a problem gambling levy that Inland Revenue would collect. Final decisions on other tax matters related to gambling are still to be made. The 2002 legislative programme also included the provision of drafting instructions to the Parliamentary Counsel Office for a Child Support Amendment Bill to be introduced next year. 10 We have the resources to draft and progress two taxation bills a year, provided they do not overlap at two highly resource-intensive stages: when a bill is being drafted and its accompanying commentary being prepared for publication, and when officials are preparing their report on submissions on a bill that is before a select committee. Other policy initiatives As well as progressing legislation still before Parliament, the previous Government had announced tax reform proposals in a number of areas. These will need to be reviewed or advanced. These reform proposals (and their current status) are: 1. GST on Imported Services. A discussion document was released in June 2001. The Government announced in March 2002 that further action would be deferred until the issues could be considered in tandem with those in a forthcoming discussion document, GST and financial services. 2. Tax Review 2001. It was announced in the 2002 Budget that the Government would consider implementing the Tax Review’s recommendations on changes to the foreign investment fund tax rules and the taxation of migrants, and would release for discussion officials’ analysis behind their advice that tax rates for non-resident investors should not be lowered. 3. Mass-marketed Tax Schemes. An officials’ issues paper published in January suggested legislative changes to defer tax deductions on schemes seen as undermining the tax base and would require their registration. Consultation has continued. 4. Trans-Tasman Triangular Tax. In March the Australian and New Zealand Governments issued a jointly prepared discussion document outlining proposals to relieve the double taxation of investments in Australian and New Zealand companies that operate in both countries. Consultation has taken place here and in Australia. 5. Charities. A discussion document on tax and charities was released in June 2001. It led to the establishment of a working party in November that issued its first report in March 2002 and a second report in May 2002. Legislation related to the first report, an increased maximum rebate for donations and extension of the corporate tax deduction, is in a bill before Parliament. The Government announced that a charities commission would be established to approve and register organisations seeking charitable status for tax purposes. 6. Tax and Privilege. A discussion document narrowing the ambit of legal privilege for documents prepared by lawyers but widening privilege to tax advice produced by non-lawyers was released in May 2002. Submissions are being received and considered. 7. Post-implementation Review of Fringe Benefit Tax. Ministers stated that a review of the fringe benefit tax rules would begin this year. 11 8. Review of Specified Superannuation Contribution Withholding Tax. With Ministerial approval, consultations have taken place on how the withholding tax on employer superannuation schemes can be aligned with the tax rate of employees for whom those contributions are paid. 9. Review of the compliance and penalty legislation. A review of the relatively new compliance and penalty legislation, which was introduced in 1997, began in October 1999. The review has continued, with the release in August 2001 of a discussion document on proposed changes that were included in the two taxation bills that are still before Parliament. Planning for the next stage of the review is under way. It is expected to consider how taxpayer behaviour has changed as a result of the new rules; examine whether the rules encourage voluntary compliance; and compare New Zealand’s rules, including the extent of non-compliance and the scale of penalties, with those of other countries.

May 2002 Taxation (Annual Rates, Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill REGULATORY IMPACT AND COMPLIANCE COST STATEMENT One goal in formulating tax law is to ensure that the costs of the tax system are minimised. However, compliance costs must be balanced by the need to protect the tax base, ensure an efficient tax system, and to treat all taxpayers fairly. The majority of the proposals in the bill are aimed at reducing tax-related compliance costs, and all aim to improve the efficiency and equity of the tax system. Compliance cost statement The following proposals in the bill reduce compliance costs: • Tax pooling: Tax pooling will reduce compliance costs associated with the payment of provisional tax. It will do so by providing an administrative mechanism that will allow taxpayers to manage the uncertainty inherent in the calculation and payment of the tax. They will have the opportunity to mitigate their tax payment risks, along with their exposure to use of money interest. Another advance arising from tax pooling is that it will involve the introduction of intermediaries, who will provide a communication link between taxpayers and Inland Revenue. To the extent that participating taxpayers choose to deal with their pooling intermediary, their need to communicate with Inland Revenue regarding their tax payments will be reduced. • PAYE intermediaries: The ability of employers to voluntarily transfer their PAYE obligations to accredited intermediaries will reduce compliance costs for employers. The initiative will reduce the barriers to employers of using intermediaries to meet PAYE obligations and support those who currently use intermediaries to help meet those obligations. One of the key benefits of the initiative is that employers’ exposure to the risk of non-compliance with the PAYE rules would be greatly reduced. Employers would be able to transfer the responsibility of calculating and paying PAYE and filing returns to the extent that they provide the intermediary with correct payroll information and employees’ gross wages as agreed between them. Currently, employers who fail to pay the correct PAYE deduction by the due date could face both late payment and shortfall penalties. Late filing penalties also apply if PAYE returns are not filed on time. In addition, outstanding PAYE balances of more than $100 attract use of money interest charges. An important outcome is that employers will be able to transfer resources spent in meeting their PAYE obligations to other activities in their business. 2 • Depreciation and amalgamation: These proposals will reduce compliance costs by clarifying the interaction of the depreciation rules and the amalgamation rules. They will ensure that companies which amalgamate are treated equitably in respect of their depreciation deductions. • Reimbursement of interest expenses: The proposal will reduce compliance costs by removing any uncertainty that occurs when a person reimburses another party for interest expenses incurred as part of film production expenditure. The person will be able to deduct the reimbursement as if it were film production expenditure they had incurred themselves. • Conduit tax relief, branch equivalent tax accounts and residual income tax: These proposals will slightly reduce compliance costs as they provide certainty that the law is as was originally intended. • Rationalising the terminal tax payment date provisions: Compliance costs will be reduced because it will be easier for taxpayers to determine their terminal tax payment dates. Other provisions that refer to terminal tax payment dates can be made significantly more concise as they can refer to one provision instead of several. • Onus of proof: This proposal will allow the courts to reduce the Commissioner’s assessments when the taxpayer can prove that the amount assessed is excessive. This is likely to reduce taxpayers’ compliance costs in reducing the costs of disputing assessments. • Tax in dispute: This proposal is likely to reduce compliance costs in that taxpayers generally will no longer be required to pay half the amount being disputed. • Capping shortfall penalties: This proposal will reduce compliance costs in that taxpayers will no longer dispute cases in order to reduce the penalty. • Promoter penalties: This proposal will reduce compliance costs as promoters of arrangements will be more accountable for their actions and take more care in ensuring that the tax effects of the arrangements they offer are correct. • Telecommunications services: The amendments reduce compliance costs for telecommunications suppliers. 3 The following proposals in the bill increase compliance costs: • Unacceptable interpretation: This proposal will increase compliance costs in that taxpayers will be required to take extra care in interpreting the legislation in cases where there is a significant amount of tax at stake. To counter this increase the thresholds over which this penalty is imposed are being increased. Those taxpayers taking tax positions which fall under the proposed new increased thresholds will have reduced compliance costs. • International cruises: The compliance costs of zero-rating international cruises are likely to be minimal. The amendment will not result in a significant change in practice, as GST is not currently being returned on these supplies. The following changes in the bill do not change compliance costs: • Annual rates: The amendment to confirm the annual rates of income tax for the 2002-03 income year will have no impact on compliance costs. • Taxation of Maori organisations: The Maori authority proposals are aimed at clarifying and simplifying tax compliance for Maori authorities and minimising the extent to which individuals who derive benefits from these organisations must interact with the tax system. Like all reforms that involve significant change, the new rules will involve an initial compliance cost as taxpayers and their advisors become better acquainted with the new changes. On going compliance costs for Maori authorities will vary from entity to entity depending on the sophistication of their internal systems, access to expert tax advice and the knowledge of their trustees or administrators but these costs should not be any greater than what Maori authorities currently face. Individuals who derive benefits form Maori authorities may face lower compliance costs, as there will be less need for them to file a tax return or request a personal tax summary at the end of the year. Overall, people affected by the proposed changes should receive compliance benefits from having a modern and clear set of legislative provisions that are more relevant to their specific needs and which fit better with other parts of the income tax legislation. • Charities: The amendments to do not change compliance costs. • Good behaviour: This proposal is likely to have no effect on compliance costs. It is aimed at ensuring those taxpayers who have a history of good behaviour are not overly penalised when their compliance does lapse. The proposal is likely to increase the incentives on taxpayers to voluntarily comply. • Information gathering powers: The proposal reduces compliance costs by removing uncertainty, by ensuring that the legislation clearly specifies the obligations on both the Commissioner and the taxpayer. 4 Consultation The proposals contained in the bill were, with the exception of an anti-avoidance measure and minor remedial amendments, subject to the Generic Tax Policy Process, a robust consultative and tax policy development process. For most measures in the bill, this process included the release of the following discussion documents: • Taxation of Maori organisations • More time for business • Tax and charities • Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review • GST and imported services To support the discussion document on the taxation of Maori organisations, information workshops were held in 22 regions around the country. The purpose of these workshops was to raise awareness about the proposals set out in the discussion document and to encourage people to make submissions on the proposed changes. Specific consultation was undertaken with a number of professional groups, industry representatives and individual taxpayers, according to their expertise on the proposed amendments. This included consultation with: • Cruise New Zealand • Federation of Maori Authorities • Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand • New Zealand Law Society • Telecom New Zealand Limited • The Maori Trustee • Trustees and administrators of Maori organisations • Vodafone Group (UK) • Vodafone New Zealand Limited • A number of small businesses, charitable organisations and tax advisers.

OECD model tax treaty updated
=============================

Changes clarifying tax avoidance provisions are the most significant made to the latest version of the OECD's Model Tax Convention on Income and Capital, published late last month.

The model, a sample treaty that forms the basis for most bilateral tax treaties entered into by most countries, and its commentaries are of particular importance in the interpretation and application of tax treaties.

In its double tax agreements, New Zealand closely follows the OECD model and regularly takes part in the work of the OECD to maintain and revise the model.

For more information on the latest changes, see our special report [2003 update to the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and Capital](/news/2003/2003-02-03-oecd-model-tax-treaty-updated#specialreport)
.

The updated convention can be purchased from the [OECD's online bookshop](http://www.oecdbookshop.org/en/page/index/)

A special report by the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue  
3 February 2003

### 2003 update to the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and Capital

The 2003 update to the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and Capital makes some significant changes in relation to tax avoidance issues. They clarify that provisions of tax treaties generally will not conflict with domestic anti-abuse rules, and address concerns over misuse of the treaty by persons to obtain inappropriate benefits.

The other main changes relate to recent work by the OECD in the area of electronic commerce and on the definition of "permanent establishment". A new Article on the provision of assistance in the collection of taxes has also been introduced.

#### Clarification of domestic anti-abuse rules

Changes to the commentaries to Articles 1 (Persons Covered) and 10 (Dividends) of the OECD model have been made to remove uncertainty or ambiguity regarding the compatibility of domestic anti-avoidance rules with the provisions of tax treaties. Key clarifications include the following:

*   States do not have to grant the benefits of a tax treaty where arrangements have been entered into that constitute an abuse of the provisions of the treaty.
*   "Substance-over-form", "economic substance" and general anti-abuse rules forming part of the basic domestic rules for determining which facts give rise to a tax liability are not affected by tax treaties. Thus, as a general rule, there will be no conflict between domestic anti-abuse rules and provisions of a tax treaty.
*   Controlled foreign companies legislation which results in a state taxing its residents on income attributable to their participation in certain foreign entities is generally not contrary to the provisions of tax treaties.

### Restricting the entitlement to treaty benefits

Further changes have been made to the commentaries to Articles 1 (Persons Covered), 10 (Dividends), 11 (Interest), 12 (Royalties) and 23 (Elimination of Double Taxation) to address concerns over misuse of the treaty by persons to obtain benefits to which they are not directly entitled.

The changes look at the use of the "place of effective management", "permanent establishment" and "beneficial ownership" concepts to resist inappropriate treaty claims, and propose some specific limitation of benefits provisions which states may consider including in their treaties. There is also some discussion on issues arising under the OECD Harmful Tax Practices project.

#### Clarification of the application of the permanent establishment concept in e-commerce

The 2003 update includes changes to the commentary to Article 5 of the OECD model (Permanent Establishment) that clarify how the permanent establishment concept applies in the context of e-commerce. These important changes were made public by the OECD at the beginning of 2001, and were noted on this web site on 25 January 2001. The changes include the following key points:

*   A web site cannot, in itself, constitute a permanent establishment.
*   A web site hosting arrangement - where the web site of a business is hosted by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) - typically does not result in a permanent establishment.
*   An ISP will not typically constitute a dependent agent of another enterprise so as to constitute a permanent establishment of that enterprise.
*   A business that owns or leases a server will not necessarily have a permanent establishment where the server is located.

#### Treaty characterisation of e-commerce payments

The update incorporates changes to the commentary to Article 12 of the OECD model (Royalties) resulting from a consideration of whether particular e-commerce payments should be characterised as payments for the sale or lease of property, for the provision of a service, or as a royalty.

Note that New Zealand has reserved its position on one finding of the report, that payments for the use of digital products (such as software) cannot be considered as payments "for the use of, or the right to use, industrial, commercial or scientific equipment". This is because Inland Revenue is currently considering issues relating to the tax treatment of software generally, in response to submissions received on a draft ruling it published last year.

#### Issues arising under Article 5 (Permanent Establishment)

As part of its continuing work in the area of permanent establishments, the OECD has considered a number of practical cases that relate to the application and interpretation of the current provisions of the OECD model that define the concept of permanent establishment. The changes resulting to the commentary to Article 5 of the model address the following issues:

*   Problems in applying the "fixed place of business" standard under paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 5 (geographical link requirement, time requirement, relationship between the enterprise and the fixed place of business, place of management, active v. passive activity, cables and pipelines, sub-contractors).
*   Problems in the treatment of building sites and construction or installation projects under paragraph 3 of the Article (supervisory activities and the aggregation of construction contracts, computation of the construction period, scope of the reference to "installation project", multiple installation projects, renovations, coherent geographic whole, place of management of several construction sites).
*   Problems in identifying preparatory and auxiliary activities under paragraph 4 of the Article (error correction in paragraph 25, clarification of the "deeming" language, storage facilities).
*   Problems related to agency permanent establishments under paragraphs 5 and 6 of the Article (level of presence of the agent in the source country, agent with implied contractual authority, habitually exercising an authority to conclude contracts, commercial representations, meaning of independence, agent with only one principal, agents acting in the ordinary course of their business).

#### New Article on assistance in the collection of taxes

A new Article has been included in the OECD model which will enable states to agree to provide each other with assistance in the collection of taxes.

Changes to trans-Tasman imputation law announced
================================================

Australian Treasurer Peter Costello and New Zealand Finance and Revenue Minister Michael Cullen announced today that a long-standing tax problem involving trans-Tasman investment is close to resolution. Both countries expect to introduce legislation in May to relieve the "triangular tax" problem that results in the double taxation of certain investments in Australian and New Zealand companies that operate in both countries. The legislative solution is to extend each country's imputation system to include companies resident in the other country. For more information see the joint [media statements](/news/2003/2003-02-19-changes-trans-tasman-imputation-law-announced#statement)

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Trans-Tasman tax break-through

The Australian and New Zealand governments announced today that a new tax arrangement which could boost trans-Tasman investment will come into force soon.

"Both countries expect to introduce legislation in May to relieve the double taxation of certain investments in Australian and New Zealand companies that operate in both countries," said Australian Treasurer Peter Costello and New Zealand Finance and Revenue Minister Michael Cullen.

"These long awaited reforms reflect the commitment of both governments to the continued strengthening of the Closer Economic Relations agreement between Australia and New Zealand and to promoting trans-Tasman business," Mr Costello and Dr Cullen said.

"The reforms are aimed at what is known as the 'triangular tax' problem, where Australian and New Zealand shareholders investing through a company resident in the other country that earns income and pays taxes in their own jurisdiction are unable to get imputation credits arising from the payment of such taxes.

"To resolve this problem, Australia and New Zealand will extend their imputation systems to include companies resident in the other country.

"Under this reform, Australian and New Zealand shareholders of trans-Tasman companies that choose to take up these reforms will be allocated imputation credits, representing New Zealand tax paid, and franking credits, representing Australian tax paid, in proportion to their ownership of the company. However, each country's credits will be able to be claimed only by its residents."

"These changes will remove an impediment to trans-Tasman business. Therefore we are especially pleased to be able to announce them in this year of the twentieth anniversary of the signing of CER," Mr Costello and Dr Cullen said.

The expected date of effect of the new legislation is 1 April 2003 for New Zealand companies maintaining a franking account and Australian companies maintaining an imputation credit account, although franked or imputed dividends cannot be paid out until 1 October 2003.

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Ministers move CER another step forward

A significant breakthrough in the alignment of trans-Tasman tax law and a commitment to meet each year were agreed today by Australian Treasurer Peter Costello and New Zealand Finance Minister Michael Cullen.

"The tax change has been long sought and will remove an important impediment to trans-Tasman business. We are pleased to be able to announce it as part of the 20th anniversary of Closer Economic Relations \[CER\]," the Ministers said.

They noted that CER was one of the most successful economic agreements in the world and had delivered much to both partners. Bilateral trade in goods had doubled in real terms since the Treaty was signed in 1983, and the trade in services was also growing steadily.

"Today's talks were very constructive and indicative of the steady and practical progress being achieved under CER," they said.

Mr Costello and Dr Cullen endorsed the benefits of meeting annually given the importance of issues within their respective portfolios to both economies and to the trans-Tasman relationship.

"Our principal focus is to encourage trans-Tasman business through the co-ordination of business, regulatory and tax law. Current work includes possible bilateral initiatives in securities offerings and insolvency proceedings."

They also discussed how New Zealand and Australia could jointly promote the development and adoption of international accounting standards.

The Ministers agreed that policy co-ordination in these areas had already proven valuable and asked officials to explore ways of enhancing that co-ordination.

### Technical Appendix - Details of trans-Tasman imputation (triangular) reform as proposed by the Australian and New Zealand governments

#### General

New Zealand companies will be able to elect to maintain an Australian franking account, subject to full compliance with the Australian provisions relating to franking accounts.

Australian companies will be able to elect to maintain a New Zealand imputation credit account, subject to full compliance with the New Zealand provisions relating to imputation credit accounts.

Australian shareholders of New Zealand companies that have elected to maintain a franking account and earn Australian income will be able to access franking benefits on a pro rata basis (in proportion to their shareholding in the New Zealand company) arising from the payment of Australian tax on that income.

New Zealand shareholders of Australian companies that have elected to maintain an imputation credit account and earn New Zealand income will be able to access imputation benefits on a pro rata basis (in proportion to their shareholding in the Australian company) arising from the payment of New Zealand tax on that income.

Franking credits will arise in New Zealand companies' franking accounts for dividend, interest and royalty withholding taxes deducted in Australia. They will arise in addition to credits for Australian income tax and franking credits attached to dividends received.

Imputation credits will arise in Australian companies' imputation credit accounts for New Zealand taxes deducted from or paid by the Australian company. Such taxes include non-resident withholding taxes on interest, royalties and dividends and non-resident contractors' withholding tax.

#### Date of effect

The application date is 1 April 2003 for New Zealand companies maintaining Australian franking accounts and Australian companies maintaining New Zealand imputation credit accounts. Companies will not be able to distribute the credits until 1 October 2003.

#### The Australian exempting company rules

The 'look-through' approach that currently applies in relation to Australian companies under the Australian exempting company rules will be extended to include New Zealand companies so that they are 'looked through' to find the ultimate effective owners. Companies that satisfy the extended rules will be able to pass on the benefits of the reform to their Australian shareholders. The exempting company rules will also be amended to:

*   give Australian resident shareholders in a New Zealand listed company that is an exempting company franking benefits for franking credits attached to dividends paid by the entity; and
*   allow the 100 per cent owned Australian subsidiary of a New Zealand listed company that fails the amended exempting company rules to nevertheless pass franking credits to its parent.

#### Existing credits

Franking credits accumulated by an Australian subsidiary of a New Zealand company before 1 April 2003 will be available to frank distributions if the subsidiary would not have been treated as an exempting company under the proposed changes, had they applied before that date.

A company that is an exempting company immediately before 1 April 2003 will have access to franking credits accumulated before that date, provided that, during the period 13 May 1997 (when the exempting company rules came into effect) to 1 April 2003, either:

*   effective Australian ownership of the company, determined using the look-through approach, was always greater than 5 per cent; or
*   the company was a 100 per cent owned subsidiary of a New Zealand listed company.

Imputation credits accumulated by a New Zealand subsidiary of an Australian company before 1 April 2003 will be available to impute distributions made by Australian companies after 1 October 2003.

#### Joint and several liability

In Australia, all companies in a wholly owned trans-Tasman group will be jointly and severally liable for the payment of additional tax and penalties when a New Zealand company runs its Australian franking account into deficit and defaults on the franking deficit tax payable.

In New Zealand, all companies in a wholly owned trans-Tasman group will be jointly and severally liable for the payment of further income tax, penalties, and interest when an Australian company has a debit balance in its New Zealand imputation credit account at the end of the imputation year and defaults on these liabilities.

In both countries, sectors such as banking, funds management and insurance, where regulations prohibit such entities from assuming the liabilities of others in the group, will be excluded from the joint and several liability.

#### Reducing the franking rebate for Australian shareholders

The franking rebate received by an Australian shareholder of a New Zealand company who is eligible to receive credits for foreign tax (for example, an investor with less than a 10 per cent shareholding) will be reduced to the extent of the supplementary dividend paid by the New Zealand company.

#### Trans-Tasman group structures

Both countries will generally allow Australian and New Zealand group structures, regardless of the percentage of ownership, to pass credits through to their underlying shareholders.

#### Trans-Tasman group structures involving a third country/Consolidation for imputation purposes only

In Australia, wholly owned trans-Tasman groups involving an entity not resident in Australia or New Zealand will be able to pass through franking credits to the Australian shareholders of a New Zealand company.

New Zealand will allow a consolidation election for imputation purposes, based on the existing consolidation provisions. Such an election will also be available to Australian companies within wholly owned trans-Tasman groups.

#### Commissioner's discretion

The Commissioner of Taxation in Australia will be given discretion to revoke an election to maintain an Australian franking account in certain circumstances where a New Zealand company does not comply with Australia's imputation rules. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue in New Zealand will be given a similar discretion.

#### Further details

Further issues may arise in the development of the legislation and will be dealt with at that time.

Minister of Revenue

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Bill good for Maori authorities, charities, businesses and tax debtors

Legislation presented for second reading today would benefit Maori authorities, charities, businesses and people who fell behind with their tax, Revenue Minister Michael Cullen said.

"We have always had specific tax rules to deal with the administration of Maori freehold land and other tribal assets and they will continue to be necessary.

"But the definition of Maori authority will be tightened to include only those entities which are subject to specific legislative restrictions or which receive and manage Treaty of Waitangi settlement assets.

"They face constraints not faced by ordinary companies and trusts, including the fact that they cannot easily sell their assets. The 19.5 per cent tax rate contained in the Bill will apply only to them. It will not apply to Maori as a group or to all businesses run by Maori, or even to all organisations managing communally owned Maori assets," Dr Cullen said.

The rationale for the 19.5 per cent rate was that it was the statutory rate paid by some 90 per cent of the Maori beneficiaries of these assets. It was much cleaner and simpler administratively to withhold tax at the rate paid by most members than to withhold it at a higher rate and require those people to seek refunds at the end of the tax year.

"To receive what would often be a small refund, they would have to file an income tax return - something most individuals no longer have to do.

"For the estimated 10 per cent on a higher tax rate, the 19.5 per cent rate will only apply in the interim. When the income is distributed to them by the Maori authority, they will pay tax on it at their normal rate.

"The present system was last revised in 1952 and is badly out of date. It is unnecessarily complex, imposes high compliance costs and - in some cases - even double taxes income," Dr Cullen said.

"The Bill also ushers in a long overdue rationalisation of the tax treatment of charities. It increases the amount that people can claim as a tax rebate for charitable donations from $500 to $630 a year and extends the corporate tax deduction to a wider range of companies.

"It also accords marae the same tax status as public halls and churches and relaxes the public benefit test applying to charities so that organisations which meet all the other criteria are not automatically debarred simply because their members are connected by blood ties.

"The Charities Commission, which the government agreed to set up at the request of the charitable sector, will be legislated for in a future bill."

The government had already moved to provide relief to people who got into tax debt, and to give Inland Revenue greater flexibility in dealing with tax debtors. The Bill continued that direction by providing that a taxpayer's "good behaviour" could be taken into account when imposing shortfall penalties.

It also marked another step in the government's programme to reduce business compliance costs.

"It allows businesses to reduce their exposure to use-of-money interest by pooling their provisional tax payments and makes it easier for them to transfer the bulk of their PAYE obligations to an accredited intermediary. These are both useful initiatives," Dr Cullen said.

SPEECH NOTES

### Address to International Fiscal Association Conference

Thank you for inviting me to speak to your twenty-sixth annual conference. Today I would like to touch upon a number of issues that may be of interest to those attending your conference: the economic outlook, developments in tax revenue flows, progress in a number of tax policy issues, and the impact on New Zealand of tax changes in other countries.

The New Zealand economy is looking reasonably sound, though a great deal of uncertainty lies ahead.

The economy recorded solid growth of 1 percent in the September quarter, taking annual average growth to 3.9 percent and placing New Zealand in the top rung of OECD countries over 2002.

Domestic demand has been strong and has helped to offset the impact of weaker world growth, with solid growth in consumption and particularly residential investment. So far indicators for the December quarter suggest that the domestic economy has continued to perform well.

The December Economic and Fiscal Update saw growth moderating from 4 percent in the current March year, to 2.5 percent in the March year 2004, as the effects of weaker world growth fed through into domestic activity, and drivers such as migration eased off.

Since December, a number of developments have added to the uncertainty surrounding the outlook for the world economy, and therefore for the New Zealand economy. The most obvious, of course, is the possibility of war in the Gulf, higher oil prices and global economic slowdown. Locally, the appreciating New Zealand dollar is affecting exporters, and falling returns for the agricultural sector are also clouding the picture. All these factors add to the strong head-winds that the domestic economy may face over the coming year.

At this stage, it appears to be evolving in line with the December forecasts, and if anything may be running a little ahead. But my personal view is that this will not persist.

The tax we collect is strongly linked to the performance of the economy.

Tax revenue flows are looking healthy, with the tax take, so far, considerably up on last year. The main growth is in GST and company tax.

The growth in goods and services revenue in recent years has been boosted by increased revenue from the farming sector, as well as higher retail spending. Latest forecasts have GST growing by $788 million this year, or over 7 percent. Likewise, net company tax revenue is expected to increase by $521 million, or 11.4 percent, over last year.

As I have stated publicly in the past, I am cautious about this revenue growth. The reason for the size of the increase in GST is not entirely clear. We have seen in the past that the company tax take can change rapidly if the economy deteriorates.

Nevertheless, the growth in company tax has been broadly based. One of the most significant contributions to growth in company taxes in recent years has been from the property and business services sector.

The finance and insurance services sector continues to contribute the largest percentage of cash payments to company tax, although its contribution has decreased markedly over the last three years. In 2000 it contributed about 29 percent. In 2001 it contributed about 24 percent. And in the 2001-02 fiscal year its contribution retracted to 18 percent, a tax take now close to that of manufacturing.

The result is a more balanced company tax profile than has appeared to be the case in the past, when the finance and insurance services sector dominated. The reduction in the contribution of the finance and insurance services sector is obviously in part a result of reduced income from the fall in world equity prices. Nevertheless, aspects of the sector such as banking remain highly profitable, and we are continuing to look at what is driving changes in company tax revenue flows.

Economic growth is very much at the forefront of the government's Growth and Innovation Framework, which was announced just over a year ago. It aims to lift New Zealand's economic performance, and - over time - to return our per capita income to the top half of the OECD rankings.

If we are to achieve this, New Zealand must become a source of high-value innovation in particular sectors of the global economy with high growth potential. We have identified these sectors as biotechnology, information and communications technology, and the creative industries.

Four private sector taskforces have been set up to work within the target sectors, to identify and consider measures that will help their sectors to grow. Tax issues are already emerging from the work of the taskforces, so tax policy officials are working closely with them to ensure that these issues are considered from different perspectives.

The government is awaiting the forthcoming final report of the Information and Communication Technology Taskforce, which in its draft report raised a number of tax issues, which will be considered. Reports from other taskforces are expected shortly.

It is not intended that tax recommendations arising from the taskforces necessarily or automatically become government policy. Instead, what the government sees happening is the identification of a number of tax issues that will then make their way through the normal policy process.

  
Reducing the extent to which tax is a barrier to New Zealand doing business with the rest of the world is another way of promoting growth and innovation. This can be a matter of having good double tax agreements with trading partners and making sure that our tax laws are in line with those of other countries. It can be a matter of strengthening the Closer Economic Relations agreement with Australia and coming up with bilateral reforms, such as the trans-Tasman imputation changes announced just a few days ago.

It can also be a matter of making more radical changes. Several such changes were recommended by The Tax Review 2001, to rationalise the taxation of outbound investment and make New Zealand more attractive to overseas capital and migrants. The government has been considering these recommendations.

One of these recommendations was to introduce an 18 percent tax rate for new foreign direct investment. I announced at the time of last year's budget that officials' analysis of the workability of the recommendation would be made available for comment from interested parties. That has occurred, submissions were received late last year, and officials will be reporting shortly.

Another recommendation was to provide a temporary tax exemption for the foreign-sourced income of new migrants. Work is proceeding on the design of a possible regime.

A further McLeod Review recommendation was to introduce a risk-free rate of return method of taxing offshore portfolio equity investments, which would, in certain circumstances, replace the foreign investment fund rules. One of the difficulties with this recommendation is that it can result in people being required to pay tax even when their foreign investment has reduced in value.

There are, however, no easy fixes in this area and it may yet prove that the risk-free rate of return method is the best solution for some offshore investment. I am expecting a report on this shortly, and soon afterwards will make a decision on whether the proposal should proceed to become the subject of a discussion document.

To turn to a few further items on the tax policy work programme, earlier this year I signalled that I was interested in finding out whether the depreciation rules provide for depreciation of assets over their true economic life, accurately reflecting commercial reality. I have asked officials to look at whether this is the case.

The equitable taxation of savings for retirement remains a prominent issue on the tax policy work programme.

I do not believe that giving tax concessions for saving is a viable option. At the margin, in my view, you may bring about a behavioural change on the part of savers, but mostly it will be a matter of savers choosing tax-preferred savings over other types of savings.

On the other hand, current superannuation tax rules penalise this form of savings. Moreover, I am unconvinced that these tax rules recognise the special nature of retirement savings.

I am hoping that we will soon be able to introduce a progressive rate of tax on employers' contributions to their employees' retirement savings. This would deal with the current over-taxation of savings of those who earn under $38,000 a year

Another anomaly in current law is the flat rate of 33 percent applying to savings in private superannuation funds. This results in the over-taxation of the savings of people who are on lower marginal tax rates, and the under-taxation of people on higher rates. In the longer term I would like to see the introduction of a system that eliminates these inequities. I am not proposing to re-activate the TOLIS proposal of some years ago, because of the associated compliance costs, but I have asked the industry and officials to provide some advice on possible mechanisms to address this.

One option is a lower tax rate on superannuation funds but, if considered, it would need to be targeted at retirement savings.

Before turning to the impact of international tax matters, I would like to say a few words about the Inland Revenue Department. A tax system that can be relied upon to deliver the revenue the government needs is very much dependent on having a well-functioning tax administration, one that has the confidence and support of the community. Over the last decade or so, both governments and oppositions of different political parties have been concerned both about attacks on Inland Revenue and some aspects of its performance.

As Minister of Revenue I am not accountable for the detail of administration or, thankfully, assessments. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue is accountable for the delivery of the objectives and outcomes necessary to achieve government goals.

I am very happy with the evidence that I see of the major progress Inland Revenue is making. The feedback that I receive reflects the department's renewed commitment to relationship building: with people like yourselves, with members of the Finance and Expenditure Committee, with the general public, and with its own staff. I am also very pleased by the way Inland Revenue is moving ahead in information technology, with its e-enablement and technology strategies.

Very importantly, these successes have not been at the cost of tax revenue. The government has provided more money for Inland Revenue to focus on evasion and aggressive tax schemes. We set revenue targets for this extra expenditure that Inland Revenue not only achieved but exceeded. Needless to say, I am happy with that.

As I have previously mentioned, we are living through uncertain times. Distance does shelter New Zealand a bit from international developments. Nevertheless, we are not isolated from the rest of the world and, as our growth and innovation strategy makes clear, we do not want to be.

  
Australia is our closest economic neighbour. We do need to follow closely developments in that country. Anything significant on the tax side that Australia does needs to be assessed for its impact on our tax system and on New Zealand business.

As you will be aware, last month I met with Peter Costello, the Australian Treasurer, and we announced the trans-Tasman tax proposal. Those discussions reinforced to me that the tax challenges we face are similar. For example we both want to attract foreign investment, especially venture capital. When Australia alters its tax rules to encourage such investment we need to consider how we should react.

The area that Australian tax reforms are most likely to affect us is in the international area. Australia has recently negotiated a new double tax agreement with the United States that significantly lowers withholding taxes between the two countries. As a result, Australia is required to enter similar negotiations with a number of other countries. Until now the Australian and New Zealand tax treaty models have been much the same. It would seem unwise to assume that this will continue to be the case unless New Zealand were to change its approach. To date, we remain unconvinced that it would be in New Zealand's best interests to do so.

The Australian Board of Taxation is shortly expected to present to the Treasurer its proposals for the reform of Australia's international tax rules. My understanding is that a key concern is whether tax law should be amended to make Australia more attractive for foreign investors and to remove impediments to the growth of Australian companies with large offshore investments. As yet it is unclear what the final outcome will be, but we will be following developments closely.

One of the outcomes of my meeting with Peter Costello is that we agreed to have annual meetings at ministerial level on a number of issues, including tax. A useful by-product of this arrangement is that officials on both sides of the Tasman are then required to liaise in preparation for those meetings. This should improve trans-Tasman understanding of where each of us is going in the tax area.

Another major economic influence on us is, of course, the United States of America. I have already mentioned the double tax agreement between Australia and the United States. Another development is President Bush's proposal to substantially change the American tax treatment of dividends. If the measure is implemented, and given the significance of investment flows -- both ways -- between our countries, we will need to consider the impact this could have on us. For example, what will it mean for US dividend non-resident withholding tax?

At the same time as the United States may be moving away from the classical company tax system, many European Union countries have moved in the opposite direction. The United Kingdom, Germany and Ireland are examples of countries that have moved away from imputation. This in some case is for reasons specific to the European Union -- the difficulties of discriminating between the treatment of residents and non-residents within the EU. But it is a development we have to consider. For example, the move away from imputation has been matched in many cases with reductions in company tax rates.

The biggest tax issue in Europe is probably whether the EU will move to greater harmonization of its income tax laws along the lines of its VAT rules. The European Council savings agreement of January this year was part of this. That agreement has already raised questions about the OECD harmful tax project. In that project New Zealand has been a supporter of the need for international standards under which countries are expected to exchange information so that each can run its own tax system. Tax havens are likely to resist entering into information exchange agreements if it is not required of a number of OECD European jurisdictions.

Some proposals for European tax harmonization go well beyond the savings agreement. One of the options recently raised by the European Commission has been that the company tax laws of all EU countries should be based on a common set of accounting standards. In other words, the rates of company tax might vary between different countries but this would be applied to a European income figure calculated on the basis of financial accounts. Needless to say, this has met with varying degrees of enthusiasm, and its opposite, within the EU. Any moves in this direction have the potential to affect international tax standards, including transfer pricing.

These are just some of the international tax developments we are following with interest. You will be far more aware of them than I am. The International Fiscal Association is a group with considerable tax expertise and international contacts. I am interested in your views as to how New Zealand best fits into the changing international tax world.

My main caveat is that this government is totally committed to social investment. Our social commitment means that in broad terms we will need to maintain tax at broadly current levels. This does not allow us to meet international challenges by giving away large parts of our tax revenue, but there is some room to alter aspects of our tax system to better meet our economic objectives.

I hope that you are able to consider some of these issues over the next couple of days.

Thank you.

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Government to remove imputation barrier to tax pooling

The government is to change the imputation tax rules to make it easier for companies to take advantage of a new law allowing businesses to pool their provisional tax payments, Associate Revenue Minister Paul Swain announced today.

"A recently-enacted tax simplification measure makes it possible for businesses to pool their provisional tax payments with those of other businesses by using pools set up and run by commercial intermediaries," said Mr Swain.

"There is lot of interest in the new tax pooling scheme, and the government wants to make it accessible to as wide a range of businesses as possible. To that end, we intend to amend the imputation tax rules to remove a recently identified barrier to companies paying their tax through a pool.

"The government will amend the rules to ensure that businesses will receive imputation credits when they deposit money into a pooling account. The amendment will be included in the next taxation bill to be introduced into Parliament, and will take effect from 1 April 2003, the date of effect of the new pooling provisions.

"Tax pools will benefit all participants. Since provisional tax must often be paid before the income is earned, businesses base their payments on an estimate of expected income over the next year. Naturally enough, these estimates sometimes prove to be wrong. The result is that businesses that underpay provisional tax must pay use-of-money interest on the difference, and businesses that overpay receive use-of-money interest.

"In a tax pool, underpayments by participating businesses can be offset by overpayments by those in the same pool, reducing the under-payers' exposure to use-of-money interest. Overpayments will attract a higher rate of interest than a business would receive in dealing directly with Inland Revenue.

"The new tax pooling scheme is complemented by another simplification measure, also enacted last week, which makes it easier for employers to transfer most of their PAYE obligations to accredited intermediaries. The intermediaries will be legally responsible for calculating and paying PAYE deductions to Inland Revenue, meeting return filing requirements and paying employees.

"The PAYE measure has been designed to reduce the obstacles to payroll firms acting as intermediaries between employers and Inland Revenue, thus freeing up employers' resources to be used more productively elsewhere in their businesses. It also came into force on 1 April.

"Both measures are part of the government's continuing programme of tax simplification for business, which seeks to reduce the stress, hassle and risk that businesses encounter in meeting their tax obligations," said Mr Swain.

SSCWT, GST legislation announced
================================

The government will introduce legislation enabling employer contributions to superannuation funds on behalf of employees earning less than $38,000 a year to be taxed at a lower rate than the present 33%, Revenue Minister Michael Cullen told the Savings and Fund Management Conference in Wellington today.

Also to be included in a forthcoming taxation bill is legislation that better aligns the GST treatment of the financial services sector with that of other industries. It will include a proposal to zero-rate business-to-business supplies. Earlier proposals to reform the GST treatment of brokerage and other third-party fees will not proceed, Dr Cullen said.

SPEECH NOTES

### Address to Savings and Fund Management Conference  
Copthorne Hotel, Wellington

I would like to thank the organisers of today's conference for the opportunity to brief you on the government's perspective on the role of savings in the New Zealand economy, and on the future direction of superannuation, both public and private.

Today's conference is about saving, and it is useful to be very clear on why saving matters in a modern economy. Saving has about it an air of old time morality. For many people it is an activity akin to taking a weekly dose of castor oil or having regular dental checkups: none too pleasant at the time, but reputed to be good for you.

This is not the best kind of motivation, and we need a more precise understanding of how and why saving is important if we are to develop policies that foster a growing economy and that help New Zealanders become more sophisticated in their approach to planning for their financial well being across their life cycle.

First, let me make it clear that this government is not indifferent to the level of savings in the economy. There is a school of thought that maintains that provided the government is looking after its finances, the level of national saving is not a matter of government policy interest. Private borrowers and private lenders are viewed as making choices that reflect their own preferences for consuming now rather than later, and their own risk assessments. Under this view, all that is required in order for the outcomes to be "optimal" is for the government to keep out of the way.

I do not share this view. However, I do not support the opposite contention, which is also held by some within the savings industry, that the savings level of a population is a primary determinant of economic fortunes, and that more savings - and in particular more long-term locked-in savings - is a kind of economic panacea.

To begin with the fundamentals: saving is a means to an end, not an end in its own right. In New Zealand's economy it has two major purposes. First, it finances investment, and investment matters for increasing income levels. Second, saving as deferred consumption is crucial to retirement income provision, particularly at present given the prospect of population aging. In the past, retirement saving as a mechanism was confined to the private sector. Now, with the advent of the New Zealander Superannuation Fund, the government too has added a savings instrument to its portfolio of retirement income policies.

I would like to focus first, on the linkages between saving, investment and the government's objective of increasing the living standards of New Zealanders.

A key factor in labour productivity performance - the level of output per "worker" - is the quantity and quality of capital, that is, the tools, machinery, plant, computers, and the like, they have to work with. Growing the stock of capital that people have to work with requires investment, and investment needs to be financed. It is saving that finances investment.

New Zealand investment levels, overall, have not been out of line from those of similar countries, even though there may be some pressure points, for example in the areas of transport infrastructure and energy.

The stand-out feature of New Zealand's investment and capital stock compared with most other countries is the extent to which it is financed from foreign as opposed to domestic savings. Financing of domestic investment from domestic saving has been correspondingly low.

The immediate question is: does this relatively low level of domestic saving constrain the level of quality of investment in our economy? The short answer is not much, if at all. New Zealand has good access to the savings of the rest of the world through the international capital markets. That use of foreign savings, as represented by New Zealand's net obligations to the rest of the world, now stands at about 75 per cent of GDP, the highest in the developed world.

This level of use of foreign savings raises some issues about external vulnerability. Much analysis has been done on this issue, and it is something that needs to be monitored closely. But best assessments are that it is not a cause for current concern. Moody's recently upgraded the rating ceiling for New Zealand borrowers - effectively the sovereign rating - to AAA, and the IMF in its annual assessments of the NZ economy has been satisfied about New Zealand's external liability position.

However, that, of itself, does not make me entirely sanguine about New Zealand's low level of saving. How close we are to, or how far away from, insolvency is not the only consideration. We also need to consider whether, and how, our use of foreign savings is contributing to the growth of our incomes.

Three points are worth pondering:

First, as already mentioned, New Zealand has good access to foreign savings, and hence our investment is unlikely to have been constrained by a lack of savings to finance it. There may be some issues around whether heavy reliance on foreign over domestic saving has biased the allocation of investment toward areas that foreign investors, who are unfamiliar with the New Zealand economy, will be more comfortable with, for example, industries that are already well-established. These industries may not always be the strongest drivers of growth. But, be that as it may, we need to recognise that without access to foreign saving, the expansion of the economy, and of employment, that has been achieved in recent years would not have been possible.

But - and this is the second point - accessing foreign saving is not a means by which we can help ourselves to a "free lunch". It may seem that accessing foreign saving provides a way to maintain a level of spending (on consumption for now, and on investment for future growth) that exceeds our current income, without having to pay a price for that.

But we know that "free lunches" are never "free". If we want to fund our investment and simultaneously avoid the discomfort of foregoing consumption, we need to accept that it will be foreigners who accrue some of the income, that is, the interest and dividends, from the investment they finance. Those returns to foreign-provided capital, net of returns earned by New Zealand abroad, for some time now have amounted to 6 to 7 per cent of GDP (although for the year ended March 2002, they fell back to about 5 ½ per cent of GDP). While accessing foreign saving has enabled the economy to grow, some of the income from that growth has accrued to the foreign providers of capital, not as income growth for New Zealand residents.

Third, we need to think about how to maximise the benefits of inwards investment, relative to its cost. Foreign investment that includes the taking of an ownership interest, that is foreign direct investment (or FDI), holds out particular potential in this regard. This government has been emphasising the importance of New Zealand being globally connected, and FDI is an important part of that. FDI is a vehicle by which the New Zealand economy can connect up with foreign management, international marketing networks and world technological progress. By being well-connected, we can strengthen innovation within the local economy, and deepen our marketing connections with the world.

FDI in New Zealand during the 1990s predominantly took the form of the acquisition of existing New Zealand enterprises. That generally will have been positive in terms of connectedness, and much of the local capital freed up will have been re-invested. But the FDI that generally makes the greatest contribution is that which involves expanding, not just taking over, an existing enterprise, or - even better - new so called "greenfield" investments.

One of the most significant barriers to the development of export industries has been the lack of a significant venture capital market in New Zealand. Traditionally, New Zealanders have produced innovative products and ideas in the equivalent of a suburban garage or back shed, and have then turned them into modestly successful but still, by world standards, small businesses. Scaling those kind of businesses up so that they can service global markets is a risky business, but one which is aided by a deep capital market which makes finances available at all points along a risk/yield curve.

In New Zealand we have found it difficult to get such a market going. Some have argued that, if New Zealanders saved more - either of their own volition, or through compulsion or tax-breaks - then the capital needs of our businesses would be solved. This is clearly false, as it puts the cart before the horse. The problem has not been a lack of available savings, either domestic or foreign-sourced, but a lack of strength and sophistication in the institutions which comprise the market.

Deeper capital markets will themselves attract more savings; and achieving this is very much on the government's agenda. For example:

*   We have set up the New Zealand Venture Investment Fund of $100 million to address the gap in the seed capital end of the venture capital spectrum. We expect the private sector capital partners to mobilise a further $200 million through participation in this fund.
*   A range of sectoral and regional industry development strategies have been implemented by New Zealand Trade and Enterprise - a newly constituted body that integrates Industry New Zealand and Trade New Zealand. We expect the integration of these organisations to have positive downstream implications for business growth, traded securities and the depth of the New Zealand markets.
*   Similarly, Investment New Zealand's mandate to attract new capital to the New Zealand market - for example, by an active and coordinated approach towards assisting major FDI proposals to work through planning processes - should make a significant contribution.
*   And we have reformed securities legislation in the Securities Markets Act which will strengthen both domestic and international confidence in our securities market law and institutions, and should have the effect of lowering the cost of capital to New Zealand businesses.

To maximise the benefits from inwards investment, we also need to satisfied that we have the appropriate domestic regulatory regimes in place. For example, if FDI results in a loss of, or impedes the development of, competition in the New Zealand economy, then monopoly profits will accrue to the investor, and these may well end up exceeding the benefits to the New Zealand economy.

As a general proposition, I think we have to accept that the New Zealand economy has access to sufficient pools of savings, both domestic and foreign, to make the investments that are needed for the future. The immediate priority has to be to provide a greater range of opportunities for those savings to be invested in the New Zealand economy.

That leaves the question as to whether we would be better off as a nation if New Zealanders saved more themselves.

Clearly, if we saved more and, in consequence, financed more of our own investment - or, as a diversified investor might do, invested more in assets abroad - more investment income, whether from within the domestic economy, or from abroad, would accrue to us. Saving is not just about foregoing consumption now in order to be able to consume later; it is also about foregoing consumption now in order to be able to increase our consumption later.

As I said earlier, I am not convinced that government should turn its back on the question of how much New Zealanders save. That is especially the case given what we know about the ageing of our population.

The basic facts around population aging by now will be well known. By 2040, about a quarter of New Zealand's population will be 65 years or older. This is twice as high as the current proportion of about 12 percent. The change arises largely from increasing longevity and falling fertility.

Much has been said about the issues that arise, but there is a key point that tends to get lost sight of. If growth in standards of living is to be maintained as the population ages, and the labour force becomes relatively smaller, income growth will need to be bolstered from other sources. Technological progress doubtless will deliver some of that income growth, but saving and investment for future income growth is also needed, not least because new technologies tend to be embedded in new investment.

To help the Crown's finances adjust to the costs of population aging, the Government has established the New Zealand Superannuation Fund. The Fund will be built up from fiscal surpluses, and, importantly, from the earnings on the Fund's investments, over the next 30 years or so, at a time when the fiscal cost of New Zealand Superannuation remains relatively low. It should be stressed that much of the growth in the Fund is expected to come from the earnings of the Fund.

It follows that a critical element in the success of the Fund will be the level of long-term investment return it generates. In this regard, careful attention has been given to the design of robust institutional arrangements. The Fund is managed by a Crown entity - The Guardians of New Zealand Superannuation. As for all significant Crown owned funds, the key principles applying to the governance of the Fund are autonomy and accountability. The Guardians have full control of the Fund's assets and will be held accountable for the Fund's performance. This arms length management allows the Fund to be managed on a prudent and commercial basis in a manner consistent with best practice, maximising return without undue risk or influence from political pressures.

The Guardians have commenced work on asset allocation and portfolio construction and will probably begin investing in the September quarter of this year. The Guardians will decide on how much to invest in New Zealand and how much to hold in overseas assets.  
There have been some suggestions that the establishment of the Fund is resulting in some people concluding that they no longer need to save for their retirement. It is hard to say how much of this is fact and how much is fiction, but either way, the record needs to be put straight.

The New Zealand Superannuation Fund will only partially cover increases in the future cost of superannuation. It is designed to moderate, not eliminate, the pressure that future superannuation costs will put on the fiscal position. Contrary to the impression some people have, the primary beneficiaries of the Fund will not be future retired people. They, after all, will not receive any larger entitlement to New Zealand Superannuation because of the Fund. Instead, the beneficiaries will be the taxpayers of the future, who will not have to face the steep rises in tax rates that would be otherwise needed to maintain New Zealand Superannuation.

The NZSF is a prudent step in the direction of making the existing level of basic retirement income provision for all sustainable, but in no way reduces the need for those aspiring for a retirement income above a basic level to save for their retirement. I do not doubt that some may misunderstand the purpose of the Fund, and be less inclined to save for themselves. Conversely, we might argue that the fact that the government is pre-funding a portion of its future expenditure highlights the fact that there is little chance of a state pension that exceeds the current 65 percent of the average wage for a married couple.

Successive Governments have sought to encourage private provision through education programmes run by the Office of the Retirement Commissioner. These have included public advertising campaigns, education in schools, and a very useful website that includes financial calculators for managing debt and achieving saving targets. The website also contains information on how employers can help staff plan for their financial future.

The Retirement Commissioner's programmes appear to have been effective in raising awareness of the importance of saving for retirement, but it seems that they may have been less effective in translating that awareness into actual saving. Research on the psychology of saving suggests that saving is something that many want to do, but is also one of those things that gets put off until "tomorrow".

This Government, besides supporting the education initiatives of the ORC, is focussed on ensuring that government policy does not impede, or discourage private saving for retirement. We are also keen to ensure that the institutional structures for saving for retirement are working.

These priorities are reflected in the terms of reference for the recently commissioned Periodic Review Group (PRG), which is charged under the Retirement Income Act 1993 with reporting on the retirement income policies of the Government. The PRG has been asked to consider mechanisms that would promote employer-based superannuation, and on the impact of the tax system on the private provision of retirement income.

Employer sponsored superannuation plans used to be a much more significant part of the institutional framework in New Zealand for private provision for retirement than they are today. They provided a painless mechanism for getting people into an early savings habit.

For a number of reasons, employer based schemes have been declining. Later this year, I propose to hold a forum, in partnership with other interested parties, to discuss ways to revitalise employer-based schemes. The objective is to coordinate efforts to help New Zealanders supplement the state pension with their own retirement savings through their workplace. Ideally, this group would develop a framework upon which to proceed in this area, and ensure broad contribution to any proposed initiatives.

Concerning tax policy and saving, I have always been cautious but open to the notion that improvements to the tax system may be required. At the very least, we would like to ensure that the tax system does not discourage people from saving for their retirement.

We are currently making progress on this front. Employers' contributions to their employees' retirement savings are currently taxed at a flat rate of 33 per cent. This results in the over-taxation of employees earning below $38,000 per annum, as their marginal income tax rates are much lower than that. This is an inequitable outcome and may discourage them from participating in employment-based superannuation schemes. Therefore, we will soon be introducing legislation to deal with that concern. This legislation will ensure that contributions to workers with annual salary/wages and superannuation contributions below $38,000 are taxed at the appropriate marginal tax rate. Some have raised concerns about imposing further compliance costs on employers - especially at a time when employers are increasingly concerned about the cost of providing superannuation schemes. For this reason, the legislation will make aligning the rate of tax on employer contributions with the employee's marginal tax rate permissive rather than mandatory.

Another issue of concern involves the taxation on returns to savings in superannuation funds. Currently, all returns are taxed at a flat rate of 33 per cent. Taxing savings returns at that rate penalises low-income earners through over-taxation. Having a system that eliminates this inequity would be ideal. Past work in this area, for example on the TOLIS approach, demonstrates that such a system may result in increasing compliance costs associated with managing employer schemes. This may in turn lead to a reduction of employer-based schemes if employers find the costs of offering them to be too high. While I have asked officials to review the potential for change in this area, I am mindful of the potential costs.

I am also conscious that retirement savings generally may be reduced by the current general level of taxation on returns to savings, under the TTE regime. Of course, taxation in general causes a number of distortions to behaviour so the effect of taxation on saving is not unique. One concern with reducing taxes on the return to savings is the resulting decrease in government revenue or the offsetting distortions that would be caused by raising the required tax revenue through other means. I am searching for the appropriate balance in this area.

As many of you will be aware the government has been looking at how to better align the GST treatment of the financial services sector with that of other industries. To this end a discussion document was released in October last year which proposed among other things the zero-rating of business to business supplies. This proposal was well supported by the financial sector as it would increase for many the ability to claim back the cost of GST on the goods and services needed for their businesses.

This proposal is planned for inclusion in a tax bill to be introduced shortly.

I know that one proposal in the discussion document relating the treatment of brokerage and other 3rd party fees was not popular. Having considered the submissions made on this issue by your industry, including the costs that it would incur, I have decided that this issue will not be advanced as part of the government's tax policy work programme.

These changes, and the options for changing the taxation of employee super schemes, will go some way towards removing some of the potential obstacles to growth in the savings industry. You will have noticed, however, that I have scrupulously avoided any mention of tax incentives for retirement savings. As I have made clear throughout my tenure as Minister of Revenue, I am sceptical about the value of incentives, but willing to listen to reasoned arguments.

I do not dispute that a well-designed tax incentive would increase the amount of money flowing into whatever savings instruments qualified for it; but there is little evidence forthcoming that such a flow would be a net increase in the level of savings. A tax incentive worthy of the name would have a significant cost in terms of lost revenue; but if its effect is primarily to prompt those who are currently saving to redesign their portfolios, then we have gained nothing in exchange for that cost.

What we need is a shift in the savings culture; and there is no easy way that such shifts can be bought. So long as there is a relatively low level of awareness amongst New Zealanders of the respective merits of different savings options and of the quantum of savings they need to provide the kind of lifestyle they want in retirement, no set of savings policies can have much hope of success.

Once we have removed tax policies that may discourage saving, and ensured that the institutional environment is supportive of long-term retirement savings, I suspect that the next set of gains will be by a long, hard process of education. That is a process that both the government and the savings industry are committed to, and I trust that we can find ways to coordinate our respective efforts in the years to come.

Thank you.

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Report-back on implementation of recommendations by the Ministerial Panel on Business Compliance Costs

The Government has made excellent progress in implementing recommendations of the Ministerial Panel on Business Compliance Costs, Minister for Small Business John Tamihere says.

Mr Tamihere today released a progress report on implementation of the recommendations of the Ministerial Panel on Business Compliance Costs.

The ministerial panel was appointed by Commerce Minister Paul Swain in 2000 as a key plank in the government's compliance cost reduction programme. Having sought the views of businesses throughout the country, the panel submitted 162 recommendations to the government on ways to reduce compliance costs for business.

In December 2001, the government issued its response to the panel's recommendations, Striking the Balance, in which it agreed (at least partially or in principle) to 131 of the Panel's proposals.

More than 80% of these proposals are now implemented or their implementation is underway. The Government is confident that all the most significant recommendations have been implemented, capturing at least 95% of potential benefits in terms of compliance cost reduction.

The initiatives and projects undertaken in response to the panel's recommendations range across numerous government agencies and many pieces of legislation, such as employment relations, health and safety, accident insurance, local government and government statistics. Key initiatives include:

### One-stop business portal

One of the prominent themes of the panel's recommendations was to increase the accessibility of government services and information on compliance requirements via e-technology. One of the main initiatives in this area is the government's sponsorship of the setting up of a one-stop business portal.  
Led by Industry NZ, this web-based portal will allow access to business services across government (e.g. IRD, Department of Labour, ACC, Companies Office) as well as providing private sector information. The first stage of the portal is due to go 'live' this month.

### RMA-related initiatives

A number of initiatives have made it easier for businesses dealing with Resource Management Act issues:

*   Additional funding for the Environment Court, and collaboration between the Ministry for the Environment and the Environment Court, mean significant reductions in Environment Court backlog and delays are being achieved. Introduction of limited notification will curb frivolous and vexatious objections.
*   With further funding the Ministry for Environment has also implemented a number of projects that will improve the resource consent process. For example, the Ministry is moving to establish a scheme to train and accredit local councillors and independent commissioners involved in making decisions on resource consent applications. It is also developing guidance on case management and charging practices for iwi and hapu authorities.

Implementing the panel's recommendations was just part of the government's wider programme of reducing compliance costs and assisting business, Mr Tamihere said. As part of its wider programme, the government is introducing related initiatives, including:

### Tax simplification

The government is progressing a tax simplification programme addressing the tax issues of small to medium enterprises. Measures include:

*   A discussion document proposing tax simplification measures will be issued later this year. The proposals, such as frequency of tax payment and better aligning tax payment with the income earning process, address areas of concern raised by the panel.
*   A key proposal in the discussion document is that the government will encourage employers to use a commercial payroll intermediary by covering the intermediary's costs for the first five employees.

### Meeting the needs of small-medium business

\- The appointment process of a Small Business Advisory Group is in its final stages. The eight members of the advisory group will be drawn from the business community and will have experience running or working with small businesses. The group will advise Ministers on issues and policies affecting small business, including compliance costs.  
\- A new Small Business Directorate recently established within the Ministry of Economic Development will work closely with the advisory group and guide issues on small-medium businesses.  
\- In February 2004 the government will host an SME (small-medium enterprise) Summit, along with a series of regional summits, to help define the needs of SMEs and the government's role in relation to those needs.

### Regulatory impact analysis

Every regulatory proposal is now subject to a regulatory impact analysis to ensure a robust and transparent process around business compliance costs.

Mr Tamihere said he was pleased to see prompt progress being made towards implementing the panel's recommendations.

"Creating conditions under which New Zealand businesses can be innovative and operate most effectively remains a key priority for this government. The progress being made by the government on implementing the panel's recommendations will ensure that compliance cost barriers to innovation and effectiveness will be removed wherever possible."

A full progress report on implementation of the panel recommendations is available at the Ministry of Economic Development website - [www.med.govt.nz](http://www.med.govt.nz)

A media briefing on the report-back will be held in meeting room 6.31, Bowen House, Tuesday, July 1, 1.15pm.

The purpose of this letter is to: Update you on the initial views of the Liaison Group based on experience with the new regime since its introduction in 2001. Request a meeting to discuss the key issues outlined below. Terms of reference for Liaison Group It is appropriate at the outset to record our understanding of the terms of reference of the Liaison Group. They are to: monitor the application of the R & D tax rules draw issues of concern to Government�s attention. Some within the Liaison Group consider that R & D is such a critical ingredient to growth in the NZ economy that incentives, possibly in the form of a deduction for an excess of 100% of expenditure on R & D, are essential. That issue is beyond the terms of reference of the Liaison Group. However, it is important to record that the fact that the comments below relate to the existing regime, and modifications required to address issues of concern, and should not be interpreted as indicating that all members of the Liaison Group concur with the current policy position of not providing incentives for R & D expenditure. The structure of this letter is to set out our understanding of the Government�s policy position of the tax treatment of R & D, and then to comment on changes required to the existing rules to address issues of concern. The Liaison Group agrees with the Government that R & D plays a vital role in the New Zealand economy. By way of example, Navman NZ Limited estimate that: In their first 5 years of operation their R&D had a multiplier effect on the economy of 9 In their second 5 years of operation their R&D had a multiplier effect on the economy of 15 In their third 5 years of operation their R&D had a multiplier effect on the economy of 25 In the next 2 years of operation their R&D will have a multiplier effect on the economy of 50 Our understanding of the Government�s position on the tax treatment of research and development Much of the discussion about the tax treatment of research and development expenditure has been based on the difference between the Frascati rules (as contained in the Frascati Manual for R&D) and the boundaries set out in FRS 13. We understand that officials believe that FRS 13 is wider than the Frascati rules, with the exception that Frascati in some instances includes land and buildings whereas FRS13 does not. We understand that the Government�s intention is to allow 100% deductibility for expenditure on research, and 100% deductibility for expenditure on development except to the extent that an asset is created which requires capitalisation for accounting purposes. In order to allow such deductibility, a definition of �research and development� is needed. The FRS 13 rules provide that definition. The introduction of the new R & D legislation in 2001 was followed by the Commissioner giving clear instructions to the operational staff at IRD that 100% deductibility was to be allowed provided the expenditure had been expensed pursuant to FRS 13. If the expenditure falls outside FRS 13, ordinary rules of deductibility apply, with the main issue being the capital/revenue distinction. Officials have advised the Liaison Group that in their view the FRS 13 rules place a high threshold that must be crossed before expenditure must be capitalised, that is that in most cases the costs can be expensed and claimed as a deduction. This is because all five of the elements in paragraph 5.3 of FRS 13 must be met. For example, under 5.3(b) it is not enough that the taxpayer is confident of technical feasibility; rather, to meet the threshold, the taxpayer must be able to demonstrate technical feasibility. The Liaison Group�s views on the existing deductibility regime for research and development expenditure The Liaison Group supports the Government�s commitment to legislating for 100% deductibility for research and most development costs. Although as a practical matter 100% of these costs were already being deducted in most cases prior to the FRS 13 legislation, the Liaison Group endorses the increase in certainty arising from the legislation. There are a number of issues that the Liaison Group would like to see addressed. These are: Inability to depreciate/amortise development expenditure Although in practice the vast majority of development expenditure is likely to be deductible because it is written off under FRS 13, a number of companies will incur expenditure which satisfies the five tests set out in paragraph 5.3 of FRS 13, and will capitalise the associated expenditure. The Income Tax Act is currently deficient in that: There is no legislative basis for depreciating or amortising development expenditure which is capitalised, but which does not constitute depreciable property (either tangible or intangible) in terms of sub-part G of the Income Tax Act. There is no legislative basis for deducting development expenditure which is capitalised on a project but is subsequently written off or written down as a consequence of that project being abandoned or less successful than initially thought. There is no legislative basis for deducting expenditure incurred in deriving patents in circumstances where the expenditure is capital in nature, but the patent is not granted or the application is withdrawn or abandoned prior to grant of the project. The Liaison Group considers that there is no policy reason why a deduction should be denied in the circumstances set out above. The expenditure outlined above is sometimes loosely referred to as �black hole� expenditure. However, black hole expenditure also extends to matters of expense outside of the R & D regime, such as expenditure on resource management consents in circumstances where a project does not proceed. While that also needs to be addressed from a policy perspective, it is outside the R & D project. Capitalised Research and Development costs The Liaison group understands the general rule to be that a deduction cannot be claimed for tax if an expense has not been recorded in the entity�s financial statements. We are concerned that the Government has not considered the position of a taxpayer that has chosen, for non-tax reasons, to capitalise costs that could have been expensed. This may be the result of a choice by the taxpaying entity or it may be the result of a requirement placed on that entity, for example, by a parent or a lending institution. Where this capitalisation occurs, the effect of using FRS 13 in the legislation is to prohibit a deduction being taken. We understand that this issue was not considered in any detail at the time that FRS 13 was incorporated into the R & D tax regime. We would like to discuss with you the feasibility of extending the allowable deduction to cover expenditure which has been capitalised but which does not give rise to a recognisable asset and is not land or buildings. If that is not feasible, we would like to discuss a change to the amortisation rules so that any capitalised expenditure (excluding expenditure on land) could be expensed over time, or immediately if the project to which the development expenditure relates is abandoned. Differential reporting Not all entities are required to adopt the accounting standards. Most companies are exempt companies, because they are small private companies. Multi-national companies may also be outside the accounting standards. Where an entity is not using FRS 13 for financial reporting purposes, there is some ambiguity about the way that the legislation is applied. Such entities can only claim R & D expenditure by using the general deduction rules or the special rules allowing deductions for scientific research. We would like to discuss with you the coverage of entities that are not required to use FRS 13. We believe that such exempt entities should be subject to the same rules for the treatment of R & D, and the same certainty of treatment, as entities that have to use FRS 13 for their financial accounting. While it could be argued that the existing wording in section DJ 9A allows this, the position is not clear and legislative clarification is required. FRS 13 vs International accounting standard 38 (IAS 38) Currently Section DJ 9A of the Income Tax Act 1994 explicitly incorporates FRS 13. We understand that it is likely that a New Zealand version of IAS 38 will be introduced as an alternative to FRS 13 from 2005. The New Zealand equivalent of IAS 38 will completely replace FRS 13 from 2007. We would like to discuss the implications of this change. In particular it is important that the policy objectives outlined above not be undermined by the move to international accounting standards. While the tests in IAS 38 are very similar to those in FRS 13, an exercise will need to be undertaken to confirm that no unexpected tax changes arise from the switch. Well-run vs poorly run companies Concern has been expressed by companies involved in undertaking R & D that applying the five criteria in FRS 13 (at paragraph 5.3) for tax purposes may penalise orderly research and development. In practice it will be easier for an entity which is poorly run (in the sense of lacking discipline and approval procedures before R & D is undertaken) entity to show that it does not meet the criteria. A well-run entity will be trying to ensure that it gets some payback for its research and development effort, that it is acting within budget, that there is a market, etc. Thus a well-run entity may find it harder to place itself outside the requirements to capitalise. This may be an issue that the IRD can address operationally by giving some public guidance on how it sees the criteria in paragraph 5.3 working. General The Liaison Group welcomes the opportunity to discuss these issues with you. We appreciate the efforts that the Government has already made to address concerns about the deductibility of research and development. We look forward to working with you in the future on this issue. Yours faithfully  John Shewan On behalf of the Private Sector Liaison Group on Research and Development  In contrast, para 5.14 of FRS 13 requires the unamortised balance of development costs to be written off and recognised immediately as an expense when the criteria in para 5.3, which previously justified recognition as an asset, no longer apply. Para 5.15 requires the asset to be written down to the extent that the unamortised balance exceeds the probable future economic benefits.  It is recognised that is some cases a deduction may be claimed under either ordinary principles (because the new rules in section DJ 9A are elective) or under section DJ 9 (expenditure on scientific research).

SPEECH NOTES

### Hawke's Bay Financial Planners and Insurance Advisors Association

Thank you for inviting me to call in to your meeting this afternoon. As the Minister who diversified around $7 billion into the longest bear market in fifty years I presume that you have called me in to offer me some sage advice.

On a more serious note, I would imagine that you and your colleagues are also having to come to terms with the implications of recent trends in world share markets. The big question is whether we are in the middle of a sea change in where small savers put their money.

During my working life, financial planners have faced one major change in the way they went about their business. When I first encountered the insurance company agent the pitch was quite simple: use up whatever you haven't used up of your $1,200 annual tax exemption, and put it in a policy that my company sells.

Since then, the tax exemption has gone, there are more requirements around transparency and disclosure and the clients have been far less willing to take the only product on offer. Financial planners are less likely to work for a single company and are under more pressure to tailor the product - or more specifically a savings and insurance plan - around the specific needs and life cycle stage of the client.

I am generalising and of course there are exceptions, but I suspect that financial planners still had a basic fallback. When it came to the crunch, the advice was to invest in global equities because over time they had delivered the best returns. Because all markets have their ups and downs, invest for the longer term and do not panic in response to temporary fluctuations. Go into an overseas fund, lock it away, and look at it again when you are 65.

I would be interested to get your views on how well that pitch goes down these days. There is a nervousness in the marketplace about returns on managed funds, and there is still a questioning going on about whether, when and how strongly global equity markets will rebound. Personal financial planning is in a state of flux, and I don't imagine that we will get a clear picture on where it will settle for some months - or even years - yet.

In the meantime, you have asked me to address some very specific questions that your members have lodged with Vicky Watson, your Secretary. I am sure we will have time at the end to canvass other issues.

I am asked to define the government's position on estate and death duties, and to comment on whether they are likely to be reintroduced. The issue is not on the agenda and I cannot recall reintroduction of death duties ever being a formal option for consideration in budget discussions during the last four years. Indeed, if anything, the trend is the other way. The recent decision to phase out asset testing on long-term frail care patients has the ultimate effect of protecting inheritances before death as well as not taxing them after death.

I would make an observation that the recent Household Savings Survey carried out by Statistics New Zealand in collaboration with the Retirement Commissioner revealed a surprisingly strong contribution from inheritances to the net assets that New Zealanders own. People seldom inherit when they are young, but if you look at the results for those in the 45 to 65 year age groups, those who had received an inheritance had - on average - over $100,000 more assets than those who had not. I make the observation that inheritance - inter-generational savings in effect - is a surprisingly large part of personal savings behaviour in New Zealand. It is also a fact of life that inheritance will be unevenly distributed, and this explains some part of the very large inequality in the distribution of assets that the survey discovered. The survey showed that the distribution of wealth was twice as unequal as the distribution of income.

The importance of inheritance in the life-cycle savings pattern is probably one factor that would tend to make governments of all political persuasions reluctant to get back into the business of death duties.

My second question asks the government's view on tax incentives to save for retirement. We haven't closed the debate on this, but at this stage in the evaluation I would indicate that official advice is that tax incentives are very expensive and may not be all that effective in increasing retirement savings.

They are expensive for three main reasons. Firstly, they apply to all who save, and the government is not only incentivising new savers but paying the money to those who would have saved anyway. Secondly, it is difficult to design tax incentives that cannot be accessed by people who simply shift savings out of current vehicles into tax advantaged forms. Finally, in order to change behaviour, incentives have to be fairly large. The $1,200 a year I mentioned earlier was a lot of money in those days. Multiply a large incentive by something like a million people who might want to use it and you see that tax incentives for savings tend to be counted in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

There is also a bit of concern that they tend to be regressive: they give the biggest advantage to those who have the most money anyway. If lower income groups and young families are not in a position to save, they cannot access the incentives. Finally, there is the question of how effective they are. By lowering government saving to try and leverage more private savings, tax incentives can actually reduce national savings.

This is not to say the tax on savings issue is dead. A big problem is the tax disincentives that apply to forms of savings, and how we deal with that. The budget made a start by aligning the tax on the employer contribution to a superannuation scheme with the marginal tax rate of the worker, but I readily concede that we need to take a harder look at the practicalities of ironing out other disincentives and anomalies that remain in the tax system.

The next question seems to widen out the brief of financial planners a bit, and asks whether there is any plan to ease Fringe Benefit Tax on group medical insurance contributions. The argument is that medical insurance saves the government millions in health costs. The general answer is no. As a matter of principle, we have tended to go for a tax regime that has few exemptions. Comprehensive taxes are much cleaner and more efficient to administer, and there is always argument about why this or that should be exempt from GST, or FBT, or allowed as a deduction against PAYE. In this area I find my Doctor No act is the best defence.

But even on the simple argument of costs and benefits to the government, the case is weak. Removing FBT would exempt all treatments and cost recoveries and not only those that would have taken place in public hospitals had the patient not gone private. It would also give tax relief to those who would have taken out private insurance anyway to ensure more choice over time and place of treatment. It is by no means clear that this would be a fiscal winner.

I can tell you that current plans are to issue a government discussion paper on the rules that govern FBT. Because FBT on health insurance was one of the issues that were raised in submissions on the initial round of consultations, it will be in the discussion document. The focus of the discussion is on simplifying the rules and reducing the associated compliance costs, including determining whether the breadth of benefits covered by FBT remains appropriate. The document is due out later this year.

I have been asked if the government will legislate against products that are promoted as investment products, but pay high up-front commissions to promoters, at a cost to the investor. This is a special sub-set of a later question that asks what the future holds for the regulation of financial planning in New Zealand and about government plans for regulation. I am going to duck these questions for two very good reasons: they are outside my direct area of Ministerial responsibility, and the relevant Minister is scheduled to outline government thinking on the regulatory agenda at your annual association meeting in Rotorua later this month. If I gave you a preview, I am sure your national association would feel that its thunder had been stolen.

One question asks why the government doesn't allow a similar tax regime for unit trust investments in New Zealand as applies to Australian unit trusts. Australia sees unit trusts as more akin to ordinary trusts and distinct from companies, whereas New Zealand taxes unit trusts under our company tax rules.

This is because economically, a unit trust most resembles a company. There is capital contributed by beneficiaries, a real separation of owners from managers, and mutual investment by unrelated persons. In our view, these factors are not present to the same extent in an ordinary trust.

This leaves the last of the set questions before the free-for-all. It is very specific and asks whether the government will continue to allow the use of loss attributing qualifying companies for negatively geared investments.

The use of LAQCs for negatively geared investments is not on the IRD work programme and at present there is no intention to review the existing rules.

LAQCs are used in a number of mass marketed tax driven schemes, though not in all of those schemes. The recently introduced deferred deduction rule which targets arrangements that result in investors receiving more in tax deductions than the money they invest in the arrangements addresses these schemes without interfering in the legitimate use of LAQCs. It is the inappropriate use of the LAQCs, rather than LAQCs themselves that we need to focus on.

The fact that the use of LAQCs for negatively geared investments is not on the work programme does not mean that the IRD will not carry on observing what is happening in the marketplace and I am sure that they will report to me if they become aware of transactions that give rise to fresh policy concerns.

Savings has been the slumbering giant of the public policy debate during the last decade. During that time the proportion of the workforce that are members of employment based superannuation schemes has slumped from 22.6 per cent to 14.6 per cent. Household debt has increased dramatically, and credit card debt continues go grow apace.

Now the debate on what to do about savings is reviving. The Retirement Commissioner has encouraged a fuller exploration of the information that the Savings Survey gathered. The government has convened the Periodic Review Group that was established under the largely moribund Superannuation Accord and has asked it to make recommendations that focus on employment based superannuation. The PRG is scheduled to report by the end of the year. The Insurance, Investment and Savings Association is holding a savings summit on 23 July, and the next day your own national association has its forum on the theme of facing change.

So change is on the agenda in a number of ways. The investment environment has changed, policy on saving is changing, and there is a change in the profile of the debate about how to improve our national savings record.

This will be an important year for charting the course ahead for the savings industry and all the interests associated with it. With those remarks, please fire away with your questions and your observations.

Thank you.
Hon Dr Michael Cullen Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Finance, Minister of Revenue, Leader of the House 1 6 August 2003 Speech Notes Embargoed until: 6.00 pm Wednesday 6 August 2003 Address to Auckland Branch of ICANZ You have given me a fairly broad mandate to talk to you on whatever I think might interest a group like yours. I have taken the liberty of defining what I think a group of corporate Chief Financial Officers would be interested in from a professional point of view. The three areas I have listed are the immediate outlook for the economy, and what that means for the business conditions your companies face; the financial environment that you are having to adjust to, and in particular your responses to interest and exchange rate trends; and what might be happening with tax. If we look back to the March 2003 year, all of the economic indicators are remarkably strong. GDP grew by 0.6 per cent in the March quarter, leaving annual average growth at 4.3 per cent for the March year. Construction has continued to drive a lot of the growth. The economic outlook built into the budget envisaged us hitting a soft spot in the middle of the year as dry conditions, SARS and uncertainties over electricity supply impacted on farm production, tourism, export education and process industries that use a lot of electricity. I stress that these pressures were assessed as temporary, and the best guess was that they would cause the economy to soften rather than stagnate. As events have unfolded, these negative pressures have eased, and the latest advice I have from the Treasury is that they remain comfortable with the budget scenario of growth slowing to a bit over 2 per cent in the March 2004 year. That picture is consistent with last week’s National Bank Business Outlook. I am always cautious about confidence surveys. I suspect that they reflect a view through the rear vision mirror rather describe the road ahead as it appears through the front windscreen, and of course confidence indices are massively more volatile than real economic indicators ever turn out to be. We also have the problem of reconciling the almost inevitable divergence between what businesses report as their assessment of future conditions for the economy as a whole and what they see for their own activity. Those reservations aside, the bank itself interprets the level of confidence as indicative of growth of about 2 per cent: a forecast that is in line with budget and post-budget assessments. 2 I do not take this as a negative. One lesson we have to learn from the exuberances of the eighties and nineties is that the business cycle is not dead. If our economy slows, it is slowing after a long and strong expansion in terms of our recent history. It is slowing with unemployment at relatively low levels, and with the base level of activity generating strong cash flows pretty much across the board. From a fiscal point of view, that growth rate is consistent with an operating surplus of $3.8 billion and with Crown debt falling in both nominal and real terms. While it may be slowing, the softness is caused by temporary rather than structural impacts, so the outlook is for an improvement, rather than further softness. We must always remember that averages mislead. Concealed within the aggregate numbers are big differences between the sectors, and these differences are again largely consistent as between budget outlook and National Bank confidence numbers. It is this divergence between the activity rates of different sectors that is exercising the mind of Reserve Bank Governor Alan Bollard, and I have no intention of making any comment on how he might play the hand he has been dealt. I will, though, make some general comments about the exchange rate. This is not new, but it is worth repeating. Our dollar is a microscopic element in the global financial system. It is not so much what we have done in relation to the US dollar but what the greenback has done in relation to the rest of the world, of which we are but a tiny part. Important as the exchange rate may be, we are global price takers not price makers. There is a big question mark about how strongly our relative interest rate will impact on the US-Kiwi cross, so there is not a simple relationship and nor are there predictable effects from pulling particular levers. I also think it is worth repeating the results of the recent Westpac study that tried to isolate the main drivers of the Aussie-Kiwi cross. According to that study, the variations in our exchange rates were explained by differences in relative country performance on productivity, inflation, commodity prices and savings, not by interest rate differentials or speculative financial flows. If – and I always have to put a big “if” in front of drawing conclusions from selected economic models – the Kiwi is rising because we are lifting our game on the productivity front, because inflation is under control here, and because our commodity prices are relatively robust, that should not in itself be a worry. New Zealand producers remain competitive. We should also perhaps keep an eye on what is happening in Japan and in the USA. I am very interested in commentaries coming out of those economies that are now starting to worry that low interest rates – in effect interest rates that are hovering around zero – do not seem to be stimulating investment. They are 3 helping to hold up consumer demand, and have kept housing markets buoyant, but when it comes to industrial investment it is a bit like pushing on a piece of string. One speculation I have seen is that the massive expansion of global manufacturing capacity during the last quarter of the last century has made investors wary of greenfields investment. If that is so, we need to focus on where our opportunities for investment might lie, rather than being fixated with the cost of investment funds. It is no use having cheap money if there is nothing constructive that can be done with it. If we look at global capacity, and how New Zealand can grow market share given the composition of that capacity, there is a reasonably good story – or at least an optimistic story - to tell. The question that arises for us is whether we are entering another age when primary production – admittedly high productivity, knowledge intensive, smart, value-added primary based production – gives countries like us a national advantage. This advantage can lie in two areas. Because there is global overcapacity in traditional lines of manufacturing: clothing, motor vehicles, electronic goods and so on, investors have to increase the pace of innovation. They have to find new lines of product development, and primary products, in combination with exploding biotechnologies, offer new opportunities for product development across a range of uses from food to fibres to pharmaceuticals. The second area of advantage emerges from the flip side of industrialisation. The effect of it has been that vast numbers have left subsistence agriculture and moved in to urban based wage employment. They have to be fed and clothed. Primary products may well be moving away from being the poor relations of manufactured goods to becoming the new scarce resource and the basic ingredient for the next wave of innovation. This is why the government is looking to put some momentum behind the technological, skills, and infrastructural needs of innovation rather than relying on macroeconomic stimuli to solve the growth problem. The short message is that interest rates are not a cure all. And so to tax, a matter dear to the hearts of all Chief Financial Officers, who seem to have a life mission of outwitting the fiscus I have to say that like interest rates, tax is not a cure all. If a company has inadequate earnings, increasing what is left of those earnings does not make them adequate. This is why the government puts so much emphasis in trying to build an economic environment that is profit friendly. I fully acknowledge that tax can complicate the business environment, and so I have put a lot of store by continuing to make the tax rules clear, clean and comprehensive. You will see some progress on that front over the next few months. 4 A taxation bill that is before Parliament will bring into effect New Zealand’s part in a landmark agreement with Australia to relieve a longstanding problem of the double taxation of certain trans-Tasman investments. The joint initiative reflects the commitment of both governments to the continued strengthening of the Closer Economic Relations agreement and promoting trans-Tasman business by reducing the tax impediments to operating in both countries. Under the agreement, the imputation systems of both countries are being expanded to include companies resident in the other country that want to take part. New Zealand’s bill makes it possible for Australian companies to join New Zealand’s imputation credit rules. Similar legislation has been enacted in Australia. The same bill better aligns the GST treatment of the financial services sector with that of other industries. Financial institutions will be allowed to recover GST on purchases related to the supply of their services to businesses, which will reduce over-taxation of the sector. This is a major change that has been welcomed by the financial services sector. Another important reform in the bill is the introduction of a GST reverse charge to tax certain imports of services. The measure is designed to ensure that GST does not unfairly disadvantage New Zealand interests at a time when we are making increased use of electronic commerce and importing many more services than we did in the past. The government perseveres in its commitment to simplify tax and reduce tax compliance costs, and work continues apace. A number of simplification measures aimed at business have been enacted so far. Perhaps one of the most significant changes, from the perspective of the people here today, was the enactment a couple of years ago of legislation to clarify and simplify the general interest deductibility rules for most companies. Although almost all interest incurred was deductible under the previous law, the rules that companies were required to work with were complex, and companies sometimes had to structure their affairs to fit within the rules. This could create significant compliance costs. The new law ensures that interest on borrowing is deductible for most companies without requiring them to overcome these technical hurdles. The government’s tax simplification focus is now on small to medium-sized businesses, which form a more significant component of the economy than they do in other OECD countries. They are important in numbers and in their tax contribution. In New Zealand, businesses with fewer than twenty employees make up 97 per cent of all companies, employ 43% of all workers, and produce 39 per cent of all goods and 5 services. Meeting tax obligations can take up disproportionate time and effort for a small business. A government discussion document setting out further proposals for reducing the time and effort required of small businesses will be released in a few weeks’ time. It will contain a number of proposals to make tax matters easier for them. They include proposals for the government to cover part of the costs involved in businesses making use of payroll agencies to help with PAYE, and aligning the payment dates for provisional tax and GST. The government is aware that what suits one business may not suit another, and what suits small businesses may not suit large businesses, so we will be consulting extensively on the proposals. Also to be released later in the year is a discussion document setting out proposals for simplifying fringe benefit tax, reducing the associated compliance costs and improving its effectiveness. This is the first major review of the fringe benefit tax rules since they were introduced in 1985. The focus of the discussion document will be on reducing the difficulty and cost to employers of complying with fringe benefit tax and removing anomalies, while ensuring that the revenue base is maintained. I shall now turn briefly to an issue that has been attracting media attention. It concerns investment products aimed at New Zealand investors that claim virtually to remove any tax being paid on the resulting income. As I understand it, the arrangement works something like this. A New Zealand resident purchases units in an Australian unit trust, and the unit trust uses those funds to buy – for example – New Zealand Government bonds. Interest from the bonds is paid to the Australian unit trust, with only a 2% levy deducted. Because Australia, unlike New Zealand, taxes the entity as a trust, rather than as a company, the interest is not taxed in Australia under Australian tax rules because it is not sourced in Australia and does not relate to an Australian beneficiary. The unit trust distributes its income by way of non-taxable bonus issues so that the New Zealand investor ends up with more units. Given the way New Zealand and Australian tax law inter-relates, no New Zealand or Australian tax is payable at this stage. Gains that New Zealand residents derive from the eventual sale of their units may, however, be taxable, depending on whether the investment was held on capital or revenue account. The answer to this question will vary depending on the specific facts and, in particular, on the purpose for which the investor acquired the original investment. I am not a tax expert but it seems to me to be a mighty effort to argue that shares or units with no realistic dividend yield were purchased otherwise than for the purpose of sale. That would make all the gains taxable. I note that a few tax experts have also raised this warning. Regardless of the intricacies of the capital versus revenue law, the main point is that New Zealanders may be able to derive interest from New Zealand 6 Government bonds virtually tax-free if they invest through one of these Australian unit trust structures. An identical investment through a New Zealand vehicle would be clearly subject to New Zealand tax. From the Government’s perspective this is unacceptable and, if necessary, we will change the law to ensure that this option is not available. As a first step, October will see the release for consultation of an issues paper that will raise options to deal with this problem and other issues that arise under the foreign investment fund rules. One of the options canvassed will be a version of the McLeod Review’s risk-free rate of return method. The lesson of the last forty years is that loopholes are not in anybody’s interest. They distort the flow of funds and to the extent that they are effective in eroding the tax base they simply increase the pressure on the tax rate in other parts of the system. My message overall is that we are making steady progress on a number of fronts. In an era of intense global economic instability and uncertainty, New Zealand is performing very well. We cannot take continued progress for granted, and we need to work on that, but by the same token we must avoid our natural propensity to always find dark cloud inside the silver lining. Thank you.

Spotlight on "tax-free" investment products
===========================================

Revenue Minister Michael Cullen today signalled that the government would move to prevent New Zealand investors using certain overseas funds to escape tax. An issues paper to be released in October would contain proposals to deal with the problem and others that arise under the foreign investment fund rules, he said.

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Spotlight on tax-free investment products

Revenue Minister Michael Cullen today signalled that the government would move to prevent New Zealand investors using certain overseas funds to escape tax.

In a speech delivered by Associate Revenue Minister David Cunliffe on his behalf to the Institute of Chartered Accountants, Dr Cullen referred to Australian unit trusts that invest in New Zealand government stock and offer associated investment products that are claimed to be free of New Zealand income tax.

"An identical investment through a New Zealand vehicle would be clearly subject to New Zealand tax," Dr Cullen said. "From the government's perspective this is unacceptable and, if necessary, we will change the law to close the loophole.

"As a first step, an issues paper will be released in October for consultation on proposals to deal with this and other problems that arise under the foreign investment fund rules. One of the options canvassed will be a version of the McLeod Review's risk-free rate of return method.

"The lesson of the last 40 years is that loopholes are not in anybody's interest. They distort the flow of funds and, to the extent that they are effective in eroding the tax base, they simply increase the pressure on the tax rate in other parts of the system," Dr Cullen said.

Appendix C: Factors that restrict export growth (detailed analysis) Appendix D: A review of the literature on compliance 1 Executive Summary There has been a considerable amount of research undertaken on the topic of business compliance both in New Zealand and overseas. Many of these studies have focused on estimating the ‘cost’ of compliance (and defining the different types of cost), and on exploring the ways in which these costs can be minimised (by changes in the way legislation and regulations are developed and/or administered by government agencies). A secondary focus has been on gaining a greater understanding of what motivates the individuals who exhibit high levels of compliance. Some research has focused on comparing the cost of compliance in different countries, and in 2001 the OECD undertook a study of eleven countries 1 . This study made a distinction between administrative compliance costs (filling in forms etc), capital costs (capital investments needed for compliance purposes), and indirect or efficiency costs which arise when regulations reduce productivity and innovativeness. The study 2 (which suggested that in New Zealand the direct cost of compliance is low by comparison with other OECD countries) provided important information to the government agencies that are charged with reducing the negative impact of compliance in New Zealand. The Ministerial Panel on Business Compliance Costs was established in December 2000 to provide advice to the government on ways to reduce unnecessary or over-burdensome compliance costs to business arising from central and local government regulation. The Panel identified a number of concerns that are held by New Zealand firms, and the various reports that were produced as a result of the Panel’s work provided the platform for further work by the Regulatory and Competition Policy Branch of the Ministry of Economic Development (MED). One of the priorities of this work programme was to undertake a pilot study into the way in which the managers of New Zealand firms perceive regulations and legislation as having an impact on their performance and on their ability to be innovative. P ROJECT OBJECTIVES The focus of the present project was to assist the Ministry of Economic Development in understanding more about the way in which New Zealand firms (particularly those that are small and medium in size) are currently facing their compliance commitments. The intention was to undertake (and report upon) a piece of research while at the same time developing and testing a method for measuring the perceptions of New Zealand business people about compliance. In keeping with this dual focus, two main objectives were identified: Objective 1: To gain an understanding of the perceptions of NZ managers on the consequences of compliance In terms of this objective the researchers were asked to provide MED with a report which: 1 OECD. (2001). Businesses' views on red tape: Administrative and regulatory burdens on small and medium-sized enterprises. Paris: OECD. 2 There are some limitations that are important to note when relating the findings to New Zealand. The most important is that the survey excluded firms with no employees and did not include all areas of regulation. 2 1.1Identifies and describes the perceptions held by the managers of New Zealand firms in respect of their compliance commitments (with a particular focus on the way this commitment affects the firm’s performance and its ability to innovate). 1.2Provides information on the impact of the compliance commitment (and its associated costs) on the firm’s performance and its ability to innovate (relative to other factors). 1.3Provides information on the types of strategies that firms put in place to manage their compliance commitment and ameliorate any associated costs 3 . Objective 2: To develop an appropriate methodology for assessing compliance perceptions In terms of this objective the researchers were asked to develop a methodology that will make it possible for MED to measure the three items listed above, and which has been tested within the context of this project. This methodology will enable MED to: 2.1Identify changes over time in the perceptions held by the managers of New Zealand firms in respect of their compliance commitment. 2.2Understand how the compliance commitment affects the firm’s performance and its ability to innovate (relative to other factors). 2.3Build up a picture of the strategies that firms put in place to manage their compliance commitment and ameliorate any associated costs. 2.4Assess whether the actions taken by government agencies are having the desired effect. The objectives were modified slightly after Treasury became involved with the project. Their interest in firms that are exporting (or which have the potential to do so) meant that the researchers identified exporters (and potential exporters) as a specific sub-sample, to be addressed in the data gathering that was undertaken for Objective 1. P ROJECT METHODOLOGY The studies already undertaken in New Zealand provided the research team with a valuable starting point for this project, by identifying some aspects of the nature of the compliance burden, and to a certain degree exploring the way in which this burden manifests itself for different groups. For example, in the 2001 review respondents identified three main ways in which compliance impacted on their business: the time spent complying, the fact that compliance has a stifling effect on innovation and competition and the cost of expert assistance. These general concepts were used by the researchers in this project, to explore more specific ways in which the compliance burden can express itself within the context of a single firm. The project had three components: 1. A review of the international and New Zealand literature on compliance. 2. A series of focus groups to identify the particular concerns of New Zealand exporters 4 . 3 After some discussion between the researchers and MED about the difficulty of collecting valid data on this topic (see Section 7 for further discussion of this point), it was decided not to attempt to address this topic in the project. 4 These groups were not part of the initial proposal, but were added to answer the needs of the Treasury team. The results from this component of the project are reported on separately. 3 3. A telephone survey of approximately 400 business owners and managers. Those recruited to take part in this survey were selected to provide data on the following characteristics: firm size; export involvement; firm stage; growth intentions and industry type. These methods are explained in more detail in Appendix A. R ESULTS A summary of the findings follows. Constraints on exporting When asked to comment on a number of factors (a list of these was read to the respondents) and to consider whether these factors were restricting or slowing their export growth (or their ability to earn foreign exchange if this was more appropriate), the 388 respondents (those who were already exporting or felt they had the potential to do so), most commonly identified: ♦ The conditions and regulations placed by overseas governments (over 60% said this was a factor that restricted their export growth, or had the potential to do so, compared to 37% who said that this factor was not a concern). ♦ The cost and time needed to represent the firm overseas (over 60% said this was a factor that restricted their export growth, or had the potential to do so, compared to 37% who said that this factor was not a concern). ♦ The effort and distraction of complying with regulations in NZ (over 54% said this was a factor that restricted their export growth, or had the potential to do so, compared to 45% who said that this factor was not a concern). ♦ The executive time and the expense of collecting information and researching a possible new overseas prospect (54% said this was a factor that restricted their export growth, or had the potential to do so, compared to 45% who said that this factor was not a concern). ♦ Getting identity and exposure for the firm or brand overseas (51% said this was a factor that restricted their export growth, or had the potential to do so, compared to 48% who said that this factor was not a concern). However, the factors were not raised to the same degree by the five different groups that were surveyed. The key differences between the groups in relation to the top three factors shows that: ♦ Respondents that answered “yes, significantly” in relation to the ‘conditions and regulations placed by overseas governments’ were most likely to be from firms that: employ more than 11 FTEs, export, are neither ‘mature’ nor ‘new’, intend to grow strongly and come from the food and primary industry sectors. ♦ Respondents that answered “yes, significantly” in relation to the ‘cost and time needed to represent the firm overseas’ were most likely to be from firms that: do not employ and that employ more than 11 FTEs, do not export, are new, intend to grow strongly and are from the software and primary industry sectors. ♦ Respondents that answered “yes, significantly” in relation to the ‘effort and distraction of complying with regulations in NZ’ were most likely to be from firms that: employ 2-10 FTEs, export, are ‘mature’ and ‘new’, intend to contract or consolidate, and are from the food, tourism and primary sectors. 4 Viewing the entire set of factors from the perspective of the groups themselves, there were also visible differences: ♦ In terms of firm size, all groups identified the ‘cost and time needed to represent the firm overseas’ and the ‘conditions and regulations placed by overseas governments’ as factors that restrict growth. Firms with fewer staff were more likely to identify the ‘effort and distraction of complying with regulations in NZ’ as a factor. ♦ In terms of export involvement, both groups identified the ‘cost and time needed to represent the firm overseas’ and the ‘conditions and regulations placed by overseas governments’. ♦ In terms of firm stage, all three groups identified the ‘cost and time needed to represent the firm overseas’ as a factor. However, recently established firms noted ‘getting identity/exposure for firm overseas’ and ‘time/expense re possible new overseas prospect’ as factors. ♦ In terms of growth intentions, all three groups identified the ‘conditions and regulations placed by overseas governments’. Respondents from firms that are contracting identified ‘NZ's requirements for health/safety at workplaces’ and the ‘effort and distraction of complying with regulations in NZ’ as factors. ♦ In terms of industry type, almost all groups identified the ‘conditions and regulations placed by overseas governments’ and the ‘cost and time needed to represent the firm overseas’. However, the other answers demonstrate the varied nature of the New Zealand business population, and the variance in the impact of compliance on different industry sectors. Constraints on productivity & growth In relation to factors that divert and distract the firm away from focusing on productivity and growth, it is noticeable that on almost all of the factors the majority response was that the firm readily deals with the issues involved. However, given the focus of this study (on providing MED and other agencies with information that they can use to reduce the compliance burden for New Zealand firms), the researchers identified all those factors where more than 30% of respondents identified the factor as an issue – irrespective of the proportion of those who indicated that they were ‘dealing with it’. On this basis the issues of most concern to the 490 respondents (the whole sample) were: ♦ The regulations that apply to releasing a person who no longer suits the business (46% said this was a factor that diverts or distracts them, compared to 39% who said that this factor was not a concern). ♦ The ACC insurance arrangements as they relate to the firm business (37% said this was a factor that diverts or distracts them, compared to 58% who said that this factor was not a concern). ♦ The arrangements that are needed for health and safety of employees business (32% said this was a factor that diverts or distracts them, compared to 59% who said that this factor was not a concern). ♦ Providing a range of employment and other data on the firm to government agencies business (30% said this was a factor that diverts or distracts them, compared to 57% who said that this factor was not a concern). However, the factors were not raised to the same degree by the five different groups that were surveyed. The key differences between the groups in relation to the top three factors shows that: 5 ♦ Respondents who identified ‘releasing an employee’ as a factor that diverts and distracts them were most likely to be from firms that: employ 6-10 FTEs and more than 11 FTEs, export, are ‘mature’, intend to contract, and are from the primary, non-food, wholesale, retail and manufacturing sectors and the food industry. ♦ Respondents who identified ‘labelling controls and standards’ as a factor that diverts and distracts them were most likely to be from firms that: employ 6-10 FTEs and those that do not employ, are not currently exporting (but anticipate doing so) and those that are exporting, are neither ‘mature’ nor ‘new’, intend to grow and are from the food, and wholesale, retail and manufacturing sectors. ♦ Respondents who identified ‘getting consent to use land, water and air’ as a factor that diverts and distracts them were most likely to be from firms that: employ more than 11 FTEs and those that employ 6-10 FTEs, export, are neither ‘mature’ nor ‘new, intend to contract and are from the food and primary sectors. Viewed from the perspective of the groups themselves, there were also some differences, although the responses to this question provided the least differences between the groups. ♦ In terms of firm size, all groups identified ‘arrangements expected when need to fire someone’ and ‘ACC levy arrangements as they relate to your firm’ as factors that divert and distract them. Respondents from larger firms were more likely to identify ‘arrangements for health and safety of employees’ as a factor that diverts and distracts them. ♦ In terms of export involvement, all groups identified ‘arrangements expected when need to fire someone’ and ‘ACC levy arrangements as they relate to your firm’ as factors that divert and distract them. ♦ In terms of firm stage, all groups identified ‘arrangements expected when need to fire someone’ and ‘ACC levy arrangements as they relate to your firm’ as factors that divert and distract them. ♦ In terms of growth intentions, all groups identified ‘arrangements expected when need to fire someone’ and ‘ACC levy arrangements as they relate to your firm’ as factors that divert and distract them. ♦ In terms of industry type, almost all groups identified ‘arrangements expected when need to fire someone’, ‘ACC levy arrangements as they relate to your firm’ and ‘arrangements for health and safety of employees’ as factors that divert and distract them. Costs versus benefits In relation to costs versus benefits, the issues of most concern (i.e. where respondents perceived that the cost and time outweighed the benefit) were: ♦ The regulations that apply to the process of releasing a person who no longer suits the business (43% said that the cost and time outweighed the benefit, compared to 13% who felt that the benefit was greater than the cost) ♦ The ACC insurance arrangements as it relates to the firm (39% said that the cost and time outweighed the benefit, compared to 15% who felt that the benefit was greater than the cost) ♦ Providing a range of employment and other data on the firm to government agencies (37% said that the cost and time outweighed the benefit), compared to 13% who felt that the benefit was greater than the cost) 6 The issues of least concern (i.e. where respondents perceived that the benefit outweighed the cost and time involved) were: ♦ The guidelines for firms trading fairly in relation to each others products and services, and in relation to customers (27% said that the benefit was greater than the cost, compared to 9% who felt that the cost and time outweighed the benefit). ♦ The regulations that need to be taken into account when a new person is being hired (27% said that the benefit was greater than the cost, compared to 16% who felt that the cost and time outweighed the benefit). ♦ The arrangements expected of the firm in regard to clean air, water and environment protection (21% said that the benefit was greater than the cost, compared to 14% who felt that the cost and time outweighed the benefit). Again, these perceptions were not identical across the different groups that were surveyed. The key differences between the groups in relation to the top three factors shows that: ♦ Respondents who described the time, effort and cost of ‘releasing an employee’ as outweighing the benefits were most likely to be from firms that: employ 6-10 FTEs and employ more than 11 FTEs, are not currently exporting, are ‘mature’, are contracting and are from the non-food, primary sectors and the wholesale, retail and manufacturing trades. ♦ Respondents who described the time, effort and cost of ‘ACC insurance arrangements’ as outweighing the benefits were most likely to be from firms that: employ 2-5 FTEs, are not currently exporting, are ‘mature’ and from the primary, non-food and food sectors (there was no difference in terms of firm growth intention). ♦ Respondents who described the time, effort and cost of ‘providing data to government agencies’ as outweighing the benefits were most likely to be from firms that: employ more than 11 FTEs, are not currently exporting, are ‘mature’, and are from the software and business service industry and the primary sector (there was no difference in terms of firm growth intention). Viewed from the perspective of the groups themselves, there were also some differences: ♦ In terms of firm size, all groups identified ‘the ACC insurance arrangements as they relate to your firm’, ‘the regulations that apply to releasing a person who no longer suits the business’ and ‘providing a range of employment and other data on your firm to government agencies’ as examples of legislation where they felt the costs outweighed the benefits. ♦ In terms of export involvement, all groups identified ‘the regulations that apply to releasing a person who no longer suits the business’, ‘the ACC insurance arrangements as they relate to your firm’ and ‘providing a range of employment and other data on your firm to government agencies’ as examples of legislation where they felt the costs outweighed the benefits. ♦ In terms of firm stage, all groups identified ‘the regulations that apply to releasing a person who no longer suits the business’, ‘the ACC insurance arrangements as they relate to your firm’ and ‘providing a range of employment and other data on your firm to government agencies’ as examples of legislation where they felt the costs outweighed the benefits. ♦ In terms of growth intentions, all groups identified ‘the regulations that apply to releasing a person who no longer suits the business’, ‘the ACC insurance arrangements as they relate to your firm’ and ‘providing a range of employment and other data on your firm to 7 government agencies’ as examples of legislation where they felt the costs outweighed the benefits. The exception was contracting firms, which were more likely to comment on taxation. ♦ In terms of industry type, all groups identified ‘the regulations that apply to releasing a person who no longer suits the business’ and ‘providing a range of employment and other data on your firm to government agencies’ as examples of legislation where they felt the costs outweighed the benefits. Compliance & firm dynamics ♦ In relation to whether the time and effort that respondents have put into compliance has changed over the previous year or two, 273 (56%) said there had been an increase. Respondents who said that there had been an increase were more likely to be from firms that were contracting, and were from the food and primary sectors. ♦ In terms of the potential for compliance commitments to impact on firm dynamics, 283 (58%) respondents said they could identify a particular piece of legislation in relation to the nine factors that were read to them. This compares to 206 (42%) who said they could not identify a piece of legislation that had this effect. ♦ Respondents who could identify particular pieces of legislation that they saw as having the potential to ‘distract and divert senior staff’, were most likely to be from firms that: employ more than 11 FTEs and employ 6-10 FTEs, export, are ‘mature’, are contracting and are from the food, non-food and primary sectors. ♦ 312 (64%) respondents could identify particular pieces of legislation that they saw as having the potential to be ‘ambiguous to interpret or apply’. This compared to 178 (36%) who said no to this question. ♦ 179 (36%) respondents could identify particular pieces of legislation that they saw as having the potential to ‘draw the firm into legal expenses’. This compared to 310 (63%) who said no to this question. ♦ 121 (25%) respondents could identify particular pieces of legislation that they saw as having the potential to ‘generate conflict and disagreement with regulatory agency staff’. This compared to 368 (75%) who said no to this question. ♦ 177 (36%) respondents could identify particular pieces of legislation that they saw as having the potential to ‘dampen the manager’s enthusiasm for innovating’. This compared to 312 (64%) who said no to this question. ♦ 118 (26%) respondents could identify particular pieces of legislation that they saw as having the potential to ‘impact on the value or speed with which your industry can grow export earnings’. This compared to 363 (74%) who said no to this question. ♦ 189 (38%) respondents could identify particular pieces of legislation that they saw as having the potential to ‘oblige the firm to engage outside consultants’. This compared to 301(62%) who said no to this question. ♦ 162 (33%) respondents could identify particular pieces of legislation that they saw as having the potential to ‘leave a sense of unfairness with your firm’. This compared to 328 (67%) who said no to this question. 8 Section 1: Introduction During recent decades there has been an increasing focus on the importance of firm growth and innovation in many countries. Owners and managers of enterprises (particularly those that are categorised as small or medium in size) are encouraged to pursue innovative products, processes and solutions in order to maximise their potential, and improve their performance. In New Zealand this is evidenced by a number of government initiatives, including the Innovation Framework and the various reports from the Science and Innovation Advisory Committee. Policy statements such as these have provided the underpinning for programmes that encourage firms to become more effective, and business people to become more enterprising. In parallel with the focus on ‘capability building’ and developing a ‘culture of enterprise’ (as exemplified by programmes such as BIZ and the Enterprise Culture and Skills Activities Fund respectively), recent governments have emphasised the need to decrease the barriers that prevent innovation and enterprising behaviour from occurring. One area of particular focus is the cost of complying with the various regulations and the pieces of legislation that exist to guide the operation of business. As part of the government’s commitment to the goal of decreasing the cost of compliance, a Ministerial Panel on Business Compliance Costs was established. This panel consulted widely with business, seeking the views of individual business people and industry groups 5 . In its final report 6 162 recommendations were made. In the government’s response to the report 7 it was noted more than 80% of the recommendations had already been implemented or were agreed with totally, in part or in principle. The key message from this response is that while the government is aware of the need for laws and regulations that guide the actions of firms, it has recognised that there is a burden for them. This concern with the implications for individual firms that is evident in New Zealand is in contrast to much of the international discourse on the impact of compliance costs, which has focused at a macro or industry level, rather than attempting to understand the issues at a firm level. Another characteristic of these international studies is that certain facets of compliance (such as specific legislative areas) have drawn more attention than others have. For example, a large number of studies address the environment in general terms or assess specific approaches to environmental management such as resource management legislation. Another area that has been dealt with extensively is taxation. To an extent, the same situation exists in New Zealand, where specific pieces of legislation have attracted considerably more attention than others. As well as taxation, significant work has been carried out on the costs and benefits for business of compliance with the Health and Safety in Employment Act 8 . 5 Massey, C., & Quin, P. (2001).

Wellington, NZ: Labour Market Policy Group. 9 In addition to the reports from the compliance cost panel (as described in the next section), this broader work has provided the context for the study presented here. P ROJECT OBJECTIVES The Ministerial Panel on Business Compliance Costs was established in December 2000 to provide advice to the government on ways to reduce unnecessary or over-burdensome compliance costs to business arising from central and local government regulation. This process identified a number of concerns that are held by New Zealand firms, and the various reports that were produced as a result of the Panel’s work provided the platform for further work by the Regulatory and Competition Policy Branch of the Ministry of Economic Development (MED). One of the priorities of this work programme was to undertake a pilot study into the way in which the managers of New Zealand firms perceive regulations and legislation as having an impact on their performance and on their ability to be innovative. The purpose of the project was to provide MED with a snapshot of the way in which New Zealand firms are dealing with compliance, while also providing it with a way of measuring changes over time. In keeping with this dual focus, two main objectives were planned: Objective 1: Undertake research into the perceptions of NZ managers on the consequences of compliance In terms of this objective the researchers were asked to provide MED with a report which: 1.1Identifies and describes the perceptions held by the managers of New Zealand firms in respect of their compliance commitments (with a particular focus on the way this commitment affects the firm’s performance and its ability to innovate). 1.2Provides information on the impact of the compliance commitment (and its associated costs) on the firm’s performance and its ability to innovate (relative to other factors). 1.3Provides information on the types of strategies that firms put in place to manage their compliance commitment and ameliorate any associated costs 9 . Objective 2: Develop an appropriate methodology for assessing compliance perceptions In terms of this objective the researchers were asked to develop a methodology that will make it possible for MED to measure the three items listed above, and which has been tested within the context of this project. This methodology will enable MED to: 2.1Identify changes over time in the perceptions held by the managers of New Zealand firms in respect of their compliance commitment. 2.2Understand how the compliance commitment affects the firm’s performance and its ability to innovate (relative to other factors). 2.3Build up a picture of the strategies that firms put in place to manage their compliance commitment and ameliorate any associated costs. 2.4Assess whether the actions taken by government agencies are having the desired effect. 9 After some discussion between the researchers and MED about the difficulty of collecting valid data on this topic, it was decided not to attempt to address this topic in the project. 10 P ROJECT METHOD Given the intention to repeat the study, the researchers were asked to develop a methodology that was cost effective and which would focus on MED’s primary interest (in the perceptions of business people about their compliance commitments). The approach included a review of the literature, a set of focus groups (these were not part of the initial proposal but were added in response to the particular information needs of the Treasury) and a telephone survey of 490 firms (more detailed information on the method is contained in Appendix A). It is envisaged that the telephone survey component would be the component of the study that would be repeated. Literature review To provide a context for the study (and as one of the project’s specified outputs), the researchers undertook a comprehensive study of the international literature on business compliance. While much of this literature addresses compliance solely in relation to taxation (and focuses on providing detailed calculations of the actual costs involved in complying with this particular legislation), there have been several important contributions that have been useful in this study: 1. The first area is in defining the different types of ‘compliance cost’. This has been comprehensively covered, and the existing literature provides researchers with a terminology for dealing with a complex area, and addresses fundamental issues such as how to define compliance, how to research it and how to identify ‘best practice’ in terms of developing legislation with low compliance costs. 2. There are a number of studies (such as the OECD study) that estimate direct compliance costs. 3. A number of studies canvassed the general impressions of business people about compliance. The reports from the New Zealand Ministerial panel on Business Compliance Costs are an example of this type of work, which is important because it records the general concerns of business people and their particular concerns with specific pieces of legislation. 4. The last type of studies are those that focus on the indirect ‘cost’ of compliance, and particularly the way in which compliance has the potential to divert and distract the attention of senior management, thus making them less likely to consider growth strategies such as exporting. A summary of the completed literature review is included in Appendix D of this report. Focus group interviews Four focus groups were conducted to gather views from business people in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) on the factors that they perceive as constraining their ability to export. There was also an attempt to gain an understanding of the relative burden of New Zealand based considerations and compliance issues. This contributed to addressing objectives 1 and 2, and was used to help construct the questions on firm dynamics that are written up in section 6 of this report. This component of the study was reported upon separately 10 . Telephone survey In consultation with the MED and a number of other government agencies, a survey was designed and administered to 490 respondents. The sampling frame ensured that the focus 10 NRB. (November, 2002). Constraints & hurdles to SME exporting. Auckland, New Zealand: NRB. 11 was on SMEs (for the purpose of this survey, the focus was on small and micro enterprises). A number of other dimensions (firm stage, export involvement, industry sector and the firm’s growth intentions) were also used to enable the researchers to gain a better understanding of the relationship between these factors and the respondents’ views of compliance in New Zealand. The purpose of the survey was to gather perceptions from the managers of New Zealand firms in relation to: 1. The factors that restrict export growth (Section A of the questionnaire). 2. The factors that have the potential to ‘divert and distract’ the firm’s managers away from focusing on improving productivity and/or growth (Section B of the questionnaire). 3. The costs of compliance (for the firm as well as for the industry) compared to the benefits (Section C of the questionnaire). 4. The time and effort that respondents put into compliance (Section D of the questionnaire). 5. The extent the firms’ compliance commitments have impacted on a range of internal firm dynamics (Section D of the questionnaire). P ROJECT TEAM The project team consisted of researchers from the New Zealand Centre for SME Research at Massey University and the National Research Bureau Ltd. The team consulted with staff from the Ministry of Economic Development, Treasury, the Department of Labour and the Inland Revenue Department. R EPORT STRUCTURE This report presents the results of the project in 8 sections. Section 2 presents the demographics of those surveyed; Section 3 summarises the results from Section A of the questionnaire; Section 4 summarises the results from Section B of the questionnaire; Section 5 summarises the results from Section C of the questionnaire; and Section 6 summarises the results from Section D of the questionnaire. The results are discussed in Section 7, and Section 8 contains the report’s conclusions. As already noted, the results of the focus groups have been reported upon separately. 12 Section 2: Survey Demographics As already noted in the introduction, the researchers were interested in examining the way in which different groups of firms respond differently to their compliance obligations. For the purpose of this study a number of ways of exploring the difference between firms were identified: firm size; export involvement; firm stage; growth intentions and industry type. These five ‘dimensions’ (and their respective sub-categories as explained below) were used throughout the study to collect and organise the data. The following section presents the demographic data from the total sample (490 firms). F IRM S IZE There is evidence to suggest that firms that are of different sizes will exhibit differences in the way they perceive their compliance commitments. In particular, it is clear that non-employing firms have a different experience of compliance to those encountered by firms that employ. In order to examine the impact of size on the perceptions of compliance, firms in this study were grouped in terms of four size categories. These categories focused on those firms that might be described as micro, to reflect the characteristics of the New Zealand business population, in which over 85% of all firms employ fewer than 5 FTEs 11 . Figure 1: Sample by size Number of Respondents Percentage Non-employing4910.0% Employing 2-5 FTEs15531.6% Employing 6-10 FTEs14028.6% Employing more than 11 FTEs14629.8% TOTAL490100% E XPORT INVOLVEMENT Given the interest in this study on the way in which compliance may have an impact on a firm’s ability to engage in growth-related strategies (such as exporting), the researchers categorised the respondents in relation to exporting. Figure 2: Sample by export involvement Number of Respondents Percentage You currently export a physical product that is made in NZ from NZ raw materials or a plant or animal product. 21042.9% You earn foreign exchange from overseas clients by selling a skill or service undertaken largely in NZ - for example consulting, tourism, and software. 9118.6% Neither of these.18437.6% Both of these.51.0% TOTAL490100% 11 Industry & Regional Development Branch, Ministry of Economic Development. (2002) SMEs in New Zealand: Structure and dynamics. Wellington, New Zealand: MED. 13 All respondents were asked to describe their firm’s involvement in export over the last 24 months in terms of whether they are currently exporting or not. Respondents who answered that they were not currently exporting were then asked whether they considered their product or service ‘to be inherently capable of export, or being provided to overseas customers, from New Zealand’. This question elicited the responses below: Figure 3: Export capability &/or intentions (for non-exporters) Number of Respondents Percentage Yes (inherently capable of being exported)7741.9% Maybe52.7% No10255.4% TOTAL184100% F IRM STAGE When considering the possible implications of compliance, it is intuitively attractive to assume that mature firms will find compliance less onerous than those that are new. For this reason the researchers were interested in examining compliance perceptions in relation to firm stage. Given the difficulty of defining firm ‘maturity’ in a way that is appropriate to firms of all sizes and in all industries, the respondents in this study were asked to define their own stage of growth, i.e. if they saw their firm as ‘recently established and still finding a market’, ‘mature and stable’ or ‘somewhere between these two’. Figure 4: Sample by firm stage Number of Respondents Percentage Recently established and still finding its market6112.5% Mature and stable27856.7% Somewhere between those two15130.8% TOTAL490100% G ROWTH INTENTIONS The focus of this study was on the way in which manager’s perceptions of compliance impact on growth. Given the difficulty of defining growth in a way that is appropriate to firms of all sizes and in all industries, respondents were again asked to provide their own view on their growth intentions: They were asked if they saw their firm as ‘contracting to a smaller size or volume of business’, ‘consolidating at about its current size or turnover’ or ‘growing significantly through current or new products, services or clients’. Figure 5: Sample by growth intention Number of Respondents Percentage Contract to a smaller size or volume of business.255.1% Consolidate at about its current size or turnover19038.8% Grow significantly through current or new products, services or clients 27255.5% Not known30.6% TOTAL490100% I NDUSTRY TYPE There is considerable agreement that compliance is not experienced in the same way by all industry sectors. Nor are the direct or indirect costs or consequences of compliance equally borne by all. To ensure that these differences were reflected in the study, a decision was 14 made to identify a number of sectors of potential interest because of anecdotal evidence of their compliance problems. For this survey six sectors were chosen 12 . Figure 6: Sample by industry group Number of Respondents Percentage Primary sector7314.9% Food industry6613.5% Non-food industry5110.4% Tourism and allied services9319.0% Software and business services5310.8% Wholesale/retail with export/manufacturing15431.4% TOTAL490100% S UMMARY Firms and their managers are not all the same, and the 490 respondents in this study were deliberately selected to demonstrate the heterogeneity of the New Zealand business population. As a result the sample offers a unique glimpse into the way in which firms that are different in terms of firm size, export involvement, firm stage, growth intentions and industry type, differ in the way they regard the impact of compliance. This notion is explored in the following sections of this report. 12 These sectors were chosen by MED. If the survey is repeated other industry sectors could be substituted, and although the responses would not be directly comparable to the initial study, it would allow a picture of compliance across sectors to be built up. 15 Section 3: Constraints on Exporting As noted in the introduction, one of the main concerns of this study was to gain an understanding of the consequences of compliance that are less easy to identify that those that can be measured in terms of time and cost. This was consistent with the OECD study 13 , which noted that compliance is often discussed solely in terms of its direct ‘costs’ (which refers to the actual costs incurred by individuals in meeting the requirements laid upon them in complying with a given regulatory structure). 14 The OECD report goes on to make the point that gaining a clearer understanding of the indirect costs (which arise for example when regulations reduce a firm’s level of productivity and innovativeness) is important if the full impact of compliance is to be assessed. The full impact of compliance was the focus here, as was the way in which complying with regulations has the potential to divert the attention of managers, and to act as one of the factors that may prevent the firm from engaging in a variety of growth-oriented activities (such as exporting). This section presents the results from Section A of the questionnaire (see Appendix B for the questionnaire text). Here we were concerned with identifying constraints to exporting. First we asked the relevant respondents (the 388 who are either exporting currently or who consider their products or service as being inherently capable of being exported) to identify “any one need or constraint (whether New Zealand based or based in the overseas market) that is uppermost in your mind in holding back or limiting growth in your exporting”? This question deliberately avoided mentioning the term compliance, in order to minimise the degree to which respondents were ‘primed’ into framing their answers in ways that fitted the study’s focus. The question elicited a large number of detailed comments: A number of respondents were concerned with the practicality of representing the firm overseas, while other respondents were more concerned with the regulations imposed by overseas governments or the trading conditions in these countries. Some talked about growth and a number commented on New Zealand based regulations. Others had particular concerns about the impact of compliance on smaller firms or identified issues that were industry-specific, or which related to particular pieces of legislation. The primary purpose of this question was to stimulate the respondents’ thinking, before exposing them to the list of statements that was read to them in the next question. For this reason there is no analysis of these comments presented in this report. F ACTORS THAT CONSTRAIN EXPORT GROWTH Following the preliminary open-ended question, respondents were asked to comment on a number of factors and to consider whether these factors were restricting or slowing their export growth (or their ability to earn foreign exchange if this was more appropriate) 15 . Figure 7 presents the responses from the sub sample of 388, showing that the factors that were most commonly selected (where respondents answered ‘yes’ and ‘yes significantly’) were: G 13 OECD.

Administrative and compliance costs of taxation. Bath: Fiscal. 15 This list of factors was derived from those identified in the international literature as well as those that were derived from earlier New Zealand studies and the focus groups. 16 (conditions and regulations placed by overseas governments), A (the cost and time needed to represent the firm overseas), M (the effort and distraction of complying with regulations in NZ), N (the executive time and the expense of collecting information and researching a possible new overseas prospect) and L (getting identity and exposure for the firm or brand overseas). Conversely, factors B (getting/maintaining patent protection), K (hassles at NZ borders), Q (getting a loan for working capital against an overseas order), E (level of technical skill among NZ workers) and C (NZ health and safety requirements) were indicated the least frequently (i.e. respondents answered ‘no’ to the question of whether the factors restricted or hindered export growth). Figure 7: Factors that restrict export growth R ESPONSES BY SURVEY SUB - SAMPLES While the identification of the ‘conditions and regulations placed by overseas governments’ as the factor that is regarded by most respondents as restricting growth is heartening given the New Zealand government’s recent efforts to reduce the burden of compliance facing firms as a result of its own policies and regulations, it is necessary to take a more detailed look at the data to understand the issues that are being signalled by the respondents. This shows that the different groups had distinctly different views on the relative importance (or lack of importance) of the various factors. The following section analyses the data in terms of the five groups, and using two techniques: 1) by ranking the issues in order, and 2) by indexing (explained later in the report). Firm size The issues of most concern to firms of different size groups are ranked and displayed in Figure 8 16 . 16 The ranking was done after totalling the percentage of the respondents who answered ‘yes’ and ‘yes significantly’. Where the totals came to 50% or more the factor was ranked. 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100% Conditions/regs of overseas govts Cost/time to represent o'seas Efforts/distraction complying with NZ regs Time/expense re new overseas propsect Getting identity/exposure overseas Cost/time getting product to where mkt is Distance to mkt NZ mkt too small - no export leverage Language/culture in o'seas mkts Ease/difficulty of firing people After sales support in destination mkts Security of overseas paymants NZ health & safety requirements Technical skill among NZ workers Loan for working capital re o'seas order Hassles at NZ borders Getting/maintaining patent protection NoYes someYes signif 17 Figure 8: Ranking of factors that restrict export growth (by firm size) Non- employing 2 to 56 to 1011+ ACost/time needed to represent yourself overseas12=22 G Conditions/regulations placed by overseas governments2=11 INZ domestic market too small - no leverage to exports4= JDistance to market34= LGetting identity/exposure for firm overseas52=6 M Effort/distraction of complying with regulations in NZ2=147 N Time/expense re possible new overseas prospect453 PCosts/time taken up getting product to where market is74= Further analysis of the responses was undertaken using the process of ‘indexing’. This technique is useful in demonstrating the ‘order of difference’ between groups that are of different sizes. A diagrammatic representation of this technique and an explanation of how the technique was carried out in relation to this question in contained in Appendix C. Indexing the responses showed that respondents whose firms do not employ and respondents from firms that employ more than 11 FTEs were over-represented amongst the 22.9% of respondents answering “yes, significantly” in relation to ‘conditions and regulations imposed by overseas governments’, while firms employing between 2-5 FTEs were under- represented amongst those giving this answer. Respondents whose firms do not employ and respondents from firms that employ more than 11 FTEs were over-represented amongst the 25.3% of respondents answering “yes, significantly” in relation to ‘cost and time needed to represent the firm overseas’, while firms employing between 6-10 FTEs were under- represented amongst those giving this answer. Respondents whose firms that employ 2-10 FTEs were over-represented amongst the 21.9% of respondents answering “yes, significantly” in relation to the ‘effort and distraction of complying with regulations in NZ’, while firms employing more than 11 FTEs and those that do not employ were under- represented amongst those giving this answer. Export involvement The issues of most concern to firms that export (cf. those that are not currently exporting but which anticipate doing so) are ranked and displayed in Figure 9.

Respondents whose firms are not exporting were over-represented amongst the 25.3% of respondents answering “yes, significantly” in relation to ‘cost and time needed to represent the firm overseas’. 18 Respondents whose firms are exporting were over-represented amongst the 21.9% of respondents answering “yes, significantly” in relation to the ‘effort and distraction of complying with regulations in NZ’.

Respondents whose firms are ‘new’ were over-represented amongst the 25.3% of respondents answering “yes, significantly” in relation to ‘cost and time needed to represent the firm overseas’, while firms that are neither mature nor new and those that were mature are slightly under- represented amongst those giving this answer. Respondents whose firms are ‘mature’ and ‘new’ were over-represented amongst the 21.9% of respondents answering “yes, significantly” in relation to the ‘effort and distraction of complying with regulations in NZ’, while firms that are neither ‘mature’ nor ‘new’ were under-represented amongst those giving this answer. Growth intentions The issues of most concern to those with different growth intentions are ranked and displayed in Figure 11.

Respondents whose firms that intend to grow strongly were over-represented amongst the 25.3% of respondents answering “yes, significantly” in relation to ‘cost and time needed to represent the firm overseas’, while firms that are contracting or consolidating were under- represented amongst those giving this answer. Respondents whose firms that intend to contract or consolidate were over-represented amongst the 21.9% of respondents answering “yes, significantly” in relation to the ‘effort and distraction of complying with regulations in NZ’, while firms that are growing were under-represented amongst those giving this answer. Industry type The issues of most concern to those involved in different industries are ranked and displayed in Figure 12.

By contrast, respondents from the primary sector are concerned with a number of issues. Indexing the data showed that respondents whose firms are from the food and primary industry sectors were over-represented amongst the 22.9% of respondents answering “yes, significantly” in relation to ‘conditions and regulations imposed by overseas governments’, 20 while firms from the software and business service industry, the tourism industry and the non-food sector were under-represented amongst those giving this answer. Respondents whose firms are from the software and primary industry sectors were over-represented amongst the 25.3% of respondents answering “yes, significantly” in relation to ‘cost and time needed to represent the firm overseas’, while firms from the tourism and non-food sector were under-represented amongst those giving this answer. Respondents whose firms are from the food, tourism and primary sectors were over-represented amongst the 21.9% of respondents answering “yes, significantly” in relation to the ‘effort and distraction of complying with regulations in NZ’, while firms from the software and business service industry and the wholesale, retail and manufacturing sectors were under-represented amongst those giving this answer. S UMMARY When asked to comment on a number of factors, and to consider whether these factors were restricting or slowing their export growth (or their ability to earn foreign exchange if this was more appropriate), the 388 respondents (those who were already exporting or felt they had the potential to do so), most commonly identified: ♦ The conditions and regulations placed by overseas governments (over 60% said this was a factor that restricted their export growth, or had the potential to do so, compared to 37% who said that this factor was not a concern). ♦ The cost and time needed to represent the firm overseas (over 60% said this was a factor that restricted their export growth, or had the potential to do so, compared to 37% who said that this factor was not a concern). ♦ The effort and distraction of complying with regulations in NZ (over 54% said this was a factor that restricted their export growth, or had the potential to do so, compared to 45% who said that this factor was not a concern). ♦ The executive time and the expense of collecting information and researching a possible new overseas prospect (54% said this was a factor that restricted their export growth, or had the potential to do so, compared to 45% who said that this factor was not a concern). ♦ Getting identity and exposure for the firm or brand overseas (51% said this was a factor that restricted their export growth, or had the potential to do so, compared to 48% who said that this factor was not a concern). However, the factors were not raised to the same degree by the five different groups that were surveyed. The key differences between the groups in relation to the top three factors shows that: ♦ Respondents that answered “yes, significantly” in relation to the ‘conditions and regulations placed by overseas governments’ were most likely to be from firms that: employ more than 11 FTEs, export, are neither ‘mature’ nor ‘new’, intend to grow strongly and come from the food and primary industry sectors. ♦ Respondents that answered “yes, significantly” in relation to the ‘cost and time needed to represent the firm overseas’ were most likely to be from firms that: do not employ and that employ more than 11 FTEs, do not export, are new, intend to grow strongly and are from the software and primary industry sectors. ♦ Respondents that answered “yes, significantly” in relation to the ‘effort and distraction of complying with regulations in NZ’ were most likely to be from firms that: employ 2-10 FTEs, export, are ‘mature’ and ‘new’, intend to contract or consolidate, and are from the food, tourism and primary sectors. 21 Viewing the entire set of factors from the perspective of the groups themselves, there were also visible differences: ♦ In terms of firm size, all groups identified the ‘cost and time needed to represent the firm overseas’ and the ‘conditions and regulations placed by overseas governments’ as factors that restrict growth. Firms with fewer staff were more likely to identify the ‘effort and distraction of complying with regulations in NZ’ as a factor. ♦ In terms of export involvement, both groups (i.e. those that are currently exporting as well as those that are not), identified the ‘cost and time needed to represent the firm overseas’ and the ‘conditions and regulations placed by overseas governments’. ♦ In terms of firm stage, all three groups identified the ‘cost and time needed to represent the firm overseas’ as a factor. However, recently established firms noted ‘getting identity/exposure for firm overseas’ and ‘time/expense re possible new overseas prospect’ as factors. ♦ In terms of growth intentions, all three groups identified the ‘conditions and regulations placed by overseas governments’. Respondents from firms that are contracting identified ‘NZ's requirements for health/safety at workplaces’ the ‘effort and distraction of complying with regulations in NZ’ as factors. ♦ In terms of industry type, almost all groups identified the ‘conditions and regulations placed by overseas governments’ and the ‘cost and time needed to represent the firm overseas’. However, the other answers demonstrate the varied nature of the New Zealand business population, and the variance in the impact of compliance on different industry sectors. 22 Section 4: Constraints on Productivity & Growth In Section B of the questionnaire we asked firms specifically about the way in which they deal with a series of factors (which were read to them) 17 , in order to assess what factors are seen as having the most potential to ‘divert and distract’ the firm’s managers from improving productivity or concentrating on growth. Respondents were told “the next set of questions is about productivity and growth of businesses in New Zealand. That includes the products and services you have already as well as any initiatives you might take. I’ll read out a number of aspects of the business environment in New Zealand and ask you to answer by saying A or B. ‘A’ means your firm can readily deal with it and largely put it out of mind. ‘B’ means that it continues to divert and distract your business. Say not applicable if that is what fits best”. Figure 13: Dealing with the business environment Figure 13 presents the responses from the total sample (490 responses), showing that the factors that were most commonly selected as being ‘distracting’ were: B (the regulations that apply to releasing a person who no longer suits the business – referred to in Figure 13 as ‘firing’), J (the ACC insurance arrangements as they relate to the firm), I (the arrangements that are needed for health and safety of employees – referred to in Figure 13 as ‘health and safety’) and L (providing a range of employment and other data on the firm to government agencies – referred to in Figure 13 as ‘govt stats’). Conversely, factors F (running the firm’s part of the GST system), G (running the firm’s part of the PAYE system) and E (the guidelines for firms trading fairly in relation to each others’ 17 This list of factors was developed by the researchers in consultation with the interested government agencies (as listed in the introduction). It was designed to guide respondents into focusing on the events and occurrences within the business that have a related need for compliance (e.g. employing staff for the first time) rather than naming the legislation itself (which can provoke responses that are not fully considered). The exception to this was the use of the terms GST and PAYE, which were named for reasons of clarity, and ACC which was named only after the questionnaire pre-test showed that without the insertion of the term ACC, respondents were not able to understand the question. 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100% Labelling standards Plant/animal standards Land etc Consents Firing Clean air etc Govt Stats ACC Hiring Health & Safety NZ Tax Fair trading PAYE GST Deals ReadilyDivertsN/A 23 products and services, and in relation to customers), were seen as least ‘distracting’. Also identified by significant numbers of respondents were factors H (understanding and delivering your part of the NZ tax system), I (the arrangements you need to have for health and safety of employees), J (the ACC insurance arrangements as it relates to your firm), A (the regulations that you need to take into account when you are hiring a new person), and L (providing a range of employment and other data on your firm to government agencies) and C (the arrangements expected of you in regard to clean air, water and environment protection). Clearly the identification of these factors as not being distracting by some respondents contradicts the summary in the previous paragraph (where they were identified as being distracting). However, these contradictions are inherent in a study of this kind; issues that are ‘distractions’ to some are ‘easily dealt with’ by others. In an overall sense it is worth noting the high number of factors where the respondents answered that they readily deal with the issue (and by a large margin). However, given the focus of this research (on identifying aspects of policy where improvements can be made) the emphasis in the analysis is on the distracting nature of some regulations. A significant number of respondents stated that some of the factors referred to in this question were not applicable, and recalculating the percentages had an effect on the ranking of the factors. However, it should be noted that this new representation may not be any more accurate than the first: While it was clear that some respondents were correct when identifying a factor as not applicable (for example, to a non-employing firm the arrangements needed to release someone from employment are not applicable), it is less clear why some gave the answers they did (e.g. reasonable numbers noted the New Zealand tax system as not applicable). This is an illustration of an issue that has already been noted: the difficulty of gaining an accurate picture of the compliance burden (or benefit) when there is likely to be quite high levels of ignorance about some legislation. Having said this, the analysis below focuses on the reweighted totals (totals that exclude the ‘don’t know’ and ‘not applicable’ answers). R ESPONSES BY SURVEY SUB - SAMPLES As with the previous section, it is necessary to take a more detailed look at the data to understand the issues that are being signalled by the respondents. This shows that the groups had distinctly different views on the relative diversionary potential of the various factors. In the following sections the factors that were most commonly nominated are examined in detail. The data is also analysed in terms of the five groups, and using two techniques: 1) by ranking the issues in order, and 2) by indexing (explained in Appendix C). Firm size The issues of most concern to firms of different size groups are ranked and displayed in Figure 14. 18 Indexing the data showed that respondents whose firms employ 6-10 FTEs, and those employing more than 11 FTEs, are over-represented amongst the 45.7% of respondents who answered that ‘releasing an employee’ diverts and distracts them, while non-employing firms and those employing 2-5 FTEs were under-represented amongst those giving this answer. Respondents whose firms employ 6-10 FTEs, and those that do not employ, are over- represented amongst the 20.0% of respondents who answered that ‘labelling controls and standards’ diverts and distracts them, while firms employing more than 11 FTEs were under- represented amongst those giving this answer. Respondents whose firms employ more than 11 FTEs and those that employ 6-10 FTEs are over-represented amongst the 25.9% of 18 Again this ranking was done on the percentage of the respondents. In this section the top three factors were included in the ranking. 24 respondents who answered that ‘getting consent to use land, water and air’ diverts and distracts them, while those employing 2-5 FTEs and non-employing firms were under- represented amongst those giving this answer. Respondents whose firms do not employ are under-represented amongst the 37.1% of respondents who answered that ‘making ACC arrangements’ diverts and distracts them.

Firm stage The issues of most concern to firms of different stages are ranked and displayed in Figure 16. Indexing the data showed that respondents whose firms are ‘mature’ are over-represented amongst the 45.7% of respondents who answered that ‘releasing an employee’ diverts and distracts them, while firms that are ‘new’ and firms that are neither ‘mature’ nor ‘new’ were under-represented amongst those giving this answer. Respondents whose firms are neither ‘mature’ nor ‘new’ and those that are ‘new’ are over-represented amongst the 20.0% of respondents who answered that this ‘labelling controls and standards’ diverts and distracts them, while firms that are ‘mature’ were under-represented amongst those giving this 25 answer. Respondents whose firms are neither ‘mature’ nor ‘new’ are over-represented amongst the 25.9% of respondents who answered that ‘getting consent to use land, water and air’ diverts and distracts them, while firms that are ‘mature’ and firms that are ‘new’ were under-represented amongst those giving this answer.

S UMMARY In relation to factors that divert and distract the firm away from focusing on productivity and growth, it is noticeable that on almost all of the factors the majority response was that the firm readily deals with the issues involved. However, given the focus of this study (on providing MED and other agencies with information that they can use to reduce the compliance burden for New Zealand firms), the researchers identified all those factors where more than 30% of respondents identified the factor as an issue – irrespective of the proportion of those who indicated that they were ‘dealing with it’. On this basis the issues of most concern to the 490 respondents were: ♦ The regulations that apply to releasing a person who no longer suits the business (46% said this was a factor that diverts or distracts them, compared to 39% who said that this factor was not a concern). ♦ The ACC insurance arrangements as they relate to the firm business (37% said this was a factor that diverts or distracts them, compared to 58% who said that this factor was not a concern). 27 ♦ The arrangements that are needed for health and safety of employees business (32% said this was a factor that diverts or distracts them, compared to 59% who said that this factor was not a concern). ♦ Providing a range of employment and other data on the firm to government agencies (30% said this was a factor that diverts or distracts them, compared to 57% who said that this factor was not a concern). However, the factors were not raised to the same degree by the five different groups that were surveyed. The key differences between the groups in relation to the top three factors shows that: ♦ Respondents who identified ‘releasing an employee’ as a factor that diverts and distracts them were most likely to be from firms that: employ 6-10 FTEs and more than 11 FTEs, export, are ‘mature’, intend to contract, and are from the primary, non-food, wholesale, retail and manufacturing sectors and the food industry. ♦ Respondents who identified ‘labelling controls and standards’ as a factor that diverts and distracts them were most likely to be from firms that: employ 6-10 FTEs and those that do not employ, are not currently exporting (but anticipate doing so) and those that are exporting, are neither ‘mature’ nor ‘new’, intend to grow and are from the food, and wholesale, retail and manufacturing sectors. ♦ Respondents who identified ‘getting consent to use land, water and air’ as a factor that diverts and distracts them were most likely to be from firms that: employ more than 11 FTEs and those that employ 6-10 FTEs, export, are neither ‘mature’ nor ‘new, intend to contract and are from the food and primary sectors. Viewed from the perspective of the groups themselves, there were also some differences, although the responses to this question provided the least differences between the groups. ♦ In terms of firm size, all groups identified ‘arrangements expected when need to fire someone’ and ‘ACC levy arrangements as they relate to your firm’ as factors that divert and distract them. Respondents from larger firms were more likely to identify ‘arrangements for health and safety of employees’ as a factor that diverts and distracts them. ♦ In terms of export involvement, all groups identified ‘arrangements expected when it is necessary to fire someone’ and ‘ACC levy arrangements as they relate to your firm’ as factors that divert and distract them. ♦ In terms of firm stage, all groups identified ‘arrangements expected when it is necessary to fire someone’ and ‘ACC levy arrangements as they relate to your firm’ as factors that divert and distract them. ♦ In terms of growth intentions, all groups identified ‘arrangements expected when it is necessary to fire someone’ and ‘ACC levy arrangements as they relate to your firm’ as factors that divert and distract them. ♦ In terms of industry type, almost all groups identified ‘arrangements expected when it is necessary to fire someone’, ‘ACC levy arrangements as they relate to your firm’ and ‘arrangements for health and safety of employees’ as factors that divert and distract them. 28 Section 5: Costs versus Benefits In the third section of the survey the respondents’ perceptions of the factors that were used in the previous section were also the basis for the questions on the costs versus the benefits of compliance. Respondents were told “may I run through those aspects of the business environment quickly again. This time would you answer from the viewpoint of whether you feel that in the bigger picture your firm or industry is getting more or less benefit from it, than the effort you ’re putting in. Say A if you feel the benefits you get are greater than the effort and cost. Say B if you feel the time effort and cost just about balance out the benefits you get. Say C if you feel the time effort and costs outweigh the benefits you get”. Figure 19: Costs versus benefits Figure 19 shows that in relation to most factors, the respondents indicated that the time, effort and cost they put in just about balances out the benefits that they receive. The exceptions were factor B (the regulations that apply to releasing a person who no longer suits the business – referred to in Figure 19 as ‘firing’) and J (the ACC insurance arrangements as they relate to the firm). This figure also shows that in terms of a number of factors some respondents felt that the benefits they receive are greater than the effort and cost. However, there was no single factor where this opinion was held by the majority of respondents. It should also be noted that there were high numbers of ‘don’t know’ responses to this question (see for example, the responses to ‘getting consents to use land, water or air’), despite the fact that there was also a ‘not applicable’ option. This raised questions about the extent to which respondents understood their responsibilities in relation to some legislation. As Figure 19 shows, factors that were seen as providing more benefits than effort and costs were factors E (the guidelines for firms trading fairly in relation to each others products and services, and in relation to customers – referred to in Figure 19 as ‘fair trading’), A (the regulations that need to be taken into account when a new person is being hired – referred to in Figure 19 as ‘hiring’), I (the arrangements the firm needs to have for health and safety of employees – referred to in Figure 19 as ‘health and safety’). 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100% Labelling standards Firing Govt Stats ACC Plant/animal standards Land etc Consents NZ Tax PAYE Clean air etc GST Health & Safety Hiring Fair trading Benefit GreaterBalancedTime/Effort outweighDK/RefusedN/A 29 The factors that were seen as taking more time and effort than the benefit provided were factors B (the regulations that apply to the process of releasing a person who no longer suits the business – referred to in Figure 19 as ‘firing’), J (the ACC insurance arrangements as it relates to the firm), L (providing a range of employment and other data on the firm to government agencies – referred to in Figure 19 as ‘govt stats’). R ESPONSES BY SURVEY SUB - SAMPLES As with the previous section, it is necessary to take a more detailed look at the data to understand the issues that are being signalled by the respondents. This shows that the groups had distinctly different views on the relative diversionary potential of the various factors. In the following sections the factors that were most commonly nominated are examined in detail. The data is also analysed in terms of the five groups, and using two techniques: 1) by ranking the issues in order, and 2) by indexing (explained later in the report). Firm size The issues of most concern to firms of different size groups are ranked and displayed in Figure 20. 19 Figure 20: Ranking of factors that are perceived to have higher costs than benefits (firm size) Non- employing 2 to 56 to 1011+ BArrangements expected when need to fire someone3=311 H Understanding/delivering your part of the NZ tax system3= JACC levy arrangements as they relate to your firm1123 LProviding statistics on your firm to government agencies2232 Indexing the data showed that respondents whose firms employ 6-10 FTEs (and those that employ more than 11 FTEs) are over-represented amongst the 43.3% of respondents who answered that the time, effort and cost of the arrangements for releasing an employee outweighs the benefits, while firms that do not employ and those employing 2-5 FTEs were under-represented amongst those giving this answer. Respondents whose firms employ 2-5 FTEs are slightly over-represented amongst the 39.0% of respondents who described the time, effort and cost of the ACC insurance arrangements as they relate to the firm as outweighing the benefits, while firms that do not employ were under-represented amongst those giving this answer. Respondents whose firms employ more than 11 FTEs are over- represented amongst the 37.1% of respondents who answered that the time, effort and cost of providing a range of employment and other data on the firm to government agencies outweighs the benefits, while firms that do not employ were under-represented amongst those giving this answer. Export involvement The issues of most concern to those that export (cf. those that are not currently exporting but which anticipate doing so) are ranked and displayed in Figure 21. Indexing the data showed that respondents whose firms are not currently exporting are over- represented amongst the 43.3% of respondents who answered that the time, effort and cost 19 Again this ranking was done on the percentage of the respondents. In this section the top three factors were included in the ranking. 30 of the arrangements for releasing an employee outweighs the benefits, while firms that are not exporting (and do not intend to) were under-represented amongst those giving this answer. Respondents whose firms are not currently exporting are marginally over- represented amongst the 39.0% of respondents who described the time, effort and cost of the ACC insurance arrangements as they relate to the firm as outweighing the benefits. Respondents whose firms are not currently exporting are over-represented amongst the 37.1% of respondents who answered that the time, effort and cost of providing a range of employment and other data on the firm to government agencies outweighs the benefits, while firms that are not currently exporting and those that are not planning to export were under- represented amongst those giving this answer.

Respondents whose firms can be described as ‘mature’ are over- represented amongst the 39.0% of respondents who described the time, effort and cost of the ACC insurance arrangements as they relate to the firm as outweighing the benefits, while firms that are ‘new’ and those that are neither ‘mature’ nor ‘new’ were under-represented amongst those giving this answer. Respondents whose firms can be described as ‘mature’ are over-represented amongst the 37.1% of respondents who answered that the time, effort and cost of providing a range of employment and other data on the firm to government agencies outweighs the benefits, while firms that are ‘new’ and those that are neither ‘mature’ nor ‘new’ were under-represented amongst those giving this answer. Growth intentions The issues of most concern to those with different growth intentions are ranked and displayed in Figure 23. Indexing the data showed that respondents whose firms are contracting are over- represented amongst the 43.3% of respondents who answered that the time, effort and cost 31 of the arrangements for releasing an employee outweighs the benefits. There is no significant between those firms that report growth, contraction, or consolidation in relation to the ACC insurance arrangements. Nor was there a significant between those firms that report growth, contraction, or consolidation in relation to ‘providing a range of employment and other data on the firm to government agencies’.

Respondents whose firms from the primary, non-food and food sectors are over-represented amongst the 39.0% of respondents who described the ‘time, effort and cost of the ACC insurance arrangements as they relate to the firm’ as outweighing the benefits, while firms from the software and business service industry and the tourism sector were under-represented amongst those giving this answer. Respondents whose firms are from the software and business service industry and the primary sector are over- represented amongst the 37.1% of respondents who answered that the ‘time, effort and cost of providing a range of employment and other data on the firm to government agencies’ outweighs the benefits, while firms from the food and tourism sectors were under- represented amongst those giving this answer. 32 E XPLORING THE PERCEPTIONS Respondents who commented that the time, cost and effort outweighed the benefit were asked to enlarge upon these comments. This generated a large number of comments (some 1100) and while it is beyond the scope of this report to deal with them, it is worth noting that some issues generated far more comments than others. While counting the number of comments is a simplistic approach (see Figure 25), it does support other evidence gained in this survey and elsewhere; that compliance is an issue that generates intense feeling. Figure 25: Numbers of comments on different factors FactorNumber of comments AThe regulations that you need to take into account when you are hiring a new person.42 BThe regulations that apply to releasing a person who no longer suits the business.159 CThe arrangements expected of you in regard to clean air, water and environment protection. 40 DAccommodating the controls and standards that relate to producing and labelling food and drink products. 32 EThe guidelines for firms trading fairly in relation to each other’s products and services, and in relation to customers. 65 FRunning your part of the GST system.57 GRunning your part of the PAYE system.61 HUnderstanding and delivering your part of the NZ tax system.88 IThe arrangements you need to have for health and safety of employees.81 JThe ACC insurance arrangements as they relate to your firm.137 KGetting consents to use land, water, or air in ways that suit your business.66 LProviding a range of employment and other data on your firm to government agencies.116 MThe standards you are asked to observe for plant or animal products, or how these are applied. 41 S UMMARY In relation to costs versus benefits, the issues of most concern (i.e. where the 490 respondents perceived that the cost and time outweighed the benefits) were: ♦ The regulations that apply to the process of releasing a person who no longer suits the business (43% said that the cost and time outweighed the benefit, compared to 13% who felt that the benefit was greater than the cost) ♦ The ACC insurance arrangements as it relates to the firm (39% said that the cost and time outweighed the benefit, compared to 15% who felt that the benefit was greater than the cost) ♦ Providing a range of employment and other data on the firm to government agencies (37% said that the cost and time outweighed the benefit), compared to 13% who felt that the benefit was greater than the cost) The issues of least concern (i.e. where respondents perceived that the benefit outweighed the cost and time involved) were: ♦ The guidelines for firms trading fairly in relation to each others products and services, and in relation to customers (27% said that the benefit was greater than the cost, compared to 9% who felt that the cost and time outweighed the benefit). ♦ The regulations that need to be taken into account when a new person is being hired (27% said that the benefit was greater than the cost, compared to 16% who felt that the cost and time outweighed the benefit). 33 ♦ The arrangements expected of the firm in regard to clean air, water and environment protection (21% said that the benefit was greater than the cost, compared to 14% who felt that the cost and time outweighed the benefit). Again, these perceptions were not identical across the different groups that were surveyed. The key differences between the groups in relation to the top three factors shows that: ♦ Respondents who described the time, effort and cost of ‘releasing an employee’ as outweighing the benefits were most likely to be from firms that: employ 6-10 FTEs and employ more than 11 FTEs, are not currently exporting, are ‘mature’, are contracting and are from the non-food, primary sectors and the wholesale, retail and manufacturing trades. ♦ Respondents who described the time, effort and cost of ‘ACC insurance arrangements’ as outweighing the benefits were most likely to be from firms that: employ 2-5 FTEs, are not currently exporting, are ‘mature’ and from the primary, non-food and food sectors (there was no difference in terms of firm growth intention). ♦ Respondents who described the time, effort and cost of ‘providing data to government agencies’ as outweighing the benefits were most likely to be from firms that: employ more than 11 FTEs, are not currently exporting, are ‘mature’, and are from the software and business service industry and the primary sector (there was no difference in terms of firm growth intention). Viewed from the perspective of the groups themselves, there were also some differences: ♦ In terms of firm size, all groups identified ‘the ACC insurance arrangements as they relate to your firm’, ‘the regulations that apply to releasing a person who no longer suits the business’ and ‘providing a range of employment and other data on your firm to government agencies’ as examples of legislation where they felt the costs outweighed the benefits. ♦ In terms of export involvement, all groups identified ‘the regulations that apply to releasing a person who no longer suits the business’, ‘the ACC insurance arrangements as they relate to your firm’ and ‘providing a range of employment and other data on your firm to government agencies’ as examples of legislation where they felt the costs outweighed the benefits. ♦ In terms of firm stage, all groups identified ‘the regulations that apply to releasing a person who no longer suits the business’, ‘the ACC insurance arrangements as they relate to your firm’ and ‘providing a range of employment and other data on your firm to government agencies’ as examples of legislation where they felt the costs outweighed the benefits. ♦ In terms of growth intentions, all groups identified ‘the regulations that apply to releasing a person who no longer suits the business’, ‘the ACC insurance arrangements as they relate to your firm’ and ‘providing a range of employment and other data on your firm to government agencies’ as examples of legislation where they felt the costs outweighed the benefits. The exception was contracting firms, which were more likely to comment on taxation. ♦ In terms of industry type, all groups identified ‘the regulations that apply to releasing a person who no longer suits the business’ and ‘providing a range of employment and other data on your firm to government agencies’ as examples of legislation where they felt the costs outweighed the benefits. 34 Section 6: Compliance & Firm Dynamics In the final section of the questionnaire, firms were asked in general terms about the impact compliance has had on the firm. The first question concerned their perception of whether the time and effort that they have put into compliance has changed over the previous year or two. Given that this study was undertaken as a pilot, this question was included to provide MED with a point of comparison for any surveys that follow. In this section of the questionnaire respondents were also asked to comment on the particular effects complying has had on internal firm dynamics, in relation to a set of factors that the researchers derived from previous research on compliance (including the New Zealand Ministerial Panel) and from the comments made within the focus groups. This question was designed to assess the degree to which the managers of New Zealand firms feel that compliance is having a stifling effect on their ability to be innovative. C HANGES IN COMPLIANCE Respondent firms were asked to consider whether the overall time and effort that firms like theirs have been required to put into complying with acts and regulations have changed over the last 2 years. As Figure 26 shows, the perception of most respondents is that the compliance burden has increased over the last two years. Figure 26: Changes in compliance over time Number of Respondents Percentage Has become less over the past year or two102.0% Has stayed much the same19740.2% Has increased, or become more, over the past year or two27355.7% Don’t know102.0% Total490100% Respondents were then asked whether any particular government act or regulation creates one or more of nine effects for the firm. As noted above, the researchers selected these factors (listed in Figure 27) after reviewing the international literature and the previous studies undertaken in New Zealand.

Factors G (‘obliges you to engage outside consultants’) and H (‘leaves a sense of unfairness with the firm’) elicited similar levels of response. 35 Those who responded ‘yes’ to any of these factors were then asked to identify the particular piece of legislation that was of concern to them. Figure 28 summarises the responses, showing that of all those who answered yes to any factor in the previous set of questions (as listed in Figure 27) more than 26% identified employment legislation as the piece of legislation that generated the effect. Figure 28: Legislation identified as having an indirect effect on firm dynamics Another way of representing this ranking is the following table, which rank orders the legislation for all those who responded ‘yes’ in relation to each of the nine effects. This analysis shows the respondents’ concerns with employment legislation, the Resource Management Act, MAF and OSH (the four pieces of legislation that received a first place ranking in relation to one of the nine effects. Figure 29: Legislation & firm dynamics (factors ranked by respondent group) S UMMARY ♦ In relation to whether the time and effort that respondents have put into compliance has changed over the previous year or two, 273 (56%) said there had been an increase. Respondents who said that there had been an increase were more likely to be from firms that were contracting, and were from the food and primary sectors. ♦ In terms of the potential for compliance commitments to impact on firm dynamics, 283 (58%) respondents said they could identify a particular piece of legislation in relation to the nine factors that were read to them.

A review of the international literature (which is included Appendix D) on compliance provided the context for this section. R ESULTS FROM THIS STUDY The 2001 OECD study concluded that the indirect costs of compliance affect the ability of firms to innovate, operate efficiently and adjust to changes over time. Specifically, these costs affect the ability of firms to innovate (to develop and exploit new products, services and operating procedures); to maximise operating efficiency (to minimise the coats of producing goods and services of a particular quality, and the maximum flexibility); and to make structural adjustments over time (to respond effectively to major changes in the competitive environment). 20 In the OECD survey it was clear that SMEs believed that compliance with employment regulations was particularly problematic. They felt that regulations increased non-wage costs; regulations created difficulties in making staff reductions; and regulations created difficulties in hiring new staff. This survey provided a basis for the current study. In particular, it provided its primary objective: To provide information on the impact of compliance on the firm’s performance (i.e. the indirect costs of compliance) and its ability to innovate (relative to other factors). Findings & the project’s objectives As already noted, the focus of the present project was to assist the Ministry of Economic Development in understanding more about the way in which New Zealand firms (particularly those that are small and medium in size) are currently facing their compliance commitments. The intention was to undertake (and report upon) a piece of research while at the same time developing and testing a method for measuring the perceptions of New Zealand business people about compliance. In keeping with this dual focus, two main objectives were identified: Objective 1: To gain an understanding of the perceptions of NZ managers on the consequences of compliance In terms of this objective the researchers were asked to provide MED with a report which: 1.1Identifies and describes the perceptions held by the managers of New Zealand firms in respect of their compliance commitments (with a particular focus on the way this commitment affects the firm’s performance and its ability to innovate). 1.2Provides information on the impact of the compliance commitment (and its associated costs) on the firm’s performance and its ability to innovate (relative to other factors). 1.3Provides information on the types of strategies that firms put in place to manage their compliance commitment and ameliorate any associated costs 21 . 20 OECD. (2001). Businesses' views on red tape: Administrative and regulatory burdens on small and medium-sized enterprises. Paris: OECD. p32. 21 After some discussion between the researchers and MED about the difficulty of collecting valid data on this topic (see Section 7 for further discussion of this point), it was decided not to attempt to address this topic in the project. 38 Objective 2: To develop an appropriate methodology for assessing compliance perceptions In terms of this objective the researchers were asked to develop a methodology that will make it possible for MED to measure the three items listed above, and which has been tested within the context of this project. This methodology will enable MED to: 2.1Identify changes over time in the perceptions held by the managers of New Zealand firms in respect of their compliance commitment. 2.2Understand how the compliance commitment affects the firm’s performance and its ability to innovate (relative to other factors). 2.3Build up a picture of the strategies that firms put in place to manage their compliance commitment and ameliorate any associated costs. 2.4Assess whether the actions taken by government agencies are having the desired effect. The objectives were modified slightly after Treasury became involved with the project. Their interest in firms that are exporting (or which have the potential to do so) meant that the researchers identified exporters (and potential exporters) as a specific sub-sample, to be addressed in the data gathering that was undertaken for Objective 1. Objectives 1.1 and 1.2 were primarily addressed through the telephone survey (some material from the focus groups was also of value here). As already noted, objective 1.3 was not addressed as preliminary exploration with different business people suggested to the researchers that respondents found it difficult to discuss the strategies that they put in place to ‘manage’ their compliance commitments. It appeared that this was because of the different way in which they conceptualised ‘compliance’ and ‘strategy’. It was clear from the respondents with whom the researchers undertook preliminary testing that they saw strategy as voluntary and compliance as mandatory. As a consequence they found it difficult to describe the relationship between their compliance commitments and the actions (strategies) they chose to take. Subsequent discussions with the MED meant that this objective was omitted from the final study. A discussion of the findings in the context of these objectives follows. Constraints on exporting Respondents to the survey were first asked to respond to an open-ended question on the factor that was most significant in terms of constraining their export growth. While the purpose of this question was to stimulate the respondents’ thinking before exposing them to a list of statements, (and because of this no results have been presented in this report), it was clear that relatively few respondents identified issues that could be described as compliance issues. Instead, they raised issues that are more properly described as being concerned with firm strategy. 39 Figure 30: Most significant 3 factors by sample group Conditions & regulations imposed by overseas governments Cost & time needed to represent firm overseas Effort & distraction of New Zealand regulations Firm size Non employing ++ - 2-5 FTEs +=+ 6-10 FTEs --+ 11+ FTEs ++ - Export involvement Exporting +-+ Not currently exporting -+- Firm stage New -++ Neither new nor mature +- - Mature --+ Growth intentions Contract --+ Consolidate --+ Grow significantly ++ - Industry type Primary +++ Food industry +-+ Non-food industry --- Tourism & allied services --+ Software & business services -+- Wholesale & retail ++ - In response to a set of factors that was read to the respondents, ‘the conditions and regulations imposed by overseas governments’ was the most frequently identified as a constraint. Next was ‘the cost and time needed to represent the firm overseas’, followed by ‘the effort and distraction of complying with regulations in New Zealand’. Within these groups it was possible to look in more detail at the various groups that were more or less likely to identify particular factors. This showed that on the whole the groups responded in ways that related to their particular experiences. For example, those who are not currently exporting were less likely to identify the regulations of overseas governments as an issue, while those who are exporting were more likely to do so. Figure 30 summarises these different responses, with a + symbol indicating those groups that were over-represented in identifying the different factors, a – indicating that the group was under-represented and an = showing that the groups was not significantly under or over- represented. Constraints on productivity & growth Next we asked respondents to comment on a set of common business events (e.g. the employment of a new person) and asked them whether they could readily deal with it and largely put it out of mind or whether it continues to divert and distract them. Respondents most commonly identified ‘releasing a person who no longer fits the business’ as the most significant factor in terms of diverting and distracting them. This was followed by ACC, health and safety, the ‘provision of statistics to government agencies’ and the ‘arrangements needed for hiring a new person’. When the rankings were adjusted to exclude those who answered not applicable, the list (ranked by most diverting) was releasing an employee, labelling controls and standards, getting consent to use land, water and air and ACC. Again, 40 looking at the various groups (Figure 31) revealed significant variation in the way they reacted to these events. Figure 31: Most ‘diverting’ 3 factors by sample groups Releasing an employeeLabelling controls & standards Getting consent to use land, water & air Firm size Non employing -=- 2-5 FTEs -=- 6-10 FTEs +++ 11+ FTEs +-+ Export involvement Exporting +++ Not currently exporting ++ - Not planning to export --- Firm stage New -+- Neither new nor mature -++ Mature +- - Growth intentions Contract +-+ Consolidate === Grow significantly === Industry type Primary ++ - Food industry +- - Non-food industry +- - Tourism & allied services --- Software & business services -++ Wholesale & retail +++ Costs versus benefits In the third section of the survey the respondents’ perceptions of the factors that were used in the previous section were also the basis for the questions on the costs versus the benefits of compliance. Again looking at the responses by the groups revealed differences in the way in which they react to the three factors where costs were mostly likely to be seen as outweighing benefits (Figure 32). Figure 32: Factors where costs outweigh the benefits Releasing an employeeACC arrangementsProviding data to government agencies Firm size Non employing -- - 2-5 FTEs -= = 6-10 FTEs += - 11+ FTEs += + Export involvement Exporting -= = Not currently exporting += + 41 Not planning to export -= = Firm stage New -= - Neither new nor mature -= + Mature ++ + Growth intentions Contract += = Consolidate == = Grow significantly == = Industry type Primary ++ = Food industry -- + Non-food industry ++ + Tourism & allied services -+ - Software & business services -+ - Wholesale & retail +- = Indirect effects In terms of the indirect effects of compliance, it was clear that the key issue was the extent to which compliance “distracts and diverts senior staff time”. This was followed by three factors that elicited similar levels of response: Respondents were then asked whether any particular government act or regulation creates one or more of nine effects for the firm. As noted above, the researchers selected these factors (listed in Figure 27) after reviewing the international literature and the previous studies undertaken in New Zealand. Of those who answered yes, Factor A (especially distracts senior management time) was identified most often (by 58% of all respondents). Some 36 % of respondents identified factors G (obliges you to engage outside consultants), H (leaves a sense of unfairness with the firm) and E (dampens manager’s enthusiasm for innovating). When asked to identify the particular piece of legislation that was of concern to them, more than 26 % identified employment legislation as the piece of legislation that generated the effect. 42 Section 8: Conclusions The New Zealand research on compliance that existed prior to this study provided valuable feedback on how particular pieces of legislation could be improved, in order to make compliance less onerous. On another level, it also provided researchers and policy makers with an understanding of the intangible costs of compliance overall, rather than focusing solely on those costs that are tangible and/or measurable (e.g. financial). This approach (which combines an awareness of tangible costs with those that are intangible) is important if policymakers are to fully understand this broader perspective on the ‘costs’ of compliance. This depends on studies in which researchers take an integrated approach to the problem, using sociological and psychological frameworks as well as those provided by the study of economics 22 . Conceptually this broader perspective is reflected in emerging perceptions of compliance as a commitment, rather than a cost or burden. Instead of ‘having to’ comply with government regulations, a firm is choosing to commit to (or invest in) its own future. Re-framing compliance issues so that negative (i.e. cost) aspects are de-emphasised is useful in defining the boundaries for investigating the situation (i.e. enabling questions to be more neutrally phrased can be helpful in obtaining constructive suggestions). It may also have benefits for government agencies that are engaged in encouraging certain behaviours (by individuals and/or firms). Given that the extensive international research on compliance suggests that the majority of firms maintain a ‘reactive’ stance in terms of compliance, irrespective of initiatives undertaken by governmental agencies to encourage ‘proactive’ behaviour, (with small firms particularly at fault in this regard 23 ), government agencies need all the help they can get in ‘selling’ compliance as an important element in every firm’s development. However, no matter how businesses are presented with the benefits of compliance, and however frequently they hear that compliance is not a cost but an investment, they will only act willingly if they believe that government will listen to their concerns and is interested in their perceptions of the impact that compliance has on their ability to improve firm performance and act in innovative ways. The recent reports from the New Zealand government suggests that this situation exists, but to date the agencies concerned with reducing the compliance burden have been hampered by a lack of evidence about the way in which the managers of New Zealand view the indirect impacts of compliance. As the results summarised above show, New Zealand business people are articulate about the impact of legislation and regulations on their business practices. The respondents to this survey could name the pieces of legislation that concerned them and describe in some detail the way in which they felt they impacted upon them. They could also clearly voice their opinion that the impact of compliance has increased over the last two years. However, when they were asked to select from a list of factors where the ‘effort and distraction of complying with New Zealand regulations’ was included, this was not the top factor. This place instead went to the ‘conditions and regulations placed by overseas governments’ (see Figure 7). While this may be of little comfort to those concerned with growth in New Zealand firms (given the difficulty of removing or minimising the impediments placed by overseas governments), it is heartening that in the context of a study on the relationship between growth and business compliance, that the New Zealand government was not automatically blamed for restricting growth. 22 Sutinen, J.G. (1999). A socio-economic theory of regulatory compliance. International Journal of Social Economics, 26(1/2/3), 174-193. 23 Harris, L. (2000). Employment regulation and owner-managers in small firms: Seeking support and guidance. Journal of Small Business and Enterprise Development, 7(4), 352-362. 43 Having said this, there was considerable detail about some legislation, particularly from the perspectives of certain industry groups. Food labelling is an issue that is causing great concern to those in the food industry at present, while MAF came in for criticism from the primary sector. The researchers expected this situation to occur. They also expected there to be identifiable differences in the responses of the other groups that were sampled. For example, it was assumed that managers from firms with growth intentions would exhibit concerns with some pieces of legislation, for example, acts that they were dealing with for the first time because of expansion. The researchers also expected respondents from these firms to be more tolerant towards compliance as a whole, seeing it perhaps as a necessary corollary of growth. These assumptions were largely borne out. Similarly, it was assumed that managers from firms of different stages would hold different perceptions of compliance. This was borne out to a degree. For example, firms that are ‘new’ were under-represented amongst those citing the arrangements surrounding the release of an employee as a distracting factor. Conversely, ‘mature’ firms were over-represented in relation to this factor, perhaps demonstrating an example of the cumulative nature of compliance: perhaps the respondents from the mature firms were in fact remembering an experience from the past. Finally it was assumed that there would be differences in the responses between firms of different sizes. The reports from the Ministerial Panel suggested that non-employing firms would have different perceptions of compliance than those that do employ, and that those employing reasonable numbers of staff (in this survey those with more than 11 FTEs were grouped together) would also exhibit different perceptions. Again, this assumption was largely borne out, though there were some interesting deviations from the researchers’ intuitive conclusions. For example, it appeared that larger firms had appropriate systems in place for dealing with compliance (with those employing more than 11 FTEs often under- represented in the groups identifying a concern). However, they were over-represented in relation to some issues, such as getting consents to use land, water or air. This study has gathered a large amount of detailed information on the way in which New Zealand firms view the various activities that go under the heading of ‘compliance’. This has confirmed the assumption that the managers of different types of New Zealand firms would have different perceptions of compliance, and different experiences of the way in which complying has impacted on their ability to improve productivity and to plan and undertake strategies that will assist the firm to grow. Particular concerns were identified which relate to the size of the business, its stage, its involvement in export, its growth intentions and the sector to which it belongs. This information will be of value to all those agencies that are concerned with minimising the burden of compliance. 44 Bibliography AC Nielsen. (2001).

For example, in the 2001 review respondents identified three main ways in which compliance impacted on their business: 1. The time spent complying. 2. The fact that compliance has a stifling effect on innovation and competition. 3. The cost of expert assistance. These general concepts provided the scope for exploring more specific ways in which the compliance burden can express itself within the context of a single firm, such as the potential for compliance concerns to: ♦ Distract and divert senior staff. ♦ Generate disagreement and vexation as to their interpretation/application. ♦ Create anxiety and/or uncertainty as to whether the requirement has or has not been met, at a given point. ♦ Create vexing or problematical interaction with regulatory staff. ♦ Shut down or dampen project morale/enthusiasm, particularly those that are innovative, for fear of regulatory burden. On the basis of these findings, we recommended that the findings from the should be used as the foundation for this project, which would have the following components: 1. A review of the international and New Zealand literature on compliance. 2. A series of focus groups to identify the particular concerns of New Zealand exporters 24 . 3. A telephone survey of approximately 400 business owners and managers (with a small number of one to one interviews undertaken as part of the testing phase). These methods are explained in more detail in the following sections. L ITERATURE REVIEW The body of literature pertaining to compliance costs was reviewed for this project. The focus was on academic literature and material relating to compliance costs rather than good regulatory practice. In order to supplement this a general search of websites was made to ensure that recent work by governments’ and other agencies in a global context was also reviewed. 24 These groups were not part of the initial proposal, but were added to answer the needs of the Treasury team. F OCUS GROUPS The objective of the focus groups was to try to extract/reflect the experiences and perceptions of SME exporters on three dimensions: 1. Constraints to export growth: What business inputs, outputs, contexts or leverages are the ones most likely to inhibit growth of their export volume by say 10% to 20% from this year to the next? 2. The New Zealand regulatory environment: Which acts and regulations, if any, feature in their efforts to grow exports from current levels to greater levels? Are these largely negative, largely positive, or mixed in their impact on export growth efforts? 3. Distance to market: How do exporters interpret/define this notion? How is the distance to market perceived by current SMEs who are exporting? How have they dealt with it to date? Are their current strategies (still) viable for increasing their exports by 10% to 20%? The focus group method was selected as an appropriate method of conducting an open exploration into the research issues. The method aims to investigate people’s attitudes, opinions and knowledge of a certain matter in an in-depth manner. A strength of the focus group method is its ability to generate group interactions to bring up issues that might not surface using other research methods. Since it is a less structured research method, it also provides a method of uncovering and probing relevant issues that may not have been anticipated. The focus group method is excellent for discovering the range of responses of participants, and exposing dimensions or attributes relevant to the research issue. It does not measure the statistical incidence of responses in a population or target market. Caution should therefore be given to not directly infer findings from this kind of qualitative research, without separate quantification or verification. Conducting the focus groups The four focus groups were conducted at the NRB focus group facilities in Auckland, with participants from the Auckland region. Focus group sessions were of approximately 2 hours each. All the groups were moderated by an experienced moderator. In each group session, participants were seated boardroom style in a quiet room, with refreshments provided. The intention was to create a relatively relaxed and comfortable environment in which to encourage open response. However, participants were advised not to reveal trade secrets or information confidential to their firm, due to the presence of other participants. There were no real problems with participants discussing the issues and presenting viewpoints in this environment. Established focus group procedure was employed to ensure an adequate depth of response from the participants. This included the avoidance of leading questions and acquiescent responses. For this particular study, care was taken to not specifically raise the issues of ‘compliance’, but rather to allow participants to bring up and discuss impediments to export in a general sense. Likewise, ‘distance to market’ was also not raised early in discussions, until there had been opportunity to observe the manner and extent to which participants themselves raised such issues. A moderator’s guide was used to ensure coverage of the research issues and to assist ‘steer’ proceedings. However, care was taken to not follow this to rigorously, but rather allow the participants to bring up and discuss issues they saw as of importance relative to export impediments. A brief questionnaire (see Appendix B) was also used during group sessions to assist in anchoring response regarding how burdensome participants felt various New Zealand based factors relating to their business environment were). Analysis & reporting of results Each focus groups was video taped and audio taped (with the participants’ agreement) to enable a thorough analysis of the discussions by an experienced qualitative researcher. In the separate report on the sessions 25 the results are presented descriptively (rather than numerically) in a generally thematic manner, as is usual with this qualitative style of research. In this summary report this approach has also been taken. T ELEPHONE SURVEY The questionnaire that was used for the telephone survey was developed by successive interaction between the MED, the Treasury, Massey University, and NRB Ltd. It benefited from a series of four focus groups that explored the way managers of small business thought and spoke about the two areas of study, viz. the impact of compliance on their business, and obstacles to growth with particular reference to growth in export. These focus groups are reported under separate cover. A selection of one-on-one interviews was carried out by the principal researcher to assess how well managers could relate to the constructs and question phrasing in the initial draft of the questionnaire. Changes were incorporated as a result of these interviews, and as a result of the MED’s review of the questionnaire against their information needs. The questionnaire (see Appendix A) was built around 4 sections engaging mostly closed questions, and extending to probes on “reasons why” for verbatim commentary on one section. Respondents The interviewer contacted the sampled firms and asked for the General Manager, Managing Director, and/or Owner/Proprietor. If this person was not available, a senior manager was contacted. Since the sample list contained the name of the most senior person, or equivalent, the interviewer was generally asking for the person by name. NRB interviewers carried out all interviews over the phone during business hours. Interviews were conducted over October-November 2002. Sample structure The general framework for the sample was that: 1. Firms were sampled nation-wide, urban and rural. 2. The firms were to be “small-to-medium” as defined by having employee numbers in FTE terms of 50 or fewer, as reported at the time of listing. Quotas were then assigned to ensure adequate sample sizes within: 1. Firm sizes of 1-5, 6-10, and 11-50 employed. 2. Activity types which were of interest to the MED and Treasury respectively. For Treasury, this was firms that export, or had the inherent product/service type capable of being exported. For the MED, this was an informed selection of activities known from background information to have potential for growing the New Zealand economy and/or 25 National Research Bureau (2002). Constraints and hurdles to SME exporting. NRB: Auckland. with particular concerns about compliance. These were primary sector firms, the food industry, small non-food manufacturers, tourism and allied services, and software and business services. Sampling 1. Sample lists were purchased from UBD Ltd, a firm which systematically canvasses at street level to list all operating firms, their contact particulars, employee numbers and activity type as close to the NZSIC codes as the reporting staff members are able to define it. While both employee numbers and firm type classifications show some variation with those produced by Statistics New Zealand, and while firm type description and list ageing are considerations, this is the nearest quality listing enabling access to purposive samples available in New Zealand. 2. Sample lists were bought to two specifications: ♦ SME firms engaged in export. ♦ SME firms falling within selected activity type codes that suited the survey objectives. Codes were chosen from the NZSIC classification, and their grouping into the study targets are shown below. In each case, the list supplier was directed to divide the available names on the national listing by the required number, multiply this by 3 to allow for non-contacts, and then to sample according to the interval produced by this division, viz. every xth name. The activity groups and their corresponding NZSIC statistical classification are shown below: Sampled sectors against NZSIC codes Activity GroupIndustry Codes Primary Sector11 – 13 Food Industry31 Non-food industry32 – 39 Tourism and allied services71 Software and business services81-83, 91-96 \* Wholesale/retail with export/manufacturing61 – 62 \*This group emerged from the sampling of firms engaged in exporting a product or service. Tabulation The data is presented in the tables as unweighted. The total column is therefore the simple total of the replies of the targeted activity groups. The total column does not purport to reflect SMEs at large; rather the tables should be read as providing insight into the experiences and perceptions of five types of firms of SME size, on a quasi quantitative basis. Diagnostic opportunity, rather than projectable quantification, has been the priority. Numerical extrapolation of quantities, e.g. relating to turnover, staff numbers, etc. of these segments would not be appropriate. A PPENDIX B: Q UESTIONNAIRE A PPENDIX C: F ACTORS THAT RESTRICT EXPORT GROWTH ( DETAILED ANALYSIS ) Studies of this type often involve sub-samples which are of different sizes. This can present difficulties when the focus is on differences between the groups. This problem can be minimised by using the technique of indexing, which involves selecting a base (commonly 100) against which the different groups are compared. This makes it possible for the researchers to examine the differences in the responses from groups of different sizes. In relation to firm size, this showed that respondents whose firms do not employ and respondents from firms that employ more than 11 FTEs are over-represented amongst the 22.9% of respondents answering “yes, significantly” in relation to this factor, while firms employing between 2-5 FTEs were under-represented amongst those giving this answer.

In the 1960s this interest in the topic of ‘compliance costs’ and ‘compliance behaviour’ spread to Europe (Germany in particular), and over recent years a number of countries have examined compliance in the context of their particular regulatory and legislative environments. Some countries have focused on specific groups of businesses (such as small or medium enterprises), others have examined particular industry sectors with specific issues (the primary sectors in relation to environmental pollution for example), while others have focused on groupings of legislation and regulation that is seen as having the potential to be problematic (such as taxation). In terms of specific studies, some of the best known are those carried out in the UK, the US, Canada and Australia. The United Kingdom addressed the issues in a number of reviews during the 1980s, 27 the Small Business Administration in the United States reported on compliance in 1995 28 , Canada focused on tax and SMEs in their 1996 report 29 , and Australia examined taxation 30 and other aspects of compliance 31 in the mid 1990s, and established a Small Business Deregulation Task Force. 32 In New Zealand, a Ministerial panel on Business Compliance Costs was established in 2000 and reported in 2001. 33 34 The context for all of these reviews was the complex set of changes that accompanied the changing face of public management that has become particularly apparent since the 1980s. In this era of “the new public management” 35 , the relationship between government and the business sector has changed in a number of fundamental ways. At the core of the change is a shift away from government intervention in the economy. In relation to compliance, reducing intervention has often meant a focus on ‘reducing compliance costs’ and ‘cutting red tape’. One of the manifestations of this attitude (that businesses are better equipped to 26 Pope, J., Fayle, R., & Duncanson, M. (1990).

However, if this shift is to work, it needs a mental shift within the business sector. There is also a need to build capability, either internally (through the firm’s managers becoming more knowledgeable about the different aspects of compliance) or externally (through the firm expanding its network of personal advisers). In situations where responsibility for compliance increasingly falls on the shoulders of business, (either in countries where deregulation and non-intervention are key drivers of government policy or in sectors where self-regulation has become the norm), there has been a growing perception that more compliance activity is occurring at the firm level. As compliance in general terms became a matter of concern for business, in particular in reference to the level of cost associated with complying, this perception becomes even more firmly held: Now it is received wisdom that complying with government regulations is a heavy burden for business. This remains true despite the lack of empirical evidence to support the contention that businesses finds compliance with controls imposed from the outside (i.e. government) any more burdensome that those that are internally driven (i.e. in line with the firm’s own strategy). While the debate about compliance increasingly focused on its cost to businesses, there was also a shift in the way in which the community expressed its tolerance of non-compliance with certain types of legislation (such as environmental pollution). The result of these dynamics is that today’s business owner is faced with an acute awareness of the cost of compliance, has more responsibility than ever before in terms of self-regulation (and/or accessing the appropriate advisers to ensure compliance), and is facing an increasing level of compliance and community disapproval over non-compliance with certain pieces of legislation. Government responses to compliance In the face of this sensitivity on the part of business and government to a) the high levels of compliance activity needed in the light of increasingly complex legislative systems, and b) the perceived high cost of compliance, a number of governments have established permanent agencies for monitoring new legislation in the light of its impact on business. These agencies have promoted a variety of systems for monitoring the impact of new legislation. The United Kingdom has the CCA (compliance cost assessment) and the United States takes a cost- benefit analysis approach to all new legislation. 37 Australia announced a business regulation reform package in 1994 in Working Nation 38 , and since then a number of reports have continued this work and there is now a set of well accepted principles for the design and implementation of government regulation. Another approach has been in line with the changing approach to compliance that has emerged over recent years in relation to some specific areas where compliance is an issue. Partly in response to changes in society generally, the traditional (regulatory) paradigm is being replaced in some sectors (and/or in some countries) by a participatory, educative paradigm. There are two implications of this new approach. First there is a need for a change 36 Lamm, F. (1997). Small businesses and OH&S advisors. Safety Science, 25(1-3), 153-161. 37 Boden, R., & Froud, J. (1996). Obeying the rules: Accounting for regulatory compliance costs in the United Kingdom. Accounting, Organizations and Society, 21(6 ), 529-547. 38 Keating, 1994, cited in Bickerdyke, I., & Lattimore, R. (1997). Reducing the regulatory burden: Does firm size matter? Melbourne: Industry Commission, Commonwealth of Australia. in the role of the regulatory and advisory agencies; 39 instead of acting as the monitor of compliance, the agency practitioner becomes a facilitator, assisting firms to comply. The second implication is the increased need for the firm’s owners and managers to develop their own capacity so that they can comply. The consequence of both these changes is that the interaction between the parties is altered: Interactions become based on identifying needs and building capacity rather than on monitoring compliance. 40 41 . This approach is well documented in the literature, with a number of examples of training programmes for enhancing compliance in different areas (such as occupational safety and health 42 ). However, it could be argued that there is still a conceptual gap within the field. Until relatively recently the only framework for understanding compliance behaviour was Becker’s economic model of non-compliance with legislation, which was originally developed as a framework for examining criminal behaviour. 43 44 Dominant in the literature for many years, more recently this solely economic model has been challenged by researchers from psychology and sociology. The psychologists have examined individual behaviour (cf. ‘firm behaviour’), using the perspective of social learning and cognitive theory and the sociologists have introduced the notion of instrumental (cf. normative) behaviour to the subject. This has meant that new concepts have been introduced (such as the concept of ‘mental accounting’, which comes from examining an individual’s cognitive models), 45 and there is a greater understanding of the limitations of using a wholly economic perspective. This somewhat broader understanding has been the basis for the development of some practice-based models for encouraging taxpayer compliance. Generally developed by statutory bodies, they are based on the assumption that compliance behaviour can be changed by government agencies 46 through a variety of strategies (such as persuading people that it is in their self-interest to comply; or making people feel that it is their responsibility to comply). 47 This line of thinking is the basis for some recent work on categorising individuals as “environmental laggards, reluctant compliers, committed compliers, environmental strategists and true believers” (the latter two relying on building reputational capital). 48 This typology, and others like it, are helpful in allowing the agencies charged with ensuring compliance occurs with a way of understanding the factors that enhance compliance (as well as those that act as barriers to it). One of these factors is the way compliance is often seen by the firms as an admission of limited autonomy. Small firms in particular are often run by 39 Lamm, F. (1997).

This is important in a society which in general terms is moving away from an acceptance of governmental intervention, but which at the same time is losing a sense of the individual’s ‘duty’ towards an economy. 50 Developing concepts & definitions While on one level there has been a large amount written on compliance with an abstract perspective (as seen above), there has also been a continuing focus on ensuring that basic definitions have been developed. In this context it is important to remember that much of the initial work on compliance has been done in the context of taxation, and that therefore many of the key concepts and definitions refer to the particular regulatory environment for taxation. In this context, compliance costs are “those costs incurred by taxpayers, or third parties such as businesses, in meeting the requirements laid upon them in complying with a given tax structure”. 51 This definition has become standard when discussing compliance in any context, and is the basis for the typical focus on compliance costs rather than the benefits that may accrue to either firms or governments from high levels of compliance. Despite this traditional focus on costs, some benefits have been identified. These include the fact that legislation and regulation can establish frameworks in which commercial transactions can take place at lower cost, which can help smaller firms get access to markets and ensure that accounting and information systems for small firms are improved. 52 Another ‘developing concept’ concerns ‘ additionality’ (i.e. the fact that the compliance cost refers to the time and expense outlaid that is over and above normal commercial practices). This cost may include lost opportunities and disincentives to expand the business. 53 Despite this caveat, there is increasing agreement that the ‘cost’ of compliance includes time, effort, financial and ‘psychological’ costs; 54 55 56 that there can be negative impacts on a firm’s productivity and other non-economic costs; 57 that there may be opportunity costs associated with compliance; 58 and that there are internal compliance costs, external compliance costs 49 Golby & Johns, 1971,cited in Westrip, A.

However, the vast majority of studies have focused on identifying the actual (direct) costs of compliance such as financial costs and estimating the time commitment needed. Most studies omit indirect costs, 62 and/or others that are regarded as intangible: Despite the fact that there is an awareness of the presence of other ‘costs’ (e.g. psychological costs), there is as yet no generally agreed method as to how these should be measured. Much of the research also focuses on understanding non-compliance, rather than improving fairness attitudes and compliance behaviour. 63 One of the other main reasons for this lack of empirical work on all of the issues that surround compliance is the methodological complexity implicit in researching a complex phenomenon, where the issues are not simple for respondents to articulate, and where there is likely to be a high level of ignorance in the target population as to what constitutes a ‘reasonable’ level of regulations and legislation. Other methodological challenges include defining what activities constitute a compliance activity; deciding whether opportunity or marginal costs should be used; and developing an approach that minimises the impact of the efficiency/inefficiency of the firms being studied, ensures that the most appropriate person is located, and makes some allowance for the subjective measures that respondents use. 64 The consequence is that most research has addressed compliance in a relatively simplistic way, or as a by-product of a study on a related topic. For example, a New Zealand study on the barriers for exporters identified administrative procedures and ‘red tape’ as one of the most common barriers faced. 65 Whilst this research was useful in a broad sense, more detail is needed if government agencies are to address the compliance concerns of New Zealand business owners. 59 Pope, J., Fayle, R., & Chen D.

Massey compliance cost survey released
======================================

The government today released the results of a compliance cost survey conducted by the New Zealand Centre for Small and Medium Enterprise Research at Massey University. Amongst the findings were that compliance costs related to GST and PAYE were less of a concern to the businesses surveyed than were employment-related costs.

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Compliance cost perceptions survey helpful, positive

A new Government-sponsored survey of business perceptions of compliance costs is positive and helpful, Minister for Small Business John Tamihere says.

The survey of 500 firms,The Impact of Business Compliance: Perceptions of New Zealand Firms, was commissioned by the Ministry for Economic Development and Treasury and conducted by the New Zealand Centre for Small and Medium Enterprise Research at Massey University.

The survey found business concerns with tax related compliance requirements were minimal and declining.

Overall most businesses were coping fairly comfortably with their share of regulatory compliance costs. The majority of firms indicated they "deal readily" with compliance requirements.

"The survey shows that the government's efforts in reducing compliance costs are making a difference," Mr Tamihere said.

"In particular, our ongoing tax simplification programme, along with the efforts of IRD to make information more accessible, are clearly having real impact," he said.

The survey found that employment-related regulation (including accident insurance and occupational health and safety) was 'top of mind' for business.

"That's not surprising. This government has made considerable changes in the area of employment relations, and you would expect there to be a natural period of adjustment to the new requirements," Mr Tamihere said.

He said the survey's findings would provide further direction to the government's extensive compliance cost reduction programme.

They would be used, alongside other New Zealand and international research, in order to 'pin down' the most pressing compliance cost issues and identify where most gains could be achieved.

Mr Tamihere said the government would continue to tackle compliance costs in a number of ways.

These included greater use of Test Panels (such as the Panel that provided advice during implementation of the Health and Safety in Employment Amendment Act 2002), education campaigns, and increased availability of information on regulatory requirements and regulatory change.

The one-stop business portal (www-biz.govt.nz) \[site no longer available - see [Internet Archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20040814140035/http://www.biz.org.nz/Public/home.aspx?sectionid=53)\
 for archived version\] was an important step forward in this area and would be expanded, Mr Tamihere said.

The portal, which provides business with one-stop web-based information on a number of Government agencies, such as IRD, ACC and the Department of Labour, has been well received by business, and was favourably reviewed as "New Zealand Site of the Month" by NZ NetGuide magazine.

Other initiatives to reduce compliance costs include a soon-to-be-released discussion document on tax simplification; the Department of Labour's SME "Good Regulation" Project and Small Business Assistance Active Pilot.

The creation of a SME Directorate within the Ministry of Economic Development, and the imminent appointment of the Small Business Advisory Group would ensure the Government was listening to the advice of small-medium businesses- including their views on how compliance costs could best be reduced, Mr Tamihere said.

He said the Government had already implemented more than 80 per cent of the recommendations it accepted from the Ministerial Panel on Business Compliance Costs, and was committed to further reducing compliance costs.

Increased funding of the Environment Court, which has significantly reduced backlogs and delays; the Business Law Reform Bill, and the Electronic Transactions Bill would also have a strong impact on compliance costs, Mr Tamihere said.

In addition, the process for ensuring compliance costs were considered as part of any regulatory change has been refined to encourage more robust analysis and greater transparency of the consequences of regulation.

All methodologies and findings outlined in this report are provided solely for use by the client. Copyright is reserved by colmar brunton. Attention: Author(s): colmar brunton’s Social Research Agency Contact: Issue Date: 23 January 2003 Prepared for: Inland Revenue FINAL REPORT PAGE 1 colmar brunton Executive Summary At the request of the Minister of Revenue, Inland Revenue in partnership with Treasury, are looking at ways to reduce the compliance costs of small businesses. As part of a wider consultation process, Inland Revenue have commissioned colmar brunton to undertake both qualitative and quantitative research with businesses and tax agents to seek their input. This report presents the findings of the qualitative research. A summary of the salient points is provided below. Barriers to small business success Small businesses face a range of barriers to success in New Zealand. These include a general lack of knowledge and expertise in running a business, lack of capital, difficulties in recruiting and retaining suitable staff, difficulties in releasing unsuitable staff, and parental leave laws. There are also a range of barriers that are directly related to the compliance demands of the following government departments: Inland Revenue, ACC, Statistics New Zealand, OSH, Ministry of Health; and the Resource Management Act. These demands largely relate to the amount of time and paperwork required to comply as well as the perceived complexity of the regulations. The compliance costs associated with employing staff are felt to be particularly onerous with some businesses discouraging others from employing staff for this reason. Tax Compliance Costs Small businesses face a range of tax-related compliance costs. These are: • Penalties and interest. Small businesses’ principal concerns are that the system does not differentiate between dishonest taxpayers and those that fall short of the mark due to ‘honest’ mistakes, and that the system seems to be out of proportion with the size of the business. • Reliance on accountants. Small businesses feel that they need to use tax agents for a range of purposes (not restricted to year-end income tax return filing) because of the complexity of the tax system, a need to minimise the time they spend on things that are not ‘core business’, a desire to minimise their tax, and a fear of being penalised should they make mistakes in doing tax work themselves. • The volume of returns, payments and information. This impacts businesses in terms of the time required to complete these tasks, but also in terms of contributing to a sense of feeling overwhelmed and anxious about their tax obligations. Some businesses specifically struggle with the number of different payment dates for different tax revenues. • Difficulties in accessing knowledgeable staff. Businesses’ perceptions of Inland Revenue’s Call Centres are polarised. Some have had positive experiences while others hold very negative perceptions. The most common complaint relates to the waiting time. • Inadequate Inland Revenue processes. Businesses experience frustrations with one-off processes and services that Inland Revenue provides when businesses start of stop ongoing operations, such as FINAL REPORT PAGE 2 colmar brunton continuing to receive GST returns after a company has deregistered. They also experience problems with processing or computer errors regarding steady state activities, e.g. incorrect statements of account. • Provisional Tax and Use of Money Interest. Many businesses in this research project struggled to pay the three equal instalments of provisional tax due to significant cyclical and seasonal variations in their business income. Some needed to borrow finance to do this. Further, for those that have unpredictable incomes, exposure to Use of Money Interest is a large concern. • Fringe Benefit Tax. Employers and tax agents alike strongly resent FBT. They perceive it to be both unfair and a very complicated tax to calculate. Many businesses avoid offering their staff fringe benefits because of this. • Collecting child support payments. Employers resent having to collect child support payments as they feel that it is both an intrusion into the personal lives of their employees and incurs administration costs for which they are not reimbursed by the Government. • Unpaid envelopes. Businesses regard the postage they have to pay on envelopes sent to Inland Revenue as a compliance cost. This issue is considerably bigger than the financial outlay of the stamps; it is considered to be unfair and unreasonable especially given the small business’s role as an unpaid tax collector of GST and PAYE. • Transacting electronically with Inland Revenue. This is not considered to be a compliance cost as such, but rather a favoured solution to overcome a number of compliance costs. Current practices Businesses vary considerably in the way they approach their tax obligations from the highly organised and disciplined businesses that attend to their tax bookwork on a weekly basis to those that rarely plan ahead and tend to leave any tax work until just before a return is due. Many businesses no longer feel that cashflow cycles exist. If there is a best time in the month for paying bills, this tends to be the end of the month when the majority of their customers have sent in payments. Reaction to possible solutions Payment dates Having a common payment date each month for all revenue types has strong appeal to some customers as they feel the payment dates would be easier to remember. Preference, however, appears to be for a common date at the end of the month. The main disadvantage of a single payment date is perceived to be greater pressure on cashflow. Different payment dates has the advantage of spreading the demand on cashflow. Retaining the current dates, but having a single date for penalties is generally perceived to be unnecessarily complex. Nevertheless, a few see merit in the idea as it would ease pressure in times of cashflow difficulties. Statements Businesses value statements for two reasons. They enable businesses to 1) check that their transactions have been received and correctly processed by Inland Revenue and 2) check whether they have incurred any penalties. The value that businesses get from the current statements is significantly hampered by their perceived complexity and lack of timeliness. FINAL REPORT PAGE 3 colmar brunton One statement that covers all revenues does not appeal unless it is accompanied by other changes such as having one payment date (and in this case the statement would need to be monthly). Even so, some businesses would object to tax revenues being amalgamated on a statement as they operate separate filing systems for the different tax revenues. Amalgamating tax revenues Larger employers advocate the amalgamation of all tax revenues so that the business pays set monthly amounts (via automatic payment). A reconciliation process would be required on an annual or more frequent basis. GST and provisional tax Filing frequencies Businesses are strongly reluctant to consider less frequent filing of GST returns as they fear becoming less disciplined in doing their tax bookwork and are concerned that they will be tempted to spend the money for other purposes. Some businesses favour more frequent provisional tax returns and payments as it has the potential to ease cashflow difficulties (i.e. there is less temptation to spend the money on other things). However, others feel that this could potentially worsen their cashflow situation as shorter provisional tax periods mean a higher probability that a tax period will include a month or two with high income levels. Filing GST six monthly or annually, but with monthly automatic payments does not appeal because businesses dislike the uncertainty that would be introduced by the need to reconcile at the end of the period. Tying provisional tax to GST Businesses with significant seasonal or cyclical variations in their business income strongly favour the concept of paying provisional tax and GST together by using last year’s tax liability and total sales to determine a rate for paying provisional tax in the current year. The main reservation with this concept relates to whether turnover on its own sufficiently reflects profit. Some would like to see labour costs, large asset sales, shareholder payments and interest on loans brought into the equation. Nevertheless, both tax agents and businesses generally agree that the proposed system is superior to the current system of provisional tax payments. Further, there is an acknowledgement that changing the concept to incorporate other costs could be overly complex and defeat the initial intent. A common suggestion is to remove the safe harbour component by replacing the 105% in the formula with 100%. Voluntary provisional tax payments in first year of business Paying provisional tax payments in the first year of business in return for a discount holds appeal as it removes the ‘double hit’ businesses face in their second year of business when they have to pay income tax for the first year and commence provisional tax payments for the second year. The strength of the FINAL REPORT PAGE 4 colmar brunton appeal depends on the size of the discount. The main perceived problem with this concept is the difficulty a business will have in estimating their first year’s income. PAYE and FBT Using a payroll company Small employers see little benefit in using a payroll company. They feel that it would take just as long to prepare the information for the payroll company as it would to do the entire task themselves. Paying PAYE every two months Some small employers like the idea of paying PAYE on a two monthly basis as this is perceived to result in less paperwork. Conversely, others including tax agents feel there is a danger in businesses being less disciplined in their bookwork if returns only have to be filed every two months. Incorporating fringe benefit information on EMS Larger employers favour incorporating fringe benefit information with the employer monthly schedule to enable Inland Revenue to take responsibility for doing the complex calculations, but only if Inland Revenue provide documentation that explicitly shows how the fringe benefit tax was derived. Advisory Service Inland Revenue’s advisory service is well regarded. However, the key issue is lack of follow-up support. Businesses would also like to see Inland Revenue being proactive in offering the service in a range of situations. These include instances when a business makes a mistake in their GST return and when new initiatives are introduced. E-enablement Transacting electronically There is much support, and in some cases enthusiasm, for Inland Revenue’s direction in the area of e-enablement. Even among those that do not currently see electronic transactions as appropriate or relevant to their business, many are resigned to this being the way of the future. Key barriers to transacting electronically include lack of hardware and software capability, a lack of knowledge and confidence in using computers generally as well as a lack of understanding of how the options work, for example, whether an ir-file user can review a file after they have sent it. There is a number of ways in which Inland Revenue can support and encourage businesses to transact electronically. These include offering an advisory service whereby an Inland Revenue staff person provides training on the new products (and if necessary set their computer up to facilitate the task), providing Inland Revenue approved software packages, and assurances about security. Corresponding on-line Corresponding on-line with Inland Revenue staff appeals strongly to some small businesses. The main benefit is time related; users can avoid Call Centre waiting times and can correspond outside of Call Centre hours. There is an expectation that a question would be acknowledged immediately and usually answered within 24 or 48 hours, and a desire for the Inland Revenue person responding to the email to provide their contact details should a follow-up telephone call be required. FINAL REPORT PAGE 5 colmar brunton Agents are less keen on corresponding on-line principally because they are satisfied with their alternatives of the Agentline and their Account Manager. Also, tax agents are not likely to be strong advocates of their clients corresponding with Inland Revenue on-line as some agents discourage direct contact with Inland Revenue of any type. Accessing account information on-line This option also holds considerable appeal for some as it is perceived to have the potential to provide more up-to-date information than the current statements. For this option to be implemented effectively, however, businesses urge Inland Revenue to present the information in a simple and clear way (in contrast to the current statements). On-line tools for complex calculations Reaction to this concept is somewhat mixed. On the one hand, access to a mechanism that provides a binding decision is appealing. However, businesses and tax agents are unsure about the reliability of such tools, especially the ability of the tools to cope with a multitude of individual circumstances and scenarios. Unpaid tax collector role There are three areas in which Inland Revenue can better recognise the unpaid job that businesses do in collecting GST and PAYE on behalf of the Government: penalties and interest; service delivery; and ways of showing appreciation. Penalties and interest The ideal penalties and interest system recognises taxpayers’ past histories, rewards taxpayers who exhibit ‘good behaviour’, assumes taxpayers are innocent until proven guilty, educates people who make ‘honest’ mistakes rather than punishing them, is flexible enough to cater for special circumstances, and has appropriate systems in place to encourage people to comply. Practical examples of these principles are a type of credit rating which allows the taxpayer to ‘slip up’ once or twice if their past history has been good, tax discounts for on-time payment, and Inland Revenue sending businesses email reminders. The new system (encompassing both the April and December changes) is considered to be more lenient and is therefore generally well received. Small businesses particularly like the allowance for filing one employer monthly schedule late. One aspect disliked is the $250 late filing penalty for any subsequent schedule filed late within 12 months. Businesses feel that the $250 is too high for small businesses and too low for large businesses. The penalty should be proportional to the size of the business. Service delivery Businesses feel that Inland Revenue can better recognise their role as an unpaid tax collector by offering businesses the following: • Advisory visits (not just new businesses) • Seminars • Account Managers • The full name of the Inland Revenue staff person when a business calls Inland Revenue. Showing appreciation to small businesses FINAL REPORT PAGE 6 colmar brunton Businesses have many suggestions for how Inland Revenue can show their appreciation of small businesses. Participants in this research were most enthusiastic about pre-paid envelopes, a fairer penalty and interest regime, a ‘thank you’ letter, and some form of tax discount. End of year adjustments/costs Tax agents favour: • increasing the threshold below which trading stock does not have to be valued from $5,000 to around $10,000 • increasing the threshold below which new assets can be expensed from $200 to $500 or $1,000. Tax agents see little benefit in the introduction of a threshold whereby if a business’s combined value of debtors and creditors fell below it, they would not be required to adjust for it in their end-of-year tax calculations. Some tax agents believe a more pertinent issue is the period of time that needs to have passed before bad debt can be written off. They also see no benefit in a concept whereby shareholder employees, partners etc stop filing returns if their income is subject to withholding tax by the parent entity. This is because tax agents tend to do both the company and shareholder returns at the same time (and then lump any amounts together and write one cheque to the company). They are also perplexed as to how they would know what rate to deduct the withholding tax at as they would not know the tax rate of the end-recipient. Tax agent issues Tax agents are frustrated with a number of aspects of Inland Revenue’s processes that result in a waste of their time (and their clients’ time). Examples include Inland Revenue transferring amounts into the wrong period and wrong accounts, NOPAs (Notices of Proposed Adjustments) not being processed as requested, and incorrect statements of account and assessment. Likewise, there are a number of policies that cause frustration. For example, the rules that apply to amending returns (e.g. GST returns). Because of the cost and effort required to amend GST returns, tax agents sometimes recommend their clients ignore the error, rectify it in the next return, and hope that an Inland Revenue audit doesn’t pick it up. Tax agents suggest a number of ways in which Inland Revenue can better support them. These include greater ability to transact with Inland Revenue electronically, more agents meetings and seminars, and for their Account Manager to make personal visits. FINAL REPORT PAGE 7 colmar brunton Conclusions Research recommendations will be formulated once the quantitative phase of this research project has been completed. However, the qualitative research points to a number of issues that we feel are pertinent to address here - in particular, the factors involved in a successful programme of change. A number of opportunities exist to reduce tax-related compliance costs This research indicates that there is a number of proposed initiatives with strong appeal. For example: • Tying GST to provisional tax • E-enablement products • Having one payment date per month • Transferring the responsibility of calculating FBT to Inland Revenue. (The quantitative research will provide clearer direction on the size of these opportunities). These initiatives appear to have the potential to significantly reduce the tax compliance costs of small businesses in terms of time, cost and worry. Other ideas, such as prepaid envelopes, may not involve big changes to the tax system, but are gestures of goodwill that have the potential to make a positive impact on small businesses’ perceptions of Inland Revenue including the value that they perceive the Department places on the small business community. This research has highlighted a number of key challenges for Inland Revenue in implementing a programme of change. Indeed, we believe the following issues are critical to the success of the programme. Small businesses desire flexibility A strong theme in this research is the desire for Inland Revenue to be flexible. “Flexibility...you can’t have strict down the line rules because there is always something that fits outside of them and there is always a situation that occurs in businesses that throws all the good plans out the window.” (Small business) Flexibility is also about recognising that small businesses are not all alike. They differ not only in terms of the physical and financial characteristics of their business, but also in terms of the approaches they take to their bookwork and their levels of confidence, knowledge and anxiety. This has a number of implications. First and foremost, small businesses (and tax agents) call for new initiatives to be optional. Providing options is not just about acknowledging that new initiatives may not meet the business needs of some businesses. It also recognises that some businesses are strongly resistant to change because the current system is familiar and they are fearful of any change. (The types of support that these businesses require in taking on new initiatives are different to those required by businesses that are keen to embrace change; this is addressed later in this section). Herein lies a dilemma. Whilst businesses demand options, there is a real danger of overwhelming businesses with ‘yet more options’. This could lead to businesses feeling like the ‘load’ is heavier than it FINAL REPORT PAGE 8 colmar brunton was before the changes (this is a fear of the Reassurance Seekers and the Reluctant Acceptors). Inland Revenue will need to consider these opposing tensions carefully for each proposed initiative. Different needs require different types of support Further, for any initiatives to be implemented successfully, Inland Revenue must deliver different types and levels of support to cater for different needs. Small businesses vary in the level of anxiety they experience in dealing with tax and Inland Revenue and the extent to which they feel their relationship with Inland Revenue is an equal one versus Inland Revenue being in control. This is also closely linked to the extent to which businesses embrace or resist change. Four different sets of small business needs are illustrated in the following diagram. Let’s take the Reassurance Seeker as an example. These businesses lack knowledge and confidence in dealing with tax. Hence, they tend to be quite dependent on their tax agent. Although resistant to change, because they fear not being able to cope, the Reassurance Seeker can see potential benefits to their business in a number of the proposed initiatives. However, to cope with taking up these initiatives they will need to be walked through the change process step by step. Their driving need to is to feel supported and reassured in the process of change. One of the best ways that this can be achieved is via a face-to-face visit from an Inland Revenue person. In this way, Inland Revenue can build the Reassurance Seeker’s confidence and show that the Department is willing to listen. Not all businesses will need or want advisory visits, for example the Outcome Focused. However, this research indicates that the need appears to be greater than the current service currently caters for. This research therefore has significant implications in term of expanding Inland Revenue’s Advisory service. FINAL REPORT PAGE 9 colmar brunton In addition, there may be a need to upskill Advisory service staff to be able to effectively assist businesses with the e-enablement initiatives. FINAL REPORT PAGE 10 colmar brunton Background and Objectives Inland Revenue, in partnership with Treasury, is embarking on a major exploration into ways of reducing the compliance costs of small businesses. This exploration is at the request of the Minister of Revenue and is in line with Inland Revenue’s Statement of Intent; in particular that Inland Revenue’s desired future involve taxpayers meeting their obligations of their own accord – and Inland Revenue making this easy. From previous research, Inland Revenue has identified the following areas where compliance cost reductions could be made for small business: 1. The time involved in completing the sheer volume of returns and payments that businesses must send to Inland Revenue each year (steady state activity) 2. The ‘one-off’ processes and services that Inland Revenue provides when business start or stop ongoing operations (exceptions to steady state) 3. Concern that the penalties and interest regime don’t have regard to the businesses (generally good) compliance history, or acknowledge their “unpaid tax collector” role 4. Prompt access to knowledgeable Inland Revenue inquiry services staff 5. Greater ability to transact tax business electronically 6. The costs incurred in acquiring accounting services for year-end Income Tax return filing. These costs are primarily incurred for the precise profit determination required by tax law, but this level of accuracy is often superfluous to small business information needs. It is envisaged that a comprehensive approach and mix of interventions will be required including improvements to administrative processes and greater use of electronic technology, as well as legislative changes. Inland Revenue are undertaking a consultation process with the business community to seek their input. Primary research with businesses and tax agents is one component of this consultation process. Inland Revenue have commissioned colmar brunton to undertake two primary research phases: qualitative and quantitative research with both small businesses and tax agents. The broad objectives of both phases of the research are to: 1. understand and prioritise common tax-related compliance cost issues, as perceived by small business operators 2. identify and discuss possible solutions to those small business tax-related compliance cost problems 3. understand compliance cost problems specific to those business operators who have recently ended or set up a new operation or entity 4. identify barriers to the implementation of new electronic solutions to be offered by Inland Revenue, and how these might be overcome 5. determine probable take up rates of any solutions that Inland Revenue is able to offer to reduce compliance costs. Note, the prioritisation of tax-related compliance cost issues and an estimation of the probable take-up rates of specific initiatives will be addressed in the quantitative research phase. FINAL REPORT PAGE 11 colmar brunton This report presents the findings of the qualitative research phase. FINAL REPORT PAGE 12 colmar brunton Research Methodology This research was carried out using a number of qualitative research methods: • Mini-groups of businesses • Mini-groups of businesses and tax agents (where possible, a case-study approach was used whereby both a business and their agent participated) • Solution workshops • Individual interviews with tax agents 1 . Mini-groups consisted of between two and five research participants. Solution workshops consisted of between four and eight research participants. Research participants were recruited using lists provide by Inland Revenue. In total, the research consisted of 11 mini-groups, five solution workshops, and five individual interviews. Details of the sample are provided in the table below. Business Type Number of mini- groups Number of solution workshops GST registered payers (between $100,000 and $1 million turnover) 2 1 Larger employers paying FBT (between 5 and 25 employees) 2 1 Small employers (less than six employees) 2 1 Annual return filers 2 1 Recent entry (new employer since or new GST registrant since early 1999) 2 1 Recent exit (businesses that ceased being employer since early 1999) 1 Total 11 5 All groups were up to 2½ hours in length and were conducted by senior, experienced qualitative researchers from colmar brunton. The qualitative fieldwork was carried out between 31 October and 27 November 2002 in the following areas: • Whangarei • Auckland • Napier • Wairarapa • Upper Hutt • Wellington 1 The purpose of these individual interviews with tax agents was twofold. First to test the respondent understanding and interpretation of the draft questionnaire for the quantitative phase in a qualitative setting, and second to check for any additional tax agent issues not already elicited in the qualitative research or covered in the survey questionnaire. FINAL REPORT PAGE 13 colmar brunton • Christchurch • Ashburton • Timaru. As qualitative research involves relatively small sample sizes and non-random sampling, it provides indicative findings only. The second phase of this research consists of quantitative research. This stage will statistically extrapolate key findings from the qualitative research to the wider population of interest.
