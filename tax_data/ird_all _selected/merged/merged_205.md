CLASSIFIED PUBLIC Standard practice statement SPS 16/06 Disputes resolution process commenced by a taxpayer INTRODUCTION Standard Practice Statements describe how the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) will exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. This Standard Practice Statement (“SPS”) discusses a taxpayer’s rights and responsibilities in respect of an assessment or other disputable decision when the taxpayer commences the disputes resolution process. Unless specified otherwise, all legislative references in this SPS refer to the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“TAA”). Where the Commissioner commences the disputes resolution process, the Commissioner’s practice is stated in SPS 16/06: Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. The Commissioner regards this SPS as a reference guide for taxpayers and Inland Revenue officers. Where possible, Inland Revenue officers must follow the practices outlined in this SPS. The disputes resolution process is designed to ensure that there is a full and frank communication between the parties in a structured way within strict time limits for the legislated phases of the process. The disputes resolution process is designed to encourage an “all cards on the table” approach and the resolution of issues without the need for litigation. It aims to ensure that all the relevant evidence, facts and legal arguments are canvassed before a case goes to a court. This SPS has been updated to include minor amendments to the ”response period” as defined in the TAA, and also the introduction of the new communications framework contained in sections 14 to 14G. Where the legislation requires notification of something in terms of section 14C, this statement is written in terms of that notice being “in writing”. The new communications framework requires that the notice be delivered by way of post, by personal delivery, by electronic means or by facsimile. The use of the term “in writing” is not intended to imply that delivery is limited to being by post. For further explanation of the new communications framework, refer to Tax Information Bulletin Vol.28 No. 7 (August 2016). WITHDRAWN - replaced by SPS 23/01 CLASSIFIED PUBLIC In accordance with the objectives of the disputes resolution process, the Commissioner (unless a statutory exception applies under section 89C or 89N must go through the disputes resolution process before the Commissioner can issue an assessment. APPLICATION This SPS applies from 10 October 2016 and incorporates legislative changes to the disputes process enacted in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015-16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Act 2016, and also the Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Act 2016 which introduced the new communications framework. It replaces SPS 11/06: Disputes resolution process commenced by a taxpayer dated 13 October 2011. STANDARD PRACTICE Background 1.The tax dispute resolution procedures were introduced in accordance with the recommendations of the Richardson Committee in the Report of the Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Department (April 1994) and were designed to reduce the number of disputes by: Précis of changes to SPS 11/06 Apart from what are general style and grammar changes, this SPS incorporates the new definition of “response period” contained in section 89AB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“the TAA”). It also includes changes as a result of the introduction of the communications framework contained in sections 14 to 14G of the TAA. Some of the examples given in the SPS have also been updated. How these changes impact on the Statement: There are changes to the definition of “response period” in cases where a disputant’s NOPA or SOP is received late but it is determined that exceptional circumstances exist. Where the Commissioner or the Courts accept that exceptional circumstances exist, the response period will commence from the day on which the Commissioner issues a notice in favour of the taxpayer, or the day on which a taxpayer’s challenge to the Commissioner’s refusal under section 89K(4) is finally judged successful by the Taxation Review Authority (or the day the Commissioner concedes). This aspect was not covered by the previous SPS. The new sections 14 to 14G of the TAA provide a legislative framework that facilitates information flows between the Commissioner and a person, and between two persons where the tax legislation governs that interaction. At the same time as introducing the new provisions, existing terminology referring to specific modes of communication was also changed to reflect the wording of the new framework. The previous SPS contained a number of references to certain informal or administrative communications that are not specifically provided for in the legislation. Where practical and appropriate, the new SPS is written to reflect wording that is consistent with the law. For example, in various places the previous SPS used the word “inform” to describe the communication between the Commissioner and a taxpayer. However, often the law does not require such communication. This is an administrative process. The word “inform” is covered by section 14B of the TAA. As such, the new SPS uses the word “advise”. This avoids any confusion as to whether this communication is a legislative requirement. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC (a) promoting full disclosure, and (b) encouraging the prompt and efficient resolution of tax disputes, and (c) promoting the early identification of issues, and (d) improving the accuracy of decisions. 2.The disputes resolution process ensures that there is full and frank communication between the parties in a structured way within strict time limits for the legislated phases of the process. 3.The disputes resolution process is designed to encourage an “all cards on the table” approach and the resolution of issues without the need for litigation. It aims to encourage as far as practicable, the disclosure of all relevant evidence, facts, issues and propositions of law before a case proceeds to a court or hearing authority. 4.The early resolution of a dispute is intended to be achieved through a series of steps specified in the TAA. The main elements of those steps are the issue of: (a)A notice of proposed adjustment (“NOPA”): this is a notice that either the Commissioner or taxpayer issues to the other advising that an adjustment is sought in relation to the taxpayer’s assessment, the Commissioner’s assessment or other disputable decision (the prescribed form is the IR 770 Notice of proposed adjustment). A NOPA is the formal document which begins the disputes process. (b)A notice of response (“NOR”): this must be issued by the recipient of a NOPA if they disagree with it (the preferred form is the IR 771 Notice of response). (c)A notice rejecting the Commissioner’s NOR: this must be issued by the taxpayer if they disagree with the Commissioner’s NOR (there is no prescribed form for a notice rejecting the Commissioner’s NOR). (d) A disclosure notice and statement of position (“SOP”): the issue of a disclosure notice by the Commissioner triggers the requirement for the taxpayer to provide a SOP to continue the dispute. Each SOP must provide an outline of the facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law with sufficient details to support the positions taken. Each party must issue a SOP (the preferred form is the IR 773 Statement of position). The SOPs are important documents because they limit the issues and propositions of law that either party can rely on if the case proceeds to court to what is included in the SOPs (unless a hearing authority makes an order that allows a party to raise new issues and propositions of law under section 138G(2)). 5.There are also two administrative phases in the disputes process: the conference and adjudication phases. If the dispute has not been already resolved after the NOR phase, the Commissioner’s practice will be to hold a conference. A conference can be a formal or informal discussion between the parties to clarify and, if possible, resolve the issues. 6.If the dispute remains unresolved after the conference phase and the exchange of SOPs, the Commissioner will usually refer the dispute to WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC adjudication, except in limited circumstances. Adjudication involves Inland Revenue independently considering a dispute and is the final phase in the disputes process before the taxpayer’s assessment is amended (if it is to be amended) following the exchange of the SOPs. 7.Timely progression of disputes through the disputes process may require the use of the Commissioner’s information-gathering powers (particularly section 17) before and/or during the disputes process. 8.Inland Revenue has a quality assurance review process known as Core Task Assurance (“CTA”) which is designed to ensure that key pieces of work (including NORs and SOPs) are subject to an independent review by Legal and Technical Services before being issued. Given the importance of the disputes process to the Commissioner and to taxpayers, Inland Revenue officers are required to get CTA approval of disputes documents prior to issue.

Any failure to meet these administrative timeframes will not invalidate subsequent actions of the Commissioner or prevent the case from going through the disputes process. Paragraph in the SPS Key actions Indicative timeframes The taxpayer’s NOPA 29, 38, 50, 61 and 69 A taxpayer’s response period for issuing a NOPA in respect of an assessment or other disputable decision. Within four months from the date that the assessment or other disputable decision is issued. 95 The Commissioner forwards and assigns the taxpayer’s NOPA to the responsible officer. Usually within five working days after the taxpayer’s NOPA is received. 97 The Commissioner acknowledges the receipt of the taxpayer’s NOPA (either by telephone or in writing). Usually within 10 working days after the taxpayer’s NOPA is received. 98 The Commissioner advises that the taxpayer’s NOPA is deficient, but the applicable response period has not expired. Immediately after the Inland Revenue officer becomes aware of the deficiency. 116 The Commissioner considers the application of section 89K, where a taxpayer’s NOPA has been issued outside the applicable response period. The Commissioner will advise the taxpayer of the outcome within one month of receipt of the disputant’s “late” notice. If the application is rejected, a refusal notice will be issued. The Commissioner’s NOR 132 The Commissioner advises the taxpayer (either by telephone or in writing) whether the Commissioner intends to issue a NOR. Usually within 10 working days before the response period for the taxpayer to issue a NOPA expires. 131 The Commissioner has issued and the taxpayer has received a NOR. Within two months starting on the date that the taxpayer’s NOPA is issued. The taxpayer’s written rejection of the Commissioner’s NOR 152 The Commissioner confirms whether the taxpayer will reject the Commissioner’s NOR. Usually two weeks before the response period for the Commissioner’s NOR expires. 153 The taxpayer rejects the Commissioner’s NOR in writing. Within two months after the date that the Commissioner’s NOR is issued. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 154 Inland Revenue forwards the taxpayer’s rejection of the Commissioner’s NOR to the responsible officer. Usually within five working days after receiving the taxpayer’s rejection. 154 The Commissioner acknowledges receipt of the taxpayer’s rejection of the Commissioner’s NOR. Usually within 10 working days after receiving the taxpayer’s rejection. 151 The taxpayer is deemed to accept the Commissioner’s NOR, because they have failed to reject it within the applicable response period and none of the reasons in section 89K apply. At the end of the two-month period starting on the date of issue of the Commissioner’s NOR. 155 The Commissioner will advise the taxpayer in writing that they are deemed to accept the Commissioner’s NOR. Within two weeks after the response period for the Commissioner’s NOR has ended. Conference phase 166 The Commissioner will write to the taxpayer to initiate the conference phase and to offer a facilitated conference. The Commissioner’s offer of a facilitated conference will be made in writing within one month after the Commissioner receives the taxpayer’s rejection of the Commissioner’s NOR. The conference letter marks the start of the conference phase. 168 The taxpayer will advise Inland Revenue whether they will attend the conference meeting, and whether they will accept the conference facilitation offer. Usually within two weeks of receipt of the conference facilitation letter. If the taxpayer does not respond within this timeframe, the Inland Revenue officers involved in the dispute will contact the taxpayer about the letter. 169 When a taxpayer agrees to attend a conference meeting, Inland Revenue will contact the taxpayer to establish a timeframe, and agree on how the meeting will be conducted. Usually within two weeks following the taxpayer’s agreement to a conference. 173 Conference meeting(s) and further information exchange between Inland Revenue and the taxpayer. The suggested average timeframe of the conference phase is three months, subject to the facts and complexity of the dispute. Opt out 198 The taxpayer may seek to opt out of the disputes resolution process. Within two weeks from the end of the conference phase. 198 Inland Revenue officer will advise the taxpayer whether the request to opt out has been agreed to. Usually within two weeks from the date of the taxpayer’s request to opt out. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC Disclosure notice 230 The Commissioner advises the taxpayer that a disclosure notice will be issued.

Usually within five working days after the taxpayer’s SOP is received. 257 The Commissioner acknowledges the receipt of the taxpayer’s SOP. Usually within 10 working days after the taxpayer’s SOP is received. 257 The Commissioner advises that the taxpayer’s SOP is deficient, but the two-month response period has not expired. Inland Revenue officers will advise the taxpayer or their agent as soon as they become aware of the deficiency. 258 The Commissioner considers whether section 89K applies, where the taxpayer has issued a SOP outside the applicable response period. The Commissioner will advise the taxpayer of the outcome within one month of receipt of the disputant’s “late” SOP. If the application is rejected, a refusal notice will be issued. 259 The dispute is treated as if it was never commenced, if the taxpayer fails to issue a SOP within the applicable response period and none of the section 89K grounds apply. Usually 10 working days after the response period for the disclosure notice expires. The Commissioner’s SOP 260 The Commissioner issues a SOP in response to the taxpayer’s SOP.

ANALYSIS ASSESSMENT Taxpayer’s assessment 12.Section 92(1) reads: A taxpayer who is required to furnish a return of income for a tax year must make an assessment of the taxpayer’s taxable income and income tax liability and, if applicable for the tax year, the net loss, terminal tax or refund due. 13.Section 92(1) applies to tax on income derived in: (a) the 2005−06 and later tax years for a taxpayer whose income year matches the tax year, and (b) the corresponding income year for a taxpayer whose income year is different from the 2005−06 and later tax years. 14.If a taxpayer has to file an income tax return they must make an assessment of their taxable income and income tax liability and, if applicable, the net loss, terminal tax or refund due. The definition of disputable decision in section 3(1) includes an assessment made by a taxpayer. 15.Similar requirements apply to a taxpayer who must file a GST return under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (“the GST Act”). For a GST return WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC period that begins on or after 1 April 2005, the taxpayer must make an assessment of the amount of GST payable. Section 92B(1) reads: A taxpayer who is required under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to provide a GST tax return for a GST return period must make an assessment of the amount of GST payable by the taxpayer for the return period. 16.Pursuant to sections 92(2) and 92B(2) the assessment date for an income tax or GST assessment made by a taxpayer is the date that Inland Revenue receives the taxpayer’s tax return. 17.When the taxpayer’s assessment is received, the Commissioner’s practice is to stamp, either electronically or manually, the tax return with the date of receipt. This date is then entered into Inland Revenue’s computerised database and a return acknowledgment form is sent to the taxpayer or agent. This practice ensures that the taxpayer will have a clear record of when their assessment was made. 18.Under section 92B(3) for a GST assessment and section 92(6) for an income tax assessment, a taxpayer cannot make an assessment of the amount of tax payable for a return period in their tax return if the Commissioner has previously made an assessment of the tax that is payable for that return period. This is commonly known as a “default assessment” and involves the Commissioner making a default determination that estimates the taxpayer’s tax liability (for example, if they have missed a return filing deadline). 19.For further discussion regarding how a taxpayer can dispute a default assessment see paragraphs 32 to 44. The Commissioner’s assessment 20.Notwithstanding section 92(1) and subject to the statutory time bar in sections 108 and 108A, the Commissioner can sometimes issue a notice of assessment to a taxpayer. 21.The Commissioner cannot make an assessment without first issuing a NOPA to a taxpayer, unless an exception under section 89C to the requirement for issuing a NOPA applies. 22.The exceptions under section 89C are explained in the Appendix of this SPS. The Commissioner must ensure that any assessment is made in accordance with section 89C. However, if, on a rare occasion, an assessment was made in breach of section 89C, it w ill still be regarded as being valid under section 114(a). 23.If the Commissioner issues an assessment without first issuing a NOPA, the taxpayer can issue a NOPA to the Commissioner under section 89D(1). NOTICE OF PROPOSED ADJUSTMENT (NOPA) A taxpayer can issue a NOPA to the commissioner 24.A taxpayer can issue a NOPA to the Commissioner in the following situations: Situation 1: NOPA in respect of the Commissioner’s assessment 25.Section 89D(1) reads: WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC If the Commissioner– (a)issues a notice of assessment to a taxpayer; and (b)has not previously issued a notice of proposed adjustment to the taxpayer in respect of the assessment, whether or not in breach of section 89C,– the taxpayer may, subject to subsection (2), issue a notice of proposed adjustment in respect of the assessment. 26.When the Commissioner issues to a taxpayer a notice of assessment that does not relate to a “default assessment” (as discussed in paragraph 18) without first issuing a NOPA, the taxpayer can issue to the Commissioner a NOPA in respect of the assessment. A taxpayer’s response to a default assessment is discussed in Situation 2. 27.A taxpayer’s NOPA is not an assessment. It is an initiating action that allows open and full communication between the parties. A NOPA forms a basis for ensuring that the Commissioner does not issue an assessment without some formal and structured dialogue with the taxpayer in respect of the grounds upon which the Commissioner is issuing any assessment or amended assessment (McIlraith v CIR (2007) 23 NZTC 21,456). 28.If the Commissioner has issued an assessment the taxpayer can issue a NOPA under section 89D(1) in respect of any of the considerations that were relevant to making the assessment. This could include preliminary decisions which are necessary to make the assessment, for example, a decision made by the Commissioner under section 89C (MR Forestry (No 1) Trust Ltd v CIR (2006) 22 NZTC 19,954). 29.The taxpayer must issue the NOPA within the applicable “response period” as defined in section 89AB. Generally, this will be within the four-month period that starts on the date that the Commissioner issues the assessment unless the Commissioner accepts a late NOPA under section 89K(1). However, this response period is subject to the exception discussed in Situation 6. 30.For example, if the Commissioner’s notice of assessment is issued on 7 April 2016, under section 89D(1) the taxpayer must issue a NOPA in the prescribed form in respect of the assessment on or before 6 August 2016. 31.The taxpayer’s right to issue a NOPA under section 89D(1) is unaffected, even if, in a very rare circumstance, the Commissioner made the assessment in breach of section 89C. The assessment will be deemed to be valid under section 114(a). Situation 2: NOPA in respect of the Commissioner’s default assessment 32.If a taxpayer has not filed a tax return, the Commissioner can make a default assessment under section 106(1) without first issuing a NOPA to the taxpayer. 33.Section 89D(2) reads: A taxpayer who has not furnished a return of income for an assessment period may dispute the assessment made by the Commissioner only by furnishing a return of income for the assessment period. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 34.A taxpayer that intends to dispute a default assessment through the disputes process must: (a)pursuant to section 89D(2) provide a tax return for the period to which the default assessment relates notwithstanding that the tax return cannot include the taxpayer’s assessment (section 89D(2A)), and (b)issue a NOPA to the Commissioner in respect of the default assessment within the applicable response period. Generally, this will be within the four-month period that starts on the date that the Commissioner issues the default assessment. 35.Similar rules apply to a NOPA that a taxpayer issues in respect of a GST default assessment. 36.Section 89D(2C) reads: A taxpayer who has not provided a GST tax return for a GST return period may not dispute the assessment made by the Commissioner other than by providing a GST return for the GST return period. 37.Where a taxpayer has not filed a GST return, the Commissioner can make a GST default assessment without first issuing a NOPA to the taxpayer. 38.If a taxpayer wants to dispute a GST default assessment through the disputes process, they must: (a) provide a GST return for the periods to which the GST default assessment relates pursuant to section 89D(2C), notwithstanding that the tax return cannot include the taxpayer’s assessment (section 89D(2D)), and (b) issue a NOPA to the Commissioner in respect of the GST default assessment, within the applicable response period. That is, within four months from the date that the default assessment is issued. 39.The legislative requirement to provide a tax return in respect of a default assessment made by the Commissioner when issuing a NOPA is an additional requirement of the disputes process. This ensures that the taxpayer has provided the requisite statutory information before they dispute the assessment. 40.If the Commissioner agrees with taxpayer’s tax return and NOPA, the Commissioner will amend the default assessment by exercising the discretion under section 113 subject to the statutory time bar in section 108 or 108A and any other relevant limitations on the exercise of that discretion. 41.However, if the Commissioner disagrees with the taxpayer’s tax return and NOPA the Commissioner cannot amend the default assessment. Instead, the Commissioner must issue a NOR to the taxpayer within the relevant response period to continue the disputes process. 42.The taxpayer cannot commence a dispute or challenge proceedings in a hearing authority by simply filing the tax return to which the default assessment relates. The taxpayer must issue a NOPA with their tax return. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 43.If a NOPA is not issued, the Commissioner cannot be compelled to amend the default assessment on receipt of the taxpayer’s tax return. However, the Commissioner will amend the assessment under section 113 on the basis of the information provided in the tax return subject to the statutory time bar in section 108 and any other relevant limitations on the exercise of that discretion if this would ensure that the assessment was correct. (See SPS 16/01: Requests to amend assessments for further details.) Any amended assessment will be the Commissioner’s assessment in this circumstance. 44.The Commissioner can decide not to amend the default assessment by exercising the discretion under section 113 on the basis of the tax return provided. Situation 3: NOPA in respect of a deemed assessment made under section 80H 45.Section 89D(2B) reads: A taxpayer to whom section 80F applies who has not furnished an amended income statement for an assessment period may dispute a deemed assessment under section 80H only by furnishing an amended income statement for the assessment period. 46.Section 89D(2B) applies to a taxpayer who derives income solely from salary, wages, interest and dividends and who will receive an income statement from the Commissioner under section 80D(1). 47.Generally, where the taxpayer considers that the income statement is incorrect, they must advise the Commissioner of the reasons and provide the relevant information to correct the income statement under section 80F(1). This must be done within the statutory time limit. That is, the later of: (a) the taxpayer’s terminal tax date for the tax year to which the income statement relates, and (b) two months after the date that the income statement is issued. 48.If the taxpayer does not provide the relevant information within the statutory time limit, they will be treated as having filed a tax return under section 80G(2) and made an assessment under section 80H in respect of that income statement. In this case, the date of the deemed assessment under section 80H will be the date that the statutory time limit under section 80F expires. 49.Pursuant to section 89D(2B), the taxpayer cannot issue to the Commissioner a NOPA in respect of the deemed assessment made under section 80H without first satisfying their statutory obligation to file an amended income statement for the assessment period. 50.If a taxpayer wants to dispute a deemed assessment under section 80H, they must: (a) provide an amended income statement for the assessment period, and (b) issue a NOPA to the Commissioner in respect of the assessment within the applicable response period (that is, four months after the date that the deemed assessment is issued.) WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC Situation 4: NOPA in respect of a disputable decision that is not an assessment 51.Under section 89D(3) a taxpayer can issue a NOPA in respect of a disputable decision that is not an assessment. Section 89D(3) reads: If the Commissioner– (a)issues a notice of disputable decision that is not a notice of assessment; and (b)the notice of disputable decision affects the taxpayer, – the taxpayer, or any other person who has the standing under a tax law to do so on behalf of the taxpayer, may issue a notice of proposed adjustment in respect of the disputable decision. 52.For the purpose of section 89D(3) a person with standing under a tax law to issue a NOPA on behalf of the taxpayer includes a tax advisor and an approved advisor group. 53.Section 3(1) defines a “disputable decision” to include: (b)a decision of the Commissioner under a tax law, except for a decision – (i)to decline to issue a binding ruling under Part 5A; or (ii)that cannot be the subject of an objection under Part 8; or (iii)that cannot be challenged under Part 8A; or (iv)to issue a Commissioner's notice of proposed adjustment under section 89B, a Commissioner's disclosure notice or statement of position under section 89M, or a challenge notice. 54.A “decision of the Commissioner under a tax law” generally refers to a tax law that specifically confers a discretion or power on the Commissioner. Paragraph (b)(iii) excludes from the definition of “disputable decision” any decision that cannot be challenged under Part 8A. 55.For example, if the Commissioner: (a) decides not exercise the discretion under section 113 to amend a taxpayer’s income tax assessment, or (b) makes a decision under section 108A(3) regarding the application of the time bar, or (c) does not agree to a time bar waiver under section 108B, section 138E(1)(e)(iv) (within Part 8A) provides that these decisions cannot be challenged. Therefore, these decisions are not disputable decisions for the purposes of section 89D(3). However, under section 89D(1), the taxpayer can issue a NOPA in respect of the initial assessment if the Commissioner has not previously issued a NOPA in respect of that assessment. 56.A decision made by the Commissioner under section 108(2) (to increase an assessment) is not of itself, and in the absence of an assessment, a disputable decision. Any challenge to the correctness of the decision must be brought in the context of a challenge to the assessment itself (Vinelight Nominees Ltd & Anor v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (No 2) (2005) 22 NZTC 19,519). WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 57.Paragraph (b)(iv) of the definition of “disputable decision” in section 3(1) also excludes a decision to issue a Commissioner's notice of proposed adjustment under section 89B, a Commissioner's disclosure notice or statement of position under section 89M, or a challenge notice. 58.However, a taxpayer may challenge the Commissioner’s refusal to accept a late NOPA, NOR of SOP in terms of section 89K(6) in the Taxation Review Authority. The Commissioner’s refusal notice is treated for the limited purposes in section 89K(6) as a notice of disputable decision and subject to direct challenge to the Taxation Review Authority, without the need to commence the dispute with a NOPA. 59.The exceptions specified in paragraph (b) of the definition of “disputable decision” ensure that only substantive issues are disputed as disputable decisions and the procedural components of the disputes process do not, in themselves, give rise to disputes although they may be amenable to judicial review. 60.The following examples illustrate what is a disputable decision: (a) A taxpayer who is a natural person can dispute the Commissioner’s decision made under section YD 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (“ITA 2007”) that they are a New Zealand resident for taxation purposes. (b) Under section RD 3(5) of the ITA 2007, the Commissioner can determine whether, and to what extent, a payment is subject to PAYE. This determination cannot be challenged by the taxpayer and, therefore, is excluded from the definition of “disputable decision” under section 3(1)(b)(iii). However, an employer or employee can dispute an assessment of tax deductions on the basis that a section RD 3(5) determination on which it is founded is wrong in fact or law. 61.The taxpayer must issue the NOPA to the Commissioner within the applicable response period. Generally, this will be within the four-month period that starts on the date that the Commissioner issues the notice of disputable decision or notice revoking or varying a disputable decision that is not an assessment unless the Commissioner allows a late NOPA under section 89K(1). 62.It is important to note that issuing a NOPA is not the only way that a taxpayer can raise concerns about a disputable decision that they consider is incorrect. They are quite entitled to engage with Inland Revenue to raise concerns about a disputable decision that has been reached or to provide additional information. 63.However, it is only by issuing a NOPA that a taxpayer can dispute a disputable decision through the disputes process. Situation 5: NOPA in respect of a taxpayer’s assessment 64.Section 89DA(1) reads: A taxpayer may issue a notice of proposed adjustment in respect of an assessment made by the taxpayer for a tax year or a GST return period if the Commissioner has not previously issued a notice of proposed adjustment to the taxpayer in respect of the assessment. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 65.If a taxpayer needs to file an income tax return they must also make an assessment of their taxable income and income tax liability under section 92(1) unless the Commissioner has previously made an assessment for that tax year (section 92(6)). 66.Section 89DA(1) also applies to a taxpayer’s GST assessment for a return period. A taxpayer who has to file a GST return must also make an assessment of the amount of GST payable for the return period under section 92B(1). 67.The date on which a taxpayer’s assessment of income tax is made is the date on which the taxpayer's return of income is received at an office of Inland Revenue (section 92(2)). A taxpayer’s assessment of the amount of GST payable is made on the date on which the taxpayer’s GST tax return is received at an office of Inland Revenue (section 92B(2)). 68.Pursuant to section 89DA(1), a taxpayer can issue to the Commissioner a NOPA in respect of their own tax assessment. 69.The taxpayer’s NOPA must be issued within the applicable response period as defined in section 89AB. Generally, this will be within the four-month period that starts on the date that the Commissioner receives the taxpayer’s assessment unless the Commissioner allows a late NOPA under section 89K(1). 70.The date that the Commissioner receives the taxpayer’s assessment will be determined under section 14B. For example, under section 14B(8), the Commissioner will receive a NOPA that the taxpayer sends by post on the date that it would have been delivered in the ordinary course of post. Contents of a taxpayer’s NOPA 71.A NOPA is the document that commences the disputes process. It is intended to identify the true points of contention and explain the legal or technical aspects of the issuer’s position in relation to the proposed adjustment in a formal and understandable manner. This will ensure that information relevant to the dispute is quickly made available to the parties. Section 89F(1) and (3) specifies the content requirements for any NOPA that a taxpayer may issue. 72.Section 89F reads: (1)A notice of proposed adjustment must - (a)contain sufficient detail of the matters described in subsections (2) and (3) to identify the issues arising between the Commissioner and the disputant; and (b)be in the prescribed form. ... (3)A notice of proposed adjustment issued by a disputant must – (a)identify the adjustment or adjustments proposed to be made to the assessment; and (b)provide a statement of the facts and the law in sufficient detail to advise the Commissioner of the grounds for the disputant's proposed adjustment or adjustments; and (c)state how the law applies to the facts; and WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC (d)include copies of the documents of which the disputant is aware at the time that the notice is issued that are significantly relevant to the issues arising between the Commissioner and the disputant. 73.The prescribed form for a NOPA as required under section 89F(1)(b) is the IR770 Notice of proposed adjustment form that can be found on Inland Revenue’s website: www.ird.govt.nz. A handwritten NOPA in this form is acceptable. Additional information can also be attached to the prescribed form. 74.If the Commissioner receives a NOPA that is not in the prescribed form or has insufficient detail under section 89F(1)(a) the Commissioner’s practice will be to advise the taxpayer that the NOPA must be in the prescribed form or include sufficient information. If this occurs on the last day of the response period the Commissioner will consider any resubmitted NOPA under section 89K(1) (see paragraph 106). 75.If the taxpayer’s NOPA does not satisfy the content requirements under section 89F(1)(a) and (3) the Commissioner can reject the NOPA and not issue a NOR (see paragraphs 98 to 105). 76.When issuing a NOPA, the taxpayer must state the facts and law in sufficient detail, state how the law applies to the facts, and include copies of the documents that are significantly relevant to the dispute and known to the taxpayer when they issue the NOPA. 77.The Commissioner cannot treat a tax return provided by the taxpayer as a NOPA because it will not satisfy the requirements in section 89F(1) and (3). 78.Section 89F(3)(b) requires that the taxpayer’s NOPA states the key facts and law concisely and in sufficient detail. The term “sufficient detail” means that the document must contain adequate analysis of the law and facts that are relevant to the dispute. This means sufficient discussion of the law to enable the Commissioner to clearly understand the proposed adjustment. 79.The Commissioner considers that it is necessary that the taxpayer provides “a statement of the facts and law in sufficient detail” to ensure that they have fully considered issues before they raise them in their NOPA and to reduce further administrative and compliance costs. Identify the proposed adjustment – section 89F(3)(a) 80.The taxpayer must identify the proposed adjustment in their NOPA. This includes for each proposed adjustment: (a) the amount or impact of the adjustment, and (b) the tax year or period to which the proposed adjustment relates. 81.The proposed adjustment should be set out as specifically as possible. For example: “increase the 2016 repairs and maintenance expenditure by $3,000”; “increase the GST input tax deduction by $4,000 in the April 2016 return period”. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC Provide a statement of the facts and law in sufficient detail – section 89F(3)(b) Facts 82.To provide a brief and accurate statement of facts, the taxpayer must focus on the material factual matters relevant to the legal issues. The taxpayer must include the facts necessary for proving all the arguments raised in support of each adjustment, including any facts that are inconsistent with any argument that the Commissioner has previously raised. 83.The taxpayer should endeavour to disclose all the relevant material facts clearly and with adequate amounts of detail relative to the complexity of the issues. The taxpayer is best suited to do this because they are usually very familiar with the background and facts that relate to the dispute. Disclosing the background and facts at the NOPA phase helps to resolve the dispute at an earlier stage. However, the taxpayer should not overstate the facts with irrelevant detail or repetition. 84.In complex cases, the Commissioner expects the taxpayer to explain the relevant facts clearly and methodically. The taxpayer should also assist the Commissioner to understand the background and facts of the dispute, so as to facilitate a speedy resolution of the case. The taxpayer should explain the facts and law in sufficient detail to advise the Commissioner of the grounds for the adjustment. It is unhelpful and can cause delays if the Commissioner has to second guess the factual bases of the taxpayer’s case. 85.For example, in a dispute that involves a complex financial arrangement, the taxpayer should explain each element of it. This includes explaining the background to the financial arrangement, identifying the parties involved, highlighting the relevant clauses in an agreement, etc. Law 86.Each proposed adjustment should stipulate the relevant section or sections that the taxpayer relies on and including, if a section has multiple independent parts, the applicable subsection(s). 87.It is important that the taxpayer includes an adequate amount of analysis of the applicable legal principles or tests in their NOPA. If possible these should be supported by case authorities with full citations. For example, in a dispute that involves the tax treatment of a trade-tie payment, the taxpayer must apply the legal principles from a leading case such as Birkdale Service Station v CIR (2000) 19 NZTC 15,981. However, it is not necessary to laboriously describe large numbers of precedent cases on the same issue or include extracts from each. How the law applies to the facts - section 89F(3)(c) 88.The taxpayer must apply the legal arguments to the facts. This ensures that the proposed adjustment is not a statement that appears out of context in relation to the rest of the document. The Commissioner considers that the application of the law to the facts should logically support the proposed adjustment and be stated clearly and in detail. 89.The taxpayer should present the materials and arguments on which they intend to rely or on which reliance will be placed. That is, if more than one WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC argument supports the same or a similar outcome, all arguments should be made and supported by evidence. For each proposition of law, it is recommended that the NOPA makes a clear link to an outline of supporting facts. Include copies of the relevant documents that support the adjustment – section 89F(3)(d) 90.The taxpayer must provide full copies of the documents that they know are significantly relevant to the dispute and in existence when they issue the NOPA. This ensures that the Commissioner has all the relevant information necessary to respond to the NOPA. 91.For example: (a) A taxpayer proposes an adjustment to GST input tax credits in their NOPA. The taxpayer must provide copies of the relevant tax invoices as documentary evidence in their NOPA. (b) A taxpayer’s dispute involves a sale of land transaction. The taxpayer must provide a copy of the sale and purchase agreement and other relevant correspondence between the vendor and the purchaser as documentary evidence in their NOPA. 92.In some cases, new documentary evidence can emerge, as the dispute progresses. For example, the documentation is quite old and may have been misplaced. The taxpayer may be unaware of these documents when the NOPA was issued. The parties should then exchange this new evidence when it becomes known or available. 93.Where a taxpayer is aware of a particular document that is significantly relevant to their dispute, but cannot obtain a copy of it, the taxpayer should include the following matters in their NOPA: (a) the nature of the document and its relevance to the dispute, and (b) the reasonable steps that the taxpayer has taken to obtain a copy of the document, and (c) the expected date that the document will be made available to the Commissioner. 94.However, this practice should not be treated as dispensing with the requirements under section 89F(3)(d). The Commissioner still expects the taxpayer will send copies of the relevant documents mentioned in their NOPA as soon as they become available. Receipt of a taxpayer’s NOPA 95.Inland Revenue will usually assign a taxpayer’s NOPA to the responsible officer within five working days after it is received. 96.After receiving the NOPA, the responsible officer will determine and record the following: (a) the date on which the NOPA was issued, whether the NOPA has been issued within the applicable response period and the date by which the Commissioner’s response must be issued, and WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC (b) the NOPA’s salient features including any deficiencies in its content. 97.Where practicable, Inland Revenue will advise the taxpayer or their tax agent that it has received the NOPA by telephone or in writing within 10 working days. Deficiencies in the contents of a NOPA 98.Where Inland Revenue has received a NOPA that it considers deficient (that is, the requirements under section 89F(1)(a) and (3) may not be met), the responsible Inland Revenue officer will take reasonable steps to have the taxpayer correct the information in the NOPA before the response period expires. 99.The taxpayer will be advised as soon as practicable that the Commissioner considers that the NOPA may not meet the requirements of section 89F(1)(a) and (3) and why. They will also be advised that any additional or corrected information should be provided within the response period. 100. Taxpayers are encouraged to issue their NOPA immediately after they have completed it because they could have insufficient time to rectify any deficiencies if the response period is due to expire. 101. Generally where the deficiencies are not able to be remedied but the NOPA advances sufficient argument to allow the dispute to progress, then the Commissioner will continue with the dispute. The argument that the NOPA is deficient will be incorporated into the Commissioner’s SOP and the Commissioner will also fully argue the substantive issue. 102. However, if the NOPA received is highly unsatisfactory the Commissioner is unlikely to continue with the dispute. This will be on the grounds that the NOPA does not satisfy the requirements set out in section 89F(1)(a) and (3). 103. A NOPA is likely to be considered highly unsatisfactory only where the taxpayer's position is materially inconsistent and not capable of coherent explanation, or there is no observable explanation at all of the taxpayer's grounds for dispute. In these situations the dispute will be treated as if it has never commenced (unless the taxpayer resubmits a late NOPA and the Commissioner accepts it under one of the exceptional circumstances under section 89K). 104.In considering the adequacy of the taxpayer’s NOPA, the Commissioner’s view will not be based on the strength or weakness of the taxpayer’s argument. The Commissioner will only be concerned with whether the NOPA meets its statutory requirements. 105. The approach outlined above is consistent with that taken by the Court of Appeal in CIR v Alam and Begum (2009) 24 NZTC 23,564. NOPA that a taxpayer has issued outside the applicable response period 106. The Commissioner cannot accept a NOPA that a taxpayer issues under section 89D or 89DA outside the applicable response period, unless an exceptional circumstance arises or the disputant can prove a demonstrable intention to enter into or continue the disputes process under section 89K of the TAA. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC Exceptional circumstances under section 89K 107.The legislation defines exceptional circumstances very narrowly. The cases on “exceptional circumstances”, such as Treasury Technology Holdings Ltd v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,752, Milburn NZ Ltd v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 14,005, Fuji Xerox NZ Ltd v CIR (2001) 17,470 (CA), Hollis v CIR (2005) 22 NZTC 19,570, and Balich v CIR (2007) 23 NZTC 21,230 are also relevant. The case law confirms that the Commissioner should apply the definition of “exceptional circumstances” in sections 89K(3) and 138D consistently. 108. The following guidelines have emerged from the case law: (a)a taxpayer’s misunderstanding or erroneous calculation of the applicable response period will usually not be regarded as an event or circumstance beyond the taxpayer’s control under section 89K(3)(a); (b) an agent’s failure to advise their client that they have received a notice of assessment or other relevant documents that causes the taxpayer to respond outside the applicable response period will not generally be considered to be an exceptional circumstance under section 89K(3)(b) (Hollis v CIR); and (c) an exceptional circumstance can arise if the taxpayer has relied on misleading information that the Commissioner has given them that causes them to respond outside the applicable response period (Hollis v CIR). 109. See Tax Information Bulletin Vol 8, No 3 (August 1996) for some examples of situations that can be considered “exceptional circumstances” beyond a taxpayer’s control. 110. Section 89K(3) reads: For the purpose of subsection (1),— (a)An exceptional circumstance arises if— (i)an event or circumstance beyond the control of a disputant provides the disputant with a reasonable justification for not rejecting a proposed adjustment, or for not issuing a notice of proposed adjustment or statement of position, within the response period for the notice: (ii)a disputant is late in issuing a notice of proposed adjustment, notice of response or statement of position but the Commissioner considers that the lateness is minimal, or results from 1 or more statutory holidays falling in the response period: (b)An act or omission of an agent of a disputant is not an exceptional circumstance unless— (i) it was caused by an event or circumstance beyond the control of the agent that could not have been anticipated, and its effect could not have been avoided by compliance with accepted standards of business organisation and professional conduct; or (ii) the agent is late in issuing a notice of proposed adjustment, notice of response or statement of position but the Commissioner considers that the lateness is minimal, or results from 1 or more statutory holidays falling in the response period. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 111. The statutory holiday exception is self-explanatory. The Commissioner can also accept a late NOPA where the Commissioner considers that the lateness is minimal, that is, the document was only one to two days late. 112. For example, the response period ends on a Saturday and the taxpayer provides a NOPA on the following Tuesday. The Commissioner treats the response period as ending on Monday on the basis of section 35(6) of the Interpretation Act 1999 and accepts that the lateness of the NOPA was minimal. That is, the Commissioner received the NOPA within one to two days of Monday, the last day of the response period. If the response period ended on Friday and the taxpayer provided the NOR on the following Monday, the Commissioner would also accept that the lateness is minimal. 113. Besides the degree of lateness, the Commissioner will consider the following factors when exercising the exceptional circumstances discretion under section 89K(1): (a) the date on which the NOPA w as issued, and (b) the response period within which the NOPA should be issued, and (c) the real event, circumstance or reason why the taxpayer did not issue the NOPA within the applicable response period, and (d) the taxpayer’s compliance history in relation to the tax types under consideration (for example, the taxpayer may have a history of paying tax late or filing late tax returns or NOPAs in the past). 114. For example, a taxpayer issues a NOPA to the Commissioner two days after the applicable response period has expired. The taxpayer does not provide a legitimate reason for the lateness. The taxpayer also has a history of filing late NOPAs within the minimal allowable lateness period (that is, up to two days outside the applicable response period) and has been advised on the calculation of the response period each time. 115. Although the degree of lateness was minimal each time, the Commissioner would not accept the taxpayer’s NOPA in this circumstance. This ensures that the section 89K(3)(b)(ii) exception is not treated as an extension of the response period in all circumstances. 116.The Commissioner will consider a taxpayer’s application made under section 89K(1)(b) after receiving the relevant NOPA. Where the application is rejected, the Commissioner is required to issue a “refusal notice” within one month of receipt of the application (which must include the late NOPA). The disputant may challenge the Commissioner’s refusal notice by taking proceedings directly to the TRA. Where the taxpayer’s application is accepted, the Commissioner will advise the taxpayer of the Commissioner’s decision in writing within one month after Inland Revenue receives the application. 117. If the Commissioner rejects a taxpayer’s application made under section 89K(1), the Commissioner can still consider the validity of the taxpayer’s tax position in terms of the practice for applying the discretion under section 113. See SPS 16/01: Requests to amend assessments for details of this practice. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC Demonstrable intention 118. Under section 89K(1)(a)(ii) the Commissioner can also treat a late NOPA, as being on time where the Commissioner considers that the disputant had a demonstrable intention to enter into or continue the disputes process at the time the disputant failed to act within the applicable response period. 119.The concept of “intention to dispute” reflects the court’s consideration of when a dispute should be allowed to continue under the old objection regime in Part 8 of the TAA - in particular, the High Court decision in Gisborne Mills Ltd v CIR (1989) 13 TRNZ 405. Robertson J, in Gisborne Mills, held that a factor to be taken into account in determining whether the disputant was entitled to continue with their dispute was that they had “consistently asserted that they were entitled to the \[tax outcome they were seeking\]”. This was “in marked distinction to a person who, never having contemplated seeking a benefit under the taxing legislation, endeavours to take advantage of a matter when they become aware of a decision affecting another taxpayer”. 120.The officials’ issues paper, Disputes: a review (July 2010), in relation to an “intention to dispute test”, noted: The central tenet of any test should be that the taxpayer demonstrates they have, before the deadline, clearly communicated an intention to formally dispute the matter on certain grounds and have not subsequently modified that position. 121. To support this general proposition Inland Revenue will consider the following further factors in reaching a view as to whether a taxpayer had a demonstrable intention to dispute: whether the taxpayer has responded to any Inland Revenue correspondence and has consistently asserted their contrary position regarding the substantive issues; whether the taxpayer has complied with other parts of the disputes process and their overall tax obligations (for example, if the late document in question is the taxpayer’s SOP, have they filed a timely NOR?); whether the taxpayer has corresponded with other relevant parties regarding the dispute, for example, the Minister of Revenue, the Ombudsman or Inland Revenue’s Complaints Management Service. 122. In a dispute where the taxpayer or their agent has not filed an SOP because they have miscalculated the response period (and the degree of lateness does not amount to exceptional circumstances), it could be said that having participated in the earlier stages of the disputes process (including complying with timeframes) that, at the end of the response period, the disputant had a genuine intention to continue with the dispute. 123. An application will not be accepted if the degree of lateness is unjustified in the circumstances, or it is considered to be designed to defeat the application of the time period or to frustrate the disputes process itself. An example might be a taxpayer who contacts the Commissioner close to a deadline to confirm they intend to dispute, but then does nothing further for some considerable time, effectively rendering the statutory timeframe meaningless. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC Disputant may challenge Commissioner’s refusal to accept a late NOPA 124.The Commissioner can accept a disputant’s late NOPA (and a late rejection of the Commissioner’s NOPA or late SOP) by providing written advice in favour of the disputant stating that the late notice will be treated as being given within the applicable response period. On the other hand, where they are not accepted as being on time, the Commissioner must notify the disputant within one month from when the disputant issues a “late” notice or SOP to the Commissioner, of the Commissioner’s decision (“refusal notice”). The disputant may challenge the Commissioner’s refusal notice by filing proceedings with the TRA. 125. Where the Commissioner or the TRA determines that exceptional circumstances existed, the response period is deemed to commence on the day of the decision finding favour with the disputants request for exceptional circumstances. Timeframes to complete the disputes process 126. If a taxpayer has issued a NOPA to the Commissioner and the dispute remains unresolved, when practicable, the parties should negotiate a timeframe to ensure that the dispute is progressed in a timely and efficient way. 127. Agreeing to a timeframe is not statutorily required but, rather, is a critical administrative requirement that requires both parties to be ready to progress matters. The parties should endeavour to meet the agreed timeframe. If there are delays in the progress of the dispute the responsible officer must manage the delay including any relationship with internal advisers and liaise with the taxpayer. 128. If the negotiated timeframe cannot be achieved, the Commissioner must enter into continuing discussions with the taxpayer, either to arrange a new timeframe, or otherwise keep them advised of when the disclosure notice will be issued. Therefore, the failure to negotiate or adhere to an agreed timeframe will not prevent the case from progressing through the disputes process in a timely manner. 129. In addition to the above administrative practice, the Commissioner is bound by section 89P. Section 89P provides that where the taxpayer initiated NOPA is issued after 29 August 2011, being the date of enactment of the Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Act 2011, then the Commissioner must issue a challenge notice to a disputant within four years of the issue of the disputant’s NOPA. Section 89H(3) provides that where the Commissioner fails to meet the four-year timeframe for issuing a challenge notice, then the Commissioner is deemed to have accepted the adjustments proposed in the disputant’s NOPA. 130. Under section 89P(3) the Commissioner cannot issue the challenge notice without completing the disputes process (that is, issue a SOP), unless any of the exceptions in section 89N apply. These exceptions are explained in Appendix 2 of SPS 11/05: Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or any replacement SPS. WITHDRAWNWITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC NOTICE OF RESPONSE (NOR) The commissioner’s response to a taxpayer’s NOPA: NOR 131. If the Commissioner disagrees with the taxpayer’s proposed adjustment, then, under section 89G(1) the Commissioner must advise the taxpayer that any or all of their proposed adjustments are rejected by issuing a NOR within the applicable response period. That is, within two months starting on the date that the taxpayer’s NOPA is issued. The Commissioner interprets this to mean that the taxpayer must receive the NOR within this period. For example, if a taxpayer issues a NOPA on 9 April 2010, the Commissioner must advise the taxpayer of its rejection by issuing to them a NOR and they must receive that NOR on or before 8 June 2010. 132. Where practicable, the Commissioner will make reasonable efforts to contact the taxpayer or their tax agent within 10 working days before the response period expires to advise whether the Commissioner intends to issue a NOR to them in response to their NOPA. Such contact may be made by telephone or letter. 133. The Commissioner must issue the NOR to the taxpayer (section 14F(5)(a)) or a representative authorised to act on their behalf (section 14F(5)(b)). In respect of the latter, it is a question of fact whether the recipient is authorised to receive the NOR on the taxpayer’s behalf. The taxpayer must ensure that their NOPA stipulates the name of the person or agent that they have nominated to receive any NOR issued by the Commissioner (CIR v Thompson (2007) 23 NZTC 21,375). 134.If a tax agent sends a NOPA to the Commissioner although the tax agent would appear to have authority to receive the Commissioner’s NOR, the Commissioner’s practice will be to contact the tax agent to confirm whether the agent can accept service of the NOR. 135. Section 89G(2) specifies the content requirements for a NOR. The Commissioner must state concisely in the NOR: (a) the facts or legal arguments in the taxpayer’s NOPA that the Commissioner considers are wrong; and (b) why the Commissioner considers that those facts and arguments are wrong; and (c) any facts and legal arguments that the Commissioner relies upon; and (d) how the legal arguments apply to the facts; and (e)the quantitative adjustment to any figures proposed in the taxpayer’s NOPA that results from the facts and legal arguments that the Commissioner relies upon. 136. Under section 89G(2)(e), the requirement for a quantitative adjustment establishes the extent to which the Commissioner considers that the adjustment in the taxpayer’s NOPA is incorrect. This amount need not be exact, although, every attempt should be made to ensure that it is as accurate as possible. The amount in dispute can be varied, as the dispute progresses. For example, if the parties agree on new figures at the conference phase. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 137. The Commissioner considers that Inland Revenue has a statutory obligation to advise the taxpayer adequately. Therefore, any NOR that the Commissioner issues to reject the adjustment proposed in the taxpayer’s NOPA must be relatively brief but sufficiently detailed to explain all the relevant facts, quantitative adjustments, issues and law. Deemed acceptance 138. Section 89H(2) reads: If the Commissioner does not, within the response period for a notice of proposed adjustment issued by a disputant, reject an adjustment contained in the notice, the Commissioner is deemed to accept the proposed adjustment and section 89J applies. 139. If the Commissioner issues a NOR outside the two-month response period, the Commissioner is deemed to have accepted the adjustment proposed in the taxpayer’s NOPA under section 89H(2). This will finish the dispute and the Commissioner must issue an assessment or amended assessment to the taxpayer pursuant to section 89J(1) (see the discussion in paragraphs 145 to 150). 140. However, the Commissioner is not precluded from later exercising the discretion under section 113 and issuing to the taxpayer an amended assessment that reflects another adjustment for a different issue to that previously accepted under section 89H(2) for the same tax period. 141. As discussed above, section 89H(3) provides that where the Commissioner fails to meet the 4 year timeframe for issuing a challenge notice, then the Commissioner is deemed to have accepted the adjustments proposed in the disputant’s NOPA. The Commissioner must assess the disputant incorporating the adjustments which have been deemed to be accepted: section 89J. Exception to deemed acceptance 142. Notwithstanding section 89H(2), the Commissioner can apply to the High Court for an order that a NOR can be issued outside the two-month response period under section 89L(1). Section 89L only applies if an exceptional circumstance has occurred or prevented the Commissioner from issuing a NOR to the taxpayer within the response period. The Commissioner will endeavour to apply the requirement for exceptional circumstances in section 89L(1)(a) consistently with the similar requirement in section 89K(1)(a) (see discussion in paragraphs 107 to 117). 143.Under section 89L(3), an “exceptional circumstance”: Is an event or circumstance beyond the control of the Commissioner or an officer of the Department that provides the Commissioner with a reasonable justification for not rejecting an adjustment proposed by a disputant within the response period; and 144. For example: (a) A flood damaged an Inland Revenue office during the applicable response period for a taxpayer’s NOPA. The taxpayer’s NOPA was lost in the flood. The Inland Revenue officer could not obtain another copy of the NOPA within the applicable response period. The absence of information has prevented the Commissioner from forming a view on the subject matter in dispute. The Commissioner can apply for a High Court order under section 89L for further time to issue a NOR. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC (b) The Inland Revenue officer to whom a taxpayer’s NOPA was assigned is absent on annual leave for the remainder of the response period. The Inland Revenue officer does not arrange for another officer to prepare and issue a NOR to the taxpayer within the response period. The Commissioner is deemed to accept the NOPA under section 89H(2). In this circumstance, the Commissioner does not consider that an exceptional circumstance prevented the Inland Revenue officer from rejecting the adjustment within the response period for the purpose of section 89L(1)(a). 145. The exceptions for deemed acceptance have been extended and amended in respect of disputes where the taxpayer initiated NOPA is issued after 29 August 2011, being the date of enactment of the Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Act 2011. The Commissioner can apply to the High Court for an order allowing the Commissioner to issue a challenge notice past the 4 year limitation period, where there has been an exceptional circumstance as defined in section 89L(3). The Court application must be made within the 4 year period. Implication of section 89J 146.Under section 89J(1), if the Commissioner accepts or is deemed to accept any adjustment that is proposed in a taxpayer’s NOPA, the Commissioner must include or take account of the adjustment in: (a)a notice of assessment; and (b) any further notice of assessment or amended assessment that is issued to the taxpayer unless the Commissioner has applied to the High Court for an order that a notice can be issued rejecting the proposed adjustment under section 89L(1) and (1B). 147. In this circumstance, the Commissioner’s practice will be not to later issue a NOPA that purports to reverse any proposed adjustment previously accepted under section 89H(2) because section 89J(1) prevents the Commissioner from issuing to the taxpayer a further amended assessment that does not include or take into account the previously accepted adjustment. 148.However, pursuant to section 89J(2) the Commissioner does not have to issue a notice of assessment or amended assessment that includes or takes into account an adjustment that the Commissioner has, or is deemed to have accepted, if the Commissioner considers that, in relation to the adjustment, the taxpayer: (a) was fraudulent; or (b) wilfully misled the Commissioner. 149. If the Commissioner considers that section 89J(2) applies following deemed acceptance under section 89H(2) the Commissioner cannot resume the earlier disputes process but can later issue a NOPA in respect of any of the adjustments proposed in the earlier disputes process. 150. Any opinion that the Commissioner forms under section 89J(2) must be honestly held, based on a correct understanding of the relevant grounds and reasonably justifiable on the basis of the facts and law available. An opinion WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC formed by the Commissioner under section 89J(2) is a disputable decision for the purposes of section 89D(3). REJECTION OF THE COMMISSIONER’S NOR 151.If the Commissioner has issued a NOR under section 89G(1) that rejects the adjustment proposed in the taxpayer’s NOPA, the taxpayer must notify the Commissioner that they reject the Commissioner’s NOR within the applicable response period. That is, within two months starting on the date that the Commissioner issues the NOR. Otherwise, the taxpayer is deemed to have accepted the Commissioner’s NOR under section 89H(3) and the dispute will finish. 152. The Commissioner will make reasonable efforts to contact the taxpayer or their tax agent two weeks before the response period for the Commissioner’s NOR expires to determine whether the taxpayer will reject the Commissioner’s NOR. Such contact by the Commissioner can be made by telephone or in writing. 153. The taxpayer’s notification that they reject the Commissioner’s NOR must be in writing. The written rejection must be issued within the response period. A prescribed form is not required to be used. The taxpayer does not have to expressly reject each of the rejections of proposed adjustments that are included in the Commissioner’s NOR. The taxpayer’s written rejection must simply make it clear that the taxpayer rejects the Commissioner’s NOR. 154. Where practicable, the taxpayer’s written rejection will be referred to the responsible officer within five working days after Inland Revenue has received it and acknowledged as received within 10 working days. 155. If deemed acceptance occurs (that is, the taxpayer has not rejected the Commissioner’s NOR), the Commissioner will make reasonable efforts to advise the taxpayer of this within two weeks after the response period to the Commissioner’s NOR has expired. 156. Under section 138B(3) a taxpayer can file challenge proceedings upon receipt of the Commissioner’s NOR. The Commissioner’s practice is to treat a notice of proceedings and statement of claim that the taxpayer serves on the Commissioner within the response period commencing challenge proceedings as also being a request for the Commissioner’s agreement to opt out of the disputes process under section 89N(1)(c)(viii). The Commissioner will agree to the taxpayer opting out in these circumstances as it is considered that once a challenge is filed the dispute will be resolved more efficiently at a hearing authority. 157. For taxpayer-initiated NOPAs issued after 29 August 2011, being the date of enactment of the Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Act 2011, a new section 138B(3) applies. The new section 138B(3) provides that a disputant may challenge a self-assessment, where the disputant has issued a NOPA which has been rejected by the Commissioner, but only after the Commissioner has issued a challenge notice. As a challenge notice cannot be issued by the Commissioner until the Commissioner issues a SOP (unless one of the exceptions in section 89N(1)(c)(viii) applies), a taxpayer is no longer permitted to unilaterally opt out of the disputes process. 158. Section 89P(4) requires that a challenge notice must state that the Commissioner will not be issuing an amended assessment that includes or WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC takes into account an adjustment proposed by the disputant, and that a challenge may proceed. The Commissioner must issue a challenge notice within 4 years of the disputant issuing a NOPA to the Commissioner: section 89P(1). CONFERENCE PHASE What is the conference phase of the disputes process? 159. The conference phase of the disputes process allows the taxpayer and Inland Revenue officers directly involved in the dispute to exchange material information relating to the dispute (if this has not already been done prior to the conference phase). More importantly it is an opportunity for the parties to the dispute to try to resolve the differences in their understanding of facts, laws and legal arguments. 160.The word “resolve” in this context is not limited to final resolution of the dispute. Settlement is a possibility but this is not the only objective of the conference phase. The parties may “resolve” part of the dispute by agreeing on some of the facts and clarifying some of the legal arguments, while agreeing to disagree on other matters, which will become the focus in the later phases of the disputes process. 161. Generally, if a dispute remains unresolved after the NOR phase, the conference phase will follow. 162. The conference phase is an administrative process that aims to clarify and, if possible, resolve the dispute. However, the conference phase should not be used by either party for the purpose of delaying the completion of the disputes process. The conference phase can involve more than one meeting between the parties and it is not necessarily complete just because the parties have held the final meeting. For example, the parties may need further information or to consider further submissions made at the meeting. Legal and other advisers attending a conference 163. If a dispute is not settled earlier, the parties can obtain expert legal or other advice during the conference phase in addition to advice previously obtained. These advisers can attend any meetings in relation to the dispute. Conference facilitation 164. Conference facilitation is a feature in the conference phase. A facilitated conference will involve an independent internal facilitator who will promote and encourage structured discussion between Inland Revenue officers and the taxpayer on an informed basis and with the bona fide intention of resolving the dispute. The conference facilitator will be a senior Inland Revenue officer who will not have been involved in the dispute or given advice on the dispute prior to the conference phase. The facilitator will have sufficient technical knowledge to understand and lead the conference meeting. 165. The conference facilitator will not be responsible for making any decision in relation to the dispute, except for determining when the conference phase has come to an end. In particular, it is not the role of the facilitator to undertake settlement of the dispute. If this possibility arises it is the responsibility of the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officers involved in the dispute. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 166. Having a conference facilitated is optional and a conference can be held without a facilitator but, conference facilitation will be offered to all taxpayers as part of the disputes process. The Commissioner’s offer of a facilitated conference will be made in writing (“the conference facilitation letter”) within one month from the date of issue of the taxpayer's rejection of the Commissioner's NOR. The conference facilitation letter marks the commencement of the conference phase. 167. The format of the conference meeting need not be limited to a face-to-face meeting. The parties to the dispute may agree to hold a telephone or video conference. (For reasons of simplicity, the SPS refers to “meetings” to include these different conference formats.) 168. The taxpayer is expected to respond within two weeks from the date of the conference facilitation letter. The taxpayer should indicate whether they will attend the conference meeting, whether they will accept the conference facilitation offer, whether there are any special needs or requirements at the meeting and who else will be attending the meeting. If the taxpayer does not respond within this timeframe, the Inland Revenue officers involved in the dispute will contact the taxpayer about the conference facilitation letter. Preparation for the conference meeting 169. When a taxpayer agrees to attend a conference meeting, Inland Revenue will contact the taxpayer within two weeks from the taxpayer’s agreement to establish a timeframe and agree on how the meeting will be conducted. 170. Prior to the conference meeting, the taxpayer should advise Inland Revenue whether their advisors will attend the conference meeting. 171. The parties to the dispute may agree to exchange information relevant to the dispute before the conference meeting. A copy of that information will be provided to the facilitator. The Inland Revenue officers will provide the taxpayer a list of information that has been given to the facilitator. The taxpayer may seek a copy of any information on that list if it is not already in their possession. It is also crucial for the parties to exchange the information prior to the meeting if the agreed format of the conference is a telephone or video conference. 172. Inland Revenue may decide to concede the dispute after considering the taxpayer’s information. The whole disputes process (including the conference phase) would come to an end in these cases. 173. The conference phase will generally be expected to be completed within three months, but this may vary depending on the facts and complexities of the specific case. A longer conference phase may be justified in some disputes if the parties are engaged in meaningful discussions. 174. An agenda will be useful for both parties at the conference meeting. An agreed agenda should divide the conference meeting into two parts. The first part of the meeting should involve an exchange of material information and discussion of contentious facts and issues relating to the dispute. Any procedural matters such as the timeframe for completing the disputes process, the adjudication process, time bar waivers and the possibility of opting out of the disputes process will also be discussed. The second part of the meeting, if applicable, would involve negotiation of possible areas of resolution of the dispute. Any communication made and any materials WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC prepared for the purpose of negotiating a settlement or resolution during this part of the meeting will be treated as being on a “without prejudice” basis. 175. Where there is no agenda the conference facilitator will guide the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officers to discuss the contentious facts and issues at the conference meeting. 176. Where the option of conference facilitation has been declined, the parties to the dispute should work out the appropriate structure at the conference meeting, bearing in mind that one of the aims of any conference is to reach agreement on some or all the facts and issues and thus, resolve the dispute. At the conference meeting Facilitated conference 177. The facilitator will: (a) explain the objectives of the conference phase on the basis of the agreed agenda; (b) remind the parties of any rules relating to the conference (these will generally have been set out in the conference facilitation letter); (c) clarify who the parties are at the conference meeting and the capacities they hold (eg, whether they are the authorised tax advisors; whether they have authority to settle the dispute at the meeting); (d) ask whether the parties agree to record the meeting discussions using audio or video technology (refer to SPS 12/01: Recording Inland Revenue Interviews or any replacement SPS); (e)run through the agenda; (f)encourage the parties to present evidence in support of their perceived facts (either at the conference meeting or on a later date if the evidence cannot be provided at the time of the meeting). Where possible, encourage the parties to reach agreement on all the facts of the dispute. If no agreement can be made, encourage the parties to establish the common grounds and address the matters that they agree to disagree. These agreements will be recorded in writing. The agreements will be sent to the taxpayer to verify the correctness and sign by a specified date; (g) promote constructive discussion of only the contentious tax issues and where possible, encourage both parties to explore the issues, resolve or settle the dispute (subject to our internal revenue delegations and guidelines on settlement). If the contentious tax issues cannot be resolved, ask both parties to do one or more of the following: At the end of the conference meeting, ask the parties to consider whether the conference phase comes to an end. Consider whether there is need for another meeting, noting that another meeting can be justified if both parties need to exchange further information in support of their tax technical arguments but continuous meetings are discouraged if this is seen as a delaying tactic. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC Where the parties agree to end the conference phase and the facilitator considers that the objectives of the conference phase have been achieved, the facilitator can clearly signal the end of the conference phase to the parties. Agree on the timeframe for completing the disputes process and submitting the dispute to the adjudication process. This includes the timeframe for taxpayers to meet outstanding information requests and Inland Revenue officers’ undertaking to provide copies of information relevant to the disputes. The agreed timeframe will also factor in time bar waivers if given by the taxpayer and the time required for any court challenge that relates to documents, which are claimed to be protected by professional legal privilege and tax advice documents, which are claimed to be protected by the non-disclosure rights. Ask the taxpayer whether a time bar waiver will be given if the time bar applicable to the assessment in dispute is imminent. Clearly indicate whether the communication made and/or documents prepared for the purpose of negotiating potential settlement or resolution of the dispute will be treated as being on a “without prejudice” basis. Ask the taxpayer to consider whether the opt-out process applies and advise the taxpayer of the right to opt out within the required timeframe, so that it is not necessary to complete the disputes process as required under section 89N and that the dispute will be more efficiently resolved by a hearing authority. (h) note that any agreement between the parties will be recorded in writing and signed either at the conference meeting by both parties or on a later date after the taxpayer has verified the correctness of the agreement; (i)note that the Inland Revenue officers directly involved in the dispute will remain as the first point of contact. Unfacilitated conference 178. In an unfacilitated conference, the parties at the conference should agree on and perform tasks similar to those listed in paragraphs 177(a) to (h) above. 179. At the end of the conference meeting, it is important for the Inland Revenue officers and the taxpayer to discuss whether they consider that the conference phase has come to an end and record any agreement in writing. After the conference meeting 180. The following is relevant only if the conference phase does not end at the meeting. Facilitated conference 181. The facilitator will: (a) follow up on the agreed matters including the agreed timeframe and exchange of information (but does not include enforcing the agreement WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC between the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officers directly involved in the dispute); (b) assess any need to attend a further meeting; (c) suggest to the parties that the conference phase has ended and ask them to reach an agreement on this matter, then clearly notify the parties of the date on which the conference phase has ended. Unfacilitated conference 182. In a conference that did not have a facilitator, the Inland Revenue officers will perform these tasks. They may suggest to the taxpayer that the conference phase has ended after all the material information relating to the dispute has been exchanged and all the contentious facts and issues have been discussed. The parties will then agree in writing on the date on which the conference phase has ended. If the parties cannot agree on when to end the conference phase, the Investigations Manager will be responsible for making the decision on ending the conference phase after considering all the parties’ relevant reasons and concerns. End of the conference phase 183. It is important for the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officers to be fully aware of when the conference phase comes to an end. The conference phase is not necessarily complete just because the parties have held the final meeting. For example, the parties may need further information or to consider further submissions made at the meeting. In most cases, it is expected that the parties involved in the dispute will agree on when the conference phase has ended. The disputant will put such agreement in writing. Facilitated conference 184. After a facilitated conference the facilitator will be responsible for clarifying the agreed end date of the conference phase with the parties. 185. If the facilitator considers that both the taxpayer and Inland Revenue officers have exchanged all the material information relevant to the dispute, have fully discussed the tax technical issues and have not resolved the dispute, the facilitator may suggest to the parties that the conference phase can come to its end. 186.If there is no agreement and the parties’ reasons for continuing the conference phase are considered to be insufficient, the conference facilitator can make a decision to end the conference phase and notify the parties of that decision. The following are examples of strong indicators that the conference phase has come to its end: (a)The taxpayer and/or the tax advisors stop contacting the Inland Revenue officers directly involved in the dispute for a few weeks. (b) The parties did not exchange information notwithstanding that this has been agreed on at the conference meeting, thus leading to the exercise of the Commissioner’s powers (eg section 17 notices). WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC (c) The parties agree to disagree with each other and express interest in progressing to the SOP phase. (d) The taxpayer appears to be using delaying tactics at the conference phase when the issue in dispute is subject to an imminent time bar. 187. In rare situations, where conference facilitation is involved and the facilitator is concerned with the parties’ decision to end the conference phase before achieving the objectives of the conference meeting, the facilitator may adjourn the meeting and discuss the concerns with the responsible Inland Revenue officers. The facilitator may also contact the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s tax advisors to discuss whether the conference phase should come to its end. The facilitator will seek the parties’ agreement as to whether or not the conference phase is complete. Unfacilitated conference 188. Where no conference facilitation is involved, the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officers will work out when to end the conference phase. They should consider whether the objectives of the conference phase have been achieved before reaching the agreement. If no agreement can be reached, the Investigations Manager will review the conduct of the parties during the conference phase and make a decision on whether the conference phase has come to an end. 189. When a dispute remains unresolved after the conference phase has been completed, the Commissioner must issue a disclosure notice under section 89M(1). 190.If the taxpayer seeks the Commissioner’s agreement to opt out of the disputes process under section 89N(1)(c)(viii), they will be required to sign a declaration that all material information relating to the dispute has been provided to the Commissioner. OPT OUT OF THE DISPUTES PROCESS 191. Section 89N(1)(c)(viii) provides that the Commissioner and a taxpayer can enter into an agreement not to complete the disputes process if they are satisfied that the dispute can be more efficiently resolved at a hearing authority (referred to as “opt out”). 192. A taxpayer may seek to opt out of the remainder of the disputes process. If they do, a decision on whether or not the Commissioner will enter into an opt- out agreement will be made by a senior Inland Revenue officer. In making a decision on opt out, that person will consult with Legal and Technical Services, the Litigation Management Unit, and the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel. The decision-maker will consider the taxpayer’s request with reference to all of the specific criteria listed and will also consider if any other factors exist which mean that the dispute can be resolved more efficiently at a hearing authority. 193.Before agreeing to a taxpayer’s preference to opt out the Commissioner must be satisfied that the taxpayer has participated meaningfully during the conference phase. In addition, the taxpayer must have signed a declaration that all material information has been provided to the Commissioner. 194. The Commissioner will not agree to opting out unless there has been a conference. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 195. In addition to attending the conference, the Commissioner considers that a taxpayer will have participated meaningfully during the conference phase where: (a) the taxpayer has provided all relevant information as indicated by Inland Revenue (if it has not already been provided prior to the conference phase); and (b) the taxpayer has discussed the contentious facts and issues of the dispute with Inland Revenue. This discussion will have involved identifying and clarifying what the dispute turns on, seeking potential resolution of the dispute or reaching agreements to enable the dispute to move forward to the next phase if it remains unresolved. 196. If the taxpayer has participated meaningfully during the conference phase and signed a declaration that all material information has been provided the Commissioner will agree to the taxpayer’s preference to opt out of the disputes process in circumstances where one of the following applies: (a) the total amount of tax in dispute is $75,000 or less except where the dispute is part of a wider dispute; (b) the dispute turns on issues of fact (eg, facts that are to be determined by reference to expert opinions or valuation) only; (c) the dispute concerns facts and issues that are waiting to be resolved by a court; or (d) the dispute concerns facts and issues that are similar to those considered by the Disputes Review Unit of the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel if similar issues have been considered in a dispute in the past. 197. Where the dispute does not fall within the criteria listed at paragraph 196, the Commissioner may still agree to opt out of the disputes process if it is considered that the dispute can be resolved more efficiently at a hearing authority. 198. The taxpayer may request to opt out of the disputes process within two weeks from the end of the conference phase. The Commissioner will advise the taxpayer in writing within two weeks from the date of the request whether the request to opt out has been agreed to. 199. Where the opt-out has been agreed to and the dispute remains unresolved after taking into account the information and discussion during the conference phase, the Commissioner will issue a challenge notice. 200. When it is considered that the taxpayer does not meet the criteria for opting out of the disputes process, the taxpayer will be advised of the decision in writing. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC (a) The $75,000 or less threshold 201. The Commissioner will agree to a taxpayer opting out of the disputes process if the total amount of core tax in dispute is $75,000 or less. The “$75,000 or less” threshold does not apply if the dispute is part of a wider dispute that involves a number of taxpayers. An example of this is a tax avoidance arrangement similar to the “Trinity forestry scheme” in Accent Management Ltd v CIR (2007) 23 NZTC 21,323; \[2007\] NZCA 230. 202.The “$75,000 or less” threshold excludes: shortfall penalties, either proposed in the same NOR as the core tax or proposed in a separate NOPA; use-of-money interest that results from the position taken in the Commissioner’s NOR; and late payment penalties imposed on the taxpayer, if applicable. 203. In some disputes, the Commissioner may propose adjustments in respect of more than one tax type or more than one return period/income year. The “$75,000 or less” threshold applies to the net total amount of tax in the same dispute. The threshold will take into account the following: any variation of the amount of tax in dispute due to the Commissioner’s partial acceptance of the taxpayer’s NOPA; and any variation of the net total amount of tax in dispute as agreed between the participants during the conference phase. (b) The dispute turns on issues of fact only 204.The Commissioner will agree to a taxpayer’s request to opt out if the dispute turns on issues of fact or evidence only. 205.The “issues of fact” requirement may apply where the disputed facts are to be determined by reference to expert opinions or valuation. 206.Disputes on tax avoidance issues will not meet the “issues of fact” requirement. In these disputes, case law requires consideration of issues such as whether the arrangement has used a specific provision in a way that cannot have been within Parliament’s contemplation when it enacted the provision. This will involve analysing mixed questions of law and fact. (c) The dispute concerns facts and issues that are waiting to be resolved by a court 207. The opt-out process is available if the facts and issues relating to the dispute are similar to those that are waiting to be resolved by a court. The Commissioner will agree to a taxpayer’s request to opt out in those cases. 208. A taxpayer may become aware of a current court case that concerns facts and issues that they consider to be similar to their dispute. The Commissioner will consider this position when deciding whether to accept the taxpayer’s opt-out request. In considering a taxpayer’s request, Inland Revenue will advise the taxpayer of its views as to the similarity, but will not comment on the merit of WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC the current court case or the plaintiff’s tax affairs due to the secrecy provisions in section 81 of the TAA. 209. In some cases, a taxpayer may not be aware at the time of issuing the NOPA or during the conference phase of the existence of similar cases that are subject to court proceedings. The taxpayer may still request to opt out of the disputes process without this knowledge. In considering the request, the decision maker will consult with the Litigation Management Unit to determine whether there are any current court cases that concern facts and issues that are considered to be similar to the taxpayer’s dispute. (d) The dispute concerns facts and issues that are similar to those considered by the Disputes Review Unit 210. The opt-out process is available if the facts and issues relating to the dispute are similar to those already considered by the Disputes Review Unit. A taxpayer may request to opt out of the disputes process because a previous adjudication decision was in favour of the Commissioner and they consider it would be unlikely that the Commissioner’s view will change. In considering the taxpayer’s request, Inland Revenue will advise the taxpayer of its views as to the similarity, but will need to bear in mind the secrecy provisions of the TAA. 211. In some cases, a taxpayer may not be aware of similar disputes that have been considered by the Disputes Review Unit when the taxpayer issues the NOPA or participates at a conference meeting. Inland Revenue officers may be aware of such other similar disputes, and may choose to advise the taxpayer that, should the taxpayer request an opt out, Inland Revenue would be very likely to agree. However, Inland Revenue will need to bear in mind the secrecy provisions of the TAA when considering other disputes. CHALLENGE NOTICE WHERE THE COMMISSIONER HAS AGREED TO OPT OUT 212.In agreeing to the taxpayer’s preference for opt out the Commissioner will issue a challenge notice to the taxpayer. In doing so the Commissioner will have taken into account the information and legal arguments raised in the NOPA, the NOR and during the conference phase. The taxpayer can then challenge the assessment by commencing proceedings in a hearing authority within two months of receipt of the challenge notice. 213. In issuing the challenge notice, the Commissioner is not bound by the facts, issues, evidence and propositions of law stated in the NOPA and NOR, and the Commissioner is able to take into account information and arguments raised during the conference phase. The Commissioner’s administrative practice is that grounds of assessment which have not previously been referred to in the Commissioner’s NOR and the taxpayers’ NOPA will not be relied on, if they have not been notified or sufficiently discussed during the conference phase. 214. Where the parties have agreed to opt out the Commissioner will send to the taxpayer at or near the time of the challenge notice, a letter confirming briefly the reasons why the Commissioner has not accepted the adjustment proposed by the taxpayer. CHALLENGE UNDER SECTION 138B(4) 215. It is also possible to shorten the disputes process in circumstances where: WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC the adjustment relates to a matter for which the material facts and relevant law are identical to another assessment for the taxpayer (for another period) which is the subject of court proceedings; or the adjustment seeks to correct a tax position taken by the taxpayer (or an associated person) as a consequence or result of an incorrect tax position be taken by another taxpayer, which is the subject of or was the subject of court proceedings. 216. If the Commissioner agrees that either of the above conditions are met, then she will issue a challenge notice enabling the disputant to file a challenge in a hearing authority. 217. When a taxpayer wishes to utilise the process provided for in section 138B(4) it is recommended that contact is made with Inland Revenue prior to the issue of the NOPA to discuss the possibility of using the section. 218. Where the adjustment relates to one for another period contact should be made with the Inland Revenue staff who are involved in that dispute. It is envisaged that where the parties agree that the section 138B(4) process could apply, an abridged NOPA would be able to be issued in this circumstance cross-referencing to the dispute for the previous period. PROGRESSING DISPUTES THROUGH THE DISPUTES PROCESS WHERE THE DISPUTE AFFECTS MULTIPLE TAXPAYERS 219. Sometimes it is necessary for Inland Revenue to deal with a large number of taxpayers that are all affected by the same disputed matter. This can arise in situations where: the taxpayers are all investors in a particular scheme; the taxpayers have entered into similar arrangements and they have the same promoter; the taxpayers have entered into similar arrangements and they have the same tax agent; there exists a widespread but well-defined common problem involving many unrelated taxpayers (eg taxpayers moving their private residence into an LAQC, or a number of taxpayers claiming non-deductible expenses such as fines for overloading). 220. Given Inland Revenue’s limited resources, and bearing in mind taxpayer compliance costs it may not be appropriate for all the cases to proceed through the full dispute process. 221. The Commissioner’s approach, in the context of taxpayer initiated disputes, to the different situations which arise where a large number of taxpayers are all affected by the same disputed matter is outlined in the following paragraphs. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC Situation 1: There are a number of cases on the same issue under dispute. One case has been referred to the Disputes Review Unit, who has still to reach a conclusion on the matter 222. In this situation it may be possible for other affected taxpayers and the Commissioner to merely agree, subject to statutory time bar issues, to place their case "on hold" while the Disputes Review Unit undertakes its analysis. 223. However, care will need to be taken to ensure that the time bar will not be breached, and consideration should be given to obtaining a time bar waiver. 224. Again, as this approach requires the taxpayer to agree, the Commissioner can offer it to individual taxpayers but they still have the choice to progress the dispute through the full disputes process. 225.Taxpayers who agree to place their case “on hold” while adjudication considers the issues in question in relation to another taxpayer will not be bound by any decision reached by the Disputes Review Unit and will be free to continue with their dispute should they wish Situation 2: The Disputes Review Unit has looked at an issue before and taken a view supporting the taxpayer 226.It is the Commissioner’s policy that a finding for the taxpayer in previous dispute(s) will usually lead to the other disputes being withdrawn, particularly if the disputes are in respect of the same transaction. 227. However, in some situations further consideration of the issue is required at a national level before the Commissioner will apply the conclusions reached in a particular adjudication report more broadly to other taxpayers. In those cases, Inland Revenue officers may be advised that a specified or contrary approach (to that adopted by the Disputes Review Unit) is to be followed pending further consideration of the issue at a national level. DISCLOSURE NOTICE 228. The Commissioner must issue a disclosure notice under section 89M(1), unless the Commissioner: (a) does not have to complete the disputes process because any of the exceptions under section 89N(1)(c) apply (see the discussion in Appendix to this SPS), or (b) does not have to complete the disputes process because the High Court has made an order that the dispute resolution process can be truncated pursuant to an application made by the Commissioner under section 89N(3), or (c) has already issued to the taxpayer a notice of disputable decision that includes or takes into account the adjustment proposed in the NOPA pursuant to section 89M(2). Section 89M(1) and (2) reads: (1)Unless subsection (2) applies, and subject to section 89N, the Commissioner must issue a disclosure notice in respect of a notice of proposed adjustment to a disputant at the time or after the Commissioner or the taxpayer, as the case may be, issues the notice of proposed adjustment. (2)The Commissioner may not issue a disclosure notice in respect of a notice of proposed adjustment if the Commissioner has already issued a notice of disputable WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC decision that includes, or takes account of, the adjustment proposed in the notice of proposed adjustment. 229. The meaning of disputable decision is discussed in paragraphs 51 to 61. 230. The Commissioner will usually advise the taxpayer two weeks before a disclosure notice is issued that it will be issued to them. 231. Where practicable, the Commissioner will contact the taxpayer shortly after the disclosure notice and SOP are issued to ascertain whether they have received these documents. 232.If the taxpayer has not received the Commissioner’s disclosure notice, for example, due to a postal error or an event or circumstance beyond the taxpayer’s control, the Commissioner will issue another disclosure notice to the taxpayer. In this circumstance, the response period within which the taxpayer must respond with their SOP will commence from the date that the Commissioner issued the initial disclosure notice. 233. Where the taxpayer cannot issue a SOP within the applicable response period, they should issue a late SOP with an explanation of why it is late. The Commissioner will consider the late SOP in terms of the discretion under section 89K(1) (see paragraphs 107 to 117 for details). Evidence exclusion rule and issues and propositions of law exclusion rule 234. The evidence exclusion rule has been replaced by the issues and propositions of law exclusion rule, in relation to disputes where a disclosure notice is issued on or after 29 August 2011, being the date that the Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Act 2011 received the royal assent. A disclosure notice is the document that triggers the application of either rule under section 138G(1) and its replacement. The evidence exclusion rule restricts the evidence that the parties can raise in court challenges to matters disclosed in their SOP. (Both parties can refer to evidence raised by either party.) The new issues and propositions of law exclusion rule only confines the taxpayer and Commissioner to the issues and propositions of law set out in their respective SOPs, in subsequent challenge proceedings. There is no restriction on introducing new facts or evidence which has not previously been referred to in either party’s SOP. 235. Any disclosure notice that the Commissioner issues will explain the effect of the exclusion rules and refer to section 138G. Issue of a disclosure notice 236. The Commissioner can issue a disclosure notice at any time on or after the date that the taxpayer issues a NOPA because there is no statutory timeframe specifying when the notice must be issued. 237. The Commissioner does not have to issue a disclosure notice to a taxpayer when they ask for one to be issued. However, the Commissioner will usually discuss such a request with the taxpayer and advise whether a disclosure notice will be issued and, if not, the reasons why and the implications for the dispute. 238. Generally, the Commissioner’s practice is to issue a disclosure notice after the exchange of a NOPA, NOR, notice rejecting the NOR, the conclusion of the conference phase and in accordance with any timeframe agreed with the WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC taxpayer. The Commissioner will usually issue a disclosure notice within one month after the conference phase has been completed. 239. When possible, the responsible officer should use the relevant statutory power under the TAA to obtain any information needed to complete the conference or disclosure phases. This will ensure that the disputes process is conducted in a timely and efficient manner. If the Commissioner is waiting for information to be provided pursuant to a statutory power Commissioner will defer issuing a disclosure notice to ensure that any information provided by the taxpayer can be included in the Commissioner’s SOP. 240.If a disclosure notice is issued earlier (for example, the facts are clear, the taxpayer agrees, or a conference is not required) the reasons must be documented and explained to the taxpayer. TAXPAYER’S STATEMENT OF POSITION (SOP) 241. Pursuant to section 89M(5), once the Commissioner has issued a disclosure notice, the taxpayer must issue to the Commissioner a SOP within the two- month response period that starts on the date that the disclosure notice is issued. 242. The Commissioner cannot consider a document that the taxpayer purports to issue as a SOP before the Commissioner has issued the disclosure notice because it would have been issued outside the applicable response period. The taxpayer must submit another SOP after the disclosure notice is issued to satisfy their obligation under section 89M(5). 243.Unless an “exceptional circumstance” or “demonstrable intention” in section 89K applies, if the taxpayer issues a SOP to the Commissioner outside the response period, the Commissioner will treat the dispute as if it w as never commenced. The Commissioner does not have to issue an assessment to include or take account of the taxpayer’s proposed adjustment. Section 89M(7)(b) reads: (7)A disputant who does not issue a statement of position in the prescribed form within the response period for the statement of position, is treated as follows: ... (b)if the disputant has proposed the adjustment to the assessment, the disputant is treated as not having issued a notice of proposed adjustment. Contents of a taxpayer’s SOP 244. Different elements of a SOP will be binding on the taxpayer, depending on whether the evidence, or issues and propositions of law exclusion rule apply. Either exclusion rule is subject to section 138G(2), which permits any party to a challenge to apply to the court to include new facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law in the challenge. 245. The taxpayer’s SOP must be in the prescribed form (the Statement of position (IR 773) form that can be found on Inland Revenue’s website: www.ird.govt.nz) and include sufficient detail to fairly advise the Commissioner of the facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law on which the taxpayer wishes to rely. In particular, the taxpayer must clarify what tax laws are being relied on and advise if any of these are different to those relied on in the taxpayer’s NOPA. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 246. However, if the Commissioner receives a SOP that is not in the prescribed form (as described in paragraph 245) the Commissioner’s practice will be to advise the taxpayer that the SOP must be in the prescribed form. If this occurs on the last day of the response period the Commissioner will consider the resubmitted SOP under section 89K. 247. Section 89M(6) reads: A disputant’s statement of position in the prescribed form must, with sufficient detail to fairly advise the Commissioner,– (a)give an outline of the facts on which the disputant intends to rely; and (b)give an outline of the evidence on which the disputant intends to rely; and (c)give an outline of the issues that the disputant considers will arise; and (d)specify the propositions of law on which the disputant intends to rely. 248. The minimum content requirement for a SOP is an outline of the relevant facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law. To allow the Disputes Review Unit to successfully reach a decision, the outline in the SOP must contain full, complete and detailed submissions. 249. An outline that consists of a frank and complete discussion of the issues, law, arguments and evidence supporting the arguments is implicit in the spirit and intent of the disputes process. (In very complex cases the taxpayer should provide a full explanation of the relevant evidence.) 250. The disputes process does not require that relevant documents are discovered or full briefs of evidence or exhaustive lists of documents exchanged. Rather, providing an outline of relevant evidence in the SOP will ensure that both parties appreciate the availability of evidence in respect of the factual issues in dispute. The taxpayer should include an outline of any expert evidence on which they intend to rely in the SOP. 251. If the Commissioner considers that the SOP has insufficient detail to allow a correct assessment to be made the SOP can be treated as not complying with the requirements of section 89M(6). 252. Subject to any order made by the court under section 138G(2), the evidence exclusion rule found in section 138G(1) and the issues and propositions of law exclusion rule found in the replacement section 138G(1) (applying to disclosure notices issued after 29 August 2011) prevents a hearing authority from considering facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law (where the evidence exclusion rule applies) or issues and propositions of law (where the issues and propositions of law exclusion rule applies) that are not included in: (a) the SOP, or (b) any additional information that: (i)the Commissioner provides under section 89M(8), that is deemed to be part of the Commissioner’s SOP under subsection (9), or (ii) the parties provide pursuant to an agreement under section 89M(13), that is deemed to be part of the provider’s SOP under subsection (14). WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 253. Section 89M(6B) reads: In subsection 4(b) and 6(b), evidence refers to the available documentary evidence on which the person intends to rely, but does not include a list of potential witnesses, whether or not identified by name. 254. Pursuant to section 89M(6B), the SOP must list any documentary evidence but not potential witnesses. Any witnesses’ identities will continue to be protected without undermining the effect of the evidence exclusion rule, in disputes where that rule applies. Receipt of a taxpayer’s SOP 255. If a taxpayer has issued a SOP the Commissioner can accept the SOP or issue a SOP in response to the taxpayer’s SOP. Furthermore, section 89P allows the Commissioner to issue a challenge notice after the Commissioner has issued the SOP. (However, the Commissioner’s practice is to send the dispute through the adjudication process. See paragraphs 275 to 290 for details.) 256. The Commissioner will make reasonable efforts to contact the taxpayer or their tax agent 10 working days before the response period expires to determine whether the taxpayer will issue a SOP in response to the disclosure notice. Such contact will be made by telephone or in writing. The taxpayer’s SOP will be referred to the responsible officer within five working days after Inland Revenue receives it. Upon receipt of the SOP, the responsible officer will ascertain and record the following: (a) the date on which the SOP was issued, and (b) whether the SOP has been issued within the relevant response period, and (c) the salient features of the SOP including any deficiencies in its content. 257. Where practicable, the Commissioner will acknowledge that the taxpayer’s SOP is received within 10 working days after it is received. However, the Commissioner will advise the taxpayer or their agent of any deficiencies in the SOP’s content as soon as they become aware of the deficiency. They will be further advised when the response period expires that those deficiencies must be rectified and whether the Commissioner intends to provide any additional information to the taxpayer. 258. Where a SOP is issued outside the applicable response period, the taxpayer can apply for consideration of exceptional circumstances or that the disputant had a demonstrable intention to continue the dispute under section 89K. The responsible officer will notify the taxpayer of the decision to accept the application in writing within one month after Inland Revenue has received the taxpayer’s application. Where the application is rejected, the responsible officer must notify the taxpayer by issuing a refusal notice. 259. If the taxpayer issues a SOP outside the applicable response period and none of the exceptional circumstances under section 89K apply, the dispute will be treated as if it was never commenced (see paragraph 243). Where practicable, the Commissioner must advise the taxpayer of this within 10 working days after the response period for the disclosure notice has expired. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC COMMISSIONER’S SOP IN RESPONSE 260. When the taxpayer has issued a NOPA, section 89M(3) allows the Commissioner to issue a disclosure notice without a SOP. If the dispute remains unresolved the Commissioner’s practice is to issue a SOP that addresses and responds to the substantive items in the taxpayer’s SOP within the applicable response period (that is, within two months starting on the date that the taxpayer issued their SOP). 261. However, in very rare circumstances the Commissioner may not issue a SOP in response to the taxpayer’s SOP. For example, an exception arises under section 89N(1)(c) or the High Court has made an order that the disputes process can be truncated pursuant to an application made under section 89N(3). 262.If there is insufficient time to provide a SOP in response, the Commissioner can apply to the High Court for further time to reply to the taxpayer’s SOP under section 89M(10) if the application is made before the response period expires and the Commissioner considers that it is unreasonable to reply within the response period because of the number, complexity or novelty of matters raised in the taxpayer’s SOP. 263. Such applications are expected to be rare but can arise if the taxpayer is less than cooperative with supplying information and/or has failed to maintain proper and adequate records. 264.The Commissioner’s SOP must be in the form that the Commissioner has prescribed under section 35(1) and include sufficient details to fairly advise the taxpayer of the facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law on which the Commissioner wishes to rely. 265. Section 89M(4) reads: The Commissioner’s statement of position in the prescribed form must, with sufficient detail to fairly advise the disputant,– (a)give an outline of the facts on which the Commissioner intends to rely; and (b)give an outline of the evidence on which the Commissioner intends to rely; and (c)give an outline of the issues that the Commissioner considers will arise; and (d)specify the propositions of law on which the Commissioner intends to rely. 266.If the Commissioner has issued a SOP, the Commissioner can also provide to a taxpayer additional information in response to matters raised in their SOP under section 89M(8) within two months starting on the date that the taxpayer’s SOP is issued. 267. However, the Commissioner’s practice is to issue a SOP to the taxpayer towards the end of the response period to allow sufficient time for gathering any further information in response and considering the SOP’s content. This minimises the occasions when additional information needs to be provided under section 89M(8) as the information in question will be in the SOP. In any event, as any additional information must be provided within the same response period as the Commissioner’s SOP in most case it will be unlikely that the Commissioner will be able to issue additional information within the response period. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 268. The taxpayer cannot reply to the Commissioner’s SOP (or any additional information provided) unless the Commissioner agrees to accept additional information under section 89M(13). AGREEMENT TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 269. The parties can agree to include additional information in their SOP under section 89M(13) at any time during the disputes process including after the dispute has been referred to the Disputes Review Unit. Although there is no statutory time limit, the Commissioner’s practice is to allow one month (from the later of the date that the Commissioner issues a SOP or provides any additional information under section 89M(8)) for such an agreement to be reached and information provided. 270. However, before agreeing to include additional information under section 89M(13) the Commissioner will consider the taxpayer’s prior conduct and whether they could have provided the information earlier through the application of due diligence. 271. The Commissioner will usually also consider the materiality and relevance of the additional information and its capacity to help resolve the dispute and may decide to take it into account in coming to an assessment. In this circumstance, both parties will be expected to cooperate in resolving the relevance and accuracy of any such material. The Commissioner may wish to apply resources to verification and comment and this will be considered by the adjudicator. 272. If the Commissioner does not agree to add additional information to the taxpayer’s SOP, the reasons for not agreeing must be documented with detailed reference to the taxpayer’s conduct, level of cooperation before the request was made and why the information was not provided earlier. The responsible officer will also advise the taxpayer or their tax agent of the reasons why their request was not agreed to. 273. Any agreements to add further information to the SOP will be made subject to the taxpayer agreeing that the Commissioner can also include responses to the additional information to the SOP under section 89M(13), if required. 274. Any additional information that the parties provide under section 89M(13) will be deemed to form part of the provider’s SOP under section 89M(14). The evidence exclusion rule under section 138G(1) and the issues and propositions of law exclusion rule under the new section 138G(1) apply to the additional information. PREPARATION FOR ADJUDICATION 275. The Disputes Review Unit is part of the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel and represents the final step in the disputes process. The adjudicator’s role is to review unresolved disputes by taking a fresh look at the tax dispute and the application of law to the facts in an impartial and independent manner and provide a comprehensive and technically accurate decision that will ensure the correctness of the assessment. 276. Generally, the adjudicator will make such a decision within three months after the case is referred to the Disputes Review Unit (although sometimes a decision can be made in a few weeks). The length of time taken to make a decision will depend on the number of disputes that are before the Disputes WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC Review Unit, any allocation delays and the technical, legal and factual complexity of those disputes. 1 277. Judicial comments have been made in C of IR v Zentrum Holdings Limited and Another, Ch’elle Properties (NZ) Limited v CIR (2004) 21 NZTC 18,618 and ANZ National Bank Ltd and others v C of IR (No. 2) (2006) 22 NZTC 19,835 indicating that, as a matter of law, it is not strictly necessary for Inland Revenue officers to send all disputes to the Disputes Review Unit for review, and Inland Revenue officers are not necessarily bound by the Disputes Review Unit’s decisions. 278. Notwithstanding the above judicial comments, if the parties have not agreed on all the issues at the end of the conference and disclosure phases or to truncate the disputes process under section 89N(1)(c)(viii), it is the Commissioner’s policy and practice that all disputes are to be sent to the Disputes Review Unit for review, irrespective of the complexity or type of issues or amount of tax involved unless any of the following exceptions arise: (a) the Commissioner has considered the taxpayer’s SOP for the purposes of section 89N(2)(b) and referred the dispute to the Disputes Review Unit for their preliminary consideration and the Disputes Review Unit has determined that it has insufficient time to reach a decision in respect of the dispute before a statutory time bar would prevent the Commissioner from subsequently increasing the assessment (see paragraph 282 for further discussion), or (b) any of the legislative exceptions specified in section 89N(1)(c) apply (see Appendix to this SPS) so that the Commissioner can amend an assessment without first completing the disputes process, or (c) the High Court has made an order that the disputes process can be truncated pursuant to an application made by the Commissioner under section 89N(3). 279. Inland Revenue officers will adequately consider the facts and legal arguments in the taxpayer’s SOP before deciding whether to amend the assessment. It is expected that this will occur only in very rare circumstances. 280. Whether the Commissioner has adequately considered a SOP will depend on what is a reasonable length of time and level of analysis for that SOP given the circumstances of the case (for example, the length of the SOP and the complexity of the legal issues). 281. Thus a simple dispute could take only a couple of days to consider adequately while a complex dispute could take a few weeks. 282. The decision not to refer the case to adjudication must be made by a senior person in Service Delivery (for example, at the time of writing the delegation was with Area Manager level or above). In respect of the first exception mentioned in paragraph 278(a) it is necessary that the parties have 1 For further information on the timeframe for adjudication of disputes see the article titled “Adjudication Unit – Its role in the dispute resolution process” that was published in the Tax Information Bulletin Vol. 19, No. 10 (November 2007). WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC exchanged a SOP and it is a matter solely for the Disputes Review Unit to determine whether it has insufficient time to fully consider the dispute. 283.If the dispute is to be referred to the Disputes Review Unit, the Commissioner should not issue a challenge notice before the adjudication process is completed unless a time bar is imminent. The responsible officer will prepare a cover sheet that records all the documents that must be sent to the Disputes Review Unit. 284. The cover sheet together with copies of the documents (NOPA, NOR, notice rejecting the NOR, conference notes, both parties’ SOP, additional information, material evidence including expert opinions and a schedule of all evidence held) and any recordings of discussions held during the conference must be sent to the Disputes Review Unit. 285. When the dispute is to be referred for adjudication, the responsible officer will issue a letter and copy of the cover sheet to the taxpayer before sending the submissions, notes and evidence to the Disputes Review Unit. The cover sheet and letter is usually completed within one month after the date that the Commissioner issues the SOP or provides additional information under section 89M(8). 286. The purpose of this letter is to seek the taxpayer’s concurrence on the materials to be sent to the adjudicator - primarily in regard to the documentary evidence that has been disclosed at the SOP phase. This letter will allow the taxpayer no more than 10 working days from when it is received to provide a response. 287. Once the taxpayer has concurred on the materials to be sent to the Disputes Review Unit, those materials will usually be so forwarded. However, if the taxpayer does not provide a response the materials will be forwarded within 10 working days after the date that the letter is issued to the taxpayer advising that the materials will be sent to the Disputes Review Unit. The adjudicator can also contact the parties after the initial materials have been received to obtain further information. 288. Where an investigation has covered multiple issues, the cover sheet will outline any issues that the parties have agreed upon and any issues that are still disputed. The adjudicator can then consider the disputed issues and not reconsider those issues that have been agreed upon. 289. Generally, the adjudicator only considers the materials that the parties have submitted. They do not usually seek out or consider further information, unless it is relevant. The adjudicator may consider such additional information notwithstanding that the parties have not agreed that the provider can include this information in their SOP under section 89M(13). 290. However, any additional material which amounts to a legal or factual issue, or a proposition of law, that the parties have not included in their SOP (or is not deemed to be included in their SOP under section 89M(14)) cannot later be raised by the parties as evidence in the TRA or a hearing authority because of the issues and propositions of law exclusion rule in section 138G(1). ADJUDICATION DECISION 291. Once a conclusion is reached, the Disputes Review Unit will advise the taxpayer and responsible officer of the decision. The responsible officer will WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC implement the Disputes Review Unit’s recommendations and follow up procedures where required, including issuing a notice of assessment to the taxpayer where applicable. 292. If the Disputes Review Unit makes a decision that is not in the Commissioner’s favour, the Commissioner is bound by and cannot challenge that decision. The dispute will come to end. The Commissioner will issue an assessment or challenge notice to the taxpayer to reflect the decision. 293.If a taxpayer commences the disputes process, they can file challenge proceedings in the TRA or the High Court within the applicable response period if any of the following conditions are met: (a) The Commissioner or taxpayer has issued an assessment that was the subject of an adjustment that the taxpayer proposed and Commissioner rejected within the applicable response period and the Commissioner has later issued an amended assessment to the taxpayer (section 138B(2)). (b) For taxpayer-initiated disputes where the taxpayer NOPA is issued after 29 August 2011, a new section 138B(3) applies. A taxpayer may issue challenge proceedings where: the Commissioner or taxpayer has issued an assessment that was the subject of an adjustment that the taxpayer proposed and the Commissioner rejected within the applicable response period by a NOR; and the Commissioner has issued a challenge notice to the disputant. The latter requirement has the effect of deferring the commencement of challenge proceedings, as the Commissioner’s challenge notice can only generally be issued after the Commissioner has issued a SOP. (c) The Commissioner or taxpayer has issued an assessment that is the subject of an adjustment notified to the Commissioner, where: the adjustment relates to a matter for which the material facts and relevant law are identical to another assessment for the taxpayer (for another period) which is the subject of court proceedings; or the adjustment seeks to correct a tax position taken by the taxpayer (or an associated person) as a consequence or result of an incorrect tax position taken by another taxpayer, which is the subject of or was the subject of court proceedings; and the Commissioner has issued a challenge notice. (d) The Commissioner or taxpayer has issued a disputable decision that is not an assessment that was the subject of an adjustment that the taxpayer proposed and the Commissioner rejected within the applicable response period (section 138C). 294. A taxpayer must file proceedings with the TRA or High Court within the two- month response period that starts on the date that the Commissioner issues: (a) the amended assessment if the challenge proceedings are filed under section 138B(2), or (b) the challenge notice if the challenge proceedings are filed under section 138B(3) or (4), or WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC (c)the written disputable decision rejecting the taxpayer’s proposed adjustment if the challenge proceedings are filed under section 138C. 295. If applicable, the responsible officer will implement any decision made by the hearing authority and follow up procedures where required including issuing a notice of assessment or amended assessment to the taxpayer. This Standard Practice Statement is signed on 10 th October 2016. Rob Wells LTS Manager – Technical Standards WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC APPENDIX SECTION 89N − EXCEPTIONS − WHEN AN ASSESSMENT CAN BE ISSUED WITHOUT COMPLETING THE DISPUTES PROCESS 1.If a NOPA has been issued and the dispute is unresolved, the Commissioner can issue an assessment without completing the disputes process under the following circumstances: Exception 1: In the course of the dispute, the Commissioner considers that the taxpayer has committed an offence under an Inland Revenue Act that has had the effect of delaying the completion of the disputes process (section 89N(1)(c)(i)). 2.Section 89N(1)(c)(i) reads: (i)the Commissioner notifies the disputant that, in the Commissioner’s opinion, the disputant in the course of the dispute has committed an offence under an Inland Revenue Act that has had an effect of delaying the completion of the disputes process: 3.This exception applies where the Commissioner may need to act quickly to issue an assessment because it is considered that the taxpayer has committed an offence under an Inland Revenue Act that has caused undue delay to the progress of the dispute. 4.For example, in the course of a dispute a taxpayer obstructed Inland Revenue officers in obtaining information from the taxpayer’s business premise under section 16. The Commissioner will advise the taxpayer in writing that it is considered that an offence has been committed under section 143H. The offence has the effect of delaying the completion of the disputes process meaning that the Commissioner does not have to complete that process and can amend the taxpayer’s assessment under section 113. 5.Another example of when the exception may apply is where, in the course of a dispute, a taxpayer wilfully refuses to attend an enquiry made under section 19 on the date specified in the Commissioner’s notice. In these circumstances, the Commissioner will advise the taxpayer in writing that that it is considered that an offence has been committed under section 143F that has had the effect of delaying the completion of the disputes process. The Commissioner can then exercise the discretion to amend the taxpayer’s assessment under section 113 without completing the disputes process. 6.In order to apply this exception, Inland Revenue officers must form an opinion that is honestly and reasonably justifiable on the basis of the evidence available, that the disputant has committed an offence under an Inland Revenue Act. The Inland Revenue officer’s decision must be clearly documented and stipulate the grounds and reasoning on which it is based. Exception 2: A taxpayer involved in a dispute, or person associated to them, may take steps to shift, relocate or dispose of the taxpayer’s assets to avoid or delay the collection of tax, making the issue of an assessment urgent (section 89N(1)(c)(ii) and (iii)). 7.If the Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe that the taxpayer or a person associated with them (“associated person”) intends to dispose of assets in order to avoid or defer the payment of an outstanding or pending WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC tax liability, the Commissioner can urgently issue an assessment to the taxpayer. Section 89N(1)(c)(ii) and (iii) reads: (ii)the Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe that the disputant may take steps in relation to the existence or location of the disputant’s assets to avoid or delay the collection of tax from the disputant: (iii)the Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe that a person who is an associated person of the disputant may take steps in relation to the existence or location of the disputant’s assets to avoid or delay the collection of tax from the disputant: 8.In order to issue an assessment on the basis of either of the above exceptions, Inland Revenue officers must record any relevant correspondence and evidence (for example, the directors’ written instructions to shift the company’s assets overseas, evidence of electronic wiring of funds to overseas countries, transcripts of interviews with the taxpayer, etc) or other grounds for the reasonable belief. Exception 3: The taxpayer involved in a dispute or a person associated with them involved in another dispute involving similar issues has begun judicial review proceedings in relation to the dispute (section 89N(1)(c)(iv) and (v)). 9.Section 89N(1)(c)(iv) and (v) reads: (iv)the disputant has begun judicial review proceedings in relation to the dispute: (v)a person who is an associated person of the disputant and is involved in another dispute with the Commissioner involving similar issues has begun judicial review proceedings in relation to the other dispute: 10.These exceptions apply to any judicial review proceedings that are brought against the Commissioner. In judicial review proceedings, the parties’ resources are likely to be directed away from advancing the dispute through the disputes process. 11.For the purpose of section 89N(1)(c)(v), an associated person of a taxpayer may be involved in a similar issue to the taxpayer even if the issue relates to a different revenue type. For example, if the dispute between the Commissioner and taxpayer relates to PAYE issues, but the dispute between the Commissioner and person associated with the taxpayer relates to income tax the taxpayer may still be involved in similar issues to the person associated with them. 12.Even if the two disputes relate to the same revenue type, section 89N(1)(c)(v) will not apply in some circumstances. For example, the dispute with the taxpayer relates to the tax treatment of entertainment expenditure, whereas the dispute with the person associated with the taxpayer relates to the capital and revenue distinction of merger expenditure. The Commissioner would not regard these two disputes as involving similar issues. Exception 4: The taxpayer fails to comply with a statutory requirement for information relating to the dispute (section 89N(1)(c)(vi)). 13.Section 89N(1)(c)(vi) reads: (vi)during the disputes process, the disputant receives from the Commissioner a requirement under a statute for information relating to the dispute and fails to comply with the requirement within a period that is specified in the requirement: WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 14.Generally, a taxpayer provides information to Inland Revenue voluntarily. However, when this does not occur the Commissioner can seek information from the taxpayer under a statutory provision, for example sections 17 or 19. (The Commissioner’s practice regarding section 17 is currently set out in OS 13/02: Section 17 Notices.) The requirement for statutory information will specify the period within which the information must be provided. This period will allow the taxpayer reasonable and sufficient time to comply. 15.Where the taxpayer does not comply with a formal requirement for information that relates to a dispute (for example, as a tactic to delay the progress of the disputes process), the Commissioner can issue an assessment to the taxpayer without first completing the disputes process. Exception 5: The parties agree in writing that the dispute should be resolved by the court or TRA without completing the disputes process (section 89N(1)(c)(viii)). 16.Section 89N(1)(c)(viii) reads: (viii) the disputant and the Commissioner agree, recording their agreement in a document, that they have reached a position in which the dispute would be resolved more efficiently by being submitted to the court or Taxation Review Authority without completion of the disputes process: 17.Under this exception, where the Commissioner or taxpayer commences the disputes process, the parties can make such an agreement before either party issues their SOP. This would occur, for example, if the parties could incur excessive compliance and administrative costs in completing the full disputes process relative to the amount in dispute. 18.This exception allows the taxpayer to bring challenge proceedings against the Commissioner. The parties must have exchanged a NOPA and NOR before the taxpayer can bring challenge proceedings under section 138B(1). 19.The circumstances under which the Commissioner will enter into such an agreement are discussed in detail from paragraph 191 to 214. This SPS refers to this exception as opting out of the disputes process or “opt out”. Exception 6: The parties agree in writing to suspend the disputes process pending the outcome of a test case (section 89N(1)(c)(ix)). 20.Section 89N(1)(c)(ix) reads: (ix)the disputant and the Commissioner agree, recording their agreement in a document, to suspend proceedings in the dispute pending a decision in a test case referred to in section 89O. 21.Section 89O(2) allows a dispute to be suspended pending the result of a test case. Pursuant to section 89O(3), the parties can agree, recording their agreement in a document, to suspend the dispute from the date of the agreement until the earliest date that: (a)the court’s decision is made, or (b) the test case is otherwise resolved, or (c) the dispute is otherwise resolved. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 22.If the parties agree to suspend the disputes process, any statutory time bar affecting the dispute is stayed. The Commissioner can then make an assessment that is consistent with the test case decision. (However, the taxpayer is not precluded from challenging the Commissioner’s assessment under section 89D(1), even if it is consistent with the test case decision.) 23.The Commissioner must issue an amended assessment or perform an action within the time limit specified in section 89O(5). 24.Section 89O(5) reads: The Commissioner must make an amended assessment, or perform an action, that is the subject of a suspended dispute by the later of the following: (a)the day that is 60 days after the last day of the suspension: (b)the last day of the period that – (i)begins on the day following the day by which the Commissioner, in the absence of the suspension, would be required under the Inland Revenue Acts to make the amended assessment, or perform the action; and (ii)contains the same number of days as does the period of the suspension. 25.If the statutory time bar arising under section 108 or 108A is imminent, section 89O(5) allows the Commissioner more time to complete the disputes process. 26.For example, the Commissioner commences a dispute and on 1 March 2010 agrees with the taxpayer in writing to suspend the disputes proceedings pending the decision in a designated test case. The disputed issue is subject to a statutory time bar that commences after 31 March 2010 and the taxpayer does not agree to delay its application under section 108B(1)(a). A decision is reached in the test case on 31 July 2010. 27.The Commissioner must make an amended assessment or perform an action that is the subject of the suspended dispute by 29 September 2010. This date is calculated as follows: (a) The suspension period commences on the date of the agreement (1 March 2010) and ends on the date of the court’s decision in the test case (31 July 2010). This is a period of 153 days. (b) The last date that the Commissioner can make an amended assessment falls on the later of the following two dates: (i)29 September 2010, that is 60 days after the date that the suspension period ends on 31 July 2010 pursuant to section 89O(5)(a), and (ii) 31 August 2010, that is 153 days after the period commences on 1 April 2010 pursuant to section 89O(5)(b). Exception 7: The Commissioner applies to the High Court for an order to allow more time to complete or dispense with the disputes process. 28.Section 89N(3) reads: WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC ... \[T\]he Commissioner may apply to the High Court for an order that allows more time for the completion of the disputes process, or for an order that completion of the disputes process is not required. 29.The Commissioner envisages that this exception will be used if section 89N(1)(c) does not apply and there are exceptional circumstances. 30.Any application made by the Commissioner under section 89N(3) must be based on reasonable grounds. Whether there are reasonable grounds will depend on considerations such as the complexity of the issues in the dispute, whether the taxpayer has caused delays; whether the dispute involves large amounts of revenue or whether there were significant matters in the dispute that were unforeseen by either party and provided a justification for the delay. 31.For example, due to unusual circumstances the Commissioner does not learn about a proposed adjustment until late. Further delays by the taxpayer and the need for the Commissioner to obtain significant legal advice means that the Disputes Review Unit cannot consider the dispute before the time bar applies. In these circumstances, the Commissioner may apply to the High Court for an order that allows more time for the disputes process to be completed under section 89N(3). (Note: This is only an example of a possible unforeseen situation and it is anticipated that there will be a wide variety of circumstances under which an application under section 89N(3) will be appropriate.) 32.The Commissioner’s application to the High Court under section 89N(3) must be made before the four-year statutory time bar falls due. 33.The Commissioner must also issue an amended assessment within the time limit specified in section 89N(5). Section 89N(5) reads: If the Commissioner makes an application under subsection (3), the Commissioner must make an amended assessment by the last day of the period that - (a)begins on the day following the day by which the Commissioner, in the absence of the suspension, would be required under the Inland Revenue Acts to make the amended assessment; and (b)contains the total of - (i)the number of days between the date on which the Commissioner files the application in the High Court and the earliest date on which the application is decided by the High Court or the application or dispute is resolved: (ii)the number of days allowed by an order of a court as a result of the application. 34.Section 89N(5) allows the Commissioner more time to complete the disputes process where the statutory time bar under section 108 or 108A is imminent. 35.For example, the Commissioner commences the disputes process. On 1 March 2010 the Commissioner applies to the High Court under section 89N(3) for an order allowing more time to complete the process. The disputed issue is subject to a statutory time bar that commences after 31 March 2010 and the taxpayer does not agree to delay its application under section 108B(1)(a). On 30 June 2010, the High Court makes an order that allows the Commissioner’s application and gives the Commissioner 30 further days to complete the disputes process. WITHDRAWN CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 36.Pursuant to section 89N(5), the Commissioner must make an amended assessment by 30 August 2010. This date is calculated as follows: (a) The Commissioner would have one month to make the amended assessment before the statutory time bar commences. That is, 1 March 2010 to 31 March 2010. The period during which an amended assessment must be made under section 89N(5)(a) commences on 1 April 2010. (b) The period during which the assessment must be made includes 122 days, that is the period between 1 March 2010 and 30 June 2010 (the date of the decision) under section 89N(5)(b)(i) and the 30-day period allowed by the High Court order under section 89N(5)(b)(ii). This is a total of 152 days. (c) The Commissioner must issue an amended assessment to the taxpayer on the date that is 152 days from 1 April 2010. That is, by 30 August 2010. 37.During the period from 1 March to 30 August 2010, the parties may continue to attempt to resolve the dispute. This may include exchanging SOPs and going through the adjudication process. 38.The above example indicates that the Commissioner has more time to complete the disputes process. The time bar will not commence until 30 August 2010. 39.Where the Commissioner applies to the High Court under section 89N(3) for an order to truncate the disputes process, an assessment must be issued within the period as calculated under section 89N(5). Applying the same facts as in the above example, the Commissioner must issue an assessment to the taxpayer by 30 August 2010. WITHDRAWN
Standard practice statement SPS 16/02 Child Support and Domestic Maintenance – Amendments to Assessments INTRODUCTION Standard Practice Statements describe how the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) will exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. This Standard Practice Statement (SPS) sets out how the Commissioner will exercise the discretion under s 87 of the Child Support Act 1991 (the Act) to amend assessments for child support and domestic maintenance to give effect to the Act. This includes assessments the Commissioner makes as a result of a voluntary agreement entered into by parties. Throughout this SPS, references to “financial support” include child support and domestic maintenance. References to a “carer” includes both parent and non-parent carers. Unless specified otherwise, all legislative references in this SPS are to the Child Support Act 1991. APPLICATION This SPS applies from 30 May 2016. This SPS does not apply to requests to depart from the formula assessment of child support. If the parent or carer considers the formula assessment is not fair because it does not fit their particular circumstances, they can apply for an administrative review under Part 5A or 6A, or a departure under s 104. Section 87 cannot be used as an alternative to these processes. This SPS also does not apply to the amendment of the amount of outstanding child support debt or penalties where the calculation of child support was itself correct. This SPS should be read in conjunction with: IR174 Helping you to understand child support and the Family Court IR175 Helping you to understand child support reviews INLAND REVENUE RESTRICTED AND UNCLASSIFIED 1 IS 10/07 Care and management of the taxes covered by the Inland Revenue Acts – Section 6A(2) and (3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 22, No 10 (November 2010): 17) Status of the Commissioner’s advice (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 24, No 10 (December 2012): 86) If a customer is not satisfied with the level of service they receive from Inland Revenue, they can obtain more information about the Complaints Procedure at: http://www.ird.govt.nz/aboutir/who-we-are/structure/complaints/. STANDARD PRACTICE Summary 1. Section 87 of the Child Support Act 1991 gives the Commissioner a wide discretion to amend any assessment at any time where it is considered the changes are necessary to give effect to the Act. The amendments can apply to assessments for the current child support year, a future year, or to past years (in which case parties may receive, or be required to make, payments for previous years). A child support year runs from 1 April to 31 March of the following year. 2. The Commissioner is not limited as to the number of years for which past year assessments can be amended. In the past, Inland Revenue’s practice has been to amend all incorrect assessments over a number of years. The Commissioner no longer considers this to be the best approach for dealing with s 87 amendments, as it uses considerable Inland Revenue resources and also has the potential to create uncertainty for parents or carers. Instead, the practice now is for the Commissioner to consider the circumstances of individual cases before making changes to past years. This is because any changes will generally result in opposite effects for the parties involved. The liable parent will be required to pay more (or less) than originally assessed and the receiving carer will receive more (or less) than originally assessed. Changes to assessments could also result in the obligations of the parties being reversed, so that the receiving carer becomes the liable parent and vice versa. 3. There are a number of sections in the Act that specifically allow, and in some cases require, the Commissioner to amend an assessment. Section 87(3) also sets out situations where an assessment may be amended. The Commissioner may amend assessments in all of these cases, although assessments may also be amended outside of these specially defined cases. Section 87(4) and the opening words of s 87(3) make it clear that the Commissioner’s power to amend assessments is not limited. All that is required is that the amendment is necessary to give effect to the Act. 4. Sections 6 and 6A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 set out the Commissioner’s duties and responsibilities for the care and management of the various taxes. These provisions apply to child support, and the interpretation statement IS 10/07: Care and management of the taxes covered by the Inland Revenue Acts - section 6A(2) and (3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will also apply. 5. This SPS states that the Commissioner is to consider all amendment requests made by parents or carers and errors identified by Inland Revenue staff. Before an assessment is amended, the amendment must be considered necessary to give effect to the Act. When considering whether an assessment should be amended, INLAND REVENUE RESTRICTED AND UNCLASSIFIED 2 the Commissioner will consider the principles set out in this SPS. Not all assessments will necessarily be amended. 6. The time that an assessment is amended from will be determined by specific rules discussed below in \[25\], \[26\] and \[32(a)\]. These apply where the Commissioner considers the assessment should be amended, and where there has been a cessation event, a change in living circumstances, or an estimate and subsequent discovery of the correct taxable income by the Commissioner. 7. In all other cases, the time that the assessment is amended from will generally depend on when the particular change, event or error occurred (and therefore the assessment that it affects). If the change or event occurred in the current child support year, amendments will generally be made from the date that the particular change or event occurs. 8. Aside from the rules set out in \[25\] – \[27\], i f the assessment relates to a period before the current child support year, amendments will generally be made from the start of the current year (subject to specified exceptions set out in \[32\]). This ensures a consistent and impartial treatment to all child support customers. Detailed Discussion When can an assessment be amended under section 87? 9. Section 87 applies to assessments of child support and domestic maintenance. 10. An assessment of child support can arise from a formula assessment determined under Part 2 of the Act, the acceptance of a voluntary agreement entered into by parties under Part 3 of the Act, or a court maintenance order under Part 4 of the Act: a) A formula assessment may be amended when any of the components of the formula assessment change, or when the child ceases to be a qualifying child. This includes, but is not limited to, situations where: i. the income of one or both of the parents changes; ii. the qualifying child moves into a different age bracket; iii. the dependent child allowance changes (for example, if the number of dependent children changes, the care cost percentage changes, or the dependent children move into a different age bracket); iv. the multi-group allowance changes (for example, when the number of children in a parent’s other child support group changes); v. a change to the proportion of care that each parent or carer provides for the child (the care percentage) results in a change to the care cost percentage; vi. the qualifying child becomes financially independent; vii. the qualifying child lives with another person in a marriage, civil union or de facto relationship. It may also be necessary to amend an assessment where an independent decision has been made that an assessment should be amended. For example, an amendment may be necessary to comply with: viii. a court-ordered departure, or INLAND REVENUE RESTRICTED AND UNCLASSIFIED 3 ix. a departure made under an administrative review. b) An assessment may also be amended when the Commissioner accepts a voluntary agreement of child support that has been entered into by the parties. This includes, but is not limited to, situations where: i. the voluntary agreement between the parties is amended and the Commissioner accepts an application to administer the amended agreement; ii. a court makes an order to cancel, vary, extend or suspend a voluntary agreement under s 32(2)(d) of the Property (Relationships) Act 1976; iii. the payments under the voluntary agreement cease to be payable, for example, if the voluntary agreement expires. 11. An assessment of domestic maintenance can arise either from the acceptance of a voluntary agreement between parties, or from a court order. These assessments of domestic maintenance can be amended in various situations, including when: a) both parties agree to amend their voluntary agreement, or b) a court orders the amendment. 12. Amendments to child support assessments can either be initiated when the Commissioner becomes aware of new information affecting a child support assessment, or be requested by parents or carers (for example, after a change in circumstances that affects the calculation of financial support). 13. If a parent or carer considers that the formula assessment does not adequately take into account their circumstances, they can apply for a review. This is not covered by s 87 or this SPS. See principle (c) in \[23\] below, and the Inland Revenue guide IR175 Helping you to understand child support reviews for more information. Informing Inland Revenue about changes 14. A parent or receiving carer is required by law to advise Inland Revenue of any change in their living circumstances that may affect their care cost percentage, any allowances, or their multi-group cap (if applicable). 15. When a parent or carer becomes aware of any other change that may affect the amount of financial support they pay or receive, they should advise Inland Revenue at the earliest opportunity. This will ensure greater certainty for both parties. Furthermore, in some cases, failing to notify the Commissioner of changes is treated as an offence under s 208 of the Act. This inc ludes failing to notify the Commissioner of changes in living circumstances or of a change of address. 16. It is best for all parties to inform Inland Revenue promptly regarding possible changes to assessments. Certainty works both ways. The Commissioner retains the discretion to amend (or not to amend) assessments at any time. This means that if Inland Revenue is advised of a change in circumstances well after the change or event took place, the Commissioner may consider the assessment should not be amended. Conversely, there may be good reason for the assessment to be amended and this could result in significant changes to an assessment at a later time. Advising Inland Revenue of changes as they come to light results in greater certainty of payments of financial support for all parties. INLAND REVENUE RESTRICTED AND UNCLASSIFIED 4 What information should be provided to Inland Revenue? 17. When advising the Commissioner about a change that could affect an assessment, the parent or carer should provide as much information and evidence as possible. Where relevant, the following information should be provided: a. A description of the event or change, including the background circumstances. b. The dates of events that affect the assessment. c. How the change or event was identified. d. If the amendment relates to a prior child support year and the Commissioner was not notified within 28 days of the change/event, an explanation of the delay in notifying Inland Revenue. In addition, the parent or carer should provide any other evidence they consider relevant. This may help to ensure the amendment request progresses more efficiently as the Commissioner may not need to request further evidence from the parent or carer. What is relevant will depend on the amendment being requested. In some instances, the Commissioner may verify information provided by the requesting party with other sources of information. 18. The Commissioner has secrecy obligations under part 4 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and s 240 of the Child Support Act 1991 and therefore may not be able to divulge information provided by another party (including other parents or carers in the child support relationship). 19. There are exceptions to this. For example, s 240(2) specifically sets out communications that are permitted. Another example is s 96H which applies under an administrative review and allows the Commissioner to send documentation to the other parties to the application for the administrative review. 20. To ensure the Commissioner has the correct information and is able to make an accurate assessment, it is important that all available relevant information and supporting evidence is provided. The Commissioner may also ask for evidence for specific periods of time. 21. The Commissioner is legally able to act on the basis of the documents and information held by Inland Revenue, and is not required to conduct any enquiries or investigations or to require that any further information be supplied. However, the Commissioner will not amend an assessment where it is reasonably suspected that the information provided by a parent or carer may be false. To ensure the Commissioner has complete information, parents or carers should, as far as possible, proactively provide all relevant information. Principles 22. An amendment to an assessment can only be made under s 87 if the Commissioner considers the amendment necessary to give effect to the Act. This will include amendments required to give effect to a formula assessment, a voluntary agreement accepted by the Commissioner, a court order or a legislative exemption under Part 5A of the Act. 23. The Commissioner is not required to, and will not necessarily, amend all assessments that are incorrect. As part of the care and management obligations, INLAND REVENUE RESTRICTED AND UNCLASSIFIED 5 the Commissioner will weigh up a number of principles to decide whether to amend an assessment. These principles are explained below. Note that these principles are not listed in order of importance. The principles that apply and the weighting that they are given will depend on the particular fact situation. (a) Giving effect to the Act This involves considering what provision of the Act the amendment would give effect to. In many instances, even where it requires an assessment to be amended, the Act also provides a discretion for the Commissioner as to when to make the amendment. The objects of the Act (set out in s 4) are: • to affirm the right of children to be maintained by their parents • to affirm the obligation of parents to maintain their children • to provide that the level of financial support to be provided by parents for their children is to be determined according to their relative capacity to provide financial support and their relative levels of provision of care • to ensure that parents with a like capacity to provide financial support for their children should provide like amounts of financial support • to provide legislatively fixed standards in accordance with which the level of financial support to be provided by parents for their children should be determined • to affirm the right of carers who provide significant care to children to receive financial support in respect of those children from a parent or parents of the children • to enable carers of children to receive support in respect of those children from parents without the need to resort to court proceedings • to ensure that equity exists between parents and, where applicable, carers, in respect of the costs of supporting children • to ensure that obligations to birth and adopted children are not extinguished by obligations to stepchildren • to ensure that the costs to the State of providing an adequate level of financial support for children and their carers is offset by the collection of a fair contribution from liable parents • to provide a system whereby child support and domestic maintenance payments can be collected by the Crown, and paid by the Crown to those entitled to the money. Therefore, the Commissioner must consider whether the objects will be met if either the status quo is retained and no amendment is made or the amendment is made to the assessment. There are three situations where the current practice focuses on giving effect to the Act. First, where there has been a change in living circumstances, s 82 sets out the rules that must be applied for amending assessments. These rules are discussed further in \[25\]. Second, where the Commissioner has previously estimated taxable income under s 39 and later ascertains the correct amount of income, the assessment will be amended as if the correct amount is, and always has been, the person’s taxable income. This is discussed further in \[26\]. INLAND REVENUE RESTRICTED AND UNCLASSIFIED 6 Third, where there has been an event that means the liability to pay child support has ceased, the assessment must be amended. This applies to three situations: first, where there is a formula assessment and one of the events in s 25 of the Act has occurred ; second, where there is a voluntary agreement and one of the events in s 62 of the Act has occurred; and third, where there is a court order in force and an event under s 71(c) or (d) of the Act has occurred. The Commissioner will amend from the date that the cessation event took place unless, after considering the other principles listed below, there are overriding reasons to amend from a different date. (b) Length of time since the change or event Generally, the older the period of reassessment, the less likely it is that an amendment will be made. This is because facts and circumstances are often harder to establish, making it difficult for the parties to provide reliable evidence to help substantiate a reassessment. The Commissioner will consider the parent or carer’s disclosure of information. In particular, where there has been a delay in informing Inland Revenue of the change or event, the Commissioner will consider the reasons for the delay. A parent or carer is expected to promptly notify the Commissioner of changes or events that affect a child support assessment. (c) Other administrative options available Where a parent or carer considers that the formula assessment calculated under the Act is not fair because it does not fit their particular circumstances, they can apply for an administrative review or a departure order. The rules relating to administrative reviews and departure orders are contained in Parts 6A, 6B and 7 of the Act. Section 87 cannot be used as an alternative to these processes. For further information on these processes, see the Inland Revenue publications IR174 Helping you to understand child support and the Family Court, and IR175 He lping you to understand child support reviews, available at www.ird.govt.nz (keywords: IR174 or IR175). (d) Complexity The law relating to the proposed or requested amendment must be clear and unambiguous. The Commissioner will not make an amendment where there is a complex, unresolved issue (for example, issues that are before a court or covered only by proposed new legislation yet to be passed by Parliament). (e) Events or changes in the intervening years When considering an amendment to a past-year assessment, the Commissioner will consider whether the parent or carer’s situation is likely to have significantly changed over the period. For example, while an event requiring an assessment to be amended may have occurred five years ago, another change may have occurred three years ago that means the original amendment is not required to the same extent. Making a retrospective amendment to a previous assessment might only be fair if the assessments for the intervening periods are also made. INLAND REVENUE RESTRICTED AND UNCLASSIFIED 7 (f) Voluntary compliance Where possible, any decision to amend an assessment should not discourage the voluntary compliance of parents and carers with their legal obligations, including their obligations to provide information. (g) Compliance costs One of the care and management principles to be taken into account by the Commissioner when deciding whether to amend an assessment is the effect on compliance costs for the parents or carers. (h) Vexatious requests Amendment requests that relate to very small amounts of financial support, or requests that the Commissioner considers to be vexatious in nature, will not usually be agreed to. Whether an amount is a “very small amount” will depend on the facts of the case, the assessment period being considered and the circumstances of the individuals involved. (i) Fraudulent or misleading behaviour Assessments will be considered for amendment in all cases where it is suspected that the Commissioner has been fraudulently or wil fully misled in order to prevent the activity resulting in a benefit to the fraudulent party. This maintains the integrity of the tax system and adheres to the concept of fairness by treating all customers that fall into this category equally. Where fraudulent or misleading behaviour is suspected, any proposed amendment will first be reviewed by a Team Leader or a Technical and Service Advisor (or higher) before it is made. This is to ensure that a stricter process is followed by Inland Revenue where an assertion of fraudulent or misleading behaviour exists, and because such cases typically involve more complicated facts. (j) Effect of the error on future assessments As far as possible, assessments should be correct. Where an error or a change in circumstances has occurred in the past that, if left uncorrected, would affect future assessments, this suggests the amendment should be made. Similarly, where an error occurred in the past, but the circumstances of the parents/carers have now changed so that the error is no longer applicable to their current assessment, this may suggest the amendment is less important. (k) Inland Revenue communications If the Commissioner is persuaded that the parent or carer has made an error as a direct result of relying on advice given to them by Inland Revenue officers, favourable consideration may be given to the exercise of the discretion. (l) Party ultimately affected Changes to assessments of child support will generally result in opposite effects for the two parties – eg, if the liable parent is required to pay more (or less) than originally assessed, then the receiving carer will receive more (or less) than originally assessed. INLAND REVENUE RESTRICTED AND UNCLASSIFIED 8 A consequence of the amendment may be that the obligations between the parties are reversed, so that the receiving carer becomes the liable parent, and the liable parent becomes the receiving carer. On the other hand, it is not always the parent or carer themselves who are better or worse off. In some cases, where the parent or carer is the recipient of a benefit, the Government is the affected party. The Government is to be treated with no more or less importance than a natural person carer or parent. (m) Resources It is important to recognise that Inland Revenue does not have unlimited resources. The Commissioner must balance the time spent considering amendments to financial support with the time spent on other activities, and thereby meet the obligation under s 6(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to protect the integrity of the tax system. The Commissioner will be reluctant to make amendments where they would require the use of disproportionate amounts of Inland Revenue’s resources. This is not to say that the Commissioner will only use minimal resources to determine whether to make amendments or will never agree to complex amendment requests. The extent and relevance of a parent or carer’s disclosure will help the Commissioner determine the amount of resources needed to consider amendment requests. Ultimately, the allocation of resources will be determined on a case-by-case basis. As noted in principle (h), amendment requests that relate to very small amounts of financial support will not usually be agreed to. Whether an amount is a “very small amount” will depend on the facts of the case, the assessment period being considered and the circumstances of the individuals involved. To assist in the consideration of any amendment request, parents or carers should provide sufficient relevant information with their request to ensure that the facts and laws relating to the errors are clear and unambiguous. Determining unresolved factual or legal issues may require disproportionate amounts of Inland Revenue’s resources such that an amendment request might be declined irrespective of the dollar amounts involved. (n) Applying consistency In general, where a change is going to affect more than one assessment or have more than one effect on an assessment, these amendments should be made consistently. (o) Agreement between the parties In the case of a voluntary agreement of financial support, an assessment is likely to be amended where all parties to the agreement mutually agree on an amendment. Similarly, where parties to a formula assessment of child support mutually agree that an amendment should or should not be made, and no Crown monies are at stake, this may be taken into account by the Commissioner. INLAND REVENUE RESTRICTED AND UNCLASSIFIED 9 24. After considering the principles above, when the Commissioner decides that an assessment will be amended, all parties to the child support relationship will be notified where possible. When a decision is made not to amend an assessment, generally only the party who made the request will be notified. Date to amend assessment(s) from Changes in living circumstances 25. Where there is a change in living circumstances, s 82 of the Act applies and the following rules apply. Every receiving carer must advise the Commissioner of any change in their living circumstances if it affects the determination of their care cost percentage. Every parent must advise the Commissioner of any change in their living circumstances that affects the determination of their care cost percentage, their appropriate living allowance, any dependent child allowance, any person’s multi-group allowance, or any person’s multi-group cap. The rules for when these changes are treated as occurring are set out below. Date to amend assessments for change in living circumstances - Ordinary rules Where the Commissioner is satisfied that a change of living circumstances has occurred, the assessment will be amended with effect from the date of the change where: (i) the Commissioner was notified of the change within 28 days of the date on which the change occurred; (ii) the change relates to a liable parent and it has the effect of increasing the amount of the parent’s child support liability; or (iii) the change relates to a receiving carer and it has the effect of decreasing the amount of child support payable in respect of that carer. Where the Commissioner is satisfied that a change of living circumstances has occurred, the amendment will apply from the date that the notice of the change was received where: (i) the change relates to a liable parent and it has the effect of decreasing the amount of the parent’s child support liability; or (ii) the change relates to a receiving carer and it has the effect of increasing the amount of child support payable in respect of that carer. However, as noted above, if the Commissioner was notified within 28 days of the date on which the change occurred, then the change is treated as having occurred on the date of the change. The application of the rules above may result in changes to assessments from previous years. Conflicting dates Where two or more parties notify the Commissioner outside the 28 day period and the application of the ordinary rules above would mean that the same change is treated as having occurred on different days for different people, the change will be INLAND REVENUE RESTRICTED AND UNCLASSIFIED 10 effective for all parties from the first date that notice was given to the Commissioner. Where at least one party notifies the Commissioner within 28 days of the event and at least one party notifies the Commissioner outside the 28 day period and the application of the ordinary rules above would mean that the same change is treated as having occurred on different days for different people, the change will be effective from the date of the change. Estimating taxable income 26. Section 39 provides that where the Commissioner has requested certain income information to be provided and the person has failed to provide that information, the Commissioner may estimate the taxable income for that person and make an assessment on the basis of that estimate. If the Commissioner later ascertains the person’s correct taxable income, the Commissioner is required to amend the formula assessment as if the newly ascertained amount is, and always has been, the person’s taxable income. End of year reconciliations 27. Where a parent or carer has estimated their income, an end-of -year reconciliation will be performed that may result in previous years’ assessments being amended. General rules 28. The words as the Commissioner considers necessary in s 87 indicate that it is for the Commissioner to determine when an amendment is required and to what extent. It follows that there will be situations where the Commissioner does not consider an amendment necessary or that a partial amendment would be appropriate. 29. When considering whether to amend an assessment, emotive considerations cannot be taken into account. The Child Support Act considers financial considerations and is not directly concerned with welfare issues; these are dealt with by other legislation. 30. For all decisions whether to amend an assessment, Inland Revenue will record notes in its internal system that set out the reasons for the decision. 31. If the Commissioner considers an amendment should be made, the extent to which assessments will be amended depends on the period in which the change or event occurred (and therefore the assessment that it affects). Where the change or event occurred in the current child support year, amendments will generally be made from the date that the particular change or event occurred . 32. Aside from the rules set out in \[25\]–\[27\] above, where the change or event affects assessments that are prior to the current child support year, amendments will generally be made from the start of the current year, and only the current year assessment will be amended. This is to ensure a consistent and impartial treatment to all child support customers, but is subject to the exceptions below. (a) Exception 1: Cessation event. Where the liability to pay financial support has ended after one of the events outlined in ss 25, 62, or 71(c) or (d) has occurred, the assessment will be amended from the date that the cessation event took place unless, after considering the other principles listed above, INLAND REVENUE RESTRICTED AND UNCLASSIFIED 11 there are overriding reasons to amend from a different date. However, where the assessment is at the minimum level and, with the amendment, would remain at the minimum level, then the assessment will only be amended from the start of the current child support year. (b) Exception 2: This exception applies if a change took place in a child support year up to and including the year ending 31 March 2015 and that change relates to a dependent child who was included in a living allowance and who has now turned 19. Unless there are exceptional circumstances that warrant a different date to be used, the assessment will be amended from the date the child turned 19. Inland Revenue considers that it is reasonable to expect that, where a child included in a living allowance turns 19, the parents should notify Inland Revenue. They should not benefit where they have failed to do so. However, where the assessment is at the minimum level and, with the amendment would remain at the minimum level, then the assessment will only be amended from the start of the current child support year. (c) Exception 3: Where there are exceptional or special circumstances that justify a different amendment date. The Commissioner would need a good reason to be satisfied that the circumstances are in fact exceptional to justify deviating from the ordinary process, and higher internal processes would need to be followed (eg, higher delegations, written submission required). One example of an exceptional circumstance is where there are multiple changes that affect the same assessment and, individually, not all the changes result in the same amendments or not from the same point in time.

Section 82: Parents and receiving carers to advise Commissioner of changes (1) For the purpose of enabling the Commissioner to make or amend a calculation of child support payable in respect of a child in any child support year under a formula assessment, every parent and every receiving carer of the child must advise the Commissioner of any change in the parent’s or carer’s living circumstances occurring during the child support year that affects, or may affect, any of the following: (a) in relation to parents and non-parent carers, the determination of the person’s care cost percentage: (b) in relation only to parents, the following: (i) the person’s appropriate living allowance: (ii) the application or calculation of any dependent child allowance (if any): (iii) the application or calculation of any person’s multi-group allowance (if any): (iv) the application or calculation of any person’s multi-group cap (if applicable). (2) If the Commissioner is satisfied that a relevant change of living circumstances has occurred, the change is to be treated as having occurred— (a) on the date on which the change occurred, in any of the following cases: (i) in relation to a liable parent, where the change has the effect of increasing the amount of the parent’s child support liability: (ii) in relation to a receiving carer, where the change has the effect of decreasing the amount of child support payable in respect of that carer: (iii) where notice of the change is received by the Commissioner within 28 days after the date on which the change occurred; or (b) on the date on which the Commissioner receives notice of the change, in either of the following cases (unless paragraph (a)(iii) applies): INLAND REVENUE RESTRICTED AND UNCLASSIFIED 16 (i) in relation to a liable parent, where the change has the effect of decreasing the amount of the parent’s child support liability: (ii) in relation to a receiving carer, where the change has the effect of increasing the amount of child support payable in respect of that carer. (3) Every notification of a change must be accompanied by such documentation as the Commissioner requires. (4) The Commissioner may disregard subsection (2), and may determine the date on which a particular change in living circumstances is to be treated as having occurred, in any case where 2 or more people give notice under this section relating to the same change, and the application of subsection (2) would result in the same change having to be treated as having occurred on different days in relation to different people. Section 86: Commissioner to give effect to changed circumstances (1) Where child support is payable in respect of a qualifying child and the Commissioner is notified, or otherwise becomes aware,— (a) that the liability of a liable parent to pay child support to a carer in respect of the child has ceased in accordance with section 25 or 62; or (b) that an event or change of circumstances has occurred that alters the respective liability or entitlement of any parent or carer of the qualifying child,— the Commissioner shall, as soon as practicable, take such action as is necessary to take account of the event or change in circumstances (whether by amending any assessment or otherwise). (2) Where domestic maintenance is payable by a liable spouse or partner under a voluntary agreement or an order of the court and either— (a) payment is to cease, or the rate of payment is to reduce, on a particular day in accordance with that agreement or order; or (b) the Commissioner is notified, or otherwise becomes aware,— (i) of the death of either party to the agreement; or (ii) that an event or change of circumstances has occurred that affects the annual rate at which domestic maintenance is payable under this Act,— the Commissioner shall, as soon as practicable, take such action as is necessary to take account of the event or change in circumstances (whether by amending any assessment or otherwise). (3) Nothing in subsection (1) or subsection (2) is to be taken to prevent the Commissioner from taking such action as the Commissioner considers appropriate to take account of the likely occurrence of an event or change of circumstances of which the Commissioner is notified or otherwise becomes aware (whether by amending any assessment or otherwise). INLAND REVENUE RESTRICTED AND UNCLASSIFIED 17 Section 87: Amendment of assessments (1) The Commissioner may, at any time, amend any assessment by making such alterations and additions as the Commissioner considers necessary to give effect to this Act. (2) Subsection (1) has effect despite the fact that— (a) child support or, as the case may be, domestic maintenance has been paid under the assessment; or (b) the child support year, or the part of the child support year, to which the assessment relates has ended; or (c) proceedings are pending in a court having jurisdiction under this Act against or in relation to the assessment. (3) Without limiting subsection (1), the Commissioner may amend any assessment for the purpose of— (a) correcting any error or mistake (whether or not made by the Commissioner); or (b) correcting the effect of any false or misleading statement made to the Commissioner; or (c) giving effect to the happening of an event or change of circumstances to which the provisions of section 86 apply; or (d) giving effect to a formula assessment of child support by the Commissioner; or (da) giving effect to Part 5A; or (e) giving effect to the acceptance of a voluntary agreement by the Commissioner; or (ea) giving effect to a determination of the Commissioner under Part 6A or 6B; or (f) giving effect to a decision or order of a court under Part 7. (4) Where a provision of this Act expressly authorises the Commissioner to amend an assessment, that provision does not by implication limit the power of the Commissioner (whether under this section or otherwise) to amend the assessment. (5) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Act, every amended assessment is to be taken to be an assessment for all the purposes of this Act. (6) In any case where— (a) child support or domestic maintenance payable under an amended assessment is increased after the due date; and (b) the Commissioner is satisfied that the matter giving rise to the increase did not result from any neglect or default by the person who is required to pay that child support or that domestic maintenance under the amended assessment,— that person— (c) shall pay by the due date the amount that would have been payable if the increase had not taken effect; and (d) shall pay the amount of the increase within 30 days after the date of the amended assessment,— and the Commissioner shall fix that date as the new due date for payment.

INLAND REVENUE RESTRICTED AND UNCLASSIFIED 22
CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 1 Standard practice statement SPS 16/03 Notification of a pending audit or investigation INTRODUCTION Standard Practice Statements describe how the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. This statement sets out the Commissioner’s practice for notifying taxpayers of a pending audit or investigation or advising them that one has begun. For many taxpayers, notification of an audit will be by letter without any prior contact by Inland Revenue on the matter. For the purposes of this statement, the words “audit” and “investigation” have the same effect. Inland Revenue may undertake a variety of tasks to review a taxpayer’s compliance with their tax obligations, but these will all be referred to here as “audits”. Not all contact by Inland Revenue officers with a taxpayer, or the taxpayer’s agent, relates to an audit or will necessarily lead to one. An officer may contact a taxpayer (or their agent) for information where no decision has been made to audit them. General enquiries by Inland Revenue officers are not considered part of an audit unless the taxpayer has been clearly notified that an audit is pending or that one has begun. Taxpayers will be encouraged to voluntarily disclose any errors or omissions. Section references are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the TAA) unless otherwise stated. The relevant provision is s 141G. It is reproduced in the appendix to this statement. APPLICATION This statement applies from 17 June 2016 and replaces SPS 07/02 Notification of a pending audit or investigation, which was issued in April 2007. This statement should be read with SPS 09/02 Voluntary Disclosures (or any subsequent statement issued in replacement). CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 2 STANDARD PRACTICE Summary 1. Inland Revenue makes a variety of enquiries of taxpayers that may or may not be related to a pending or existing audit. 2. Inland Revenue will clearly notify a taxpayer when they are about to be audited or advise them when an audit has begun. This notification will specifically use the word “audit” or “investigation”. 3. Notification of pending or existing audits will meet the requirements of sections 14 to 14G of the TAA and will be in writing and communicated by post, by facsimile, by personal delivery, or by electronic means. Detailed Discussion 4. A number of situations have arisen where it was disputed whether the taxpayer was entitled to a reduction of a shortfall penalty. These situations show a need for Inland Revenue to communicate clearly when notifying taxpayers of a pending audit or that one has begun. 5. This statement also clarifies when notification is expected to be given. It clarifies when enquiries made by Inland Revenue are likely to be for information gathering purposes only and when the enquiry is likely to be part of a pending or existing audit. 6. Modern tax administration practices recognise that taxpayers have the best information about their own activities. Taxpayers are generally better placed than the Commissioner to assess their tax liabilities by making the appropriate calculations and furnishing their returns. 7. The voluntary disclosure rules provide an incentive to taxpayers to determine their tax liability correctly. The incentives in those rules reflect the savings to Inland Revenue from auditing taxpayers where a voluntary disclosure has been made. They also acknowledge the co-operation of those taxpayers who have made a voluntary disclosure. 8. The voluntary disclosure rules are based around the timing of notification by the Commissioner that an audit is pending or that one has begun. Where a voluntary disclosure is made before that notice is given, a taxpayer qualifies for the greatest reduction in shortfall penalties for which they may be liable. The reductions can be 100% or 75% of the shortfall penalty, depending on the relevant type of penalty. 9. However, a person can still qualify for a lesser reduction of 40% where a voluntary disclosure is made after that notification but before the time specified in s 141G(5). That section provides that an audit starts at the earlier of (a) the end of the first interview, and (b) the time when an officer inspects information and the taxpayer is notified of the inspection. This is known as a post-notification disclosure. Note, in relation to s 141G(5)(b), that Inland Revenue will give written notice that the records are being inspected upon the commencement of that inspection. It is not necessary that the records being inspected have been collected subsequent to the initial notification of audit. Until the notification of inspection is given, or the first CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 3 interview has ended, a taxpayer will still qualify for a post-notification disclosure reduction of shortfall penalties. 10. It is therefore important to clarify when it is expected that notices will be given and how to recognise them. What is an audit or investigation? 11. The words “audit” and “investigation” are not specifically defined in the tax legislation. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary (11 th ed, Oxford University Press, New York, 2004) defines “audit” as “an official inspection of an organisation’s accounts, typically by an independent body”, and “investigate” as to “carry out a systematic or formal inquiry into (an incident or allegation) so as to establish the truth.” 12. In a tax context, Inland Revenue views an audit as an examination of a taxpayer’s financial affairs to verify that they have paid the correct amount of tax and complied with their tax obligations as required by law. 13. For further information about audits, please see Inland Revenue’s guide, IR297 Inland Revenue audits - Information for taxpayers. This is available on our website at http://www.ird.govt.nz/forms-guides/number/forms-200-299/ir297-guide-ir- audits.html When will notification be given? 14. Not all contact that Inland Revenue has with taxpayers will relate to an audit. 15. Although the Commissioner is not required either to alert taxpayers when she is considering whether to audit them or to advise them that an audit has begun, the Commissioner’s practice is that a taxpayer will generally be given notice, in writing, advising them that they have been selected for an audit, or that an audit is underway. The notice will set out which areas of their tax affairs are being audited. Taxpayers will also be informed of the direction and focus of an audit as it progresses. If the audit’s scope widens during the audit and other tax types and/or periods are to be reviewed, the taxpayer will be promptly notified of this change. 16. Instances where no notice will be given will be limited but may include where:  the visit is intended to be unannounced, such as a spot check;  Inland Revenue holds anonymous information;  there are strong indications the taxpayer is involved in an aggressive tax practice;  it is impractical to send a letter due to time constraints. 17. Notwithstanding \[8\], where the Commissioner establishes a tax shortfall but no notice was given, a taxpayer will not qualify for a pre-notification or post-notification disclosure reduction in shortfall penalties. This is because a taxpayer cannot disclose a tax shortfall when Inland Revenue has already identified the shortfall and advised them of it. Situations that are not audits 18. Inland Revenue often contacts taxpayers for information omitted or incorrectly entered on filed returns to enable the self-assessment process to be completed. CLASSIFIED PUBLIC 4 19. Inland Revenue officers often call taxpayers for background information on GST returns without having decided whether to carry out an audit. These situations are not considered part of an audit unless the taxpayer has been clearly notified that an audit is pending or that one has begun. 20. Inland Revenue officers routinely request information from various sources, including individual taxpayers, to research and prioritise tax compliance risk areas. This activity is often referred to as risk review. In these circumstances, the purpose of the Inland Revenue officer’s enquiry is to collect information and their contact with taxpayers is neither an audit nor notification of a pending audit. 21. Information gathered through risk review activities allows Inland Revenue to consider the level of risk of a particular taxpayer, taking into account that taxpayer's approach to determining their tax position. Audit activity, on the other hand, involves examining the tax position itself, having already decided to audit that tax position. 22. As discussed earlier, a taxpayer will qualify for a pre-notification disclosure reduction of shortfall penalties up until the point that the taxpayer has been notified in writing that an audit is pending or is notified that one has begun. Notice of Audit 23. Inland Revenue officers will clearly communicate the purpose of their contacts with taxpayers and their agents. When Inland Revenue contacts taxpayers or their agents to notify of a pending audit or to advise that one has begun, the communication will use the word “audit” or “investigation”. That notification will only occur once a decision has been made to audit the taxpayer. 24. The communication will be in writing and is considered to be given when that written notification is received by the taxpayer. It will be communicated in terms of section 14C of the TAA by post, by facsimile, personal delivery, or by electronic means. Up until that time, a taxpayer can still qualify for a pre-notification disclosure reduction of shortfall penalties. 25. Audits sometimes involve considering compliance by other parties that are connected. For example, a partnership and the individual partners, a company and its shareholders.

Payment of shortfall penalty using losses
=========================================

SPS 16/04 sets out the law allowing a taxpayer to use tax losses in payment of a shortfall penalty imposed on an income tax liability.

### Introduction

Standard practice statements (SPS) describe how the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) will exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts.

This SPS sets out the Commissioner’s application of the law in section IW 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section IW 1 allows a taxpayer to use tax losses in payment of a shortfall penalty imposed on an income tax liability.

Unless specified otherwise, all legislative references in this SPS are to the Income Tax Act 2007 (the Act).

### Application

This SPS applies from 1 November 2016 and replaces SPS INV-245 _Payment of shortfall penalty using losses (Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 10, No 3 (March 1998)).

### Standard practice

### Summary

1.  Section IW 1 applies in a tax year a person has a shortfall penalty imposed for an income tax liability.
2.  A person who has a tax loss for the tax year (ie the year that the shortfall penalty is imposed) may choose to use some or all of the amount of the loss to pay all or part of the shortfall penalty.
3.  A person’s tax loss for the tax year includes losses carried forward from previous tax years plus any net loss that the person has for the tax year.
4.  The person must notify the Commissioner that they choose to use the loss to pay the shortfall penalty by the due date for payment of the penalty. The person may notify by post, facsimile, personal delivery, or by electronic means if the person complies with the provisions of the Electronic Transactions Act 2002.
5.  The amount of any tax loss that is used to pay a shortfall penalty cannot be used or carried forward from the date of notification.
6.  The shortfall penalty must be for an income tax liability. Losses cannot be used to pay a shortfall penalty in relation to a non-income tax liability, for instance goods and services tax (GST) or fringe benefit tax (FBT).
7.  If a company that is part of a wholly-owned group of companies has a tax loss, the wholly-owned group may use the loss to pay the penalty imposed on:
    *   the company or
    *   another company that is part of the same groupupon notification to the Commissioner by the due date for payment of the penalty (subject to the shareholder continuity rules).
8.  For individuals, each dollar of an amount of a loss that is used to pay a shortfall penalty is equal to $1 multiplied by the lowest marginal tax rate that would apply to a person if they had tax to pay in the year the tax shortfall is for.
9.  For other entities, each dollar of an amount of a loss that is used to pay a shortfall penalty is equal to $1 multiplied by the rate of tax that would apply to the entity if it had tax to pay in the year the tax shortfall is for.

### Detailed discussion

10.  Section IW 1(1) of the Act states that section IW 1 applies in a tax year a person has a shortfall penalty for an income tax liability in. The term “income tax liability” is defined in section YA 1 and relevantly means an income tax liability for a person and a tax year calculated under subpart BC - Calculating and satisfying income tax liabilities. So section IW 1 only applies in situations where a shortfall penalty has been imposed for income tax. Section IW 1 will not apply when a shortfall penalty has been imposed on a non-income tax liability, for example, goods and services tax (GST) or fringe benefit tax (FBT).
11.  Section IW 1(2) states that if a person has a tax loss for the tax year they may use the amount of the loss to pay the shortfall penalty. This includes using part of the tax loss and paying any part of the shortfall penalty.
12.  The reference to “the tax year” is to the tax year the shortfall penalty is imposed in. For example a shortfall penalty is applied on a tax shortfall for the 2014 tax year. The penalty is imposed on 15 September 2016. The tax year for the purposes of section IW 1 is the 2017 tax year (1 April 2016 - 31 March 2017).

#### Available losses

13.  A “tax loss” for the tax year is defined in section IA 2 of the Act. It includes losses brought forward from previous tax years and either reduced by the net income for the tax year or added to the net loss for the tax year.
14.  The losses that a person may use to pay their shortfall penalty are losses carried forward and still available from years previous to the year that the shortfall penalty is imposed together with any loss incurred in the tax year it was imposed in.
15.  In practice at the time a shortfall penalty is imposed and payable in a tax year the final tax loss for that year will have yet to be confirmed. However a person who reasonably expects that they will have a tax loss for the tax year that the shortfall penalty is imposed will be able to notify the Commissioner that they choose to use the tax loss in payment of the shortfall penalty.
16.  For example, a person has their 2014 tax assessment amended by the Commissioner and incurs a tax shortfall. A shortfall penalty of $5,000 is imposed on the tax shortfall for the 2014 tax year on 1 July 2016 (the 2017 tax year). The due date for payment of the shortfall penalty is 29 August 2016 . Losses carried forward from the 2016 tax year are $3,000 and the person expects they will have a net loss for the 2017 tax year of $2,000, a total tax loss for the 2017 tax year of $5,000. The person notifies the Commissioner on 31 July 2016 that they choose to pay the shortfall penalty using their tax losses. The losses that can be used in the payment of a shortfall penalty will be the loss carried forward of $3,000 from the 2016 tax year and the expected loss of $2,000 for the 2017 tax year.
17.  Where the tax loss for the tax year is later confirmed to be insufficient to pay the shortfall penalty, the person’s account will be adjusted. Late payment penalties and use-of-money interest will apply from the due date for payment of the shortfall penalty (29 August 2016 in the above example) to the date that the taxpayer pays the outstanding balance.
18.  The amount of any tax loss that is used to pay a shortfall penalty cannot be used or carried forward from the date of notification.

#### Notification

19.  The person must notify the Commissioner that they choose to use their loss to pay the shortfall penalty by the due date for payment of the penalty. A shortfall penalty is generally due on the due date for the payment of the unpaid tax. However when the penalty is subject to dispute, the due date is the due date for payment of deferrable tax, generally by the 30th day after the last day of the relevant period of deferral.
20.  "Notify" has the meanings set out in sections 14C and 14F of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“TAA”). These sections are applicable where a provision such as section IW 1(2) requires a person to notify the Commissioner. Together, these sections allow that person to communicate with the Commissioner by post, facsimile, or personal delivery or by electronic means if the person complies with the provisions of the Electronic Transactions Act 2002. So a person wishing to use their loss to pay a shortfall penalty (in whole or part) must notify the Commissioner using one of the means allowed by sections 14C and 14F of the TAA.

#### Wholly-owned group of companies

21.  If a company is part of a wholly-owned group of companies and has a tax loss for a tax year, the wholly-owned group may use the amount of the loss to pay a shortfall penalty imposed on the company or on another company in the group on notification to the Commissioner by the due date for the payment of the penalty.
22.  A company’s available tax loss for a tax year is subject to the shareholder continuity requirement. Losses incurred before a continuity breach cannot be carried forward and used in later years but are available to be offset against a shortfall penalty applied to a tax year that is before the breach occurred.
23.  For example, in 2017 a taxpayer has incurred losses of:
    *   $10,000 in the 2014 tax year,
    *   $10,000 in the 2015, and
    *   $10,000 in the 2016 tax year.There was a continuity breach at the end of 2014 (when the taxpayer acquired all the shares in the company). This breach means that the 2014 losses cannot be carried forward and in 2016 the taxpayer has only $20,000 losses available to offset ($10,000 losses carried forward from 2015 and current year loss of $10,000). The 2014 tax year loss of $10,000 is restricted to 2014 use only.

#### Loss conversion

24.  For individuals, each dollar of the loss that is used is equal to $1 multiplied by the lowest marginal rate of tax that would apply if the individual had tax to pay in the year the tax shortfall is for. For other entities each dollar of the loss that is used is equal to $1 multiplied by the rate of tax that would apply if the entity had tax to pay in the year that the tax shortfall relates.
25.  For example, if an individual has $10,000 of tax losses available and their lowest marginal tax rate for the year is 10.5%, they will be able to pay shortfall penalties amounting to $1,050 (10,000 x 0.105). If a company has $20,000 of tax losses available they will be able to pay shortfall penalties amounting to $5,600 (20,000 x 0.28). A trust with tax losses available of $15,000 will be able to pay shortfall penalties amounting to $4,950 (15,000 x 0.33).

#### Part payment

26.  A person may use their losses in part payment of a shortfall penalty. Notification that they wish to use their losses to part pay the penalty must be received by the Commissioner by the due date for payment of the penalty. The remainder of the liability can be satisfied by the usual means (for example, cash, cheque or credit card) or the person may apply for financial relief if payment of the remaining debt is going to put the person in financial difficulties.

This Standard Practice Statement is signed on 13th October 2016.

Standard practice statement SPS 17/01 Income equalisation deposits and refunds Introduction St andard practice statements describe how the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) will exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. This standard practice statement (“SPS”) sets out the Commissioner’s practice in regard to the statutory powers to accept income equalisation deposits for a tax year outside the specified period, and to accept refund applications for a tax year outside the specified period. Un less specified otherwise, all legislative references in this SPS refer to the Income Tax Act 2007 (“ITA ”). Application This SPS applies from 7 August 201 7 and replaces SPS 05/09 Income equalisation deposits and refunds issued in September 2005. The S PS applies to income equalisation deposits and refunds made under: •the main income equalisation scheme (under sections EH 3 to EH 37), and •the thinning operations income equalisation scheme (under sections EH 65 to EH 81). How ever, it does not apply to: •th e adverse event income equalisation scheme (under section EH 38 to EH 64) •refunds from the main income equalisation account to: opersons who retire, die or are adjudicated bankrupt (under section EH 17 to EH 24), or ocompanies that are put into liquidation (under section EH 25 and EH 26) •refunds from the thinning operations income equalisation account to companies that carry on a forestry business in New Zealand and are put into liquidation (under section EH 77 and EH 78). WITHDRAWN - replaced by SPS 19/03 Standard Practice Summary Deposits 1. Eligible taxpayers may make a deposit into the applicable income equalisation scheme. 2. To be deductible in an accounting year, the deposit must be received by the Commissioner: • within the accounting year • within the specified period after the end of the accounting year, or • within a time after the end of the specified period for an accounting year that the Commissioner allows in a case or class of cases (a “late deposit”). 3. If the deposit is made within or after the specified period for an accounting year the taxpayer must, at the time the deposit is made, notify the Commissioner that the deposit is for that accounting year. 4. The Commissioner will accept a late deposit, where the deposit is provided by the earlier of: • one month from the date the taxpayer’s income tax return was filed for an accounting year • one month from the taxpayer’s income tax return due date for an accounting year. 5. In exceptional circumstances, the Commissioner will extend her discretion beyond the timeframe set out in paragraph 8. This is discussed in more detail at paragraphs 91 to 102 . 6. The Commissioner must consider every request to allow a late deposit on a case -by -case basis and will decide whether to accept a deposit for the nominated accounting year after careful consideration of the taxpayer’s particular circumstances. 7. Where the Commissioner declines to allow a late deposit for the accounting year nominated by the taxpayer, the deposit may still be applied to the accounting year the deposit was made in. In this situation, the Commissioner will first contact the taxpayer to give them the option of continuing with the deposit or having it returned to them. 8. The taxpayer is allowed a deduction for a deposit made into the applicable income equalisation scheme for the accounting year that was set out in the taxpayer’s notice, provided it is accepted by the Commissioner for the relevant accounting year. If the taxpayer’s income tax return was filed before the deposit was made, the Commissioner will reassess the return to include the deduction. WITHDRAWN Refunds 9. An eligible taxpayer may apply for a refund from the applicable income equalisation scheme. 10. A deposit cannot generally be refunded until it has been in the scheme for one year unless specific circumstances apply. However, the Commissioner may allow an early refund where she is satisfied that the early refund is required for a purpose a refund should be given for . 11. A refund within the one -year period can only be allowed when certain legislative criteria are met. The criteria discussed in this statement are: • To enable the taxpayer to undertake planned development work • To enable the taxpayer to buy livestock or replacement livestock • To avoid them suffering serious hardship • To do anything else that that the Commissioner determines in a case or class of case is a purpose for which a refund should be given. 12. In every case the taxpayer is required to provide evidence to support the reason for the early refund. 13. A refund from the scheme is income in the income year in which the Commissioner receives the application except where the taxpayer chooses the income to be allocated to an accounting year. 14. To be allocated as income in an accounting year, the application must be received by the Commissioner: • within the accounting year, or • within the specified period after the end of an accounting year, or • within a time after the end of the specified period for an accounting year that the Commissioner allows in a case or class of cases (a “late application”). 15. If the application for a refund is made within or after the specified period for an accounting year, the taxpayer must, at the time of applying for the refund, notify the Commissioner that they elect the refund be allocated as income to that accounting year. 16. The Commissioner will accept a late application, where the application is received by the earlier of: • one month from the date the taxpayer’s income tax return was filed for an accounting year • one month from the taxpayer’s income tax return due date for an accounting year. 17. In exceptional circumstances, the Commissioner will extend her discretion to accept a late application beyond the timeframe set out in paragraph 16. This is discussed in more detail at paragraphs 91 to 102. WITHDRAWN 18. The Commissioner must consider every request to allow a late application on a case -by -case basis and decide whether to allow the refund for the requested accounting year after careful consideration of the taxpayer’s particular circumstances. 19. Where the Commissioner declines a late application for the accounting year elected by the taxpayer, the refund may still be applied to the accounting year the application was made in. In this situation, the Commissioner will first contact the taxpayer to give them the option of continuing with or withdrawing the application for a refund. 20. The taxpayer must return the income equalisation refund as income in the accounting year nominated in the taxpayer’s notice, provided it is accepted by the Commissioner for the relevant accounting year. If the taxpayer’s income tax return was filed before the application was made , the Commissioner will reassess the return to include the income equalisation refund as income. 21. The Commissioner must issue a refund of a deposit that is in a person’s income equalisation account at the end of five years after the end of the accounting year the deposit was made for . Background 22. The income equalisation scheme was introduced in 1965. At the time of introduction of the scheme, it was stated that it would: • enable farmers to iron out rates of tax due to rises and falls in income • encourage farmers to put aside part of their income in good years and to use this money for farm development in years when farm income falls • help to remove a cause of inflation and therefore help to maintain a steadier rate of economic growth. 23. The scheme enables eligible taxpayers to: • make income equalisation deposits with the Commissioner, and • claim a deduction against their income in the accounting year: • the deposit is made in, or • requested by the taxpayer in their notice to the Commissioner when they mak e a deposit, provided the request is accepted by the Commissioner. 24. When a refund is made from the scheme, the amount is included as part of the taxpayer’s income in the accounting year: • in which the application for the refund is received by the Commissioner, or • elected by the taxpayer. 25. Since the implementation of the scheme, use-of -money interest has been introduced. Farmers are not usually in a position to know their final financial position until after liability for use-of -money interest applies. Also, many farmers do not receive the bulk of their income until near the end of their tax year, so they have not had the use of that money throughout the year. The WITHDRAWN income equalisation scheme provides an avenue for farmers to limit their exposure to use-of -money interest. Detailed discussion Meanings The following meanings describe terms used in this statement. Accounting year 26. “Accounting year” is defined under s YA 1 of the Act and means a tax year or another 12-month period that ends with the taxpayer’s balance date. 27. The definition of “accounting year” for a company also includes: • a period, shorter than twelve months, that is the period accounts are prepared for , including under the international tax rules, because of the formation of the company or the termination of the company’s existence • a period, shorter or longer than twelve months, that is the period accounts are prepared for , including under the international tax rules, because of the company or a person adopting a new accounting balance date under ss EX 25 or EX 69 of the Act. Eligible taxpayers 28. “Eligible taxpayers” may reduce their net income for a tax year by making an income equalisation deposit into the applicable income equalisation scheme with the Commissioner pursuant to s EH 1(1) of the Act. 29. Section EH 3(1) of the Act provides that eligible taxpayers in respect of the main income equalisation scheme are: • persons who carry on a farming or agricultural business on land in New Zealand • persons who carry on a fishing business • persons who derive income from forestry, but not a company, public authority, Māori authority, or an unincorporated body. 30. Section EH 63(1) of the Act provides that eligible taxpayers for the thinning operations income equalisation scheme are companies that carry on a forestry business on land in New Zealand and derive income from carrying out thinning operations on the land. 31. The thinning operations income equalisation scheme does not apply to natural persons. Serious hardship 32. The term “serious hardship” is not defined in the legislation. Although the ordinary meaning of the words “serious” and hardship” would require that there is a degree of suffering or privation that is relatively significant in the circumstances, the historical background to the scheme suggests that “serious hardship” should not be an unduly high standard to satisfy. WITHDRAWN 33. However, a taxpayer must still show evidence that an early refund would be used to avoid them suffering serious hardship. 34. This would include a situation where, if the refund were not made, the future farming operation may be seriously jeopardised. Examples of this could include the need to dispos e of breeding stock, or being unable to undertake essential farm maintenance. Note that the Commissioner considers that deferring the application of fertiliser for one year would not seriously jeopardise future farming operations. 35. Factors likely to count against an early refund to avoid serious hardship are: • There are alternative and more traditional sources of credit available. • The early refund, or the saving as a result of an early refund, will effectively be spent on things other than maintaining the farming operations or keeping debt lower (buy a new vehicle or spending more to upgrade machinery than is reasonable, for instance). Specified period 36. “Specified period” is defined for the purposes of the applicable income equalisation schemes under ss EH 36, EH 79 and YA 1 of the Act and means the shorter of: • the period of six months after the end of the accounting year that corresponds to the tax year • the period from the end of the accounting year that corresponds to the tax year to the date one month after the date the person must, under s 37 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, file their return of income for the accounting year that corresponds to the tax year. Examples Calculating the specified period with an extension of time arrangement In the case of a taxpayer with a balance date of 30 June 2016 and an extension of time arrangement to file their income tax return by 31 March 2017, the specified period is the shorter of: • the period of six months after the end of the accounting year that corresponds to the tax year—1 July 2016 to 31 December 2016 • the period from the end of the accounting year to one month after the tax return is due—1 July 2016 to 30 April 2017. The specified period ends on 31 December 2016. Calculating the specified period without an extension of time arrangement In the case of a taxpayer with a balance date of 30 June 2016 without an extension of time arrangement, the specified period is the shorter of: • the period of six months after the end of the accounting year that corresponds to the tax year—1 July 2016 to 31 December 2016 WITHDRAWN • the period from the end of the accounting year to one month after the tax return is due—1 July 2016 to 7 November 2016. The specified period ends on 7 November 2016. Main income equalisation scheme Section EH 4 – Deposit 37. The minimum deposit is $200. Deposit amounts cannot exceed a taxpayer’s net income derived from carrying out their farming or agricultural, fishing or forestry activity in the accounting year the deposit is accepted. Any interest received from lending or investment activities will not form part of the deposit. 38. Where the net profit has been paid as a salary to trust beneficiaries or company shareholders, the Commissioner is not likely to reassess the taxpayer’s income tax return and amend the salary paid to an income equalisation deposit. She will apply her discretion in the manner set out in SPS 05/05: Retrospective adjustments to salaries paid to shareholder-employees and SPS 16/01: Requests to amend assessments. 39. An eligible taxpayer may make a deposit into the main income equalisation scheme for an accounting year at any time during the accounting year or within the specified period for the accounting year. 40. The Commissioner has neither the ability nor the discretion under the Act to accept an early deposit into the main income equalisation scheme. 41. Section EH 4(4)(c) of the Act gives the Commissioner the discretion to accept a late deposit, ie, a deposit made within a time after the end of the specified period for an accounting year in a case or class of cases allowed by the Commissioner. R efer to paragraphs 91 –102 of this statement for discussion on how the Commissioner will apply this discretion. 42. If the deposit is made within or after the specified period for an accounting year the taxpayer must, at the time of making the deposit, notify the Commissioner that the deposit is for that accounting year. 43. Where the Commissioner does not accept a late deposit, it may, subject to consultation with the taxpayer, be applied to the accounting year in which the deposit was made. 44. Sections DQ 1 and EH 7 of the Act provide that the taxpayer can claim a deduction for the amount of the deposit in the applicable accounting year. 45. No deduction is allowed until the deposit is physically received and accepted by the Commissioner. If this occurs after the taxpayer’s income tax return has been filed, the Commissioner will reassess the return to allow the deduction. Section EH 13 – Refund on request 46. A taxpayer may apply, in writing, for a refund from the main income equalisation scheme under s EH 13 of the Act. If the taxpayer wants a refund from the main income equalisation scheme and none of the other relevant refund provisions apply, the Commissioner must refund the amount applied for. WITHDRAWN This is to the extent to which the refund can be made up of one or more deposits that have been in the main income equalisation scheme for at least one year. 47. Section EH 14 of the Act provides that a refund under s EH 13 of the Act is allocated as income to the accounting year the Commissioner receives the application for the refund, unless either of these two situations apply: • The application is received within the specified period for an accounting year and the taxpayer chooses that the refund is to be treated as income in the accounting year the specified period relates to. I n this case the refund is allocated as income to the accounting year the specified period relates to. • A late application is received, ie: o the application is received within a longer period after the end of the specified period for an accounting year that is allowed by the Commissioner in a case or class of cases, and o the taxpayer chooses that the refund be treated as income in the accounting year the longer period relates to. I n this case the refund is allocated as income to the accounting year nominated by the taxpayer. Refer to paragraphs 91–102 of this statement for discussion on how the Commissioner will apply this discretion. 48. Where the Commissioner does not accept a late application, the refund may, subject to consultation with the taxpayer, be allocated to the accounting year the application was made in. 49. Sections CB 27 and EH 14 of the Act provide that the taxpayer must return the refund as income in the applicable accounting year. 50. The refund may not be allocated as income to an accounting year until the application for a refund is physically received and accepted by the Commissioner. If this occurs after the taxpayer’s income tax return has been filed, the Commissioner will reassess the return to allocate the refund as incom e. Section EH 15 – Refund for development or recovery 51. A taxpayer may apply, in writing, for an early refund from the main income equalisation scheme in specific circumstances under s EH 15 of the Act. 52. The Commissioner must refund an amount that has been in the main income equalisation scheme for more than six months to an eligible taxpayer to enable them to: • undertake planned development or maintenance work, or • buy, immediately after the refund is given, livestock for use in their farming business (other than to replace livestock disposed of or lost as a result of a self -assessed adverse event). 53. The Commissioner must refund an amount regardless of the length of time it has been in the main income equalisation scheme to an eligible taxpayer to enable them to: WITHDRAWN • buy, immediately after the refund is given, livestock for use in their farming business to replace livestock replaced or lost as a result of a self-assessed adverse event • avoid suffering serious hardship • do anything else the Commissioner determines, in a case or class of cases, is a purpose for which a refund should be given. 54. The Commissioner has the discretion to allow a refund from the main income equalisation scheme, regardless of the length of time the deposits have been in the account, for the taxpayer to do anything the Commissioner determines in a case or class of cases is a purpose for which a refund should be given. R efer to paragraphs 91 –102 of this statement for discussion on how the Commissioner will apply this discretion. 55. If refund requests are made on the grounds that they will be used to avoid serious hardship, the taxpayer will need to be able to explain to the Commissioner how the refund will be applied to avoid serious hardship. 56. A forecast reduction in income as part of the normal fluctuations in prices which primary producers would expect to experience from time-to-time would not be enough, on its own, to meet the criteria. Although some degree of “hardship” may be on the horizon, the taxpayer will need to be able to show how that event will, or is likely to, lead to them experiencing “serious hardship”. 57. It may be hard to show where money is deposited into the scheme and then asked to be withdrawn at the same time or shortly after. In that situation, the financial impact of an early withdrawal will only be the tax deferral and cash- flow benefits. 58. Section EH 16 of the Act provides that a refund under s EH 15 of the Act is allocated to the accounting year the Commissioner receives the application for the refund in, unless either of these two situations apply: • The application is received within the specified period for an accounting year and the taxpayer chooses that the refund is to be treated as income in the accounting year the specified period relates to. In this case the refund is allocated as income to the accounting year the specified period relates to. • A late application is received, ie: o the application is received within a longer period after the end of the specified period for an accounting year that is allowed by the Commissioner in a case or class of cases, and o the taxpayer chooses that the refund be treated as income in the accounting year the longer period relates to. In this case the refund is allocated as income to the accounting year nominated by the taxpayer. Refer to paragraphs 91 –102 of this statement for discussion on how the Commissioner will apply this discretion. 59. Where the Commissioner does not accept the late application, the refund may, subject to consultation with the taxpayer, be allocated to the accounting year the application was made in. WITHDRAWN 60. Sections CB 27 and EH 16 of the Act provide that the taxpayer must return the refund as income in the applicable accounting year. 61. The refund may not be allocated as income to an accounting year until the application for a refund is physically received and accepted by the Commissioner. If this occurs after the taxpayer’s income tax return has been filed, the Commissioner will reassess the return to allocate the refund as income. Thinning operations income equalisation scheme Section EH 64 – Deposit 62. The minimum deposit is $200. Deposit amounts cannot exceed a taxpayer’s net income derived from carrying out thinning operations in the accounting year the deposit is accepted. Any interest received from lending or investment activities will not form part of the deposit. 63. Where the net profit has been paid as a salary to company shareholders, the Commissioner is not likely to reassess the company’s income tax return and amend the salary paid to an income equalisation deposit. She will apply her discretion in the manner set out in SPS 05/05: Retrospective adjustments to salaries paid to shareholder-employees and SPS 16/01: Requests to amend assessments. 64. An eligible taxpayer may make a deposit into the thinning operations income equalisation scheme for an accounting year at any time during the accounting year or within the specified period for the accounting year. 65. Section EH 64(4)(c) of the Act allows the Commissioner to accept a late deposit, ie, a deposit made within a time after the end of the specified period for an accounting year in a case or class of cases allowed by the Commissioner. Refer to paragraphs 91 –102 of this statement for discussion on how the Commissioner will apply this discretion. 66. If the taxpayer makes the deposit within or after the specified period the taxpayer must, at the time of making the deposit, notify the Commissioner that the deposit is for that accounting year. 67. Where the Commissioner does not accept a late deposit, it may, subject to consultation with the taxpayer, be applied to the accounting year the deposit was made in. 68. Sections DQ 3 and EH 67 of the Act provide that the taxpayer can claim a deduction for the amount of the deposit in the accounting year. 69. No deduction is allowed until the deposit is physically received and accepted by the Commissioner. If this occurs after the taxpayer’s income tax return has been filed, the Commissioner will reassess the return to allow the deduction. Section EH 71 – Refund on request 70. A taxpayer may apply, in writing, for a refund from the thinning operations income equalisation scheme under s EH 71 of the Act. If the taxpayer wants a refund of some or all of the amount in the scheme and none of the other relevant refund provisions in the Act apply, the Commissioner must refund the WITHDRAWN amount applied for. This is to the extent the refund can be made up of one or more deposits that have been in the scheme for at least one year. 71. Section EH 72 of the Act provides that a refund under s EH 71 of the Act is allocated to the accounting year the Commissioner receives the application for the refund in, unless either of these two situations apply: • The application is received within the specified period for an accounting year and the taxpayer chooses that the refund is to be treated as income in the accounting year the specified period relates to. In this case the refund is allocated as income to the accounting year the specified period relates to. • A late application is received, ie, o the application is received within a longer period after the end of the specified period for an accounting year that is allowed by the Commissioner in a case or class of cases, and o the taxpayer chooses that the refund be treated as income in the accounting year to which the longer period relates, in which case the refund is allocated as income to the accounting year nominated by the taxpayer (refer to paragraphs 91 –102 of this statement for discussion on how the Commissioner will apply this discretion). 72. Where the Commissioner does not accept a late application, the refund may, subject to consultation with the taxpayer, be allocated to the accounting year in which the application was made. 73. Sections CB 27 and EH 72 of the Act provide that the taxpayer must return the refund as income in the applicable accounting year. 74. The refund may not be allocated as income to an accounting year until the application for a refund is physically received and accepted by the Commissioner. If this occurs after the taxpayer’s income tax return has been filed, the Commissioner will reassess the return to allocate the refund as income. Section EH 73 – Refund for development or recovery 75. A taxpayer may apply, in writing, for an early refund from the thinning operations income equalisation scheme in specific circumstances under s EH 73 of the Act: • The Commissioner must refund an amount that has been in the scheme for more than six months to an eligible taxpayer to enable them to undertake planned development or maintenance work for their forestry business. • The Commissioner must refund an amount regardless of the length of time it has been in the scheme to an eligible taxpayer to enable them to: o avoid suffering serious hardship o do anything else the Commissioner determines, in a case or class of cases, is a purpose a refund should be given for . 76. If requests for refunds made on the grounds that they will be used to avoid serious hardship, the taxpayer will need to be able to explain to the Commissioner how the refund will be applied to avoid serious hardship. WITHDRAWN 77. That may be hard to show where money is deposited and a refund request is made at the same time or shortly after. In that situation, the financial impact will only be the tax deferral and cash-flow benefits. 78. The Commissioner has the discretion to allow a refund from the thinning operations income equalisation scheme, regardless of the length of time the deposits have been in the account, for the taxpayer to do anything the Commissioner determines in a case or class of cases is a purpose for which a refund should be given. R efer to paragraphs 91 –102 of this statement for discussion on how the Commissioner will apply this discretion. 79. Section EH 74 of the Act provides that a refund under s EH 73 of the Act is allocated to the accounting year in which the Commissioner receives the application for the refund, unless either of these two situations apply: • The application is received within the specified period for an accounting year and the taxpayer chooses that the refund is to be treated as income in the accounting year the specified period relates to. I n this case the refund is allocated as income to the accounting year the specified period relates to. • A late application is received, ie: o the application is received within a longer period after the end of the specified period for an accounting year that is allowed by the Commissioner in a case or class of cases, and o the taxpayer chooses that the refund be treated as income in the accounting year the longer period relates to. I n this case the refund is allocated as income to the accounting year nominated by the taxpayer. Refer to paragraphs 91 –102 of this statement for discussion on how the Commissioner will apply this discretion. 80. Where the Commissioner does not accept a late application, the refund may, subject to consultation with the taxpayer, be applied to the accounting year in which the application was made. 81. Sections CB 27 and EH 74 of the Act provide that the taxpayer must return the refund as income in the applicable accounting year. 82. The refund may not be allocated as income to an accounting year until the application for a refund is physically received and accepted by the Commissioner. If this occurs after the taxpayer’s income tax return has been filed, the Commissioner will reassess the return to allocate the refund as income. Commissioner’s discretion – “a case or class of cases” 83. As stated above, the Commissioner has the discretion to accept a deposit into or an application for a refund from the applicable income equalisation scheme after the specified period for an accounting year. Relevant case law 84. The Courts have established some principles around the exercise of a statutory discretion that require the Commissioner to act reasonably in applying her discretion and consider the merits of the taxpayer’s particular circumstances and explanation. WITHDRAWN 85. The Commissioner must exercise her discretion reasonably, as stated by Lord Wrenbury in Roberts v Hopwood \[1925\] AC 578, as follows: A person in whom is vested a discretion must exercise his discretion upon reasonable grounds. A discretion does not empower a man to do what he likes mere ly because he is minded to do so – he must in the exercise of his discretion do not what he likes but what he ought. In other words, he must, by the use of his reason, ascertain and follow the course which reason directs. He must act reasonably. 86. When exercising her discretion, the Commissioner must consider each case on its own merits. This is supported by the Court of Appeal’s decision in Lawton v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2003\] 2 NZLR 48 in which the Court held that the Commissioner had not properly exercised his discretion in respect of s 30(2) of the Income Tax Act 1976, which provided that the Commissioner may accept a late objection, on the basis that there had been a failure to consider and properly weigh the merits of the taxpayer’s late objection. 87. Justice Glazebrook, delivering the unanimous judgment of the Court, quoted the Court of Appeal’s previous decision in CIR v Wilson (1976) 17 NZTC 12,512: ... the merits of a proposed objection must be considered unless the explanation for the lateness of the objection is so inadequate that this is unnecessary. 88. The Court also found that the taxpayer had given a full and credible explanation for the lateness of the objection. Justice Glazebrook stated: ... In such a case, unless this explanation was palpably untrue or quite unjustified, it would be rare for the explanation to be deemed so inadequate that the merits need not be examined. 89. Another principle established by the Court is that the Commissioner may make policies, but the policies cannot be overly rigid. This is highlighted in Gisborne Mills Ltd v CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,194. Justice Robertson found that the Commissioner is required to weigh the particular circumstances which exist in each individual case, rather than adhere to policy: The test is whether, by the rigid and inflexible application of policy, there has been a reasoned exercise of the discretion ... In my view, however the discretion required him to weigh the particular circumstances which existed ... In as much as none of these exceptional matters appear to have been addressed because of the preoccupation with the policy issue, I am forced to the conclusion that there has been a failure by the Commissioner to exercise the discretion which Parliament has given him. ... I find therefore, that the respondent has abused his powers by refusing to consider the specific circumstances of this case. What is reasonable? 90. What needs to be considered is how the Commissioner should exercise her discretion, with reference to the principles established by the Courts. Late deposits and applications for a refund 91. In most instances, the taxpayer’s financial position for an accounting year will not be known until the taxpayer’s set of accounts and tax return have been completed. At this point, the decision on whether to make a deposit to the applicable income equalisation scheme, and of how much, may be made. WITHDRAWN 92. So an eligible taxpayer could reasonably be expected to make a deposit into or request a refund from the applicable income equalisation scheme for a particular accounting year at the time of filing their tax return, provided the tax return is filed by the due date. 93. However, it may not be possible or practicable for the deposit or application to be sent to the Commissioner with the tax return. It may also take a tax agent a period of time to arrange for the deposit or application for a refund to be sent to Inland Revenue. So eligible taxpayers should be allowed a reasonable period of time after either: • the taxpayer’s income tax return due date, or • the date the taxpayer’s income tax return was filed on to forward the deposit or application to Inland Revenue. 94. The Commissioner considers it is reasonable to apply her discretion and accept late deposits and late applications for a refund in relation to the applicable income equalisation scheme by the earlier of: • one month from the date of filing the tax return for that accounting year, and • one month from the date the tax return for that accounting year is due to be filed. 95. If the specified period for an accounting year is longer than the extended timeframe set out in paragraph 94, the taxpayer may still make the deposit or application for a refund within the specified period. The Commissioner is not likely to further extend this to provide a late deposit or late application for a refund unless exceptional circumstances apply. R efer to paragraphs 91 –102 of this statement for discussion of exceptional circumstances. 96. Taxpayers without a tax agent who require an extension of time to file their income tax return should refer to SPS 09/03: Extension of time applications from taxpayers without tax agents. Examples Making a late deposit with an extension of time arrangement A taxpayer has a tax agent. The taxpayer has a balance date of 31 March. The taxpayer’s income tax return due date for the 2016 accounting year is 31 March 2017, incorporating an extension of time arrangement. The taxpayer’s income tax return was filed on 31 October 2016. The specified period for making deposits into the applicable income equalisation scheme ends on 30 September 2016, which is the shorter of: • the period of six months after the end of the accounting year that corresponds to the tax year—1 April 2016 to 30 September 2016 • the period from the end of the accounting year to one month after the tax return is due—1 April 2016 to 30 April 2017. For a deposit to be accepted for the 2016 accounting year, the taxpayer must make the deposit within the discretionary extended timeframe, ie, by WITHDRAWN 30 November 2016, which is the earlier of: • one month from the date of filing the tax return for that accounting year—30 November 2016 • one month from the date that the tax return for that accounting year is due to be filed—30 April 2017. In the same scenario, if the taxpayer’s income tax return was filed on 1 May 2017, a deposit would need to be paid by 30 April 2017, which is the earlier of: • one month from the date of filing the tax return for that accounting year—1 June 2017 • one month from the date that the tax return for that accounting year is due to be filed—30 April 2017. In the above scenarios, if there are valid reasons why the taxpayer cannot make the deposit within the specified period or discretionary extended timeframe for an accounting year, the Commissioner will consider the merits of the taxpayer’s situation on a case-by -case basis and may still accept the late deposit. Making a late deposit without an extension of time arrangement A taxpayer with a 30 June 2016 balance date, with no extension of time arrangement, must file their income tax return by 7 October 2016. The taxpayer filed their income tax return on 30 September 2016. The specified period for making deposits into the applicable income equalisation scheme ends on 7 November 2016, which is the shorter of: • the period of six months after the end of the accounting year that corresponds to the tax year – 1 July 2016 to 31 December 2016, and • the period from the end of the accounting year to one month after the tax return is due—1 July 2016 to 7 November 2016. The taxpayer should make the deposit by the end of the specified period, ie, 7 November 2016. This is a later date than would be allowed by applying the discretionary extended timeframe, ie 31 October 2016, which is the earlier of: • one month from the date of filing the tax return for that accounting year—30 October 2016 • one month from the date that the tax return for that accounting year is due to be filed—7 November 2016. However, if there are valid reasons why the taxpayer cannot make the deposit by 7 November 2016, the Commissioner will consider the merits of the taxpayer’s situation on a case-by -case basis and may still accept the late deposit. WITHDRAWN Early applications for a refund 97. The Commissioner will allow applications for an early refund for unforeseen development, ie, development work not anticipated when the deposit was made, which arose through an adverse event (for example, a flood, drought, fire, l ivestock disease). Unforeseen development is not confined to deductible development expenditure and may also include any capital expenditure that will result in increased production. Adverse events 98. If an event is classified as an adverse event, the Commissioner may extend the timeframe for eligible taxpayers to make a deposit or request an early refund from the main income equalisation scheme under ss EH 4 and EH 15(3)(c) of the Act. Note that a taxpayer must still explain how the adverse event has affe cted them before these provisions to can apply. 99. Where the Commissioner extends her discretion due to an adverse event being declared, this is published on Inland Revenue’s website: http://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/income-equalisation/special- provisions/ Exceptional circumstances 100. Where an eligible taxpayer makes a late deposit, or an application for an early refund or a late application for a refund outside of the circumstances detailed above, it may still be accepted by the Commissioner. Each request will be considered on a case-by -case basis, taking into account the merits of the taxpayer’s particular situation. 101. Reasons to accept a late deposit, an application for an early refund, or a late application for a refund could include, but are not limited to: • a taxpayer receiving incorrect advice from their tax agent, or • a taxpayer experiencing a sudden or unexpected change in circumstances. 102. However, these examples are not indicative of situations when a late deposit, an application for an early refund, or a late application for a refund will automatically be accepted. All factors must be considered before the Commissioner accepts the deposit as being made in the requested tax year.

UNCLASSIFIED Standard Practice Statement SPS 17/02 Six-monthly GST return filing Introduction Standard Practice Statements describe how the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. This statement sets out certain practices that the Commissioner will exercise in applying the discretion to allow registered persons to remain or become six-monthly return filers for goods and services tax (GST) purposes. Application This statement replaces GNL 420 Six-monthly GST return threshold, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 13, No 12 (December 2001), and applies from 04 October 2017. Standard practice Summary 1. The Government recognises that filing GST returns on a one or two-monthly basis may involve significant compliance costs. A GST-registered person may apply to the Commissioner for a six-monthly filing frequency if their taxable supplies in any 12-month period do not or are not likely to exceed $500,000. This figure is calculated on a GST exclusive basis. 2. In addition, a person may also apply for a six-monthly filing frequency regardless of their level of taxable supplies where they make seasonal supplies. That is, where 80% or more of their taxable supplies are made within a six-month period that ends at any day within the last month of the person’s income year. 3. Where a person who has been allocated a six-month filing frequency ceases to meet the criteria for that approval, they will be required to change their filing frequency following the end of the return period that aligns with the end of the 12-month period in which they ceased to meet those requirements. UNCLASSIFIED 4. However, a person is not required to cease using a six-monthly filing frequency if the breach of the taxable supplies threshold is one-off. A person may remain a six- month filer if they expect their taxable supplies to still be within the threshold for the following 12-month period. Changes to six-month filing frequency 5. The recently enacted Taxation (Annual Rates for 2016-17, Closely Held Companies, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017 addressed technical issues with the eligibility to file six-monthly GST returns and introduced an exception that allows a person to file six monthly even if they have a one-off breach of the threshold. 6. Section 15(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 provides that a GST- registered person must have a one, two or six-monthly return filing frequency. Section 15(2) sets out the criteria for using a six-monthly filing frequency. Section 15C(1) provides that a person may apply, either in writing or in electronic format, to change from a one or two-monthly filing frequency to a six-monthly basis. 7. A six-monthly filing frequency has the obvious compliance cost advantage of requiring only two returns to be filed each year. It will also delay the liability to pay GST output tax on some transactions. However, these advantages must be weighed against the effect of delaying the ability to claim GST input tax. Criteria for six-month filing frequency 8. A six-month filing frequency is available to any person whose taxable supplies have not or are not likely to be more than $500,000 in any 12-month period. 9. The amount of a person’s taxable supplies is calculated on a GST exclusive basis and exclude amounts that arise out of:  donations and exempt supplies  the ending, including a premature ending, of a taxable activity carried on by the person:  a substantial and permanent reduction in the size or scale of a taxable activity carried on by that person:  the replacement of plant or a capital asset used in a taxable activity carried on by the person. 10. A person may also apply for a six-monthly filing frequency even though their taxable supplies exceed the $500,000 threshold if 80% or more of their taxable supplies in an income year are made:  within a six-month period that ends at any day within the last month of the person’s income year, and  the person has not had a six-monthly filing frequency under this criterion in the 24-month period before the application. UNCLASSIFIED 11. This criterion is designed for people who have seasonal taxable activities. It is intended to apply for those taxpayers whose taxable supplies fall near the end of their income year. 12. A six-month filing frequency would provide administrative savings. A person who files six-monthly GST returns would include most or all of their taxable supplies in one return that aligns with their annual balance date. 13. Note that a person who has changed from a six-monthly filing frequency under the seasonal criteria within the past 24 months, may not re-apply for six-monthly filing. Breach of criteria 14. A person who has approval to file six-monthly GST returns and becomes ineligible to do so because they have breached the $500,00 threshold, and do not make seasonal supplies, must notify the Commissioner within 21 days of that breach. Example 1 – Seasonal business Dwight operates a ski hire shop with an annual turnover of $600,000. The shop is open only during winter. During the rest of the year, Dwight leaves New Zealand. If Dwight filed two monthly GST returns, he would need to file nil returns while he was outside New Zealand. Dwight has approval to file income tax returns to coincide with his annual balance date of 31 October each year. Dwight can apply to file GST returns on a six- monthly basis because all of his taxable supplies are made between May and October, being within the last six months of the end of Dwight’s income year. This means Dwight will need to file only two GST returns each year. The return filing frequency will be aligned with Dwight’s income year. Dwight will file one return for the period November to April and the other for the period May to October each year. Example 2 – Seasonal income Aroha operates an apple orchard with an annual turnover of $700,000. 85% of her income is received from her harvest in April and May each year. Aroha has approval to file income tax returns which coincides with her annual balance date of 30 June each year. Even though Aroha’s orchard operates all year round, she can apply to file GST returns on a six-monthly basis because almost all of her taxable supplies are made within the last six months of the end of her income year. This means that Aroha will need to file only two GST returns each year. The return filing frequency will be aligned with her income year. Aroha will file one return for the period July to December and the other for the period January to June each year. UNCLASSIFIED 15. In practice, it is likely that taxpayers will monitor their turnover when they calculate and file their GST returns. If, at that time, their taxable supplies made in that return indicate they have exceeded the turnover threshold (that is, taxable supplies made for that six-month period and the previous six-month period together exceed $500,000), they will need to determine whether they are likely to continue to maintain that level of turnover. If so, they must notify the Commissioner, and they will be changed to a one-monthly or two-monthly filing frequency. 16. However, where the person’s taxable supplies exceed the threshold for six-monthly filing, but they determine they are not likely to exceed the threshold in the following 12 months, they are not required to change from six-monthly filing. 17. For any return filing frequency approved by the Commissioner, whether by initial application or by request to change, it is the Commissioner’s practice to notify the person in writing. The letter will set out the approved filing frequency and the date from which the filing frequency will apply. 18. The flow chart in the Appendix below sets out the circumstances in which a registered person who makes (or expects to make) total taxable supplies for a 12- month period valued above $500,000 (but not more than $24 million) is eligible to be a six-month filer. This Standard Practice Statement is signed on 04 October 2017 Rob Wells Manager, LTS Technical Standards Example 3 – One-off breach in excess of the threshold Sharyn operates a motel with an annual turnover of $450,000 and has an annual balance date of 31 March each year. She is approved to file six-monthly GST returns for the periods April to September and October to March each year. February is usually a quiet month for occupancy in the motel. However, in February 2017, the city held a month-long international event that meant Sharyn’s turnover for the 12 months ending 29 February 2017 reached $550,000. The international event will be held in a different city in 2018. Therefore, Sharyn does not expect her annual turnover to be more than $450,000 for the 12-month period ended 28 February 2018. Sharyn is not required to change her return filing frequency from 1 April 2017, because, although her turnover breached the $500,000 threshold, she does not expect her turnover to be over that threshold in the 12-month period following that breach.

UNCLASSIFIED 1 Standard practice statement SPS 17/03 Loss offset elections between group companies Introduction Standard practice statements (SPS) describe how the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. This statement sets out certain practices that the Commissioner will accept for offsetting losses by election between group companies. It also sets out the consequences of specific events that can impact on a loss offset and how these should be addressed. The SPS does not consider all questions relating to loss offsets within a group of companies and accordingly is not a fully comprehensive guide to Subpart IC of the Income Tax Act 2007 Application This statement applies from 14 December 2017 and replaces SPS 05/12 Loss offset elections between group companies published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 18, No 1 (February 2006). Standard practice Summary 1.The purpose of the loss offset provisions is to allow those companies that incur losses to utilise those losses even where different entities are involved. This means that there is similarity in the tax treatment of a group of companies, each carrying on separate enterprises, as compared with a single company that carries on the same enterprises in separate divisions. 2.This SPS sets out the application of certain pre-requisites and other aspects of loss offset provisions in Subpart IC which allow loss offset elections to be made. It discusses the requirements for giving notice, the Commissioner’s practice with respect to part-year losses, and explains what should happen when the loss WITHDRAWN UNCLASSIFIED 2 company’s loss or the profit company’s net income is increased or reduced. It also sets out the requirements for there to be a valid election and/or subvention payment. 3. A loss company must be resident in New Zealand in terms of section IC 7. The loss company must have maintained a 49% continuity of ownership from the time of the loss to the time of the offset. The profit companies and the loss company must have at least 66% common ownership. The amount of loss offset(s) will be limited to the amount of profit(s) in the profit companies. The amount must be fixed by the election in a manner that binds the electing company, but need not be quantified in the election. Refer to paragraphs 14 to 16 for more detail in this area. 4. The loss company must notify the Commissioner of an election for the loss offset and where applicable of a subvention payment within the timeframe under section IC 9 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The election may be notified in a tax return or separately from the tax return. Where an extension to the timeframe for filing the election is sought. In this case the request for the extension must be sought from and approved by the Commissioner before an offset can be made. Detailed discussion 5. Subpart IC provides for the sharing of losses between companies that are in the same group of companies. A company may make its tax loss available for subtraction from the net income of another group company. There are two methods of sharing losses which may be used together. 6. The first is for the loss company to notify an election in its tax return for the loss to be made available to the profit company. Any such election is irrevocable. That election must be notified to the Commissioner no later than the 31 March that follows the end of the loss company’s year of offset, or within such further time as the Commissioner may allow: section IC 9(2). 7. Another method of sharing a loss is for the profit company to make a “subvention payment” to the loss company. A subvention payment made to the loss company is offset against the profit company’s net income and reduces the loss company’s available net losses. The payment to the loss company and notice to the Commissioner by the loss company of that payment must be made no later than the 31 March that follows the end of the loss company’s year of offset, or within such further time as the Commissioner may allow: sections IC 9(1) and (2). 8. Previously the Commissioner took the view that a subvention payment required actual payment to be made. However, from December 2010 the Commissioner’s position is that in the absence of any statutory definition of “payment” in the context of subvention payments, the following principles will apply: a) The ordinary meaning requires a discharge of obligations between parties. b) There are a number of ways in which an obligation may be discharged including payment in cash or its equivalent or by certain accounting entries. c) Payment may be made by accounting entries where they cause a genuine crediting in the payee’s account or set off a pre-existing obligation. Making a WITHDRAWN UNCLASSIFIED 3 Example 1 A loss company has an obligation to pay a debt to a profit company for past purchases from the profit company. The profit company resolves to make a subvention payment to the loss company. The profit company and the loss company decide to allow the subvention payment to be applied in satisfaction of the Loss Coy’s past debt. An accounting entry is made to record this. The accounting entry is treated as the payment of the subvention payment. journal entry will not be generally sufficient to cause a “payment” unless there is a clear agreement between the parties that this will satisfy the obligation. 9. Consequently, in the subvention payment context, “payment” will be satisfied when the obligation under the subvention payment agreement has been discharged. The obligation can be discharged by an actual cash payment, cheque or bank transfer. Other methods of discharging an obligation can also amount to “payment”. An obligation will generally be discharged where the payee can no longer sue the payer for the payment. It should be noted that an Accounting Entry that merely records an intention to pay a subvention payment will not in itself amount to a “payment”. Also, simply resolving to pay a subvention payment does not amount to creating an enforceable obligation. 10. As stated above, this SPS sets out the application of certain aspects of loss offset provisions in Subpart IC which allow loss offset elections to be made. It discusses the requirements for giving notice, the Commissioner’s practice with respect to part year losses, and explains what should happen when the loss company’s loss or the profit company’s net income is increased or reduced. It also sets out the requirements for there to be a valid election. Where this statement discusses elections, it is equally referring to notices of subvention payments made. 11. The election may be included in the loss company’s income tax return or made separately from the tax return. An election must be made by the latest time to file a loss company’s income tax return. The Commissioner has discretion to accept a late election to offset losses beyond an agreed extension of time (“EOT”) to file the return. 12. The Commissioner must approve the application to apply the discretion and agree to make the loss offset. The mere processing of the return and issuing the taxpayer’s notice of assessment do not amount to an exercise of the discretion by the Commissioner to accept a late loss offset election. Prerequisites 13. Before a loss offset can proceed the following factors must be present. Loss company 14. There must be a company with a tax loss for an income year or a loss balance carried forward. The loss company must have 49% continuity of ownership from the time the loss is incurred until the loss is offset: sections IA 5(2), (3) and (6). WITHDRAWN UNCLASSIFIED 4 15. The loss company for the commonality period under section IC 6(1) must be incorporated in New Zealand or be carrying on a business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment in New Zealand. 16. The loss company for the commonality period under section IC 6(1) must not be a dual resident company, that is, though resident in New Zealand it must not be: ● treated under a double tax agreement as not being resident in New Zealand for the purposes of the double tax agreement, or ● liable to income tax in another country by reason of domicile, residence or place of incorporation: section IC 7. Profit company 17. There must be one or more profit companies in the same group of companies as the loss company, and all companies must be in the same group of companies for the whole continuity period as defined in section IA 5(6). Whether or not two companies form a group of companies is outside the scope of this SPS. A group of companies must have at least 66% common ownership. More detailed guidance on common ownership can be found in the Interpretation Statement: IS 13/02 Income tax – whether certain rights conferred by the Companies Act 1993 could give rise to a “shareholder decision-making right”. 1 Amount of loss 18. The amount of loss to be offset must not exceed the net income of the elected profit company for the tax year, or the total net income of all the elected profit companies. Nor can the amount of subvention payment that the profit company agrees to pay the loss company exceed the loss company’s tax loss: sections IC 8. A specific amount 19. An election should refer to an amount that is capable of identification as a specific dollar amount. The amount must be fixed by the election in a manner that binds the loss company, but need not be quantified in the notice of election. That is, a formula may be used where the result of applying that formula could be known at the time of the election. For example, the election might provide that the tax loss to be offset is to be such an amount that would reduce the profit company’s net income to nil. 1 More information on this statement can be found at www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword: “IS 13/02”). WITHDRAWN UNCLASSIFIED 5 Example 2 In a group consisting of two companies, it is found, once its accounts have been prepared, that company A has a tax loss of $10,000. It is anticipated that Company B will be in profit and that the amount of the net income will be about $2,000, ie less than the amount of Company A’s tax loss. However, Company B’s accounts have still to be prepared as the accountants are waiting on further information from their clients. That information will be arriving in a few days. There is still time to file an election and the question is whether Company A can now elect to offset some of its loss up to the amount of the profit company’s net income by using a formula. This is permissible because:  the Commissioner will be notified in time  the amount will be subsequently identified as a specific dollar amount  it does not matter that (even if the accounting firm could commit staff to the finalisation of the accounts) the net income cannot be ascertained with finality at the time of making the election  the amount to be offset is already fixed in that it is controlled by the formula. The election 20. An election to offset the tax loss must be notified by the loss company. The loss company can give notice of election by: ● completing the appropriate boxes in the loss company’s income tax return, or ● completing the appropriate boxes in the loss company’s e-filed income tax return, or ● sending a separate notice to the Commissioner. These notices need to set out the names and IRD numbers of the relevant companies as well as the respective amounts (or formula for calculation of the amounts) of net loss to be offset. Late elections and extensions of time for filing them 21. An election must generally be made by 31 March in the year following the year of loss offset (that is, in the year to March 31 when the offset is elected). However, the Commissioner can agree to a later date for the election: section IC 9(2). The notification of the election may be made in the \[late\] return, or by separate notice. Note that in the case of a subvention payment, the payment must also be made within the same time for notifying the Commissioner of the election: section IC 9(1). 22. In considering an application to apply this discretion, the Commissioner will be WITHDRAWN UNCLASSIFIED 6 Example 3 A request to extend the date for making a loss offset election is filed on 10 April after 31 March of the year following the year of loss offset. The reason given for requesting the extension is that although the loss company’s income tax return had been prepared and filed sometime previously there were numerous profit companies in the group and the preparation of those returns had taken time. Consequently, the income tax returns for the profit companies had been filed late. The loss company made no loss offset election within the time for the loss company to file their income tax return. Section 113 of the TAA would not be applied to allow a loss offset. As such, the timeframe for notifying the loss offset election would not be extended. mindful of the purpose of the loss offset regime which is to allow those companies that incur losses to utilise those losses even where different entities are involved. There should be similarity in the tax treatment of a group of companies, each carrying on separate enterprises, as compared with a single company that carries on the same enterprises in separate divisions. A case need not be exceptional for the discretion to be exercised favourably. The Commissioner will generally extend the timeframe required to make loss offset elections where a loss offset would be allowed. However, where the loss company has already taken a tax position that does not provide for a loss determination, an amendment to that tax position will be required to apply any subsequent loss offset election. It is logical that the same rationale that relates to an amendment under section 113 of the TAA, should be applied to the discretion to extend the date for making an election. This means that where an amendment to an assessment under section 113 would be denied, the Commissioner would not extend the timeframe for notifying a late loss offset election. 23. To summarise this aspect, the decision to exercise the discretion to notify the late loss offset election will be based on whether the loss offset will be allowed. If the loss offset will be allowed, then the discretion will be exercised. Where the loss company is seeking to amend a position already taken with regard to the loss offset, the discretion will only be exercised where the approval under section 113 of the TAA will be applied with regard to the loss offset election. Further elections 24. Once a loss company has made an election, it cannot withdraw that election or change any part of that election. It is final and irrevocable: section IC 5(4). However, further elections can be made in some cases, for instance a loss company is not limited to a single election in respect of only one profit company. As already highlighted, it must be remembered that any further elections would be treated as a request to amend an assessment under section 113. Part-year losses WITHDRAWN UNCLASSIFIED 7 25. It is possible to offset a part-year loss (section IP 4) provided the following requirements as set out in section IP 4(2) are met: ● the tax loss component arises in the common span (as defined in section IP 2(1)), and ● the amount of the tax loss component is no more than the net income that the profit company derives in the common span, and ● continuity of ownership in the loss company under section IC 2(1) applies from the beginning to the end of the common span, and ● the loss company and the profit company provide the Commissioner with adequate financial statements under section IP 6. These accounts should contain sufficient information to indicate the calculation of the amount of the company’s net income for the relevant part of the corresponding income year. The Commissioner’s view is that the financial statements are required to be prepared in accordance with the generally accepted accounting practice, adjusted for the purposes of income tax legislation, at the level required under the Financial Reporting Act 2013 and the Tax Administration (Financial Statements) Order 2014. This does not require the preparation of notes to the accounts and disclosure statements. The part-year accounts will of necessity be different from full year accounts due to different ratios, denominators etc, and ● a valid loss offset election (section IP 7) within the timeframes required for elections under section IC 9. 26. Where a company has a break in shareholder continuity part way through a month and its accounting system balances and reports at the end of the month, subject to the taxpayer backing out significant transactions pre or post the change in continuity, Inland Revenue will accept the use of the end-of-month balance sheet figures for determining provision balances. Inland Revenue will also accept pro-rata allocation of the month’s income and expenditure to determine the pre and post continuity change in net income or loss. 27. In some cases it may be difficult to prepare part-year accounts to the level of detail set out above, particularly where there has been a significant lapse of time since the loss of shareholder continuity for the part-year. In such circumstances, taxpayers may discuss their individual positions with Inland Revenue and depending on the facts a different approach may be agreed upon. Amended assessments 28. In some cases Inland Revenue may amend an assessment for a profit or loss company resulting in increased or reduced net income or losses respectively. As a consequence there may be a need for further elections for additional loss offsets. There are four situations that may be brought about by amended assessments. These are: WITHDRAWN UNCLASSIFIED 8 ● the available loss is reduced below the amount originally elected to be offset ● the available loss is increased ● the profit company has additional net income that could be the subject of an offset, and ● the profit company has reduced net income below the level of the amount of the loss offset. Reduced loss 29. Where the loss company’s assessment is amended (having its loss reduced below the level in the loss offset election) and as a consequence is not entitled to offset the amount elected then the following action will be taken: (i) where there is only one profit company then the Commissioner will, usually after consultation with the company or its agent, simply amend the assessment for the profit company in accordance with section 113 of the TAA. No further election is necessary as the assessment of the profit company will reflect the reduced loss available to be offset, and (ii) where there is more than one profit company the loss company will need to notify Inland Revenue as to how that reduced loss is to be allocated to the profit companies pursuant to section IC 11(3). If the loss company does not make this subsequent election within 6 months of the loss company being notified that it’s tax loss is reduced or within such further time as the Commissioner may allow, the reduced loss is allocated proportionately to the original amount of the loss offset allocated to each profit company: section IC 11(4). 30. In the case where the reduction results in a subvention payment being treated as a dividend in the hands of the loss company, the dividend may be reduced to the extent this portion of the subvention payment is repaid to the profit company within the same timeframe discussed in the preceding paragraph: section IC 11(5) Increased loss 31. Where the loss company’s assessment is amended and as a consequence has additional losses to offset, a further election can be made for those additional losses. The first election remains valid and cannot be revoked. The further election must meet all the criteria set out above for an election, for example it must be on time, state the additional amount to be offset, and name the profit company or companies. As discussed already, any amendment will be subject to the SPS 16/01 Requests to amend assessments, April 2016. Increased profit 32. Where a profit company’s assessment is amended and as a consequence has WITHDRAWN UNCLASSIFIED 9 additional net income that could be the subject of an offset, a further election can be made by the loss company in respect of the additional net income within the statutory time period (set out in section IC 9(2)). This election must meet all the criteria for loss offsets. The emphasis will be on the notification of a loss offset by the loss company. It will not focus on the profit company’s change in net income. Reduced profit 33. Where a profit company’s assessment is amended and as a consequence has reduced net income (below the level of the loss offset), the deduction for the profit company remains valid up to the reduced amount of the net income. The “unused” tax loss will be added back to the loss balance carried forward by the loss company. A further election can be made for the additional losses to other profit companies within the group. Any further election must meet all the relevant criteria for loss off- sets. Requests to amend assessments 34. Changes to the assessments of the loss company or profit company may impact on the loss offset election already made and the availability of further loss offset elections. Examples are discussed in the immediately preceding paragraphs. 35. Requests will be looked at from the amending loss company’s point of view. This means, for example, that the Commissioner will be considering why a loss company made an error with their initial loss offset. In that case, it may not be relevant why the profit companies’ net income was amended. 36. Where there are any consequential impacts on the loss offset election and a further election needs to be made or the election needs to be revised, the taxpayer companies may need to consider whether section 113 of the TAA allows those changes to be implemented. SPS 16/01 Requests to amend assessments (Apr 16) (published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol. 28, No. 4 (May 2016)), which sets out the circumstances when the Commissioner may amend assessments to ensure correctness, is relevant in considering whether the election should be accepted. 37. It should be noted that taking tax positions that both include or exclude a loss offset are each correct tax positions. The Commissioner will not amend one correct tax position to another correct tax position unless the initial tax position was made in error. In terms of SPS 16/01, the onus will be on the taxpayer to show that this was the case. 38. It is the Commissioner’s practice that having approved a further election so that the loss company’s loss or the profit company’s net income is increased or reduced, those amendments will be made. Generally the Commissioner will not agree to amend an assessment where the taxpayer has previously had the opportunity to offset known losses, and has failed, for whatever reason, to do so. WITHDRAWN

Tax payments - when received in time (WITHDRAWN)
================================================

This standard practice statement sets out Inland Revenue’s practice for accepting tax payments as having been made in time.

Withdrawn
---------

This statement has been withdrawn and is provided for historical purposes only.

This statement also appears in _Tax Information Bulletin_, Vol 31, No 3 (April 2019).

### Introduction

Standard practice statements describe how the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) will exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts.

This standard practice statement (this Statement) sets out the Inland Revenue’s practice for accepting tax payments as having been made in time.

With the influence of technology there has been a significant shift in practice to use digital methods for making tax payments. The Commissioner encourages customers to use direct banking facilities when they make tax payments (or when refunds are issued).

### Application

This Statement applies from 1 March 2019. It replaces SPS 14/01 _Tax payments – when received in time_, which was published in _Tax Information Bulletin_, Vol 26, No 8 (September 2014).

Standard practice
-----------------

### Summary

1.  This Statement sets out when Inland Revenue would accept payments as having been received in time, including:

*   electronic payments (from New Zealand)
*   debit/credit cards
*   cash and eftpos payments
*   payments by cheque (including from overseas)
*   tax pooling
*   tax transfers
*   overseas electronic payments
*   weekends and public holidays

### Detailed discussion

2.  This Statement applies to all tax types, including student loan repayments and child support payments.

**New Zealand electronic payments**

3.  Customers are encouraged to make payments electronically, including by internet banking. Payment by this method minimises delays and includes a formal notification of the date and time the payment was made to Inland Revenue. A payment will be received in time when it has been electronically paid or direct credited into an Inland Revenue account either on or before the due date. You may need to be familiar with your bank's processing schedule.
4.  If a customer wishes to post-date an electronic payment the “my tax payment” option is available on all major New Zealand banks’ websites.
5.  Customers who are registered for myIR can set up direct debits where available for certain revenue types. A direct debit payment will be received in time when it has been credited into an Inland Revenue account on or before the New Zealand due date.
6.  Tax agents who are registered for myIR can set up instalment arrangements and one-off payments on behalf of their clients (who are registered for myIR) by direct debit on a condition that the client has authorised this action.

**Debit/credit cards**

7.  Customers can make payment by debit/credit card over the phone, through the payment page on our website for all revenues, and through myIR, our secure online service.
8.  A convenience fee of 1.42% is payable (charged by the banks) on all debit/credit card tax payments made within New Zealand. This fee also applies to debit/credit card tax payments from overseas, except for child support debt and student loan repayments where Inland Revenue pays the convenience fee.
9.  A debit/credit card payment will be received in time when it has been paid or direct credited into an Inland Revenue account on or before the New Zealand due date.

**Cash and Eftpos payments**

10.  Payments by cash or eftpos cannot be accepted at an Inland Revenue office. Customers may make payments by cash or by eftpos at branches of Westpac. Payments made over the counter or by eftpos are received in time if they are made on or before the due date. (Note: While payment of tax may be made at Westpac branches, Westpac is not authorised to accept returns. Returns may be filed electronically, posted to Inland Revenue or delivered to an Inland Revenue office.)
11.  Customers with a Westpac bank account may also make payments via Westpac ATMs, provided they have a payment slip with a bar code that has been issued by Inland Revenue.

**Payments by cheque**

_Physical delivery to Inland Revenue offices_

12.  Cheque payments will be accepted as being received in time if delivered to an Inland Revenue office on or before the close of business on the due date.
13.  Drop boxes are now inside Inland Revenue office reception areas and are only available during reception opening hours.

_Cheques through post_

14.  Cheques posted to an Inland Revenue postal address, whether posted from within New Zealand or from overseas, must be received on or before the due date. Payments by post should be sent to: Inland Revenue, PO Box 39050, Wellington Mail Centre, Lower Hutt 5045.

_Post-dated cheques_

15.  Inland Revenue will make its best efforts not to bank post-dated cheques until the specified date. A cheque that is post-dated after the due date, even though it may have been received on or before the due date, will be treated as late. This applies to cheques that are mailed or physically delivered.

**Tax pooling**

16.  Tax pooling involves customers depositing money with a tax pooling intermediary who then deposits that money into a tax pooling account with Inland Revenue. These deposits are not tax payments at this stage.
17.  It is when a payment is transferred from the tax pooling account into a taxpayer’s tax account that it becomes a tax payment. The date of payment to Inland Revenue is triggered when the tax pooling deposit is transferred into a taxpayer’s account. The effective date of the transfer can be no earlier than the date the tax pool deposit was received by Inland Revenue.
18.  For more information on the implications of tax pooling see _Tax Information Bulletins_, Vol 15, No 5 (May 2003) pages 64 to 67, Vol 23, No 8 (October 2011) pages 35 to 55 and Vol. 29, No. 5 (June 2017) pages 148 to 149.

**Overseas electronic payments**

19.  A payment will be received in time when it has been electronically paid or direct credited into an Inland Revenue account either on or before the New Zealand due date.
20.  For more information about making payments from overseas visit www.ird.govt.nz/makepayment/overseas/from-overseas-index.html

**Tax transfers**

21.  For the rules regarding the transfers of overpaid taxes refer to _Tax Information Bulletins_, Vol 14, No 11 (November 2002) pages 35 to 47, Vol 16, No 1 (February 2004) page 71 and Vol. 17, No. 1 (February 2005) pages 101 to 102.

**Weekends and public holidays**

22.  If a due date falls on a weekend or a public holiday, then an electronic payment will be in time when it is credited into an Inland Revenue account on or before the next working day.
23.  If a due date falls on a weekend or a public holiday (including a provincial anniversary day), a payment will be in time if it is received by an Inland Revenue branch office, at a Westpac branch or at an Inland Revenue postal address on the next working day. This treatment only applies to those customers who usually deliver payments to a Westpac branch or Inland Revenue drop box in the province that is celebrating its anniversary day and so are unable to access those sites on that day.

This Standard Practice Statement is signed on 19 February 2019.

A separate barcode is required for each individual tax type payable and tax period. 12. Customers with a Westpac bank account may pay (cash or EFTPOS) via Westpac Smart ATMs. Customers making payments at a Westpac smartATM must also use a barcode obtained from letters, returns \[3\] , and statements issued by Inland Revenue, or a barcode generated online \[4\] 13.

From 1 March 2020, Inland Revenue will no longer accept cheques as a method for payment of tax. Customers are expected to explore and use other bank services available for making payments. 21. The Commissioner may agree in exceptional circumstances to continue to receive a payment by cheque where a customer is unable to pay by any other means. Customers who consider that none of the other options for paying tax is practicable for them should contact the Commissioner explaining why they cannot use one of the current options and so wish to continue to pay their tax using cheques. Each situation will be considered on a customer’s individual circumstances. Example 1 : Alternative payment method available Mary is 75 and lives in a remote area. She does not have access to the internet and there is no Westpac branch close by. Mary does have a landline and an EFTPOS card. Through discussion with the customer about her circumstances, it was agreed that she is able to (with assistance by phone) set up a direct debit with us, or make payments using an Automatic Payments form. On this basis, an exceptions arrangement to pay tax by cheque post 1 March 2020 would be declined. Example 2: Agreed cheque exception arrangement Jock lives in a remote rural area and lives off-the-grid. He does not have access to the internet or a reliable phone service and is many hours from any bank services. His only contact with Inland Revenue is through a Post Office box service from which he collects mail infrequently. The Commissioner would agree his circumstances are exceptional and that he may continue to pay tax by cheque post 1 March 2020. 22. Requests for approval to continue paying by cheque can be made by telephone, SecureMail (log in to myIR), by post and at face to face appointments with Inland Revenue. It is important that requests for cheque exception arrangements made via myIR include customer phone contact details (where possible), should Inland Revenue want to further discuss alternative payment options with them. Customers that are unable to provide phone contact details will be sent a response via myIR (if registered) or by post. Cheques through post 23. Where the Commissioner’s agreement has been given to make cheque payments, cheques must be received on or before the due date irrespective of whether they are posted from within New Zealand or from overseas. Payments by post should be sent to: Inland Revenue, PO Box 39050, Wellington Mail Centre, Lower Hutt 5045. 24. Post-dated cheques will not be accepted as a payment method for tax after 1 March 2020. 25. Cheques will be returned to customers who have not obtained prior WITHDRAWN 6 UNCLASSIFIED agreement from the Commissioner to pay by this method. Physical delivery to Inland Revenue offices 26. Where the Commissioner’s agreement has been given to make cheque payments, cheque payments will be accepted as being received in time if delivered to an Inland Revenue office on or before the close of business on the due date. Income Equalisation Scheme (IES) deposits and primary sector business customers 27. Customers are to continue paying IES by cheque until an alternative payment option is provided. IES customers will be advised when the myPay tax payment upgrade is available to pay IES deposits. Weekends and public holidays 28. If a due date falls on a weekend or a public holiday (including a provincial anniversary day), a payment will be in time when it is received at a Westpac branch or an Inland Revenue bank account on or before the next working day. 29. The treatment for a provincial anniversary day only applies to those customers located in the province that is celebrating its anniversary day and usually make tax payments in person over-the-counter at Westpac, so are unable to make payment on that day.

1 UNCLASSIFIED Standard practice statement SPS 20/02 Loss offset elections between group companies Introduction Standard practice statements describe how the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) will exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. This Statement sets out certain practices that the Commissioner will accept for offsetting losses by election between group companies. It also sets out the consequences of specific events that can impact on a loss offset and how these should be addressed. The Statement does not consider all questions relating to loss offsets within a group of companies and accordingly is not a fully comprehensive guide to Subpart IC of the Income Tax Act 2007. All legislative references in this Statement refer to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise specified. Application This Statement applies from 12 February 2020 and replaces SPS 17/03 Loss offset elections between group companies published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 30, No 1 (February 2018). Standard practice Summary 1. The purpose of the loss offset provisions is to allow those companies that incur losses to utilise those losses even where different entities are involved. This means that there is similarity in the tax treatment of a group of companies, each carrying on separate enterprises, as compared with a single company that carries on the same enterprises in separate divisions. 2. This S tatement sets out the application of certain pre-requisites and other aspects of loss offset provisions in Subpart IC which allow loss offset elections to be made. It discusses the requirements for giving notice, the Commissioner’s practice with respect to part-year losses and explains what should happen when the loss 2 UNCLASSIFIED company’s loss or the profit company’s net income is increased or reduced. It also sets out the requirements for there to be a valid election and/or subvention payment. 3. A loss company must be resident in New Zealand in terms of s IC 7. The loss company must have maintained a 49% continuity of ownership from the time of the loss to the time of the offset. The profit company(ies) and the loss company must have at least 66% common ownership. The amount of loss offset(s) will be limited to the amount of profit(s) in the profit company(ies). The amount must be fixed by the election in a manner that binds the electing company but need not be quantified in the election. Refer to \[13\] to \[15\] for more detail in this area. 4. The loss company must notify the Commissioner of an election for the loss offset and where applicable of a subvention payment within the timeframe under s IC 9. The election may be notified in a tax return or separately from the tax return. The Commissioner may agree to an extension of time for filing the election so long as the request for an extension of time is made and approved before an offset is made. Detailed discussion 5. Subpart IC provides for the sharing of losses between companies that are in the same group of companies. A company may make its tax loss available for subtraction from the net income of another group company. 6. There are two methods of sharing losses which may be used together. The first is for the loss company to notify an election in its tax return for the loss to be made available to the profit company. Any such election is irrevocable. That election must be notified to the Commissioner no later than the 31 March that follows the end of the loss company’s year of offset, or within such further time as the Commissioner may allow: s IC 9(2). 7. Another method of sharing a loss is for the profit company to make a “subvention payment” to the loss company. A subvention payment made to the loss company is offset against the profit company’s net income and reduces the loss company’s available net losses. The payment to the loss company and notice to the Commissioner by the loss company of that payment must be made no later than the 31 March that follows the end of the loss company’s year of offset, or within such further time as the Commissioner may allow: ss IC 9(1) and (2). 8. Previously the Commissioner took the view that a subvention payment required actual payment to be made. However, from December 2010 it is accepted that in the absence of any statutory definition of “payment” in the context of subvention payments, the following principles will apply: a) The ordinary meaning requires a discharge of obligations between parties. b) There are several ways in which an obligation may be discharged including payment in cash or its equivalent or by certain accounting entries. c) Payment may be made by accounting entries where they cause a genuine crediting in the payee’s account or set off a pre-existing obligation. Making a journal entry will not be generally sufficient to cause a “payment” unless there is a clear agreement between the parties that this will satisfy the obligation. Consequently, in the subvention payment context, “payment” will be satisfied when the obligation under the subvention payment agreement has been discharged. The obligation can be discharged by an actual cash payment, cheque or bank transfer. Other methods of discharging an obligation can also amount to “payment”. An 3 UNCLASSIFIED obligation will generally be discharged where the payee can no longer sue the payer for the payment. It should be noted that an accounting entry that merely records an intention to pay a subvention payment will not in itself amount to a “payment”. Also, simply resolving to pay a subvention payment does not amount to creating an enforceable obligation. Example 1 A loss company has an obligation to pay a debt to a profit company for past purchases from the profit company. The profit company resolves to make a subvention payment to the loss company. The profit company and the loss company decide to allow the subvention payment to be applied in satisfaction of the loss co mpany’s past debt. An accounting entry is made to record this. The accounting entry is treated as the payment of the subvention payment. 9. As stated above, this Statement sets out the application of certain aspects of loss offset provisions in Subpart IC which allow loss offset elections to be made. It discusses the requirements for giving notice, the Commissioner’s practice with respect to part year losses, and explains what should happen when the loss company’s loss or the profit company’s net income is increased or reduced. It also sets out the requirements for there to be a valid election. Where this statement discusses elections, it is equally referring to notices of subvention payments made. 10. The election may be included in the loss company’s income tax return or made separately from the tax return. An election must be made by the latest time to file a loss company’s income tax return. The Commissioner has discretion to accept a late election to offset losses beyond an agreed extension of time to file the return. 11. The Commissioner must approve the application to apply the discretion and agree to make the loss offset. The mere processing of the return and issuing the taxpayer’s notice of assessment do not amount to an exercise of the discretion by the Commissioner to accept a late loss offset election. Prerequisites 12. Before a loss offset can proceed the following factors must be present. Loss company 13. There must be a company with a tax loss for an income year or a loss balance carried forward. The loss company must have 49% continuity of ownership from the time the loss is incurred until the loss is offset: ss IA 5(2), (3) and (6). 14. The loss company for the commonality period under s IC 6(1) must be incorporated in New Zealand or be carrying on a business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment in New Zealand. 15. The loss company for the commonality period under s IC 6(1) must not be a dual resident company, that is, though resident in New Zealand it must not be: ● treated under a double tax agreement as not being resident in New Zealand for the purposes of the double tax agreement, or ● liable to income tax in another country by reason of domicile, residence or place of incorporation: s IC 7. 4 UNCLASSIFIED 16. A qualifying company may only receive a loss offset from another qualifying company: s HA 22. Profit company 17. There must be one or more profit companies in the same group of companies as the loss company and all companies must be in the same group of companies for the whole continuity period as defined in s IA 5(6). A group of companies must have at least 66% common ownership. Whether or not two companies form a group of companies is outside the scope of this Statement. More detailed guidance on common ownership can be found in the Interpretation Statement: IS 13/02 Income tax – whether certain rights conferred by the Companies Act 1993 could give rise to a “ shareholder decision-making right”. 1 Amount of loss 18. The amount of loss to be offset must not exceed the net income of the elected profit company for the tax year, or the total net income of all the elected profit companies. Nor can the amount of subvention payment that the profit company agrees to pay the loss company exceed the loss company’s tax loss: s IC 8. A specific amount 19. An election should refer to an amount that is capable of identification as a specific dollar amount. The amount must be fixed by the election in a manner that binds the loss company but need not be quantified in the notice of election. That is, a formula may be used where the result of applying that formula could be known at the time of the election. For instance, the election might provide that the tax loss to be offset is to be such an amount that would reduce the profit company’s net income to nil. Example 2 In a group consisting of two companies, it is found, once its accounts have been prepared, that Company A has a tax loss of $10,000. It is anticipated that Company B will be in profit and that the amount of the net income will be about $2,000, ie less than the amount of Company A’s tax loss. However, Company B’s accounts have still to be prepared as the accountants are waiting on further information from their clients. That information will be arriving in a few days. There is still time to file an election and the question is whether Company A can now elect to offset some of its loss up to the amount of the profit company’s net income by using a formula. This is permissible because: • the Commissioner will be notified in time; • the amount will be subsequently identified as a specific dollar amount; • it does not matter that (even if the accounting firm could commit staff to the finalisation of the accounts) the net income cannot be ascertained with finality at the time of making the election; • the amount to be offset is already fixed in that it is controlled by the formula. 1 T his statement can be found at www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword: “IS 13/02”). 5 UNCLASSIFIED The election 20. An election to offset the tax loss must be notified by the loss company. The loss company can give notice of election by: ● completing the appropriate boxes in the loss company’s income tax return, or ● completing the appropriate boxes in the loss company’s e- filed income tax return, or ● sending a separate notice to the Commissioner. These notices need to set out the names and IRD numbers of the relevant companies as well as the respective amounts (or formula for calculation of the amounts) of net loss to be offset. Late elections and extensions of time for filing them 21. An election must generally be made by 31 March in the year following the year of loss offset (that is, in the year to March 31 when the offset is elected). However, the Commissioner can agree to a later date for the election: s IC 9(2). The notification of the ele ction may be made in the return, or by separate notice. Note that in the case of a subvention payment, the payment must also be made within the same time for notifying the Commissioner of the election: s IC 9(1). 22. In considering an application to apply this discretion, the Commissioner will be mindful of the purpose of the loss offset regime which is to allow those companies that incur losses to utilise those losses even where different entities are involved. There should be similarity in the tax treatment of a group of companies, each carrying on separate enterprises, as compared with a single company that carries on the same enterprises in separate divisions. A case need not be exceptional for the discretion to be exercised favourably. The Commissioner will generally extend the timeframe required to make loss offset elections where a loss offset would be allowed. However, where the loss company has already taken a tax position that does not provide for a loss offset of a (current year) net loss, an amendment to that tax position will be required to apply any subsequent loss offset election. It is logical that the same rationale that relates to an amendment under s 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) - where this involves a change to a (current year) net loss - should be applied to the discretion to extend the date for making an election. This means that where an amendment to an assessment under s 113 (TAA) would be denied, the Commissioner would not extend the timeframe for notifying a late loss offset election. 23. To summarise this aspect, the decision to exercise the discretion to notify the late loss offset election will be based on whether the loss offset will be allowed. If the loss offset will be allowed, then the discretion will be exercised. Where the loss company is seeking to amend a position already taken with regard to the loss offset, the discretion will only be exercised where the approval under s 113 (TAA) would be applied. 24. Where the late election relates to the loss company’s available tax losses other than a current year net loss (losses brought forward), then the same rationale that applies to amendments under section 113 (TAA) will equally apply to deciding whether the late election will be allowed. This rationale is set out in SPS 16/01 Requests to amend assessments 2 . 2 This statement can be found at www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword: SPS 16/01). 6 UNCLASSIFIED Example 3 A request to extend the date for making a loss offset election is filed on 10 April after 31 March of the year following the year of loss offset. The reason given for requesting the extension is that although the loss company’s income tax return had been prepared and filed sometime previously there were numerous profit companies in the group and the preparation of those returns had taken time. Consequently, the income tax returns for the profit companies had been filed late. At the time of filing its return, the loss company was unaware of the group company’s profit outcome. The loss company made no loss offset election within the time for the loss company to file their income tax return. Section 113 (TAA) would be applied to allow a loss offset. The reason is that the loss company was not aware of the full facts and erred when it took its tax position ( refer para \[59\] of SPS 16/01 – Requests to amend assessments). Further elections 25. Once a loss company has made an election, it cannot withdraw that election or change any part of that election. It is final and irrevocable: s IC 5(4). However, further elections can be made in some cases, for instance a loss company is not limited to a single election in respect of only one profit company. As already noted, it must be remembered that any further elections would be treated as a request to amend an assessment under s 113 (TAA). Part-year losses 26. It is possible to offset a part-year loss (s IP 4) provided the following requirements as set out in s IP 4(2) are met: ● the tax loss component arises in the common span (as defined in s IP 2(1)), and ● the amount of the tax loss component is no more than the net income that the profit company derives in the common span, and ● continuity of ownership in the loss company under s IC 2(1) applies from the beginning to the end of the common span, and ● the loss company and the profit company provide the Commissioner with adequate financial statements under s IP 6. These accounts should contain sufficient information to indicate the calculation of the amount of the company’s net income for the relevant part of the corresponding income year. The Commissioner’s view is that the financial statements are required to be prepared in accordance with the generally accepted accounting practice, adjusted for the purposes of income tax legislation, at the level required under the Financial Reporting Act 2013 and the Tax Administration (Financial Statements) Order 2014. This does not require the preparation of notes to the accounts and disclosure statements. The part-year accounts will of necessity be different from full year accounts due to different ratios, denominators etc, and ● a valid loss offset election (s IP 7) within the timeframes required for elections under s IC 9. 7 UNCLASSIFIED • As stated above, loss offsets are limited to the profit company’s profit for the year (s IC 8 refers). 27. Where a company has a break in shareholder continuity part way through a month and its accounting system balances and reports at the end of the month, subject to the taxpayer backing out significant transactions pre or post the change in continuity, the Commissioner will accept the use of the end-of-month balance sheet figures for determining provision balances. She will also accept pro-rata allocation of the month’s income and expenditure to determine the pre and post continuity change in net income or loss. 28. In some cases it may be difficult to prepare part-year accounts to the level of detail set out above, particularly where there has been a significant lapse of time since the loss of shareholder continuity for the part-year. In such circumstances, taxpayers may discuss their individual positions with the Commissioner and depending on the facts a different approach may be agreed upon. Amended assessments 29. In some cases, the Commissioner may amend an assessment for a profit or loss company resulting in increased or reduced net income or losses respectively. As a consequence there may be a need for further elections for additional loss offsets. There are four situations that may be brought about by amended assessments. These are: ● the available loss is reduced below the amount originally elected to be offset; ● the available loss is increased; ● the profit company has additional net income that could be the subject of an offset: and ● the profit company has reduced net income below the level of the amount of the loss offset. Reduced loss 30. Where the loss company’s assessment is amended (having its loss reduced below the level in the loss offset election) and consequently is not entitled to offset the amount elected then the following action will be taken: (i) where there is only one profit company then the Commissioner will, usually after consultation with the company or its agent, simply amend the assessment for the profit company in accordance with section 113 (TAA). No further election is necessary as the assessment of the profit company will reflect the reduced loss available to be offset, and (ii) where there is more than one profit company the loss company will need to notify the Commissioner as to how that reduced loss is to be allocated to the profit companies pursuant to IC 11(3). If the loss company does not make this subsequent election within 6 months of the loss company being notified that its tax loss is reduced or within such further time as the Commissioner may allow, the reduced loss is allocated proportionately to the original amount of the loss offset allocated to each profit company: s IC 11(4). 31. In the case where the reduction results in a subvention payment being treated as a 8 UNCLASSIFIED dividend in the hands of the loss company, the dividend may be reduced to the extent this portion of the subvention payment is repaid to the profit company within the same timeframe discussed in the preceding paragraph: s IC 11(5). Increased loss 32. Where the loss company’s assessment is amended and therefore has additional losses to offset, a further election can be made for those additional losses. The first election remains valid and cannot be revoked. The further election must meet all the criteria set out above for an election, for example it must be on time, state the additional amount to be offset, and name the profit company or companies. As discussed already, any amendment will be subject to the SPS 16/01. Increased profit 33. Where a profit company’s assessment is amended and consequently has additional net income that could be the subject of an offset, a further election can be made by the loss company in respect of the additional net income within the statutory time period (set out in s IC 9(2)). This election must meet all the criteria for loss offsets. The emphasis will be on the notification of a loss offset by the loss company. It will not focus on the profit company’s change in net income. Reduced profit 34. Where a profit company’s assessment is amended and therefore has reduced net income (below the level of the loss offset), the deduction for the profit company remains valid up to the reduced amount of the net income. The “unused” tax loss will be added back to the loss balance carried forward by the loss company. A further election can be made for the additional losses to other profit companies within the group. Any further election must meet all the relevant criteria for loss off- sets. Requests to amend assessments 35. Changes to the assessments of the loss company or profit company may impact on the loss offset election already made and the availability of further loss offset elections. Examples are discussed in the immediately preceding paragraphs. 36. Requests will be looked at from the amending loss company’s point of view. This means, for example, that the Commissioner will be considering why a loss company made an error with their initial loss offset. In that case, it may not be relevant why the profit companies’ net income was amended. 37. Where there are any consequential impacts on the loss offset election and a further election needs to be made or the election needs to be revised, the taxpayer companies may need to consider whether s 113 (TAA) allows those changes to be implemented SPS 16/01) sets out the circumstances when the Commissioner may amend assessments to ensure correctness, is relevant in considering whether the election should be accepted. 38. It should be noted that taking tax positions that both include or exclude a loss offset are each correct tax positions. The Commissioner will not amend one correct tax position to another correct tax position unless the initial tax position was made in er ror. The onus will be on the taxpayer to show that this was the case. 39. It is the Commissioner’s practice that having approved a further election so that the 9 UNCLASSIFIED loss company’s loss or the profit company’s net income is increased or reduced, those amendments will be made. Generally, the Commissioner will not agree to amend an assessment where the taxpayer has previously had the opportunity to offset known losses, and has failed, for whatever reason, to do so.

All legislative references are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the “TAA”), unless otherwise stated. The relevant legislative provisions of the Act are set out in the Legislative References page at the back of this Statement. This Statement also appears in Tax Information Bulletin Vol. 33, No. 4 (June 2021). Application This Statement applies from 6 May 2021 and replaces SPS 13/01: Retention of business records in electronic format, application to store records offshore and application to keep records in Māori, published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 25, No 3 (April 2013). It applies to customers who are required to keep business and other records under the Inland Revenue Acts and other third parties that hold business records for customers offshore. SPS 21/02 | 6 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 17 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Standard practice Summary 1. This Statement applies to the Commissioner’s discretion to allow customers to store information in a digital format and also sets out how the discretion to store business records offshore will be applied. It also confirms that as official languages of New Zealand, customers may keep their records in English or te reo Māori. It also provides guidelines for customers who wish to keep their records in a language other than English or te reo Māori. 2. The TAA and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GSTA) require customers to keep business and GST records in New Zealand and in either English or te reo Māori. The Commissioner has the discretion to authorise the offshore storage of records or to authorise records being kept in a language other than English or te reo Māori. The TAA allows applications to be made by a third party data storage provider, such as a cloud service provider, to store records offshore for their clients. 3. Records stored electronically, both inside and outside of New Zealand, and either on the customer’s own electronic storage system or on an outsourced system, must meet the requirements of the Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017 (CCLA). This provides that the integrity of the information contained in the records is to be maintained and that the information is readily accessible so as to be usable for subsequent reference. Further conditions for legal requirements to retain records under the Inland Revenue Acts are provided in schedule 2, clause 4 of the Contract and Commercial Law (Electronic Transactions) Regulations 2017 (CCLETR). 4. It is the Commissioner’s view that the requirements in the CCLA and the conditions in the CCLETR are met if the practices in \[26\] to \[37\] of this statement are followed. 5. The Commissioner may authorise a customer to store records offshore or a third party to hold records offshore for multiple customers, if the storage of those records offshore does not impede the Commissioner’s compliance activities. In particular, the records stored offshore must remain accessible by the Commissioner. An applicant will be required to demonstrate that the manner in which the records are to be stored offshore will meet the requirements of the CCLA and the CCLETR. Each application will be considered on a case by case basis having regard to the merits of the case, including the compliance history of the applicant. 6. For a third party application, the Commissioner will also consider whether the third party carries on business in, or through, an establishment in New Zealand. The SPS 21/02 | 6 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 17 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Commissioner will also take account of the procedure that the third party has for dealing with client data should they cease to hold records for a client. 7. The Commissioner may impose conditions on an authorisation to store records offshore. The need to impose such conditions is determined on a case by case basis. 8. The Commissioner may withdraw an authorisation, either upon request by the party to which the authorisation applies or by giving reasonable notice of the withdrawal. 9. An authorisation given to a third party does not replace a customer’s responsibility to meet the record keeping requirements as prescribed in the Inland Revenue Acts. The authorisation merely enables the third party to store the customer’s records offshore without the customer being in breach of their obligations. 10. Pursuant to s 17B, the Commissioner can request information from any person, including a third party. Generally, the records of a specific customer will be obtained from that individual customer in the first instance. The Commissioner may request this information from a third party if it is necessary in the particular circumstances of the case. 11. The Commissioner will follow the standard practice for protecting customers’ rights to non-disclosure of tax advice documents and documents that are legally privileged when requesting information 1 . 12. The Commissioner may authorise records to be kept in a language other than English or te reo Māori. Applications to keep records in other languages will be approved only in limited circumstances where there are compelling reasons to do so. These applications will be considered on the facts of each case. 13. All customers must use certain English phrases specifically required by the GSTA and numbers must be recorded using Arabic numerals. This will be the case even where the Commissioner has agreed to keep records in another language, or whether the customer has elected to keep their records in te reo Māori. Detailed discussion Obligation to keep business and other records 14. Section 22 requires a person who carries on a business in New Zealand (including those who do business via the Internet) to keep sufficient business records to enable 1 Refer to Operating Statement (OS) 18/02 Non-disclosure right for tax advice documents SPS 21/02 | 6 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 4 of 17 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] the Commissioner to readily ascertain the amount of tax payable by the business and all other tax matters relating to that business. 15. Records include, but are not limited to: • books of accounts that record receipts or payments or income or expenditure; • vouchers, bank statements, invoices, receipts, and other documents to verify entries in the books of accounts; • other accounts and documents specifically required to be maintained and kept. 16. Section 22(1) requires that the records to be kept in relation to a business must contain certain information. This includes: • a record of the assets and liabilities of the business; and • a record of all entries from day to day of all sums of money received and expended in relation to the business; and • all records and invoices relating to trading stock or the provision of services, depending on the type of business; and • charts and codes of accounts, the accounting instruction manuals, and the system and programme documentation which describes the accounting system used in each income year. 17. Business records must be retained in English or te reo Māori and at a place in New Zealand (unless the Commissioner has approved otherwise), and they must be retained for the full retention period required by the TAA, currently 7 years unless extended to 10 years by the Commissioner for specific situations. 18. Similar record keeping requirements are contained in s 75 of the GSTA for the retention of records specified in that section for GST purposes. 19. Records may be kept in paper form or electronic form. There must be sufficient detail to ensure a complete audit trail that allows tracing the retained records to and from accounting records and to tax returns. 20. Section 229 of the CCLA provides the option of using technology to store source paper documents by electronic means. The legal requirement to retain a document that is in paper form, is met by retaining an electronic form of the information if: • the electronic form provides a reliable means of assuring the maintenance of the integrity of the information; and • the information is readily accessible so as to be usable for subsequent reference. SPS 21/02 | 6 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 5 of 17 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 21. Subject to s 231 of the CCLA, s 230 of the same Act sets the standard for retaining information in electronic form. The legal requirement to retain information that is in electronic form is met by retaining the information: • in paper or non-electronic form if the form provides a reliable means of assuring the maintenance of the integrity of the information; and • the information is readily accessible so as to be usable for subsequent reference. 22. Section 231 of the CCLA provides extra conditions for electronic communications. If a person is required to retain information that is contained in an electronic communication the person must also retain information that can identify the origin, destination, and the time when the electronic communication was sent. This information must be readily accessible and usable for subsequent reference. 23. Schedule 2, clause 4 of the CCLETR provides conditions for legal requirements to retain records under the Inland Revenue Acts: • A record that is initially in paper or other non-electronic form may be retained in electronic form if the record is readily able to be produced in paper form and that the paper form is a duplicate image of the original paper or other non- electronic form. • If annotations, indexing references or other additional information are included in the electronic form of the record, they must not obscure any of the original information contained in the record and must be distinguishable as additions to the original record. • A record that is generated in electronic form and is provided to another person in paper or other non-electronic form may be retained in its electronic form only. • If a record is received from a person in both non-electronic form and electronic form, the record may be retained in its electronic form only. Retention of records in electronic form 24. The main requirements for keeping records in electronic form under the CCLA, whether the records were originally in paper form or in electronic form, are that: • the integrity of the information contained in the records is to be maintained; and • the information is readily accessible so as to be usable for subsequent reference. 25. The Commissioner considers that the information will meet the requirements of the CCLA and the CCLETR if the practices in \[26\] to \[37\] are followed. The same standards SPS 21/02 | 6 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 6 of 17 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] of record keeping practice applies to records stored both inside and outside of New Zealand, and either on the customer’s own electronic storage system or on an outsourced system. Originally in paper form 26. Paper records transferred to electronic form must be copied completely and accurately, for example, the use of imaging to provide information in a format identical in all respects to the source-paper document. A black and white scan of a coloured document is acceptable, unless the colours in the original document are material to understanding the information. The addition of information such as index referencing is also acceptable, provided the additional information does not obscure the original information and the additional information must be distinguishable as additions to the original record. 27. The electronic copy must be readily accessible and capable of being retrieved on legible hard copy (printouts) or supplied in an electronic form able to be read by Inland Revenue staff. 28. Source-paper documents or other non-electronic records from which the complete information is transferred and stored in electronic form, may be destroyed after transfer to the electronic form. 29. As an example, where a customer electronically transmits to the Commissioner information contained in any return in a prescribed form, s 36 of the TAA requires the customer to retain a hard-copy transcript of their information, and for a period of 7 years as required under s 22 of the TAA. The Commissioner considers that the requirement to keep the hard-copy transcript is met if the practices in \[26\] and \[27\] are followed. Originally in electronic form 30. Internal controls must be adequate to ensure that all business transactions executed electronically, including those executed through the internet, are completely and accurately captured. 31. People should be able to demonstrate that their electronic records systems are secure from both unauthorised access and data alterations. This usually involves developing and documenting a security program that: • establishes controls to ensure that only authorised personnel have access to electronic records; • provides for backup and recovery of records; SPS 21/02 | 6 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 7 of 17 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] • ensures that personnel are trained to safeguard sensitive or classified electronic records; and • minimises the risk of unauthorised alteration, addition or erasure. 32. The charts and codes of accounts, the accounting instruction manuals, and the system and programme documentation which describes the accounting system used, must be retained and produced (if required) to Inland Revenue staff. 33. Those who engage in the electronic transfer of tax invoices, credit notes or debit notes must retain electronic records that have an adequate level of detail to meet the requirements of the GSTA. This may require the customer to keep other records such as the underlying contracts, price lists, price changes, and product code descriptions. 34. Where tax invoices are held in an electronic format there is no requirement to also hold a copy of the invoice in either paper or.pdf format provided that the required details of the invoice are readily accessible so as to be useable for subsequent reference. Emails 35. An email that contains information required to be kept by the Inland Revenue Acts may be regarded as a record. Where emails are considered to be records s 231 of the CCLA requires the origin, destination and time of electronic communications to be retained and accessible so it can be used for subsequent references. Backup 36. Backup and recovery procedures must be sufficient to ensure the availability of electronic records for the required record retention period. Hardware/software changes 37. In the event of hardware/software changes: • facilities for retrieving electronic records that have been stored on the former system must be retained; or • the electronic records must be converted to a compatible system and both sets of files retained complete with documentation showing the method of transfer and controls in place to ensure the transfer was complete and accurate. SPS 21/02 | 6 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 8 of 17 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The Commissioner’s discretion to authorise offshore record keeping 38. Section 22(2BA)(b) requires a customer to keep their business records in New Zealand, unless the Commissioner has authorised under s 22(8) that the records may be kept offshore. This applies to business records in both paper form and electronic form. 39. Authorisation may be given to an individual customer to hold their own records offshore or to a person (a third party) to hold records for multiple clients offshore. 40. An individual customer who wants to store their business records offshore should apply to the Commissioner for authorisation to do so before sending their records outside of New Zealand. 41. A third party may include a cloud service provider or other data storage providers that hold records for multiple customers. 42. It may be necessary for a tax agent to make a third party application if that tax agent is storing their clients’ records for their clients outside New Zealand, i.e ., where the clients of the tax agent have outsourced the storage of records to the tax agent and the clients are not holding their own records. 43. If either a backup of the business records is retained in New Zealand, or if the records to be stored offshore are merely a backup of the records held in New Zealand, the Commissioner considers that the requirement to store the records in New Zealand is satisfied and an authorisation is not necessary. This applies to both individual customers and to third parties. 44. If an authorisation is granted to a third party the individual customers for whom the third party holds records for would not need a separate authorisation from the Commissioner. 45. However, third party applications should be sent to the Business Lifecycle Manager, Significant Enterprises at: Inland Revenue 5 Osterley Way Manakau PO Box 76198 Manakau City 2241 46. Individual applications may be made through MyIR, telephone or in writing to your local Inland Revenue office. SPS 21/02 | 6 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 9 of 17 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The Commissioner’s Consideration 47. The Commissioner may agree to a customer storing their business records offshore where the Commissioner is satisfied that the offshore storage would not impede compliance activities. In particular, the information stored offshore remains accessible by the Commissioner. 48. There are inherent risks to accessing information stored offshore as New Zealand laws may not apply to information that is physically stored in another jurisdiction (electronically or otherwise). The Commissioner must rely on the cooperation of customers or third parties to access information stored offshore. Furthermore, the Commissioner’s access could be jeopardised if the third party who is providing the storage services has no presence in New Zealand. 49. Therefore, in order to ensure the records held offshore by a third party remain accessible, the Commissioner will have regard to the following when considering an application by a third party: • whether the third party has a place of business in New Zealand or carries on its business through an establishment in New Zealand; and • how the clients’ data will be dealt with should the third party no longer hold records for clients or for a particular client (for example, the contractual relationship ends between a client and the third party or the third party ceases to exist). 50. Each application will be considered on the merits of the case and may include the compliance history of the applicant. 51. In terms of an authorisation to a third party, s 22(8)(b) provides that in addition to the Commissioner authorising the third party to hold records for customers outside New Zealand, the Commissioner also has the discretion to require the records to be kept in a particular form and to be accessible in a way approved by the Commissioner. The need to impose such terms on an authorisation to a third party will depend on the circumstances of the third party and will be considered on a case by case basis. 52. An application to store records offshore should address the above factors. If the storage of records offshore is by electronic means, the applicant may be required to provide information that demonstrates the manner in which the records are to be stored will meet the requirements of the CCLA and CCLETR as discussed in \[24\] to \[37\] above. The information supplied in support of the application may include the following: SPS 21/02 | 6 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 10 of 17 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] • documentation that describes the operation of the systems in which the records are stored; • explanation as to how the records are stored offshore and how they can be accessed by the Commissioner should it be required; • standard terms and conditions for services of data storage provided by the third party to their customers; • any Code of Practice disclosure statements applicable to a third party. For example, the New Zealand code of practice for cloud computing which a New Zealand-based cloud provider can voluntarily adhere to. Certain information about the cloud provider and its services are disclosed under the code of practice. 53. The standard timeframe for processing third party applications is three months, dependent on the timely receipt of any further information requested. Conditions of an authorisation 54. The Commissioner may impose conditions on an authorisation to store records offshore, as provided for in s 22(9). 55. All authorisations to store records offshore would be subject to the customer or third party providing an undertaking that the records would be provided to the Commissioner on request, in a usable format, and at no cost to Inland Revenue in obtaining the information. The undertaking would also require assurance that the records be provided in a timely manner and that extra time to respond to requests on the basis that the records are offshore would not be sought. 56. In order to ensure the information stored offshore continues to be accessible, the Commissioner may impose additional conditions that are considered necessary and reasonable in the circumstances of the case. As an example, to ensure that the Commissioner’s access to information is not compromised where the relationship between the customer and a third party ends, a reasonable condition may be imposed by the Commissioner on the third party. This condition could be that at the end of the service agreement between the client and the third party, the third party will return the data to their client either in: • a format that is meaningful to the client; or • a format that can be readily exported into a meaningful format that the client can understand and can be used for subsequent reference. 57. Conditions may be varied as circumstances of the customer or the third party applicant change. SPS 21/02 | 6 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 11 of 17 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Withdrawal of authorisation 58. No period of validity would be prescribed on an authorisation. However, the Commissioner may withdraw an authorisation, either upon request by the customer or the third party to which the authorisation applies or by giving reasonable notice of the withdrawal. Circumstances where an authorisation may be withdrawn include: • non-compliance to the conditions of an authorisation or to an information request; • the customer or third party no longer keeps records offshore. Public notice of an authorisation or withdrawal 59. A public notice of an authorisation given to a third party or the withdrawal of that authorisation will be published on Inland Revenue’s website. A list of authorised third party providers 2 can also be found on the IRD Tax Technical website. Customer has ultimate obligation 60. An authorisation given to a third party does not replace a customer’s responsibility to meet the record keeping requirements as per the Inland Revenue Acts. The authorisation merely enables a customer to store records offshore without being in breach of their obligation to hold those records in New Zealand. A customer still has the responsibility to ensure that their records, whether stored in New Zealand or offshore (or both), are sufficient to satisfy their record keeping requirements. 61. Further, an authorisation to a third party should not be relied upon as an approval of the third party as a service provider in general. The individual customer should carry out their own assessment of the third party to ensure that they are satisfied that services offered meet the customer’s business needs. The authorisation provided by the Commissioner merely relates to the offshore storage of records. Providing information to Inland Revenue 62. The Commissioner can request information from any person pursuant to s 17B. Any person, when required under s 17B, must produce for inspection any documents that the Commissioner considers necessary or relevant for a purpose under an Inland Revenue Act. The failure to produce information that is in the person’s knowledge, possession or control when requested, is an offence under the TAA. 2 https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/general-articles/third-party-providers-approved-to -store- taxpayer-electronic-records-offshore SPS 21/02 | 6 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 12 of 17 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 63. A third party may be required to provide information that is in their possession when requested under s 17B. The request may include any logs of entries, alterations and deletions of transactions that a third party may keep. 64. Generally, a s 17B request will be made to the customer in the first instance. On occasion, the Commissioner may request this information from a third party. Factors that may influence the Commissioner’s decision to request information from a third party include whether the documents required may be at risk, and where there has been non-compliance or non-cooperation with previous requests for information. 65. Section 17B notices (including those issued to a third party other than the customer) will be issued following the practice set out in OS 13/02 Section 17 3 notices (or any subsequent replacements of that OS). Also refer to SPS 10/02 Imaging of electronic storage media for the Commissioner’s standard practice for imaging of electronic information when exercising the information gathering powers now contained in s17 B. 66. Inland Revenue has officers that specialise in downloading electronically stored information. The preferred media for receiving electronic information is on CD, DVD or USB drive. However, other mutually agreeable transfer methods may be negotiated as required. 67. Electronic information supplied to Inland Revenue should be in a tab or comma delimited or fixed record length format, in EBCDIC or ASCII. It should be encrypted or password protected with the password/passphrase or any other information required to access the information supplied to Inland Revenue separately. The electronic information should be copied to media, not a proprietary back up. Documentation should be supplied with the media showing the record layout, record length, and number of records. Assistance to Inland Revenue Officers 68. Where necessary, adequate viewing and printing facilities should be made available free of charge to Inland Revenue officers. If requested, persons must locate selected records that have been stored and print any items selected, free of charge to Inland Revenue. 69. Someone must be available to explain the operation of their computer system to Inland Revenue officers. This is the case whether the system is owned and operated by the person or outsourced to a third party. 3 Section 17B was previously s 17 until amended by the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018-19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019. SPS 21/02 | 6 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 13 of 17 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Non-disclosure of tax advice document and legal privilege 70. Sections 20 to 20G provide customers with the right to non-disclosure of documents that are tax advice documents or documents that are legally privileged. The Commissioner will follow the standard practice for protecting these customer rights when requesting information. 71. There is a possibility that information relating to a particular customer obtained from a third party may contain documents that may be subject to these non-disclosure rights. Where a request for information is made to a person other than the customer pursuant to s 17B, the recipient of the request may contact the customer to confirm whether the customer wishes to claim non-disclosure right for tax advice documents or legal privilege over documents required to be disclosed. This is outlined in OS 13/02 Section 17 4 notices. 72. The Commissioner will attempt to deal with the claim of legal privilege or tax advice status of information with the person making the claim. If the claim of legal privilege or the non-disclosure of tax advice documents cannot be resolved between the Commissioner and the person making the claim, the Commissioner may apply to a District Court Judge for orders under s 20(5) as to whether the claim for legal privilege is valid or under s 20G as to whether the document is a tax advice document. 73. Refer to OS 18/02 Non-disclosure right for tax advice documents (or any subsequent replacements of that OS) for more information on what constitutes tax advice documents and the process for claiming non-disclosure right for these documents. The Commissioner’s discretion to authorise records being kept in a language other than English or te reo Māori 74. Sections 22, 26 (records to be kept for resident withholding tax purposes) and s 32 (records of specified charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural bodies) and s 75 of the GSTA require customers to keep sufficient records in the English or te reo Māori languages to enable the Commissioner to readily ascertain the customer’s liability to tax. 75. The reason for the requirement to keep records in English or te reo Māori is that these are New Zealand’s two official written languages. However, Inland Revenue recognises that the choice of language for business dealings is not a matter for the Commissioner 4 Section 17B was previously s 17 until amended by the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018-19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019. SPS 21/02 | 6 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 14 of 17 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] to determine. It may be reasonable for a person whose business is conducted in a language other than English or te reo Māori (alternative language) to have Inland Revenue accommodate their language preference. 76. Each of ss 22, 26 and 32 and s 75 of the GSTA provides discretion to the Commissioner to allow records to be kept in an alternative language, following an application. Therefore, those customers who wish to keep their records in an alternative language must apply to the Commissioner to do so. 77. The tax law obligations of other parties, such as the recipient of a tax invoice, must also be considered. When base records, such as invoices and receipts, are maintained in an alternative language there may be some inconvenience to other persons. GST tax invoices and debit and credit notes raise a specific issue. They are necessary for ascertaining the tax liability of the issuer and of that other party. Therefore, they are records covered by s 75(3) of the GSTA that must be maintained in English, unless the Commissioner gives permission to use another language. 78. There are explicit requirements under ss 24, 24BA and 25 of the GSTA for specific English phrases to be used in a GST tax invoice or debit and credit notes. These phrases are: • tax invoice; • copy only – on copy of lost tax invoice, credit or debit note; • buyer created tax invoice – IRD approved; • modified tax invoice – IRD approved; and • credit note or debit note – on credit or debit notes. 79. There is no discretion to allow the use of expressions in an alternative language to satisfy the requirements imposed in ss 24, 24BA and 25 of the GSTA. The Commissioner’s standard practice 80. A person may apply to keep records (i.e., invoices, receipts, cash books, and journals) in an alternative language for tax purposes. The application should specify which records the customer wishes to keep in an alternative language. 81. A customer may seek approval to keep only some of their records in an alternative language. In addition, where approval to keep certain records in an alternative language has been obtained, there is nothing to stop a person continuing to keep all or some of those records in English or te reo Māori. This would extend to having an individual document completed partly in an alternative language and partly in English or te reo Māori. SPS 21/02 | 6 May 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 15 of 17 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] The Commissioner’s Consideration 82. The Commissioner will generally approve applications to keep records in an alternative language where a case can be demonstrated, provided that: • the customer complies with the requirements of ss 24, 24BA and 25 of the GSTA; and • numbers are recorded using Arabic numerals (i.e ., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) in order to accommodate the needs of other parties. 83. In any case, the customer’s records must be sufficient to allow the Commissioner to readily ascertain the customer’s tax liabilities. 84. The approval is not a relaxation in the standard of record keeping as required by the Inland Revenue Acts. Nor does the approval necessarily mean Inland Revenue will communicate with customers in that alternative language. Impact on other parties 85. A recipient of a record that has been completed in an alternative language, such as an invoice or receipt that will be used by that other party to ascertain their tax liability, does not need to also apply for approval to keep records in an alternative language. The balance of commercial convenience between buyers and sellers will determine what language is used in any particular case. Returns not to be completed in alternative language 86. The law is silent on the language to be used in completing any returns that a person may be required to provide to the Commissioner. The Commissioner will accept returns in the prescribed format, completed in either the English or te reo Māori language with numbers entered using Arabic numerals.

UNCLASSIFIED 1 Standard Practice Statement SPS 18/04 Options for relief from tax debt Introduction Standard practice statements describe how the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. This standard practice statement (the “Statement”) sets out the Commissioner’s practice when considering the options for removing or deferring the obligation to pay tax, interest and/or penalties under the Tax Administration Act 1994. The options available to the Commissioner are to write off amounts, enter into an instalment arrangement, remit amounts, or a combination of these options. Unless otherwise specified, all legislative references in this Statement refer to the Tax Administration Act 1994. Application This Statement applies to relief considered on or after 22 August 2018. It replaces 3 standard practice statements: SPS 11/01 – Instalment arrangements for payment of tax, SPS 15/02 – Remission of penalties and use-of-money interest, and SPS 15/03 – Writing off outstanding tax. This Statement does not extend to child support obligations or student loan arrears. For more information on these, see SPS 11/02 Child support debt – Requesting an instalment arrangement and SPS 11/03 Student Loans – Relief from repayment obligations, or any statements issued in replacement. UNCLASSIFIED 2 Terminology In this Statement the following terms are used. Please note their intended meaning for the purposes of this Statement: Relief is to be interpreted in its context. It can refer to all forms of assistance covered by this Statement. It can include entering into instalment arrangements, writing off amounts owing under any ground, and the remission of interest and/or penalties. Financial relief is a subset of “relief” and refers to relief granted as a result of financial hardship (that is, entering into an instalment arrangement, or writing off amounts owing when the test for serious hardship is met). Interest refers to use-of-money interest payable by the taxpayer to the Commissioner under part 7 of the Act. Amounts owing or outstanding amounts refer to any amounts of tax, interest and/or penalties which the taxpayer owes to Inland Revenue.

Taxpayers are required to pay their tax in full and on time. When they fail to do so late payment penalties may be applied and act as an incentive for taxpayers to comply with the law. In addition, interest may be payable to compensate the Commissioner for the loss of use of the money, and to encourage taxpayers to pay the correct amount of tax on time. 2. In certain situations however, the Commissioner may be able to provide assistance to taxpayers if they are not able to pay on time, or if the imposition of penalties and/or interest is not appropriate. Depending on the circumstances the Commissioner may be able to write off or remit amounts owing (so they do not need to be paid), or enter into an instalment arrangement (so the amount is paid over time rather than immediately). This Statement discusses the options that are available. 3. Where there is discretion about whether or not to grant relief, this decision rests with the Commissioner; while a taxpayer can apply for relief it is not available as of right. In addition to granting or denying relief, the Commissioner may choose to not take any immediate action in relation to a debt. This approach of waiting may be appropriate if, for example, the taxpayer’s financial situation is not clear or the Commissioner considers that an unquantifiable amount is expected to be received by the taxpayer in the near future. 4. The options available to the Commissioner are not to be considered in isolation. For any amount of debt, the Commissioner may consider a combination of options. This is the case even if a taxpayer only requests one particular form of relief. 5. The options, and the extent to which those options are available, will depend on the particular circumstances of the taxpayer. The majority of options involve the Commissioner exercising her discretion and various factors will be taken into consideration to reach a decision. These factors are referred to throughout the Statement and are listed at the end. 6. Here is a summary of the relief options available:  Financial relief can be granted when a taxpayer cannot meet their payment obligations. The options available for financial relief are for the Commissioner to collect the amounts owing over a period of time (through an instalment arrangement), or to not collect the amount owing (that is, write off the amount), or a combination of the two options (that is, write off some of the debt and enter into an instalment arrangement for the remainder). An amount may be written off if collecting it would place the taxpayer in “serious hardship”.  Where an amount is considered irrecoverable, the Commissioner has the discretion to write it off.  The Commissioner may write off amounts if collecting the amounts owing is considered to be an inefficient use of Inland Revenue’s resources. UNCLASSIFIED 4  When a taxpayer is made bankrupt, is liquidated or their estate has been distributed, the Commissioner must write off amounts that cannot be recovered. This is not discretionary.  The Commissioner may permanently write off outstanding tax when the balance of the tax payable is $20 or less.  Certain penalties may be remitted when an event or circumstance has occurred which is beyond the taxpayer’s control. The remission may be granted if the event/circumstance provides a reasonable justification that the taxpayer did not meet their obligations (for which they were given the penalty), so long as the taxpayer has corrected the failure to comply as soon as practicable. Common examples of events or circumstances are a death or illness of a family member.  Interest may be remitted when there has been an emergency event declared in an Order in Council which prevented the taxpayer from making the payment. Common examples of emergency events are floods or earthquakes. Before remitting interest under this ground the Commissioner must be satisfied that: - the taxpayer applied for the remission and paid the tax owing as soon as practicable; - the conditions of the Order in Council are met; and - the emergency event means that remitting the interest is fair.  Interest or certain penalties may be remitted if to do so is consistent with the Commissioner’s duty to collect the highest net revenue over time. 7. This Statement applies where amounts of tax, penalty or interest were correctly imposed, but there are reasons for writing off or remitting them, or deferring their payment. Where amounts were incorrectly charged (for example, resulting from an error by Inland Revenue), they will be reversed rather than remitted or written off. Where an amount has been written off, the Commissioner may reverse the write off if the amount was written off on the basis of false or misleading information provided by the taxpayer. 8. For interest, note that section 120W of the Act provides that a taxpayer is not liable to pay interest on unpaid tax to the extent that the interest arises because the taxpayer relied on a “Commissioner’s official opinion” 1 , which includes opinions or official statements of the Commissioner about the taxpayer’s specific situation. Section 120W does not apply to misinterpretations of what is written in an Inland Revenue publication. If section 120W applies, the interest is not written off or remitted, it is simply never imposed. 9. Finally, by way of completeness, in some cases an amount may be written off and the underlying assessment is later amended to reduce the amount of tax payable. In this case an adjustment may be required to the amount written off to ensure that an unintended credit is not created. 1 “Commissioner’s official opinion” is defined in section 3 of the Act. UNCLASSIFIED 5 Detailed discussion Overview of the collection of tax and options for relief 10. The collection of tax is fundamental to the successful operation of the tax system. By ensuring that taxpayers are committed to paying tax on time and in full the integrity of the tax system is protected, and taxpayers understand that they will be treated fairly, consistently, impartially and in accordance with the law. This is recognised in the legislation. Section 15B(c) of the Act specifically provides that a taxpayer is obliged to pay their tax on time. In addition, section 176 of the Act sets out the general obligation that the Commissioner must maximise the recovery of outstanding tax from a taxpayer. Where tax is not paid on time, penalties and/or interest may be payable. 11. There are some situations, however, when a taxpayer has amounts owing and it may be appropriate to provide relief. These are summarised in the table below: Grounds for relief Obligation that can be subject to relief Form of relief Relevant factors (discussed in paragraph 82) Legislative authority (sections of the Act) Financial relief – unable to make immediate payment Tax, interest and/or penalties Instalment arrangement (delayed payment) A – I (all) Sections 177, 177A, 177B Financial relief – serious hardship Tax, interest and/or penalties Write-off (no payment required) A – I (all) Sections 177, 177A, 177C Unrecoverable amount Tax, interest and/or penalties Write-off (no payment required) A – F Section 177C(1) Inefficient use of Commissioner’s resources Tax, interest and/or penalties Write-off (no payment required) A – E, G, H Section 176 Bankruptcy, liquidation or the distribution of an estate Tax, interest and/or penalties Write-off (no payment required) None – no discretion Section 177C(2) and (4) Small amounts of refunds or tax payable Tax, interest and/or penalties Write-off (no payment required) C – E Section 174AA Event/circumstance beyond the taxpayer’s control Penalties Remission (no payment required) C, E - H Section 183A Declared emergency event Interest Remission (no payment required) C, E, F Section 183ABA Promote compliance and collect the highest net revenue Penalties and/or interest Remission (no payment required) C, E – I Section 183D UNCLASSIFIED 6 12. For each of these grounds an explanation of the legislative criteria and when the relief is likely to be granted by the Commissioner are discussed below. The Commissioner has the discretion to grant relief for many of the situations listed above, and the exercise of this discretion will depend on a number of factors discussed in this Statement. 13. The action taken by the Commissioner for an outstanding amount may be a combination of granting one or more forms of relief outlined above, and/or collecting some or all of the amounts owed. In addition, the decision by the Commissioner may be different to the form of relief originally requested by the taxpayer. For example, a taxpayer may apply for an amount of debt to be written off as they claim that paying it will put them in serious hardship. After considering the taxpayer’s circumstances the Commissioner may instead decide to collect a portion of it, enter into an instalment arrangement for a portion, and write off the remainder. 14. If, after considering the taxpayer’s circumstances, the Commissioner concludes that relief under the Act is not appropriate the options available are to collect the amount owing, or if failing to do so, to apply to have the taxpayer made bankrupt (or liquidated if they are a company). 15. The care and management rules in sections 6 and 6A of the Act support this balance of, on the one hand maximising the collection of tax and, on the other hand of relieving taxpayers from their duty to pay in appropriate situations. 2 In particular:  Section 6 requires that the Commissioner’s best endeavours are used to protect the integrity of the tax system. In carrying out this responsibility, the Commissioner is required to consider a range of factors including: - taxpayer perceptions of that integrity; - the rights of taxpayers to have their liability determined fairly, impartially, and according to law; - the responsibilities of taxpayers to comply with the law; and - ensuring the law is administered fairly, impartially, and according to law.  Section 6A(3) provides that it is the duty of the Commissioner to collect the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law, having regard to the resources available to the Commissioner, the importance of promoting compliance (especially voluntary compliance) by all taxpayers with the Inland Revenue Acts, and the compliance costs incurred by taxpayers. This duty requires the Commissioner to collect the highest net revenue over time. This means the Commissioner must consider the short and long-term implications of the various options open to her for the collection of outstanding amounts and debt relief. 2 Interpretation Statement IS 10/07 Care and management of the taxes covered by the Inland Revenue Acts provides the Commissioner’s view on the application of the care and management provisions. This statement is published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 22, No 10 (November 2010): 17 and available on Inland Revenue’s website, www.ird.govt.nz (keyword: Interpretation statement 10/07) UNCLASSIFIED 7 Financial relief: Entering into an instalment arrangement, or writing off amounts for serious hardship General rules 16. When a taxpayer faces financial difficulty in paying their taxes they can request that the Commissioner grant them financial relief. The relief options available under the legislation are to either have the amounts of tax, interest and/or penalties collected at a later point in time (through an instalment arrangement), or for the amounts to not be recovered by the Commissioner (that is, to apply to have the tax written off), or a combination of both options. Section 176 of the Act allows the Commissioner to not recover outstanding amounts to the extent that it would place a natural person taxpayer in serious hardship. 17. When relief is provided by way of a combination of an instalment arrangement and write off, the Commissioner will write off the agreed amount at the beginning of the instalment arrangement. 18. The words “to the extent that” in section 176 are important, and mean that the Commissioner may apportion an amount of debt so that the maximum is collected either immediately or over time and only the amount that cannot be recovered is written off. This approach ensures the Commissioner meets the obligation to maximise the recovery of outstanding tax, and her care and management obligations. 19. When an instalment arrangement is entered into, the period of the arrangement should be as short as possible, but not so short as to put the taxpayer into serious hardship. Instalment arrangements can consist of one payment or multiple payments over a period of time. If there are multiple payments being made, they can consist of equal or varied amounts, and they can be made at regular or irregular intervals. Interest will continue to apply during the term of the arrangement. 20. One of the important factors to consider for granting any form of financial relief is serious hardship. When considering serious hardship the Commissioner must follow a 2-step approach and the steps below clearly dictate that two separate decisions must be made. (The following two steps are adapted from the process set out by the judge in the case of P v Commissioner of Inland Revenue). 3 Step 1 – Is there serious hardship? The first step considers whether recovery of the amount owing would place the taxpayer in serious hardship. The legislation defines what “serious hardship” is. 4 After allowing for payment of outstanding tax, interest and penalties, the question the Commissioner must consider is: Is the taxpayer likely to have significant financial difficulties because one or more of the following factors is likely to arise after the date that the taxpayer requests financial relief? : a) the taxpayer or their dependant has a serious illness; b) the taxpayer would likely be unable to meet minimum living expenses estimated according to normal community standards of cost and quality; c) the taxpayer would likely be unable to meet the cost of medical treatment for an illness or injury of the taxpayer, or of their dependant; 3 P v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2015\] NZHC 2293. 4 Section 177A(2). UNCLASSIFIED 8 d) the taxpayer would likely be unable to meet the cost of education for their dependant; or e) any other factor that the Commissioner thinks relevant would likely arise. If the answer is “yes”, the test for serious hardship is met. Step 2 must be considered to determine whether the Commissioner should write off the outstanding amounts. An instalment arrangement cannot be entered into to the extent that the arrangement would place the taxpayer in serious hardship. If the answer is “no”, the test for serious hardship is not met and the outstanding amounts cannot be written off on the ground of serious hardship. The Commissioner may consider another ground or form of relief from the table in paragraph 11 (including entering into an instalment arrangement), or require that the outstanding amount be paid. Note that in Step 1, the Commissioner must not take into account compliance or non- compliance with tax obligations when determining whether the taxpayer suffers serious hardship. Whether or not the taxpayer has met their tax obligations in the past is irrelevant for Step 1. Serious hardship also does not take into account whether the taxpayer may become bankrupt, nor does it take into account the taxpayer’s ability to maintain entertainment and their social activities. It should also be noted that serious hardship can only apply to natural person taxpayers or shareholders of relief companies. 5 Step 2 – What relief, if any, should be granted? If the Commissioner considers that requiring the taxpayer to pay any or all of the outstanding amounts would place the person in serious hardship, the Commissioner must consider how to best deal with the debt. The options are to write off the outstanding debt (in full or in part), or allow the debt to remain and take steps to bankrupt the taxpayer. At step 2, the Commissioner will have regard to how the debt originally arose, and the person’s compliance with tax obligations as that is clearly material to whether the Commissioner should grant relief. When making this decision at step two the Commissioner will consider all of the factors, as relevant, described in paragraph 82 below. 21. The Commissioner cannot write off amounts owing (including the shortfall penalty imposed) when a taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty for an abusive tax position or evasion or a similar act, in relation to the outstanding tax. 6 In these cases the Commissioner will require payment, or may apply for the taxpayer to be put into bankruptcy or liquidation. 22. The definition of serious hardship refers to “normal community standards of cost and quality”. While these standards must be considered in the context of the wider community of New Zealand, the actual expenditure of taxpayers in different parts of the country may vary. When calculating a taxpayer’s minimum living expenses, the Commissioner will consider the reasonable costs of food, heating and accommodation 5 Section 3(1) defines a "relief company", in relation to a taxpayer, as a company in which: o the taxpayer owns 50% or more of the shares; or o the taxpayer and 1 other person jointly own 50% or more of the shares; or o the taxpayer is a shareholder-employee, and the company has five or fewer natural persons whose total voting or market value interests in the company exceed 50% and it is not a special corporate entity. 6 Section 177C(3). Note that “liable to pay” does not mean the liability must have been assessed, imposed, or otherwise quantified. All that is required is that the criteria in section 141D or section 141E of the Act are met. UNCLASSIFIED 9 in that taxpayer’s area, based on information provided by Statistics New Zealand. However this is just a starting point and the Commissioner will have regard to expenditure incurred that is outside the norm due to a taxpayer’s specific circumstances. 23. The definition of serious hardship also refers to a “dependant”. Whether a person is a taxpayer’s dependant will be determined on a case-by-case basis. The Commissioner will consider whether the person depends on the taxpayer for financial support, what degree of financial support is provided, and to what extent providing financial support affects the taxpayer’s ability to meet minimum living expenses according to normal community standards. 24. When a payment is not made by the date it is due 7 , late payment penalties may be payable and consist of the following components:  an initial late payment penalty (firstly, a 1% penalty is applied the day after the payment was due, and secondly a 4% penalty is applied 7 days after the payment was due); and  an incremental late payment penalty of 1% which is applied every month. 25. In certain situations, some of these penalties may not be imposed. If a taxpayer anticipates they will not be able to make payments on time, they should contact Inland Revenue as soon as possible. If the application for financial relief is made before the due date and relief is granted, fewer penalties may be applied. The table below shows when a penalty will be applied (√), and when a penalty will not be applied (X), and the relevant sections of the Act: 7 A payment is due on either: the due date, or if the amount has a new due date set under section 142A, then the collection date. Section 142A applies where the Commissioner makes a new or amended assessment of tax and requires that the Commissioner fix a new date for the payment of tax. The new date must be at least 30 days after the new assessment or reassessment is issued. 8 As noted above, due date can mean either the date it is due, or if the amount has a new due date set under section 142A, then the collection date. 1% initial late payment penalty; one-off 4% initial late payment penalty; one-off 1% incremental late payment penalty; monthly Taxpayer applies for financial relief before due date 8 , and relief is granted √ (s 139BA(1)) X (s 139BA(1)) X (s 139BA(2)) Taxpayer applies for financial relief on or after due date, and relief is granted √ (s 139B(2)(a)(i)) √ (s 139B(2)(a)(ii)) X (s 139BA(2)) Taxpayer applies for financial relief at any time, and relief is declined √ (s 139BA(6)) √ (s 139BA(6)) √ (s 139BA(6)) Instalment arrangement entered into √ (s 139BA(1)) X If relief was requested before the due date (s 139BA(1)) √ If relief was requested after the due date (s 139B(2)(a)(ii)) X Not applied if the taxpayer complies with the instalment arrangement (s 139BA(4)) UNCLASSIFIED 10 26. When an instalment arrangement is entered into, interest will continue to apply. 27. Before granting an application for financial relief the Commissioner will almost always require that any outstanding returns be filed. In exceptional circumstances, and on a case-by-case basis, the Commissioner will consider requests for financial relief where returns have not been filed. However, the reason for not filing the return (factors G, H and I at paragraph 82) must be taken into consideration when determining whether or not to grant relief. 28. The Commissioner may cancel an instalment arrangement if the taxpayer has provided false or misleading information, or if the taxpayer is not meeting their obligations under the instalment arrangement. When an instalment arrangement is cancelled because the taxpayer provided false or misleading information, monthly incremental penalties will be imposed retrospectively as if the instalment arrangement had not been entered into. Process to be followed for financial relief 29. When a taxpayer feels they are in financial difficulty they can apply for financial relief. This application can be made before or after the due date for payment. It may be beneficial to apply before a due date as that may stop some penalties from applying (discussed in paragraph 25 above). If the taxpayer is applying to have tax written off, they must provide evidence to show why payment of the amount owed would place them in serious hardship (refer to paragraph 20). 30. The request for financial relief can be made verbally (by telephone or face–to–face with an Inland Revenue officer) or in writing. However, in some cases, the Commissioner may require that the application be made in writing. This may be where a taxpayer’s inability to pay the outstanding tax is caused by a number of factors that require evidence in writing or when a taxpayer has related parties, such as a partnership or company, that have outstanding tax to pay. Where a taxpayer is required to put their application in writing, they may do so by post, through Inland Revenue’s myIR Secure Online Services, email, fax, or delivering written notice in person to an Inland Revenue office. 31. For instalment arrangement requests in respect of outstanding GST, taxpayers can use myIR to directly request an instalment arrangement through the “GST” tab. This method of applying enables them to:  instantly review the forecasted instalment amounts including a breakdown of interest and penalties; and  receive an automatic notification of whether the instalment arrangement is accepted, or has been sent to be reviewed. These instalment arrangements need to be a minimum of $50/week, $100/fortnight or $200/month, and the debt must be cleared within 3 years. Taxpayers who do not meet this criteria can request an instalment arrangement by the methods in paragraph 30 above. 32. Written applications for write-off will not be required when it is evident from information already available to the Commissioner that recovery would place a taxpayer in serious hardship. This may happen where a taxpayer requests relief by UNCLASSIFIED 11 way of an instalment arrangement, but the information provided shows that repayment, even by way of an instalment arrangement, would place them in serious hardship. Where this is the case the Commissioner will contact the taxpayer and discuss their situation. 33. After receiving a request for financial relief the Commissioner will consider the taxpayer’s financial position as at the date on which the request is made (unless the Commissioner seeks further information or makes a counter offer, as discussed in the following paragraph, and receives a response after 20 working days). The Commissioner will review the information provided as part of the application, and may also consider other information that the Department holds. All of the factors A – I in paragraph 82 are potentially relevant and will be considered by the Commissioner when deciding whether recovery of the outstanding amounts would place the taxpayer into serious hardship. As explained in the 2 step test above, an instalment arrangement can only be entered into so long as doing so does not place the taxpayer in serious hardship. If recovery of the amount owing would lead to serious hardship the Commissioner will follow the 2 step test (refer to paragraph 20) to decide whether to write off the amounts owing. 34. When considering an application for financial relief, the Commissioner may take 1 of 4 actions: 9  Accept the request If the request is accepted, the taxpayer will be advised in writing of: - the tax type(s), the relevant period(s) and any amounts of tax written off; - details of any instalment arrangement including the repayment amounts and frequency of payments; - any remaining net losses and/or excess imputation credits carried forward (see discussion at paragraph 43); and - the amount of any penalties or interest.  Seek further information from the taxpayer To help the Commissioner make a decision on granting relief, a taxpayer may be asked to provide additional information including relevant financial information. If further information is requested, the taxpayer must provide that information within 20 working days (or within any longer period allowed by the Commissioner). Information received outside that timeframe will be treated as a new request for financial relief. Depending on when the original request was made and when the further information is provided this could mean additional late payment penalties are applied (see paragraph 24 above).  Make a counter-offer The Commissioner may make a counter-offer. This may occur where, for instance, it is considered that the taxpayer can afford to make a lump-sum payment, or an arrangement involving a lump sum payment, a partial write-off and a partial instalment arrangement may be more appropriate. If a counter offer is made, the taxpayer must respond to that offer within 20 working days (or within any longer period allowed by the Commissioner). A response received outside that timeframe will be treated as a new request for financial relief. 9 Section 177(3) of the Act. UNCLASSIFIED 12  Decline the taxpayer’s request The Commissioner may decline the taxpayer’s request for various reasons, including where the Commissioner considers that: - the taxpayer is able to pay the outstanding tax immediately; - the taxpayer has not provided sufficient information to support their request; - agreeing to the taxpayer’s request would not maximise the recovery of outstanding tax from the taxpayer; - the request is frivolous or the taxpayer is vexatious; - for instalment arrangement requests - the taxpayer has not met their obligations under a previous instalment arrangement; - for instalment arrangement requests - the arrangement being proposed bears little relation to the debt owed. 10 The taxpayer will be informed of this decision to decline the request. 35. A taxpayer who has entered into an instalment arrangement may at any point in time ask that the arrangement be renegotiated. The Commissioner may only renegotiate instalment arrangements after two years from when the arrangement was entered into. For example, it may be appropriate to renegotiate an arrangement when the taxpayer incurs new debt that they are unable to meet. Any renegotiation will be treated as if it were a new request for financial relief. 11 36. While there is no legislative time limit for the term of an instalment arrangement, Inland Revenue’s practice is that instalment arrangements are made for as short a period as possible - generally no more than 2-3 years. 37. Through the term of the instalment arrangement a taxpayer is expected to meet their current tax obligations or make a new application for financial relief if unable to meet those obligations. Reversal of a write-off 38. The Commissioner may reverse a write off if the tax was originally written off on the basis of false or misleading information provided by the taxpayer. 12 39. In addition, the Commissioner will reverse a write-off made on the grounds of serious hardship if the taxpayer declares bankruptcy, or is subject to bankruptcy proceedings within a year of the tax being written off. Or, in the case of a relief company, if they are liquidated or are in the course being liquidated within a year of the write-off. 40. If the Commissioner partially writes off some debt and enters into an instalment arrangement for the remainder, the Commissioner cannot reverse the write-off even if, during the term of the instalment arrangement, the taxpayer does not meet the instalment arrangement’s terms. 13 10 While the Commissioner’s duty to collect highest net revenue is paramount, this is to be balanced against the care and management obligations. As was held in the case of Russell v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2015\] NZHC 754, to preserve the integrity of the tax system, the Commissioner may refuse to enter into an instalment arrangement with a taxpayer where the arrangement proposed bears little relation to the real debt. 11 Section 177B(3),(4),(5). 12 Section 177C(7). 13 Section 177C(8). UNCLASSIFIED 13 Other matters Writing off a trust’s outstanding tax 41. Trustees of a trust are personally liable for debts of the trust (including tax debts). If there is insufficient trust property to pay a trust debt, a trustee may have to pay the debt out of their own resources. When there is more than one trustee, those trustees are jointly and severally liable for the trust’s tax obligations. 42. Trustees, in their capacity as natural persons, may experience serious hardship as a result of having to meet a trust’s tax debt from their personal resources. The Commissioner will consider serious hardship applications from natural person trustees on a case-by-case basis and may write off tax on grounds of serious hardship when no other avenue is available for collection. Tax losses and excess imputation credits 43. When the Commissioner writes off outstanding tax for a taxpayer (other than a partnership which is discussed in the following paragraph) who has tax losses or imputation credits carried forward from a previous year, consequential adjustments are required to those losses and imputation credits.  If the Commissioner writes off outstanding tax for a taxpayer who has net losses, part or all of the taxpayer’s tax losses will also be extinguished. The amount extinguished is calculated by dividing the amount written off by: - 0.33 (if the taxpayer is not a company); or - 0.28 (if the taxpayer is a company) and reducing the tax losses by that amount. 14 This reduces any losses that can be carried forward.  If the Commissioner writes off outstanding tax for a taxpayer who has imputation credits carried forward from a previous year, all or part of these credits will be extinguished on a dollar-for-dollar basis. 15  When a taxpayer has both tax losses and imputation credits carried forward from a previous year, the net losses will be extinguished first. 16 A taxpayer’s tax losses and/or imputation credits can be extinguished even if the tax written off is not income tax. 44. When the Commissioner writes off outstanding tax for a partnership who has tax losses, the way losses are extinguished depends on the particular tax type making up the debt and the type of partnership:  General partnership; Income tax: For income tax, the partnership is treated as transparent, so income is returned and any losses are carried forward by the individual partners. The Commissioner may grant relief to an individual partner by way of a write-off of their income tax debt. If that individual partner has losses, some or all of the losses will be extinguished. The amount extinguished is calculated by dividing the amount written off by 0.33. The tax position of other partners is irrelevant. 14 Section 177C(5). 15 Section 177C(5B). 16 Section 177C(5C). UNCLASSIFIED 14  General partnership; GST: For GST, the partnership itself is registered for GST, and any debt is payable by the partnership. However, the individual partners are also jointly and severally liable for any GST debt. Therefore, if a partnership cannot meet its GST liability, the debt is payable by the individual partners. If payment of the debt would place one partner in serious hardship, but not the other partners, then those other partners are liable to meet the debt. When the Commissioner decides to write off the GST debt of the partnership any losses of the individual partners will be extinguished. The partners must collectively have their losses extinguished by dividing the amount written off by 0.33. Where only some partners have losses available to extinguish, or where the losses for each individual partner is different, this will require apportionment of the total extinguished losses between the individual partners. This should be done in a way that is fair and reasonable. In the first instance this will mean extinguishing individual losses equally but where a partner has insufficient losses, the losses of other partners will be extinguished up to the maximum. 17  General partnership; PAYE, RWT, NRWT, other tax types: Losses will be extinguished depending on the liability of the partners. Where the legal liability to pay the outstanding tax is with the partnership (ie. the partners have no personal liability to pay the tax), none of the partners' losses can be extinguished. Where the partners are each liable for their proportionate share of the outstanding tax, each partner can have losses extinguished proportional to the amount of outstanding tax that they were liable for. Where the partners are jointly and severally liable for an amount of outstanding tax, each partner can have losses extinguished up to the total amount of tax written off (provided that the total amount extinguished from all partners does not exceed the total amount of tax written off). Note that PAYE debt is owed by the individual partners on a joint and several basis.  Limited partnerships: Limited partnerships comprise of general partners (responsible for the management of the partnership) and limited partners. General partners are liable for the partnership debt and the principles applied for the extinguishment of losses are the same as described in the bullet points above. Limited partners who take part in the management of the limited partnership are liable, to the same extent as a general partner, if, at the time that the debt was incurred: - the limited partner took part in the management of the limited partnership; and - Inland Revenue was aware the limited partner took part in the management of the limited partnership; and - Inland Revenue believed on reasonable grounds that the limited partner was a general partner. A limited partner who does not take part in the management of the partnership is not liable for the partnership debt. 45. The Commissioner needs to know the correct value of losses or imputation credits when making the adjustments required after writing off outstanding tax. So a taxpayer 17 The maximum is the amount set out in section 177C(5) of the Act, calculated for partnerships as the total amount written off divided by 0.33. UNCLASSIFIED 15 will almost always be required to file all outstanding tax returns before their application for a write-off will be considered. Irrecoverable amount 46. In addition to the grounds discussed above, the Commissioner may also write off outstanding tax, interest and/or penalties that cannot be recovered. 47. This ground may apply in combination with another ground (for instance, an amount may be irrecoverable because the taxpayer is in serious hardship, or an amount is irrecoverable because the administrative resource needed to recover it is considered high and so would be an inefficient use of those resources). However, it may also apply in isolation. Whether an amount is considered to be irrecoverable is to be determined on a case-by-case basis. Factors A - G in paragraph 82 will be relevant in deciding whether to write off the amount owing. Voluntary administration 48. During the voluntary administration process as provided in the Companies Act 1993 the Commissioner may enter into a deed of company arrangement and as a result the Commissioner may receive some payments from the taxpayer. Amounts that are irrecoverable will not be written off under the Tax Administration Act until the company has been released from debts as a result of the process followed under the Companies Act. No asset procedure 49. The “no asset procedure” is a one-off process that provides a fresh start to natural persons. It is administered by the New Zealand Insolvency and Trustee Service and is available as an alternative to bankruptcy for those people who have insufficient income and no assets left to sell to repay debts from $1,000 up to $47,000. 50. Unless the Commissioner has cause to ask the Official Assignee to reject or overturn the no asset procedure, any tax owed by a taxpayer who is subject to the procedure is effectively frozen and the Commissioner cannot take any recovery action. 51. Once a taxpayer has been released from debts covered by a no asset procedure, the Commissioner will then write off the balance of the outstanding tax on the basis that it is irrecoverable. Inefficient use of resources 52. The Commissioner has limited resources to undertake what can sometimes be a lengthy process to collect outstanding amounts. Consistent with the obligations under sections 6(1) and 6A(3), she will not recover outstanding amounts if the recovery of that outstanding tax, interest or penalties would be an inefficient use of her limited administrative resources. 18 If the Commissioner makes a decision under this ground, the tax will be written off. 53. However, a taxpayer cannot request that outstanding amounts be written off simply because they consider that collection would be an inefficient use of the Commissioner’s resources. It is for the Commissioner to determine how Inland Revenue’s resources are allocated. These decisions will be made by Inland Revenue staff with the authorised level of authority. The seniority of position that is required to write off 18 Section 176(2)(a). UNCLASSIFIED 16 amounts under this ground is an internal process and will depend on the amount being written off. 54. When making a decision whether to write off outstanding amounts under this ground, the Commissioner must take into account factors A – E, H and I in paragraph 82. 55. In considering this ground for writing off tax there will be some instances where the Commissioner will pursue amounts owing even though the cost of collection may be higher than the outstanding tax. In these cases recovery action may still be considered appropriate if it is consistent with the Commissioner’s obligations under sections 6 and 6A, including protecting the integrity of the tax system, promoting compliance and collecting over time the highest net revenue. 19 Bankruptcy, liquidation or the distribution of an estate 56. The Commissioner must write off amounts that cannot be recovered because of bankruptcy or liquidation. 20 When a taxpayer is adjudicated bankrupt they will be issued with a new IRD number. The Commissioner will write off outstanding tax 21 under the bankrupt’s previous IRD number upon receiving advice from the Official Assignee that a dividend is unlikely or a final report or notice that the taxpayer is discharged from bankruptcy. 57. Similarly, when a company is liquidated the Commissioner will write off outstanding tax that cannot be recovered upon receiving a final report or advice from the liquidator that there will be no dividend to Inland Revenue. 58. When an estate has been distributed, the Commissioner must write off any outstanding tax that cannot be recovered upon receiving confirmation from the administrator that the estate has been properly distributed. 22 59. The Commissioner may only reinstate tax that has been written off if:  by operation of law, additional funds are received in respect of a taxpayer after that taxpayer has become bankrupt or has been liquidated; or  additional funds due to a taxpayer’s estate are discovered after that taxpayer’s estate has been distributed. 23 60. This is the case notwithstanding section 177C(3) (discussed above at paragraph 20). Where a taxpayer had been liable to pay a shortfall penalty for evasion or an abusive tax position and the taxpayer is now liquidated or bankrupt, despite section 177C(3), the amount owing will be written off under section 177C(2). 61. If an instalment arrangement has been entered into and the taxpayer then becomes bankrupt or liquidated, the outstanding amount under the instalment arrangement must be included in Inland Revenue’s proof of debt to the Official Assignee. 24 19 Russell v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2015\] NZHC 754. 20 Section 177C(2). 21 With the exception of child support amounts owing. 22 Section 177C(2). 23 Section 177C(4). 24 Section 177CA. UNCLASSIFIED 17 Small amounts of refunds or tax payable 62. The Commissioner may permanently write off outstanding tax when the balance of the tax payable is $20 or less. 25 63. If it is established later that a taxpayer’s assessment or interest calculation was wrong, the Commissioner must amend the taxpayer’s account to show the correct tax payable. Any earlier write-off made may also be adjusted to the correct amount of tax payable. 64. Factors C - F in paragraph 82 will be relevant in deciding whether to write off the amount owing. Remission 65. The purposes of the penalty provisions in the Act are: 26  to encourage taxpayers to comply voluntarily with their tax obligations and to co- operate with the department; and  to ensure that penalties for breaches of tax obligations are imposed impartially and consistently; and  to sanction non-compliance with tax obligations effectively and at a level that is proportionate to the seriousness of the breach. And the purposes of charging taxpayers interest are to: 27  compensate the Commissioner for the loss of use of money; and  to encourage taxpayers to pay the correct amount of tax on time. 66. However, Inland Revenue recognises that charging interest or penalising a taxpayer for an unintended non-compliant action may be counterproductive and may actually reduce voluntary compliance. So in certain situations the Commissioner may remit interest and/or penalties. 67. It is important to treat taxpayers requesting a remission of penalties and interest fairly and consistently when compared to those in a similar tax position. For example, while allowing a penalty to remain could affect that taxpayer’s future compliance, a lenient remission practice may also mean that compliant taxpayers, who have met their obligations on time, may be less likely to do so in the future. 68. The following sections discuss three circumstances where penalties and/or interest may be remitted. Event/circumstance beyond the taxpayer’s control 69. Where a taxpayer has not complied with a tax obligation and as a result has been charged a penalty, the Commissioner may, in certain cases, remit that penalty. Section 183A allows the Commissioner to remit these penalties for “reasonable causes” explained in paragraph 71 below. 25 Section 174AA. 26 Section 139. 27 Section 120A. UNCLASSIFIED 18 70. A taxpayer can request, under this section, for the following penalties to be remitted:  a late filing penalty;  a non-electronic filing penalty;  initial and incremental late payment penalties;  imputation penalty tax;  Māori authority distribution penalty tax;  a shortfall penalty imposed by section 141AA for failing to make a deduction from a payment to a non-resident contractor;  a civil penalty imposed by section 215 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 for employers who fail to provide information; or  a penalty for not paying an employer monthly schedule amount imposed by section 141ED. (Section 183A does not apply to interest. Nor does it apply to shortfall penalties, other than those imposed by sections 141AA and 141ED). 71. Before the Commissioner can remit a penalty under this section, she must be satisfied of 3 factors:  The penalty arose as the result of an event or a circumstance beyond the taxpayer’s control The Act provides that an “event or circumstance” may include an accident, disaster, illness, or emotional or mental distress. However, the Commissioner also has the discretion to consider other circumstances that are not specifically included in the legislation. An “event or circumstance” does not include a taxpayer’s financial position. Requests for financial relief are dealt with under sections 176 and 177. See paragraphs 16 - 37 for more information. Penalties cannot be remitted under this ground if they arose as a result of an event or circumstance that is caused by an act or omission by an agent of the taxpayer. However, remission can be considered if the act or omission was caused by an event or circumstance that was beyond the control of the agent, could not have been anticipated, and the effect could not reasonably have been avoided. The term “agent” is not defined in the Act. For practical purposes, the Commissioner considers an agent is someone who has been given due authority by the taxpayer to act on their behalf in relation to their general, or specific, tax matters. It could include tax agents, intermediaries or other nominated persons. The Commissioner will also consider whether the agent’s default could have been avoided by compliance with accepted standards of business organisation and professional conduct.  There is reasonable justification for the breach of the relevant tax laws The Commissioner will look at the reason that the taxpayer did not meet their obligations. Whether there is a reasonable justification will be determined objectively. Before an event or circumstance can be considered to provide a taxpayer with reasonable justification for failing to meet their obligations: - the event or circumstance relied on by the taxpayer must be identified; UNCLASSIFIED 19 - it must be determined whether the event or circumstance was beyond the control of the taxpayer; and - consideration must be given to whether the event or circumstance provided the taxpayer with reasonable justification.  The taxpayer corrected the failure to comply as soon as practicable The taxpayer must have filed the relevant return and paid any outstanding core tax as soon as it was feasible or realistic after the event or circumstance that caused the breach. 72. In deciding whether remission is appropriate, the Commissioner will consider the factors above along with any other information that the Commissioner considers relevant in assessing the application. The Commissioner may request supporting information if necessary. Declared emergency event 73. Section 183ABA allows the Commissioner to remit interest charged when an emergency event physically prevents a taxpayer from making a tax payment. 74. Before the Commissioner can remit interest under this section, she must be satisfied of the following requirements:  An emergency event has occurred Section 183ABA applies only in the circumstances of an emergency event. An emergency event is an event that meets the definition of “emergency” in section 4 of the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002 and is declared to be an emergency event by Order in Council for the purposes of section 183ABA. 28 An emergency event can be natural or otherwise and can include an earthquake, tsunami, technological failure, riot or a warlike act.  The emergency event physically prevented a taxpayer from making a tax payment Taxpayers had been unable to comply with their tax obligations due to the emergency event significantly affecting them in the following ways: - they were unable to access their records, for example, through evacuation or destruction of a home or business; or - they were unable to make payments because they were physically prevented from doing so, for example, extensive infrastructure damage that prevented any local movements, disruption of postal deliveries or damage to phone lines.  The taxpayer made the payment of tax and applied for remission of interest as soon as practicable A taxpayer who is seeking remission must have paid the tax and applied for the remission as soon as practicable (that is, as soon as it is feasible or realistic) after the event. This will depend on the circumstances of each case.  The taxpayer is a member of the specified class of persons The Order in Council that declares the emergency event will have set out a class of people to whom remission is available. 28 Orders in Council are legislative instruments and can be found on the Inland Revenue website (www.ird.govt.nz) or the Parliamentary Counsel Office website (www.legislation.govt.nz). UNCLASSIFIED 20  The Order in Council is valid; it has not expired or been revoked Amounts may be remitted up until the expiry date set out in the Order in Council.  The Commissioner is satisfied that the effect on the taxpayer of the occurrence of the emergency event makes the remission equitable Relief may be granted under section 183ABA if the effect of the emergency event on the taxpayer’s personal situation means that it is fair that the interest be remitted. 75. The taxpayer must also provide supporting information if requested by the Commissioner. Remission consistent with collection of the highest net revenue over time 76. Section 183D allows the Commissioner to remit interest and/or penalties if it is consistent with the Commissioner’s duty to collect the highest net revenue over time. 77. Under this provision the Commissioner may remit:  a late filing penalty;  a non-electronic filing penalty;  initial and incremental late payment penalties;  a shortfall penalty imposed by section 141AA for failing to make a deduction from a payment to a non-resident contractor;  a civil penalty imposed by section 215 of the Kiwisaver Act 2006 for employers who fail to provide information;  a penalty for not paying an employer monthly schedule amount imposed by section 141ED; and/or  interest under part 7. (Section 183D does not apply to shortfall penalties other than those imposed by sections 141AA and 141ED) 78. Before the Commissioner can remit a penalty or interest under this section, she must consider:  Whether remitting the interest and/or penalties is consistent with the Commissioner’s duty to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law The Commissioner must consider whether, and the extent to which, remitting penalties and/or interest can promote compliance, especially voluntary compliance, and thereby result in a higher collection of revenue over time.  How the imposition of penalties and interest is used in promoting compliance, especially voluntary compliance As noted in paragraph 65 above, encouraging voluntary compliance is one of the key purposes of the penalty rules. The Commissioner recognises that pursuing the collection of penalties in some circumstances will not be consistent with those aims, for example, when a penalty may have been imposed due to: - a genuine error; or - a one-off situation. Each application for remission will be considered on the merits of the case. Interest will only be remitted in limited circumstances. The test of whether or not interest should be remitted focuses on whether charging the particular taxpayer UNCLASSIFIED 21 interest is inconsistent with promoting compliance of all taxpayers. In making this decision, the Commissioner will be mindful of the purpose of charging interest. That is, to compensate the Commissioner for the loss of use of the money and also to encourage taxpayers to pay the correct amount of tax on time. 79. When considering remission under section 183D, the taxpayer's financial situation cannot be taken into account. 29 This means the taxpayer’s ability (or inability) to pay the tax owing is not a factor when deciding whether to grant remission. 80. In deciding whether remission is appropriate, the Commissioner will consider the following factors:  Why did the taxpayer pay or file late, or not file electronically?  Whether the non-compliant action was the result of a genuine oversight or a one-off situation: - Requests for remission because of a genuine oversight or a one-off situation apply to penalties only. Inland Revenue will not remit interest in these cases as it is compensation to the Commissioner for the loss of the use of the money over time. - If interest is charged because of an error or default by a third party, the Commissioner considers the taxpayer should look to that third party for compensation.  Was there an error in an Inland Revenue publication that has resulted in the taxpayer incurring the penalty or interest? If the taxpayer relies on incorrect information contained in an Inland Revenue publication, it may be unreasonable for the Commissioner to impose a penalty or charge interest.  Any other information that Inland Revenue considers relevant in assessing the application. In particular, how will the remission contribute to the collection of the highest net revenue over time and otherwise promote voluntary compliance by all taxpayers? 81. The Commissioner may request supporting information if necessary. Factors for the Commissioner to consider 82. In deciding whether to grant relief, the Commissioner will consider whether the legislative criteria for each form of relief are met, as covered in the earlier sections of this Statement. Of particular importance is the obligation on the Commissioner to maximise the recovery of outstanding amounts. 30 In addition, the Commissioner may take into account other, more general, factors. These are explained below. They are not listed in order of importance and the factors that apply and the weighting that they are given will depend on the particular case. The table at paragraph 11 summarises which factors are relevant for the various grounds for relief. 29 Section 183D(3) of the Act. 30 Section 176 of the Act. UNCLASSIFIED 22 A. Taxpayer’s financial position The Commissioner may consider the taxpayer’s ability to pay the outstanding amount, either immediately or in the future. This may, depending on the circumstances, include consideration of:  income and expenses (including income and expenditure for relationship property, family and spousal income where appropriate);  assets and liabilities including asset valuations;  a 12-month projection of cash-flow (including whether they are due to receive any sums of money in the near future (for instance, from the sale of a property, or from an inheritance));  a statement of financial performance (a profit and loss statement);  a statement of financial position (a balance sheet);  a list of debtors and creditors, including how much is owed to or by the taxpayer; and  any vested interest held in another entity (such as a trust). A comparison of the taxpayer’s financial position will be made to Statistics New Zealand’s Household expenditure survey which sets out average expenses. This comparison is simply a starting point, and the Commissioner will consider other expenditure that is incurred due to the taxpayer’s personal circumstances. The taxpayer’s financial position cannot be taken into account when considering whether to grant relief under sections 183A or 183D. B. Options available to the Commissioner The Commissioner has a duty to maximise the recovery of outstanding tax from a taxpayer and so is obliged to compare the value of the likely recovery from accepting a taxpayer’s proposal to other viable options for recovery. The options available are:  collection of the amount owing in full;  entering into an instalment arrangement;  writing off amounts;  remitting amounts;  applying to have the taxpayer made bankrupt or liquidated. These options are administered by the Insolvency and Trustee service, and may result in some payment being made to Inland Revenue. In some cases, it is clear which option will maximise recovery. In other cases, there may be options that could yield similar returns. Accordingly, it is necessary to determine which option, or combination of options, will maximise recovery. C. Integrity of the tax system One of the core obligations imposed under the Act requires Inland Revenue officers to use their best endeavours to protect the integrity of the tax system. 31 The “integrity of the tax system” is defined in section 6 of the Act. Three points of particular relevance are discussed below: 31 Section 6 of the Act. UNCLASSIFIED 23  Taxpayers’ perception of integrity – the Commissioner must ensure that granting relief to some taxpayers is not viewed as unjust by others in the taxpaying community. This requires the Commissioner to act legally and to provide consistent treatment. The Commissioner will be mindful of the taxpayer's expenditure, in particular spending on unnecessary goods or services. Taxpayers requesting that relief be granted should not be allowed to maintain lifestyles with high amounts of discretionary spending when either the spending is unnecessary or there are reasonable alternatives available involving lower expenditure. For example, it is unlikely that the Commissioner would agree to writing off outstanding tax while the taxpayer continues to pay private school fees.  The responsibilities of taxpayers to comply with the law – Where there has been a deliberate failure by a taxpayer to comply with their tax obligations and where recovery is uncertain or is likely to result only in a relatively minor proportion of the overall outstanding tax being recovered, the Commissioner may initiate enforcement proceedings to secure the wider interests identified by the legislation.  The responsibilities of those administering the law to do so fairly, impartially, and according to law – Tax obligations are imposed under the law and are intended to apply to all relevant taxpayers. Taxpayers should be treated consistently. Where a taxpayer’s offer for payment of all or part of the outstanding amounts (such as an instalment arrangement) would yield more than bankruptcy or liquidation action, the Commissioner is likely to consider this favourably. However, before making a decision to accept the offer, the Commissioner will weigh this up against the other factors. Any amount not recoverable under the agreement will be written off at the time the agreement is entered into. D. Resources available to the Commissioner When making any decision the Commissioner must consider the resources required to carry out that action and the resources that are available. The Commissioner must then make a decision of whether the use of resources is justified and in making this decision the relative importance of other factors will be considered. E. Importance of promoting compliance This factor is one of the Commissioner’s care and management considerations, and comprises a range of considerations. Voluntary compliance underpins tax administration. F. Taxpayer’s reasons for failure to pay The Commissioner will consider the circumstances leading to the taxpayer having outstanding amounts, the causes of those circumstances and to what extent the taxpayer contributed to, or failed to mitigate, those circumstances. G. Taxpayer’s compliance history The Commissioner will consider a taxpayer’s whole history of compliance. In particular, the Commissioner will consider the taxpayer’s history with regards to filing tax returns and payments of tax. The outcomes of previous relief granted UNCLASSIFIED 24 (such as whether the taxpayer met their obligations under previous instalment arrangements, or whether the taxpayer changed their actions to prevent recurrent financial hardship) will also be considered. H. The taxpayer’s co-operation The Commissioner will consider the nature and extent of the taxpayer’s co-operation and negotiating stance; and the speed with which the taxpayer provided requested information as well as the quality of that information. Taxpayers who are co-operative and forthcoming with information save Inland Revenue time and resource in verifying information, allow constructive discussions to take place, and allow the tax system to be administered more efficiently. In comparison, taxpayers who are frivolous and/or vexatious result in Inland Revenue investing more resource than is reasonable. I. Steps taken to avoid similar situation in future The Commissioner will consider whether any steps have been, or will be, taken by the taxpayer to prevent the situation from recurring in the future. This may involve improved budgeting, selling assets, adjusting lifestyle factors, or any other relevant steps taken. Reviewing a decision of the Commissioner Section 138E(1)(e)(iv) provides that there is no statutory right of challenge where the Commissioner has made a decision to grant relief, decline to grant relief, or to cancel relief under sections 176, 177, 177A, 177B, 177C, 183A and 183D. However, if a taxpayer is concerned that their circumstances have not been given proper consideration they should raise their concern with the Inland Revenue officer they have been dealing with and ask for the decision to be reconsidered. If a taxpayer is still not satisfied, they also have the option to have a decision reviewed by the Office of the Ombudsman or a judicial review. It is strongly recommended that independent legal advice be obtained. If a taxpayer is not satisfied with the level of service they have received from Inland Revenue, they can find more information about the Inland Revenue Complaints Management Service at http://www.ird.govt.nz/how-to/complaints-and-disputes/complaints- process/ or phone 0800 274 138 (Monday to Friday between 8am and 5pm). This Standard Practice Statement is signed on 22 August 2018. Rob Wells Manager – Technical Standards UNCLASSIFIED 25 APPENDIX: Relevant provisions of legislation TAX ADMINISTRATION ACT 1994 The following sections of the Tax Administration Act 1994 are particularly relevant to the relief provisions. For the most recent version of the Act, and any other provisions, see www.legislation.govt.nz Section 176 Recovery of tax by Commissioner (1) The Commissioner must maximise the recovery of outstanding tax from a taxpayer. (2) Despite subsection (1), the Commissioner may not recover outstanding tax to the extent that— (a) recovery is an inefficient use of the Commissioner’s resources; or (b) recovery would place a taxpayer, being a natural person, in serious hardship. (3) Despite subsection (2)(b), the Commissioner may take steps preparatory to, or necessary to, bankrupt the taxpayer, including debt proceedings in the District Court or the High Court. Section 177 Taxpayer may request financial relief (1) A taxpayer, or a person on a taxpayer’s behalf, requests financial relief by either— (a) making a claim stating why recovery of the taxpayer’s outstanding tax or a relief company’s outstanding tax would place the taxpayer, being a natural person, in serious hardship; or (b) requesting to enter into an instalment arrangement with the Commissioner. (1B) For the purposes of this section, the Commissioner must consider the taxpayer’s financial position at the date on which the request for financial relief is made. (2) The Commissioner may require a taxpayer, or a person on a taxpayer’s behalf, to request financial relief under subsection (1)(a) by notice. (3) Upon receiving a request, the Commissioner may— (a) accept the taxpayer’s request; or (b) seek further information from the taxpayer; or (c) make a counter offer; or (d) decline the taxpayer’s request. (4) A taxpayer has 20 working days, or a longer period allowed by the Commissioner, to provide the information sought or to respond to a counter offer. (5) If the Commissioner receives information or a response from a taxpayer outside the time period allowed under subsect UNCLASSIFIED 26 Section 177A How to apply serious hardship provisions (1) Subsections (2), (3) and (4) provide the rules for the Commissioner to decide (the decision) whether, - (a) for the purposes of section 176, recovery of outstanding tax would place a taxpayer, being a natural person, in serious hardship: (b) for the purposes of section 177, the Commissioner may accept the taxpayer’s request for financial relief on the basis of a claim that recovery of the taxpayer’s outstanding tax or a relief company’s outstanding tax would place the taxpayer, being a natural person, in serious hardship: (c) for the purposes of section 177B, an instalment arrangement entered into by a taxpayer or a relief company would place the taxpayer, being a natural person, in serious hardship: (d) for the purposes of section 177C, recovery of the outstanding tax would place the taxpayer, being a natural person, in serious hardship. (2) The Commissioner makes a decision under this section by determining whether financial information, after allowing for payment of a relevant amount of outstanding tax, and subject to subsections (3) and (4), shows that the taxpayer would, after the request under section 177 (the request), likely have significant financial difficulties because, after the request,— (a) the taxpayer or their dependant has a serious illness: (b) the taxpayer would likely be unable to meet— (i) minimum living expenses estimated according to normal community standards of cost and quality: (ii) the cost of medical treatment for an illness or injury of the taxpayer, or of their dependant: (iii) the cost of education for their dependant: (c) other factors that the Commissioner thinks relevant would likely arise. (3) Compliance with, and non-compliance with, tax obligations must not be considered by the Commissioner when making a decision under this section. (4) The Commissioner must use only financial information that the Commissioner has at the date on which the decision is made. Section 177B Instalment arrangements (1) The Commissioner must not enter into an instalment arrangement with a taxpayer or a relief company to the extent that the arrangement would place the taxpayer, being a natural person, in serious hardship. (2) The Commissioner may decline to enter into an instalment arrangement if— (a) to do so would not maximise the recovery of outstanding tax from the taxpayer; or (b) the Commissioner considers that the taxpayer is in a position to pay all of the outstanding tax immediately; or (c) the taxpayer is being frivolous or vexatious; or (d) the taxpayer has not met their obligations under a previous instalment arrangement. (3) A taxpayer may renegotiate an instalment arrangement at any time. (4) The Commissioner may renegotiate an instalment arrangement at any time after the end of 2 years from the date on which the instalment arrangement was entered. UNCLASSIFIED 27 (5) The renegotiation of an instalment arrangement is treated as if it were a new request for financial relief. (6) The Commissioner may cancel an instalment arrangement if— (a) it was entered into on the basis of false or misleading information provided by the taxpayer; or (b) the taxpayer is not meeting their obligations under the arrangement. (7) Despite sections LA 6(2) and LH 2(6) of the Income Tax Act 2007, a taxpayer with an instalment arrangement who is meeting their obligations under it may choose to have an amount of refundable tax credit remaining for a tax year paid to them rather than used under the ordering rules set out in those sections. Section 177C Write-off of tax by Commissioner (1) The Commissioner may write off outstanding tax that cannot be recovered. (1BA) The Commissioner may use, as a ground for deciding whether or not to write off the outstanding tax of a taxpayer or of a relief company, the basis that recovery of the outstanding tax would place the taxpayer, being a natural person, in serious hardship. The Commissioner is not required to write off the outstanding tax if the ground exists. (1B) The Commissioner may write off an amount of outstanding tax to the extent to which the amount— (a) is outstanding from the 2008–09 tax year; and (b) is tax payable under section MF 5(2) or MF 6(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007, or is otherwise the result of WFF tax credit overpayment or overcrediting; and (c) is outstanding due to amendments to the family scheme made by the Taxation (Personal Tax Cuts, Annual Rates, and Remedial Matters) Act 2008. (1C) The Commissioner must write off an amount, not exceeding $100, of outstanding tax to the extent to which the amount— (a) is outstanding from the 2008–09 tax year; and (b) is tax payable under section MF 5(2) or MF 6(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007, or is otherwise the result of WFF tax credit overpayment or overcrediting. (1D) The Commissioner must write off an amount, not exceeding $30, of outstanding tax to the extent to which the amount— (a) is outstanding from the 2010–11 tax year; and (b) is tax payable under section MF 5(2) or MF 6(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007, or is otherwise the result of WFF tax credit overpayment or overcrediting. (2) The Commissioner must write off outstanding tax that cannot be recovered in the following situations: (a) bankruptcy: (b) liquidation: (c) a taxpayer’s estate has been distributed. (3) Despite subsection (1), the Commissioner must not write off outstanding tax (inclusive of any shortfall penalties), if a taxpayer is liable to pay, in relation to the outstanding tax, a shortfall penalty for an abusive tax position or evasion or a similar act. (4) Despite subsection (2), the Commissioner may reinstate all or part of the outstanding tax written off if the Commissioner receives, by operation of law, additional funds in respect of a taxpayer after the taxpayer becomes bankrupt, is liquidated or if additional funds due to the taxpayer’s estate are discovered after the taxpayer’s estate has been distributed. UNCLASSIFIED 28 (5) If the Commissioner writes off outstanding tax for a taxpayer who has a tax loss, the Commissioner must extinguish all or part of the taxpayer’s tax loss, by— (a) dividing the amount written off by 0.33 and reducing the tax loss by that amount, if the taxpayer is not a company; or (b) dividing the amount written off by 0.28 and reducing the tax loss by that amount, if the taxpayer is a company. (5B) If the Commissioner writes off outstanding tax for a taxpayer who has a tax credit carried forward under section LE 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007, the Commissioner must extinguish an amount of the tax credit on a one-for-one basis. (5C) If a taxpayer has both a tax loss to which subsection (5) applies and a tax credit to which subsection (5B) applies, the Commissioner must extinguish the tax loss before extinguishing the tax credit. (6) For the purpose of subsection (5), the tax loss that may be extinguished is the tax loss of the taxpayer at the time at which the outstanding tax is written off and the Commissioner may use a figure for that tax loss based on the most recent return of income furnished by the taxpayer. (7) The Commissioner may reverse a write-off if— (a) outstanding tax is written off on the grounds of serious hardship, and the taxpayer for whom the debt was written off is a natural person who— (i) declares bankruptcy within a year of the outstanding tax being written off; or (ii) is subject to bankruptcy proceedings brought by a creditor within a year of the outstanding tax being written off; or (b) outstanding tax is written off on the grounds of serious hardship, and the taxpayer for whom the debt was written off is a relief company which, within a year of the outstanding tax being written off, is, or is in the course of being, liquidated; or (c) the outstanding tax was written off due to false or misleading information provided by the taxpayer. (8) If the Commissioner enters into an instalment arrangement that provides for some outstanding tax to be written off, the Commissioner may not reverse the write-off even if, during the term of the instalment arrangement, the taxpayer does not meet the instalment arrangement’s terms. Section 183A Remission for reasonable cause (1) This section applies to— (a) a late filing penalty: (b) a non-electronic filing penalty: (c) a late payment penalty: (d) imputation penalty tax imposed by section 140B: (e) \[Repealed\] (f) Maori authority distribution penalty tax imposed by section 140CB: (g) a shortfall penalty imposed by section 141AA: (h) a civil penalty imposed under section 215 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006: (i) a penalty for not paying employer monthly schedule amount imposed by section 141ED. (1A) The Commissioner may remit the penalty if the Commissioner is satisfied that— UNCLASSIFIED 29 (a) a penalty to which this section applies arises as a result of an event or circumstance beyond the control of a taxpayer; and (b) as a consequence of that event or circumstance the taxpayer has a reasonable justification or excuse for not furnishing the tax return or an employer monthly schedule, or not furnishing an employer monthly schedule in a prescribed electronic format, or not paying the tax on time; and (c) the taxpayer corrected the failure to comply as soon as practicable. (2) Without limiting the Commissioner’s discretion under subsection (1), an event or circumstance may include— (a) an accident or a disaster; or (b) illness or emotional or mental distress. (3) An event or circumstance does not include— (a) an act or omission of an agent of a taxpayer, unless the Commissioner is satisfied that the act or omission was caused by an event or circumstance beyond the control of the agent— (i) that could not have been anticipated; and (ii) the effect of which could not have been avoided by compliance with accepted standards of business organisation and professional conduct; or (b) a taxpayer’s financial position. Section 183ABA Remission in circumstances of emergency event (1) This section applies for a taxpayer if— (a) an emergency event, declared in an Order in Council under this section, physically prevents the taxpayer from making a payment required by a tax law on or before the due date for the payment; and (b) the taxpayer is charged with interest under Part 7 for failing to make the payment by the due date; and (c) the taxpayer is a member of a class of persons to whom a remission under this section is available, if such a class of persons is described in the Order in Council declaring the emergency event. (2) The taxpayer may ask the Commissioner to remit the interest. (3) The Commissioner may remit the interest if the Commissioner is satisfied that— (a) it is equitable that the interest be remitted; and (b) the taxpayer asked for the relief as soon as practicable; and (c) the taxpayer made the payment as soon as practicable. (4) The Governor-General may from time to time by Order in Council— (a) declare an event that meets the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of the definition of emergency in section 4 of the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002, to be an emergency event: (b) describe a class or classes of persons to whom a remission under this section is available in relation to the emergency event. (5) An Order in Council (the order) made under subsection (4) or this subsection— (a) may relate to an event that occurred after the commencement of this Act and before the commencement of the order: (b) expires, if not renewed under paragraph (c), after— (i) the period given in the order, if such a period is given; or (ii) if no such period is given, 6 months from the promulgation of the order: UNCLASSIFIED 30 (c) may be renewed or replaced from time to time by an Order in Council made before or after the date on which the order would otherwise expire. Section 183D Remission consistent with collection of highest net revenue over time (1) The Commissioner may remit— (a) a late filing penalty; and (aa) a non-electronic filing penalty; and (b) a late payment penalty; and (bb) a shortfall penalty imposed by section 141AA; and (bc) a civil penalty imposed under section 215 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006; and (bd) a penalty for not paying employer monthly schedule amount imposed by section 141ED; and (c) interest under Part 7— payable by a taxpayer if the Commissioner is satisfied that the remission is consistent with the Commissioner’s duty to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law. (2) In the application of this section, the Commissioner must have regard to the importance of the penalty, and interest under Part 7, in promoting compliance, especially voluntary compliance, by all taxpayers and other persons with the Inland Revenue Acts. (3) The Commissioner must not consider a taxpayer’s financial position when applying this section. Section 3 – Legislative definitions - Selected relevant definitions are below: Commissioner’s official opinion— (a) means, for a taxpayer,— (i) an opinion of the Commissioner concerning the tax affairs of the taxpayer communicated by the Commissioner after all information relevant to forming the opinion has been provided to the Commissioner, if that information is correct: (ii) a finalised official statement of the Commissioner notifying the taxpayer, if it specifically applies to the taxpayer’s situation: (b) does not include a private binding ruling Relief company means, in relation to a taxpayer, a company in which— (a) the taxpayer owns 50% or more of the shares: (b) the taxpayer and 1 other person jointly own 50% or more of the shares: (c) the taxpayer is a shareholder-employee, and the company satisfies paragraphs (a) and (c) of the definition of close company in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Standard practice statement 18/01 Retrospective adjustments to salaries paid to shareholder-employees This statement also appears in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 30, No 2 (March 2018) and on Inland Revenue’s website www.ird.govt.nz 1 . Introduction Standard practice statements describe how the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the CIR) will exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. In Tax Information Bulletin Vol 17, No 4 (May 2005), the CIR published Standard Practice Statement 05/05: Retrospective adjustments to salaries paid to shareholder- employees (SPS 05/05), which addressed the question of when a retrospective reduction in a shareholder-employee’s salary may be made. SPS 05/05 specifically did not address the question of when a retrospective increase in a shareholder-employee’s salary could be made. Any request received by the CIR to retrospectively alter an amount of shareholder’s salary involves the CIR exercising her discretion under s 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The CIR has issued Standard Practice Statement 16/01: Requests to amend assessments 2 (SPS 16/01). SPS 16/01 sets out the process that the CIR will use to consider s 113 requests 3 . This statement sets out the s 113 process for considering whether the circumstances are appropriate for the CIR to agree to retrospectively alter an amount of shareholder’s salary, irrespective of whether this alteration increases or decreases the amount of shareholder’s salary. Unless specified otherwise, all legislative references in this SPS are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the TAA). 1 Search Keywords: SPS 18/01 2 Published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 4 (May 2016) at page 12 and on Inland Revenue’s website www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: SPS 16/01) 3 From \[32\]. Application This SPS applies from 1 April 2018 and replaces Standard Practice Statement 05/05: Retrospective adjustments to salaries paid to shareholder-employees. This statement should be read with Standard Practice Statement 16/01: Requests to amend assessments and Standard Practice Statement 09/02: Voluntary disclosures (or any subsequent statements issued in replacement). Standard practice Process used to consider section 113 requests 1. The CIR acknowledges that in a self-assessment system taxpayers will occasionally take an incorrect tax position and that correcting these positions is an integral part of tax administration. Section 113 contains a broad discretion allowing the CIR to amend assessments to ensure their correctness. 2. As stated in Westpac Securities NZ Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue 4 (at \[65\]): ...the focus of the inquiry as to whether the power was available would be centred on whether the amendment the taxpayer seeks to have made will ensure the assessment is correct when amended, even if it was also correct beforehand. The CIR’s policy is generally to use the discretion to amend assessments that are requested where the amendment will lead to the issuing of a correct assessment. 3. In undertaking this approach, the CIR breaks the exercise into phases. SPS 16/01, from \[34\], describes these phases in the following terms: Phase one: An initial examination of the request. If it is clear and obvious that an error has occurred and that the error can be easily corrected, then the amendment will be made, subject to the application of phase four; the request will not have to progress through stages two and three. Conversely, if it is clear and obvious that agreeing to the request will not result in a correct assessment, the request will be declined at this phase. Phase two: If it is unclear whether agreeing to the request will result in a correct assessment being issued, the Commissioner will need to consider whether further limited resources should be applied to consider the request further. Phase three: In cases where it is decided to apply further resources the Commissioner will consider whether a correct assessment will result from the requested amendment. Phase four: Determine whether there is any residual reason (other than her limited resources) why the Commissioner should not make the requested amendment. 4 \[2014\] NZHC 3377, (2014) 26 NZTC 21-118 4. The following flowchart illustrates the progress of a s 113 request through the 4 phases: Correct assessment able to be issued 5. The setting of the amount of a shareholder’s salary is generally a matter of contract between a company and its shareholder(s). The contractual nature of a salary means that the inclusion of any amount of salary in the company’s and shareholders respective income tax returns will allow the CIR to issue a correct assessment. 6. Where the amount of a shareholder’s salary initially agreed between the parties is found to be in error, the CIR’s recognition of any mutually agreed changes to correct that error will also allow the CIR to issue a correct assessment. 7. As a correct assessment can always be issued by the CIR, changes in a shareholder’s salary are an example of a s 113 request that can be progressed from phase 1 directly to phase 4 (see arrow on right of above flowchart). Section 113 request received by CIR Phase 1 CIR examines the merits of the s 113 request Phase 2 CIR considers whether to apply limited resources Phase 3 Will a correct assessment result from the amendment requested? Phase 4 Is there any reason why the CIR should not make the assessment? CIR agrees to amend assessment Decline request Correct assessment cannot be issued CIR not willing to apply resources No Yes Unclear whether the correct assessment can be issued CIR willing to apply resources Yes No Correct assessment able to be issued Timing and matching principles 8. Sections EA 4 and EI 9 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (“the ITA”) set out the timing and matching principles relevant to the tax consequences of shareholders’ salaries. Put simply, an amount of a shareholder’s salary is assessable to the shareholder in the same income year as deductibility is available to the paying company. Assessability is determined by whether, and when, an amount of salary is deductible. 9. An amount of salary does not have to have been physically paid before deductibility occurs. It is sufficient that a company is definitively committed to the expenditure 5 even where the exact quantum of that expenditure is yet to be determined. 10. Section EA 4(3) of the ITA states that the time for paying an amount of shareholder’s salary is: ...the last day by which the person could file a return of income for the income year if the time for filing were extended to its maximum under section 37(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 11. The fact that there is a legislative timeframe for the payment of an amount of shareholder’s salary does not affect the CIR’s ability to correct the quantum of any shareholder’s salary where an error has occurred in calculating the amount of that shareholder’s salary (see further at \[20\]–\[22\] below). Considering phase four requests 12. In discussing phase 4, SPS 16/01 6 states that where a request reaches this stage (because the CIR is satisfied that the amendment requested will lead to the making of a correct assessment) the assessment will be made unless making the assessment would undermine the integrity of the tax system. SPS 16/01 states (from \[59\]) that: 59. These circumstances can include, for example: (a) Where the request is, or is part of, a tax avoidance arrangement. This is because, while the requested adjustment may be a correct interpretation of the law when considered in isolation, the Commissioner would not be convinced that the resulting assessment would be correct given the presence of tax avoidance. The Commissioner’s view of the law on tax avoidance is set out in Interpretation Statement IS 13/01 – Tax avoidance and the interpretation of sections BG 1 and GA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 7 (b) Where a taxpayer requests the Commissioner to amend an assessment from one correct tax position to another position that is also correct When a taxpayer requests the Commissioner to amend an assessment from one correct tax position to another tax position that is also correct, the fact the original position was correct is a factor the Commissioner may take into account in deciding whether to use her discretion to make the amendment requested. As stated by Clifford J in Westpac at \[67\]: There could be any number of valid reasons why the Commissioner may decline to exercise her discretion in situations of regretted correct tax positions including where the taxpayer appears to be gaming the system. ... The fact that Westpac, a well resourced, sophisticated and well advised taxpayer says that it “erred” when the relevant offset elections were made may be a proposition that the Commissioner will need to consider carefully when deciding whether or not to exercise her discretion. 5 King v C of IR (1973) 1 NZTC 61,107; \[1974\] 2 NZLR 190; CIR v Glen Eden Metal Spinners Ltd (1990) 12 NZTC 7,270. 6 At \[59\] 7 More information on this statement may be found on Inland Revenue’s website www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: IS 13/01) Two matters flow from these judicial comments. Firstly, whether a taxpayer erred in taking their original tax position is a factor the Commissioner may take into account in deciding whether to make the requested adjustment. A taxpayer could be said to have “erred” where they did not take the tax position they intended, through mistake or oversight, or the tax position they took, though technically possible and therefore already correct, was not one they would have taken if they had been in possession of all the relevant facts at that time. If the request arises from such an oversight, it is more likely the amendment will be made than if the request is simply the result of the taxpayer changing their mind. This is because the TAA places an obligation on taxpayers to make self-assessments correctly and it is not contemplated that unlimited additional variations can be made at a cost to the Commissioner. Amendments should not be able to be made merely at will. On this basis, a request for multiple changes to tax positions will also be unlikely to be agreed to. The Commissioner may also take into account the fact a taxpayer is “well resourced, sophisticated and well advised”, and therefore generally better equipped to be able to evidence the fact that they erred in taking their original position. 60. To allow an amendment in these circumstances may have a negative impact on other taxpayers’ perceptions of the integrity of the tax system, especially as they relate to the concepts of statutory timeframes 8 , certainty and their own future voluntary compliance. In these instances, the decision to not apply the discretion will be made by a senior Inland Revenue officer, with advice from the Legal and Technical Services group. Part of a tax avoidance arrangement 13. If the CIR considers that declaring a new amount of salary was part of a wider tax avoidance arrangement, or is the arrangement, the requested adjustment will not be made for the reasons stated at \[12\] 9 above. Changing from one correct tax position to another correct tax position 14. A s 113 request will progress through phase 4, and the requested salary adjustment will be made, if a taxpayer is able to demonstrate to the CIR’s satisfaction that they “erred” in taking their original tax position. That is, the quantum of salary initially declared was declared in error. 15. As stated at \[12\] 10 above, it is the CIR’s view that a taxpayer can be said to have “erred” where they did not take the tax position they intended, through mistake or oversight, or the tax position they took, though technically possible and therefore already correct, was not one they would have taken if they had been in possession of all the relevant facts at that time 11 . 16. A taxpayer will need to provide the CIR with evidence that the initial salary was declared in error. It will not be enough to show that some other tax position in their tax return is in error and that, as a result of that error, they now wish to alter the amount of shareholder’s salary. 17. For example, in Case U27 12 a company’s accountant relied on incorrect information supplied to him by the company’s majority shareholder. As a result of this misinformation, the company’s profit was overstated. The company had a policy of declaring salaries at no more than the company’s profit in any year. As a result of the overstatement of the company’s profit, the amount of shareholders’ salaries was also overstated. The CIR agreed to use the s 113 discretion to correct the 8 CIR v Wilson (1996) 17 NZTC 12,512; Charter Holdings Ltd v CIR \[2015\] NZHC 2041 9 At 59(a) 10 At 59(b) 11 See SPS 16/01 at \[59(b)\] and \[12\] above 12 (1999) 19 NZTC 9,261 errors made in the company’s income tax return, but did not agree to amend the shareholder’s salary. 18. In finding for the taxpayer, the Taxation Review Authority held that the company was not irretrievably bound by the amount of shareholder’s salary that had been declared in error. To find otherwise would, in the words of the Authority, be so patently unjust that a Court would only come to such a conclusion if inescapably driven to do so by binding authority or the clearest parliamentary intention. In the Court’s view, no such authority or intention existed. 19. In Case U27 the taxpayers were able to show that they had erred in both the tax positions taken to arrive at the company profit and the amount of shareholder’s salary initially declared. In this circumstance it would be appropriate for the CIR to apply the s 113 discretion to correct both errors made by the taxpayer. If the Court had found that there had been no error in declaring the amount of shareholder’s salary, the CIR would not have been bound to use the s 113 discretion 13 . See also \[24\] below. How errors will be corrected 20. In correcting errors made in tax returns, s 113 contains a broad discretion allowing the CIR to amend assessments to ensure their correctness. 21. Declaring an amount of shareholder’s salary is generally a matter of contract between a company and its shareholder. Where a shareholder and company agree that an error has occurred in quantifying the amount of salary to be declared for a year, that error can be corrected without the original contract being voided and a new contract entered into. As long as the declaration of the original salary (the salary declared in error) met the requirements of the timing and matching principles contained in ss EA 4 and EI 9 of the ITA, these sections will not impact on the ability of the CIR to correct the error. 22. Where the shareholder and company are able to provide evidence to the CIR’s satisfaction that an error has been made in the quantum of shareholder’s salary originally declared, the CIR will correct that error. For the above reasons it is not relevant whether the new salary is greater or less than the original salary that was declared. All parties must agree 23. As the amount of shareholder salary is a matter of contract between a shareholder and a company, the CIR will not consider using the s 113 discretion to amend assessments unless both parties to that contract agree that an error has been made. Until agreement is reached, it is the CIR’s view that any dispute between the shareholder and the company is a civil matter that is properly addressed, if necessary, through the Courts 14 . Amending shareholder’s salary where no error has occurred 24. Where taxpayers request that the shareholder’s salary be amended and they are unable to provide evidence that the original salary was declared in error, any amendment to that original salary can only have prospective effect. This is made clear by Willey DCJ in Case U27, in which he discussed the outcome of Case Q49 and stated, “it was simply that the company and the shareholders later repented of 13 See for instance, Case Q49 (1993) 15 NZTC 5,254. 14 See for instance, Spence v Commissioners of Inland Revenue 24 TC 311 their bargain and sought to reverse it. No questions of restitution or rectification arose and therefore any new arrangement which they were free to enter into could only have prospective effect”. See also comments made in SPS 16/01 (at \[59(b)\]) and at \[12\] above. Examples of when the Commissioner generally will agree to adjust an amount of shareholder’s salary When the amount of company profit is shown to be in error: 25. Where:  the CIR has agreed to use the s 113 discretion to correct an error in a company’s accounts, or  the taxpayer otherwise agrees that the CIR is able to correct an error in the company accounts (by signing an agreed adjustment, for instance), the process set out in SPS 16/01 will be followed. That is, the CIR will agree to adjust an amount of shareholder’s salary previously declared, but only where the taxpayer can also evidence the fact that, due to the error in the company’s accounts, this amount of salary is now also in error. This could occur, for instance, in the following situations:  The company’s profit has been amended and the company and shareholder have historically agreed that all company profit will be declared as salary to the shareholder (and this agreement has not changed).  The company’s profit has been amended and the company and shareholder have historically agreed that a fixed percentage of company profit will be declared as salary to the shareholder (and this agreement has not changed).  The company and shareholder have historically agreed that salary will only be declared out of company profits and not losses (and this agreement has not changed). Where an amendment to the company accounts sends the company from a profit to a loss situation (or vice versa), then the appropriate salary adjustment may be made.  The company and shareholder are otherwise able to evidence that, had they been aware of the correct level of company profit, they would have declared an amount of salary that differs from that originally declared. For instance, the taxpayers may be able to successfully argue that altering the level of shareholder’s salary would be, from an accounting perspective, the most logical treatment of the salary in the circumstances. When the amount of company profit is not in error: 26. The CIR may agree to exercise her s 113 discretion where the company and shareholder are able to provide evidence that the amount of shareholder’s salary shown in the company accounts (and returned as income by the shareholder) was not the amount that had been agreed at the time the salary was declared. That is, the amount of salary shown in the returns of income is factually incorrect. For example, the amount of shareholder’s salary may have been the subject of arithmetic, transposition or keying error. Examples of when the Commissioner will generally not agree to adjust an amount of shareholder’s salary When the amount of adjusted salary is or is part of a tax avoidance arrangement: 27. No adjustment will be made. See further at \[12\] and \[13\] above. When the taxpayer is unable to provide evidence that the original salary declared was declared in error: 28. No adjustment will be made. 29. As no error has occurred any adjustment can only be prospective from the date that a change in salary occurred. For example, rather than an error having occurred, the request may arise out of an intention to adjust the shareholder’s salary to alter the shareholder’s child support liability, to increase the shareholder’s entitlement to family assistance, or to assist with the company’s cash flow. See also SPS 16/01 (at \[59(b)\]), and \[12\] and \[24\] above. Not all of the parties to the contract agree that an error has occurred: 30. No adjustment will be made. 31. As the amount of shareholder salary is a matter of contract between a shareholder and a company, the CIR will not consider using the s 113 discretion to amend assessments unless both parties to that contract agree that an error has been made. Until agreement is reached, it is the CIR’s view that any dispute between the shareholder and the company is a civil matter that is properly addressed, if necessary, through the Courts.

UNCLASSIFIED 1 Standard Practice Statement SPS 18/02 Requests to change a balance date This statement also appears in the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 30, No 4 (May 2018). Introduction Standard practice statements describe how the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. This Standard Practice Statement (SPS) sets out Inland Revenue’s practice for considering requests for the Commissioner’s approval to change a balance date for income tax purposes. The description “non-standard balance date” in this SPS refers to a balance date other than 31 March. This SPS applies to all requests for a change of balance date. It includes requests from customers who wish to change from a 31 March balance date to a non-standard balance date; requests to change from one non-standard balance date to another non-standard balance date and also requests to change from a non-standard balance date to a 31 March balance date. Section references are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. Application This SPS applies from 1 April 2018. It replaces SPS 08/04: Elections to change a balance date which was published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 20, No 11 (February 2009).

The Commissioner has an obligation to protect the integrity of the tax system, including applying the tax laws fairly, impartially and according to the law. Every request will be considered on its individual merit in line with this SPS. 2. Section 38 allows the Commissioner to agree that customers may be permitted to file an income return for the year ending on the date corresponding with the balance date of their annual accounts, instead of using the standard 31 March balance date provided by the Tax Administration Act 1994. 3. Only customers with an obligation to file returns under s 33 (generally, customers in business or those who receive income not taxed at source) may apply under s 38 to adopt a balance date other than 31 March. 4. Subject to the detailed discussion in this SPS, approval will be provided where the Commissioner is satisfied the change is not for reasons as outlined at \[12\]. Detailed discussion Overview of the authority to change a balance date 5. When a customer wishes to adopt a non-standard balance date, or change from a non-standard balance date back to 31 March (or change from one non-standard balance date to another), they are required to obtain the Commissioner’s prior notified approval under s 38 before they can file a return for that new balance date. 6. Section 38 reads as follows: 38(1) \[Returns to annual balance date\] Instead of furnishing a tax year return under section 33 on the basis of a corresponding income year that ends on 31 March, a taxpayer (other than a person who meets the requirements of section 33A(1), or is issued an income statement or required to request or be issued an income statement,) may, with the consent of the Commissioner, elect to furnish a return based on a corresponding income year that ends with the date of the annual balance of the taxpayer’s accounts. 38(1B) \[When multi-rate PIE must not make election\] A multi-rate PIE that does not calculate and pay tax using the provisional tax calculation option under section HM 44 of the Income Tax Act 2007 must not make an election under subsection (1). ... UNCLASSIFIED 3 38(3) \[Prior notified approval required for change of election\] Any election made by a taxpayer for the purposes of this section shall continue in force unless and until it is altered by the taxpayer with the prior notified approval of the Commissioner. 7. A 31 March balance date is the default for a “tax year” in s 33, and s YA 1 of the ITA 2007 defines “tax year” as a period starting 1 April and ending 31 March. However, s 38(1) lets the Commissioner approve the filing of tax returns for a tax year that does not end on 31 March. The legislation provides no further guidance on how to use this discretion. When will the Commissioner agree to a change in balance date? 8. Subject to the detailed discussion in this SPS, approval will be provided where the Commissioner is satisfied the change is not for reasons as outlined at \[12\] and that a customer is able to provide a correct return of income for a tax year ending on the balance date. 9. The Commissioner acknowledges there are situations where a balance date of 31 March may be impractical. The situations described below are not intended to be an exhaustive list and there are likely to be other circumstances (not contemplated in the SPS) where it would be appropriate to agree to a change to a balance date. The Commissioner will agree to a change to a balance date for customers to: (a) adopt an alternative balance date when they can demonstrate that the nature of their business makes a 31 March balance date impractical, or their circumstances have changed significantly and they should be permitted to change a non-standard balance date previously agreed to (this includes elections by new business customers to adopt a non-standard balance date, with application from their first return/tax year); (b) adopt an alternative balance date when they can demonstrate that unreasonable or excessive compliance costs will be incurred as a consequence of having to return income to 31 March (this may include the impact of other statutory reporting requirements, see further comment at \[15\] and \[16\]); (c) align with an agreed industry balance date (see further comment at \[23\] to \[29\]); (d) allow a franchisee who is required as a condition of a franchise agreement to use a non-standard balance date for financial reporting purposes, where the applicable balance date has been recognised via an agreement between the Commissioner and the master franchisor; (e) allow a shareholder-employee to use the same balance date as the company from which they derive their primary source of income; (f) allow a customer who receives passive income, and therefore has an obligation to provide a return of income to 31 March for that passive income as well as any business income that they earn, to adopt a non-standard balance date for returning their business income. If the business income has a source in a related business entity, a customer may elect to return income to the balance date of that related entity (see further comment at \[17\] to \[20\]); (g) allow a subsidiary company to use the same balance date as the parent company; (h) adopt a common balance date for business entities with a close working relationship, where they share a common business/management accounting UNCLASSIFIED 4 system or central administration structure and one of those entities has an approved non-standard balance date. This category includes joint ventures that want to adopt a balance date common with a partner; (i) allow managed funds to adopt a balance date in common with a fund manager or trustee when it can be demonstrated that a parent–subsidiary-like relationship exists between parties, excluding a multi-rate portfolio investment entity (“multi-rate PIE”) that does not make tax payments under s HM 44 of the ITA 2007 (see further comment at \[30\]); (j) allow entities deemed to be agents of non-resident insurers to file “as agent” returns in terms of s HD 16 of the ITA 2007, excluding a multi-rate PIE that does not make tax payments under s HM 44 of the ITA 2007; (k) adopt a balance date applicable to a non-resident customer’s tax jurisdiction, when they perform business activities in New Zealand but have a centre of management outside New Zealand (does not apply to non-residents that merely earn passive investment income in New Zealand); (l) allow an estate to adopt the date that coincides with the date of death of the deceased customer as the balance date for the continuing estate; (m) allow a previously tax-exempt entity to continue to use a balance date consistent with an existing date for financial reporting purposes (eg, a charity that previously had only exempt income and so was not required to file tax returns but is now required to file returns, may continue to use the non- standard balance date they had used prior to entering the tax base). 10. When agreeing to a change to a balance date, the Commissioner will only agree to an annual balance date that is the last calendar day of a month rather than part-way through a month. However, there is an exception for a continuing estate that elects to adopt a balance date that coincides with a deceased taxpayer’s date of death. 11. Where the Commissioner has already provided consent to a balance date other than the last calendar day of a month, these consents will not be revisited unless a further request to change a balance date is received. Similarly, in these situations subsidiary entities will be permitted to adopt the non-standard balance date of a parent entity. When will the Commissioner not agree to a change in balance date? 12. The Commissioner will not agree to a change in balance date when: (a) a reason for the change is to defer the payment of tax, or to take earlier advantage of a tax incentive or concession than would otherwise not have been the case had no change of balance date occurred; (b) the request has been made because of a wish to smooth out administrative workloads within the customer’s business (setting aside matters relating to seasonal businesses); (c) the non-standard balance date is the anniversary date of the commencement of the business, unless that date coincides with an agreed industry balance date; (d) the request is made to smooth the workflow of a manager, or trustee, or tax agent; (e) the customer has investment income and no direct involvement in a business activity (see further comment at \[17\] to \[20\]); UNCLASSIFIED 5 (f) functions have been contracted out to a third party (eg, a specialist administration manager) and the customer wishes to adopt the manager’s balance date (g) a multi-rate PIE that does not make tax payments under s HM 44 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (“ITA 2007”) cannot have a balance date other than 31 March. Consideration of requests 13. In considering a request to change a balance date the Commissioner will look at relevant matters, consistent with the statutory responsibilities under s 6 to maintain the integrity of the tax system. 14. The supporting information in a request to change a balance date will be considered. The Commissioner’s considerations may extend to other relevant information held for a customer and of wider industry practice, to establish an informed view as to whether the circumstances of a particular case provide sufficient cause for the customer not to return income to their current balance date. The following paragraphs explain the relevant matters that will be considered by the Commissioner. Compliance costs 15. Business customers may incur compliance costs in a number of ways, including general accounting, financial and reporting requirements. Compliance costs will be considered as a factor when a customer is able to show they will incur unreasonable or excessive costs as a consequence of having to return income to 31 March (or their current balance date). The Commissioner will consider normal compliance costs, excluding for instance those incurred by choice by customers through self-imposed internal planning or reporting requirements. 16. The Commissioner will also consider the impact of other statutory reporting requirements on customers’ annual accounts and their tax obligation to return income. Passive income 17. Passive income is a term used to describe income derived from investments or property that does not require direct physical exertion or the application of specialist skill by a customer ( eg, the receipt of interest or dividends). In contrast, a business activity includes a profession, trade, manufacture, or undertaking carried on for a pecuniary profit. 18. Customers whose primary source of income is from passive investments will generally be required to return income to 31 March. Much of the information on earnings required to file a return is available from financial institutions on a periodic basis. 19. An exception to this general rule is when entities related to a customer are engaged in a business activity that has a non-standard balance date. This concession is to avoid additional compliance costs and disruption with preparing annual accounts when a customer derives passive income through the business activity of a related entity. 20. The following example shows how the passive income exception may arise. UNCLASSIFIED 6 Income from a Foreign Investment Fund 21. A further exception applies to customers with an attributing interest in a Foreign Investment Fund (“FIF”) that calculate their FIF income or loss using the attributable FIF income method. Section EX 69 of the ITA 2007 provides specific rules for changing an FIF balance date. The FIF requires the Commissioner’s consent before a new balance date can be used. Customers with wage/salary as well as business income 22. In situations where a customer has income from salary or wages as well as business income, the Commissioner may still consent to a non-standard balance date. Industry balance dates 23. Some businesses have a natural end to their income year, for example, the end of a growing season, the end of a traditionally busy trading period, or the time in the annual business cycle in which the majority of income and relevant costs can be brought to account. 24. Examples of businesses which have “natural” income years not ending on 31 March include farmers, or growers or harvesters of primary produce that are subject to seasonal climate conditions or the natural cycle of stock breeding. That may also extend to directly related service industries involved in, for instance, the harvesting, processing, packaging, and exporting of produce. 25. Market demands for manufactured goods, and the seasonal impacts on the growing or harvesting of produce, influence the trading patterns of many businesses. Customers impacted by seasonal constraints or demands on their businesses may find a 31 March balance date impractical when their attention is on those seasonal activities and the majority of their income is yet to be derived. 26. The natural end to a season for growers or retail manufacturers can be identified with the end of their production cycle when the last, or majority, of their produce is delivered to a processor or retail outlet. Once the harvest or peak business period is completed, a grower or manufacturer then prepares for the next annual busy season. 27. The Commissioner recognises a number of industry-specific non-standard balance Example: Passive income from a related entity A family trust leases a farm to a family trading partnership. The family trust passively derives their primary source of income from lease payments made by the related family partnership, which has a non-standard balance date. In this case, the Commissioner will consent to the family trust adopting the non-standard balance date used by the partnership. Example: Wage/salary as well as business income A customer earns a salary as a teacher and also has a small orchard from which she derives business income. The customer wishes to adopt a non-standard balance date of 30 June. The Commissioner would agree to the change of balance date as it is an industry-approved balance date, despite the income from salary/wages. In this situation the customer will return their business income to 30 June, but will continue to return the income from her salary to 31 March. UNCLASSIFIED 7 dates (refer to Appendix A). These dates have been determined following representations to the Commissioner by the industries concerned. Customers within these industries may apply to the Commissioner for consent to adopt these approved industry balance dates. See further comment at \[31\] to \[34\] on how to apply. 28. Customers aligned to an industry that has a recognised non-standard balance date still have the option to seek an alternative non-standard balance date (or remain with 31 March) if the industry balance date does not suit their circumstances. 29. Where taxpayers want to adopt an alternative non-standard balance date, they are required to make a full application that will be decided on the merit of each individual case (see further comment at \[35\] and \[36\]). Unit trusts, managed funds and “as agent” returns for non-resident insurers 30. Inland Revenue will consider requests for a non-standard balance date from the following entities: (a) The trustee of a unit trust that wishes to align its balance date with that of its manager A unit trust may choose to align its balance date with that of its manager. The manager is the entity with responsibility for the management of the unit trust and is appointed under the trust deed. Adoption of the manager’s balance date is appropriate only if the manager has retained the responsibility for day-to-day administration of the unit trust. (b) The trustee of a group investment fund that wishes to align its balance date with that of its manager A group investment fund is administered and overseen by a manager. The fund may have a separate trustee, although there is no requirement that the trustee and manager be separate entities. Consent will only be granted to align the fund’s balance date with that of the manager. As with unit trusts, the concession applies only when the manager has retained the responsibility for day-to-day administration of the trust and for preparing the trust’s accounts. When these functions have been contracted out to a third party, it is not appropriate to adopt the manager’s balance date. (c) A superannuation fund that wishes to align its balance date with that of its trustee The trust deed under which a superannuation fund is established will appoint a trustee to supervise the fund. Consent will be given for a fund to align its balance date with that of the trustee, provided that the trustee’s role has not been contracted out to a third party. (d) A superannuation fund administered by an employer for the benefit of its employees wishes to align its balance date with the balance date of the employer (e) A managed fund that wants to align its tax balance date for financial reporting purposes A managed fund (including unit trusts, group investment funds and superannuation funds) may choose to align its balance date with that for financial reporting purposes if it can be demonstrated that the alignment of UNCLASSIFIED 8 balance dates helps reduce the managed fund’s tax risks. The purpose of this concession is to promote voluntary compliance and good tax practices. Inland Revenue expects the managed fund to set out the reasons for changing their balance dates. These reasons will be examined on a case-by-case basis. However, the concession does not apply if: (i) the reason for changing the balance date is to improve the managed fund’s administration of human resources (eg, smoothing the workflows of their managers); (ii) the managed fund cannot provide evidence of what the tax risks are and how the change of balance date helps to mitigate these risks; (iii) the managed fund can identify some of its tax risks but the change of balance date is irrelevant to the mitigation of these risks. (f) A customer (who is a resident for taxation purposes) required to file an “as agent” return and wishes to align the balance date of that return with their own non-standard balance date A customer who insures with a non-resident insurer is required to return part of the premiums paid as income in a return known as an “as agent” return (s HD 16 of the ITA 2007). This income is returned “as agent” for the non-resident insurer. Customers with an approved non-standard balance date for their own returns will be granted consent to align the balance dates of their “as agent” returns to this date. How to make a request 31. Requests for the Commissioner’s agreement to change a balance date can be made using myIR secure online services, or by telephone (0800 377 774), or by correspondence where: (a) a customer who operates a business wants to adopt a recognised industry balance date (see further Appendix A); or (b) a shareholder-employee wants the same non-standard balance date as a company to which their shareholding relates, where earnings from the company is their primary source of income; or (c) a continuing estate wants to adopt a balance date that coincides with a deceased customer’s date of death; or (d) a subsidiary company wants to align to the balance date used by a parent company; or (e) a non-resident customer wants to adopt a balance date applicable in their country of residence, when they perform a business activity in New Zealand, but have a centre of management outside New Zealand (this concession does not apply to customers who only earn passive investment income); or (f) a previously tax-exempt entity wants to continue to use a balance date consistent with that used for financial reporting purposes. 32. These varied methods of election recognise that for these specific scenarios the UNCLASSIFIED 9 criteria for adopting a non-standard balance date may be easily verified at the time of contact. 33. Requests for the Commissioner’s agreement for the situations listed under \[31\] must contain the following details (as relevant): (a) full name of the customer seeking the non-standard balance date; (b) Inland Revenue number if already registered; (c) the balance date sought; (d) details of reasons for election to change the balance date; (e) income year their new balance date is to apply from; (f) name of tax agent. 34. Where a request is made to adopt a balance date in common with a related entity the nature of that relationship should be included as part of the request. Providing such information can help minimise any delay. 35. Other requests for a change to a balance date may be made via myIR secure online services or by correspondence, where: (a) a customer wishes to adopt an alternative balance date to the 31 March, due to the specific circumstances of their business activity; or (b) a customer’s circumstances have changed significantly and a balance date previously agreed to is no longer appropriate; or (c) a customer wishes to align balance dates for business entities with a close working relationship, where these entities share a common business/management accounting system or central administration structure; or (d) a managed fund wishes to adopt the non-standard balance date of the fund manager or trustee and it can be demonstrated a parent–subsidiary-like relationship exists between parties; or (e) entities deemed to be agents of non-resident insurers file “as agent” returns in terms of s HD 16 of the ITA 2007; or (f) a franchise owner wants to adopt the balance date used by a master franchisor. 36. As requests for a change of balance date for the situations listed under \[35\] are potentially more complex requests, they should be made via myIR secure online services or by correspondence. These requests should include the following information (as relevant): (a) full name of the customer seeking the balance date change; (b) Inland Revenue number if already registered; (c) The balance date sought; (d) details of reasons for election to change the balance date; (e) income year their new balance date is to apply from; UNCLASSIFIED 10 (f) name of tax agent; (g) details of cash flows; (h) details of stock patterns; (i) details of any significant business transactions that will impact on their tax liability for the current financial year; (j) other evidence to show that financial information prepared to the proposed balance date will be more appropriate to the entity; (k) where businesses claim they have a close trading relationship and share a common accounting system or central administration structure, evidence to support this assertion. Related matters Retrospective elections 37. Requests to change a balance date should be made prior to the commencement of a new income year, so that customers can avoid additional compliance costs if the Commissioner does not approve the change of balance date. 38. In the past, the Commissioner’s practice had been to defer the effective date for a change of balance date until the following income year. Going forward, the Commissioner, in limited circumstances, may agree to a retrospective change of a balance date change for a current income year where the request is received before the earlier of the return filing date under s 37(1) for the current balance date and that for the proposed balance date (excluding any extension of time arrangements for filing returns). 39. Retrospective agreement will be provided where customers can show that: (a) it is possible to file returns for all the income years; (b) the late election was not made for reasons of tax deferral or tax avoidance, or to take undue advantage of any tax incentive or concession; (c) any tax deferral occurring as a consequence of the proposed balance date change is insignificant (when compared to the customer’s total tax liability). Misleading information 40. When a request for a change of balance date is received, the Commissioner will consider the reasons and information provided in support of the request. The onus is on customers to make a full disclosure of the reasons for the change and to provide all relevant information to support their application. 41. However, the Commissioner is not bound by any agreement that was based on misleading or incomplete information. Income tax transitional period returns 42. When the Commissioner agrees to a change of balance date, the customer will be advised of the effective date of the change and the period for transitional return which will be required (with the exception of new taxpayers who elect to use an alternative UNCLASSIFIED 11 balance date upon registration or for their first return period). Further information on transitional return periods is given in Appendix B. Provisional tax payments 43. Where a change of balance date is agreed to, until the new balance date is reached, the customer will still need to pay provisional tax on the instalment dates that applied before the change. Once the new balance date is reached the provisional tax instalment dates relating to the new balance date will apply. Further information on transitional return periods is given in Appendix B. Effect for GST purposes of change of balance date 44. When a customer who is a liable to pay provisional tax and is GST registered (other than a GST ratio-method taxpayer) changes their balance date so that their GST taxable periods no longer align with the new balance date, they must change their GST taxable periods to align with the new balance date. Further information on alignment of GST taxable periods with a new balance date is given in Appendix B. Notification of the Commissioner’s consent 45. The Commissioner will generally respond to a request (by telephone, or myIR secure online services, or correspondence) in the same way in which the customer made their request. For complex situations, the Commissioner is likely to set out the transitional return period and consequential change details for a change of balance date in writing (via myIR secure online services or correspondence). Reviewing a decision of the Commissioner 46. Section 138E(1)(e)(iv) provides that there is no statutory right of challenge where the Commissioner has made a decision to decline a balance date change request under section 38. 47. However, if a customer is concerned that their circumstances have not been given proper consideration they should raise their concern with the officer they have been dealing with and ask that the decision to reconsidered. If they are still not satisfied with the decision, they may ask to have the decision reviewed by the Office of the Ombudsman or a judicial review. It is strongly recommended that independent legal advice be obtained. 48. If a taxpayer is still not satisfied with the level of service they receive, they can obtain more information about the Inland Revenue’s Complaints Management Service at www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword “complaints process”) or phone 0800 274 138 (Monday to Friday between 8 am and 5 pm). This Standard Practice Statement is signed on 11 April 2018 Rob Wells Manager, Technical Standards, OCTC UNCLASSIFIED 12 Appendix A: Industry-specific non-standard balance dates The Commissioner recognises a number of industry-specific balance dates. These dates have been determined following representations to the Commissioner by the industries concerned. Taxpayers in these industries, or closely aligned to them, may elect to adopt these approved industry balance dates (see comments at \[20\] to \[26\]), subject to the Commissioner’s prior notified consent under s 38(3).

UNCLASSIFIED 13 Appendix B: Consequential impact of a balance date change A) Income tax transitional period returns This appendix explains how the Commissioner applies the legislation concerning the transitional income tax returns required following the Commissioner’s agreement to use an alternate balance date. It also states the Commissioner’s practice on the effective date for a change of balance date. Section 39 sets out the treatment for transitional year returns. When the new balance date is earlier in the calendar year than the original balance date, the taxpayer’s transitional year will run from the original balance date to the new balance date. (This will generally be a period of six months or more.) When the new balance date is later in the calendar year than the original balance date, the taxpayer’s transitional year will run from the original balance date to the new balance date in the succeeding year. (This will generally be a period of more than 12 months.) Under s 39, when there is a change of balance date the taxpayer must file a transitional tax return. This return is for the income derived during the transitional period which begins on the day after the original balance date and ends on the new balance date. It is the Commissioner’s view that new business taxpayers who may elect to apply a non- standard balance date upon registration or their first return period, are not directly impacted by the transitional return provisions. Their first return will cover the period from commencement of business to their elected balance date, (instead of to 31 March). Although the transition year provisions are not applied directly to new taxpayer situations, there may be occasions when consideration of a balance date election spans more than one return period by days or weeks due to the timing of a request and the Commissioner providing consent. When these situations occur, favourable consideration will be given to taxpayer requests to include the start-up income details for the initial start-up in the substantive return that follows. Section 39 reads: 39(1) If the Commissioner approves a change to a new balance date that is earlier in the year than the original balance date, the change is effected by the taxpayer having a transitional year of the period from the original balance date up to and including the new balance date in the next succeeding year. 39(2) If the Commissioner approves a change to a new balance date that is later in the year than the original balance date, the change is effected by the taxpayer having a transitional year of the period from the original balance date up to and including the new balance date in the same year. 39(3) If the change in balance date means that a taxpayer has 2 corresponding income years for the same tax year, the figures for both corresponding income years are aggregated when the taxpayer's net income or net loss is determined. 39(4) For the purpose of giving effect to this section and section 38, the Commissioner may, for any corresponding income year, make any assessment that the Commissioner considers necessary. 39 (5) For the tax year corresponding to the income year or income years in which the change of balance date occurs, the basic tax rate for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 2007 and this Act is the rate that would apply if the person’s taxable income for the tax year were calculated using a value for the person’s net income, or net loss, for the tax year equal to the total of— UNCLASSIFIED 14 (a) the amount that, if the person had no income or expenditure associated with each business activity affected by a change of balance date for the tax year, would be obtained by subtracting the person’s annual total deduction for the tax year from the person’s annual gross income for the tax year; and (b) for each business activity affected by a change of balance date for the tax year, the amount given by subsection (6) for the tax year and the business activity. 39 (6) The amount given by this subsection, for a tax year and a business activity affected by a change of balance date for the tax year, is calculated using the formula— unadjusted business net × year days ÷ income year days. 39 (7) In the formula,— (a) unadjusted business net is the amount that, if the person had no income or expenditure other than income and expenditure associated with the business activity, would be the difference between the person’s annual gross income for the tax year and the person’s annual total deduction for the tax year: (b) year days is— (i) 365, if subparagraph (ii) does not apply: (ii) 366, if the income year or income years corresponding to the tax year include a 29 February: (c) income year days is the total days in the income year or income years corresponding to the tax year. Note: Section 39 uses the terms “earlier” and “later”. These should not be confused with the terms “early balance date” and “late balance date”. Section 39 refers to a balance date that is “earlier in the year than the original balance date” and a new balance date that is “later in the year than the original balance date”. The “original balance date” may itself be a non-standard balance date. Returns for less than six months or more than 18 months Changes to balance dates will generally result in a transitional period of more than six months, but no longer than 18 months. However, in some circumstances returns are required for a period of less than six months or more than 18 months. Returns for a period longer than 18 months only occur when there is a change from an early balance date to a late balance date. Returns for a period shorter than six months only occur when there is a change from a late balance date to an early balance date. Example 1: Early balance date A 31 March balance date is to change to 31 January. The return for the 2017–18 income year will cover the period from 1 April 2017 to 31 January 2018 (a 10- month transitional year). The return for the 2018–19 income year will be from 1 February 2018 to 31 January 2019. Example 2: Late balance date A 31 March balance date is to change to 30 June. The return for the 2017–18 income year will cover the period 1 April 2017 to 30 June 2018 (a 15-month transitional year). UNCLASSIFIED 15 B) GST and provisional tax consequences Section 39B sets out the treatment for customers with provisional tax and GST liabilities, which may also require consideration when a customer elects to change a balance date. Tax Information Bulletin Vol 18, No 5 (June 2006) comments on the GST consequences of changing a balance date for income tax purposes at page 73: When a taxpayer changes their balance date, until the new balance date is reached the taxpayer must continue to pay provisional tax on the instalment dates that applied before the change of balance date. Once the new balance date is reached the taxpayer pays provisional tax on the instalment dates relating to the new balance date. Instalments of provisional tax in this transitional year are due on the 28th of the months specified in Schedule \[3\], Part B and the final instalment is due on the 28th of the month following the final month in the transitional year or 15 January where November is the final month. Example 3: Change from a late balance date to an early balance date In 2017 a customer changes from a balance date of 30 September to 30 November for the 2018 income year (transitional return year): 1/10/16 – 30/9/17: 2016–17 income year 1/10/17 – 30/11/17: Two-month period within the 2017–18 income year (transitional return year) 1/12/17 – 30/11/18: 2018–19 income year. In this case it is not possible to include the income derived during the two-month period in the 2017–18 income year with other income derived in the same income year, because there is no other income derived during the 2017–18 income year. The taxpayer must file a two-month transitional return for the 2018 income year. Example 4 In 2016 a customer changes from a balance date of 30 November to 31 July for the 2017–18 income year (transitional return year): 1/12/15 – 30/11/16: 2016–17 income year 1/12/16 – 31/7/17: Eight-month period within the 2016–17 income year (transitional return year) 1/8/17 – 31/7/18: 2017–18 income year. The legislation requires the customer to add the income derived during the transitional period to other income derived in the same income year. Therefore, the customer must add the income derived in the eight-month period from 1 December 2016 to 31 July 2017 to the income derived in the period from 1 December 2015 to 30 November 2016 giving a return for a 20-month period for the 2017 income year. UNCLASSIFIED 16 The provisions relating to the calculation of provisional tax liability using the standard and estimation options are similar. However, the legislation introduces rules for the calculation of provisional tax in the transitional year for those taxpayers who use the GST ratio method. When a taxpayer changes their balance date and moves from a set of instalment dates in even- numbered months to a set of instalments in odd-numbered months or vice versa, there will be a one-month period when GST and provisional tax are due before they change to their new balance date. The taxpayer will determine the amount of provisional tax due for this period by applying the ratio to the one-month’s GST taxable supplies. When a taxpayer (other than a GST ratio method taxpayer) changes their balance date and their GST taxable periods do not align with their new balance date, the taxpayer must change their GST taxable periods to align with the new balance date. This is achieved by truncating the last taxable period before the new balance date so that the taxable periods and income year end on the same date. Sections 15B and 15D of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 refer to the alignment of GST return taxable periods with income tax balance dates and refer to a GST-registered person’s obligation to ensure that their GST return periods are aligned to a changed income tax balance date. Should a realignment of GST return taxable periods be required, realignment is to take effect in the income year when a new balance date is applied. If a change in balance date results in a registered person’s taxable periods not being aligned with their new income tax balance date, the Commissioner is required to make an adjustment to truncate the last GST return taxable period before a new income year/balance date is applied. Similarly, a customer who is liable to make provisional tax payments must continue to pay provisional tax on the instalment dates that apply before the change of balance date has application to their income tax return filing obligations and the Commissioner has given consent. The provisional tax instalment dates change in the income year that a new balance date takes effect, which is either the transitional return period or a new business customer’s first return period. When consent to a balance date change occurs, Inland Revenue staff handling balance date change requests will alert customers to the impact of transitional return periods, GST return taxable period realignment and provisional tax payment instalment dates, and related timing of these change impacts (if applicable).
1 UNCLASSIFIED Standard Practice Statement SPS 19/02 Voluntary disclosures This statement also appears in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31, No 4 (May 2019). Introduction Standard practice statements describe how the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) will exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. This Statement sets out the factors that the Commissioner will consider when forming an opinion as to whether a taxpayer has made a full voluntary disclosure to the Commissioner of all the details of a tax shortfall. Unless specified otherwise, all legislative references in this Statement are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the TAA). Application This Statement applies from 27 March 2019 and replaces SPS 09/02: Voluntary disclosures published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 21, No 5 (July 2009). Standard practice Summary 1. An important feature of the shortfall penalties regime is that shortfall penalties are reduced in certain specific circumstances. Section 141G(1) allows a shortfall penalty to be reduced if, in the Commissioner’s opinion, the taxpayer makes a full voluntary disclosure to the Commissioner of all the details of the tax shortfall. 2. Voluntary disclosures may be made by a taxpayer in person, by telephone or in writing, including by modifying their existing tax return by using myIR. 3. Making a “full” voluntary disclosure involves the taxpayer disclosing the following information to the Commissioner in relation to each tax shortfall (as a minimum): • sufficient details for the Commissioner to satisfactorily identify the taxpayer (name, trade name, IRD number) and confirm the taxpayer’s contact details (postal address, contact telephone number(s), email address); and • the tax periods and tax types involved; and • an explanation as to why the tax shortfall occurred; and • sufficient detail of the tax shortfall including its amount, and full details of the facts and circumstances leading to the tax shortfall to enable the Commissioner to make a correct assessment of the tax shortfall; and • any further information that is necessary for the Commissioner to make a correct assessment. 2 UNCLASSIFIED 4. The wording of s 141G(1) discloses four essential elements to a voluntary disclosure. A voluntary disclosure: • must disclose a tax shortfall; and • must disclose all the details of the tax shortfall; and • must disclose something to the Commissioner; and • must be made voluntarily. 5. All these elements must be present before the Commissioner will form an opinion that what has been disclosed by a taxpayer amounts to a full voluntary disclosure. 6. Many disclosures made to the Commissioner are unprompted. That is, they are not made as a consequence of the Commissioner first contacting the taxpayer. They will often arise when the taxpayer notices an error or omission in a tax return that has been filed and proactively contacts the department. If the disclosure is clearly unprompted, then as long as the taxpayer provides all the details of the tax shortfall, the disclosure made by the taxpayer will be treated by the Commissioner as a full voluntary disclosure; it is the disclosure of a tax shortfall that has been made voluntarily. Because of this, a taxpayer in this position will not have to consider further the detailed discussion of the four essential elements to a voluntary disclosure (stated at \[4\] above) that follows. A voluntary disclosure must disclose a tax shortfall 7. A tax shortfall is defined by s 3(1) as being the difference between the tax effect of the tax position taken by a taxpayer and the correct tax position, where that difference results in an increase in the tax payable by the taxpayer (or results in a decrease in a tax benefit). In making a voluntary disclosure, a taxpayer is disclosing to the Commissioner what the taxpayer now believes is an incorrect tax position that they have taken and requesting that the Commissioner make an assessment that they believe is based on a correct tax position. 8. A taxpayer is not able to make a voluntary disclosure on a matter that they wish to dispute. Nor will the Commissioner accept as voluntary disclosures, disclosures that are conditional on a particular outcome, or on the Commissioner doing (or not doing) something. This is because, given the definition of “tax shortfall” discussed above, a voluntary disclosure can only disclose a tax position that the taxpayer believes to be the correct tax position. 9. A taxpayer may make a voluntary disclosure and subsequently have a change of view as to whether the tax position disclosed is correct. This may occur, for instance, if further facts become available to the taxpayer, judicial authority is released, or the Commissioner changes her view in a public statement or ruling. A voluntary disclosure must disclose all the details of a tax shortfall 10. For the purposes of the voluntary disclosure regime, disclosing all the details of a tax shortfall is known as “making a full voluntary disclosure”. A “full” voluntary disclosure under s 141G requires a clear statement by the taxpayer of all the details of the difference between the tax effect of the tax position taken by the taxpayer, and the correct tax position. 11. All the details of a tax shortfall, including the monetary difference between the original tax position taken by the taxpayer and the correct tax position, should be disclosed by the taxpayer, as well as details of how this monetary difference was arrived at. 3 UNCLASSIFIED 12. Although this does not necessarily require quantification of the tax shortfall to the last dollar in every circ umstance, if the taxpayer makes little or no attempt to quantify the tax shortfall, or deliberately understates the tax shortfall, the voluntary disclosure cannot be a full voluntary disclosure. If the taxpayer is unable to quantify the exact amount of the tax shortfall, in order to allow the disclosure to be treated as a full voluntary disclosure, there is an expectation that the taxpayer will co-operate with the Commissioner to arrive at the amount of the tax shortfall. 13. A taxpayer’s tax return is made up of a number of tax positions and an error in any of them may lead to a tax shortfall for that tax position. A taxpayer’s tax return that contains a number of incorrect tax positions means that there will be a number of tax shortfalls that may have a shortfall penalty imposed on each of them separately. Where a taxpayer has multiple tax shortfalls they may make full voluntary disclosures for any of these tax shortfalls separately. 14. In some circ umstances the Commissioner is required to amalgamate a number of tax shortfalls and create an aggregated tax shortfall for which only one shortfall penalty is imposed. This occurs because of s 141(10). As a voluntary disclosure must contain all the details of a tax shortfall, if a number of tax shortfalls have been aggregated by the Commissioner, any voluntary disclosure made by a taxpayer will need to disclose all the details of all the individual incorrect tax positions taken for the aggregated tax shortfall in order to be treated as a full voluntary disclosure. A voluntary disclosure must disclose something to the Commissioner 15. For the purposes of the voluntary disclosure regime a “disclosure” is made if the taxpayer reasonably believes that the tax shortfall being disclosed is not known to the Commissioner. This is an objective test; whether the taxpayer’s belief that the Commissioner was unaware of the details of the tax shortfall at the time that it was disclosed was reasonable in the circ umstances. 16. It is the Commissioner’s view that if a voluntary disclosure of a tax shortfall is made by a taxpayer and the Commissioner is already aware of that tax shortfall, this will generally still amount to a “disclosure” by the taxpayer. It will not amount to a disclosure if: • the Commissioner has expressly advised the taxpayer of an incorrect tax position and a tax shortfall; or • the facts and circumstances of the interactions between the taxpayer and the Commissioner clearly indicate that it was reasonable for the taxpayer to infer that the Commissioner already knew of a tax shortfall. Any decision to not accept a voluntary disclosure on this basis will be made by a senior officer. A voluntary disclosure must be made voluntarily 17. A disclosure will always be made voluntarily unless a taxpayer, in making the disclosure, was acting under an obligation to do so, such that the making of the disclosure was not as a result of “acting on one’s own free will”. Meeting an obligation to provide information to the Commissioner does not necessarily mean that a voluntary disclosure cannot be made separately. A general invitation/suggestion by the Commissioner for a taxpayer (or group of taxpayers) to consider making a voluntary disclosure cannot amount to an “obligation” being imposed on those taxpayers. Voluntary disclosures and subsequent prosecution action 18. If a taxpayer makes a full voluntary disclosure before they are first notified of a pending investigation, the Commissioner’s usual practice is not to prosecute those taxpayers. In circumstances where the Commissioner forms the view that a taxpayer’s actions or 4 UNCLASSIFIED omissions is such that non-prosecution could lead to voluntary compliance more generally being undermined, the Commissioner may still proceed with that subsequent prosecution action. A decision to prosecute in these circ umstances will be an exceptionally rare occurrence, limited to serious offences, and will require the approval of a very senior officer.

An important feature of the shortfall penalties regime is that shortfall penalties are reduced in certain specific circumstances. The reduction of a shortfall penalty occurs 1 : • to take into account a taxpayer’s previous good behaviour (s 141FB); • to acknowledge the adequate disclosure of a taxpayer’s tax position (s 141H); and • to account for a tax shortfall that is temporary (s 141I). 20. Additionally, s 141G(1) allows that a shortfall penalty may be reduced if, in the Commissioner’s opinion, the taxpayer makes a full voluntary disclosure to the 1 Note that a shortfall penalty may also be increased to address a taxpayer’s obstruction of the Commissioner (s 141K ) 5 UNCLASSIFIED Commissioner of all the details of the tax shortfall. 21. The purpose of imposing shortfall penalties is to encourage voluntary compliance, and to address non-compliance in a way that is consistent, impartial and proportionate to the seriousness of that breach. The main forms of civil penalty are those listed at ss 141A to 141EB. These sections impose a shortfall penalty for taking an incorrect tax position or for doing or failing to do anything described in one of these shortfall penalty provisions. Shortfall penalties are imposed on a graduating scale from 20% to 150% of the difference between the tax effect of a taxpayer’s tax position and the correct tax position; the “tax shortfall” 2 . 22. The purpose of allowing a reduction to a shortfall penalty when a taxpayer makes a full voluntary disclosure is two-fold. It provides an incentive to taxpayers to determine their correct tax liability and aids voluntary compliance. It also provides cost savings in investigation time for Inland Revenue and other benefits that result from taxpayer co- operation. 23. If the Commissioner forms the opinion that a taxpayer has made a full voluntary disclosure before the taxpayer is first notified of a pending audit or investigation (investigation 3 ), this is known as a pre-notification disclosure. In this circumstance the shortfall penalty will be reduced by 100% if that shortfall penalty was initially imposed for not taking reasonable care, taking an unacceptable tax position, or for an unacceptable interpretation. All other shortfall penalties will be reduced by 75%. 24. Full voluntary disclosures made after a taxpayer is first notified of an investigation, but before that investigation commences, are known as post-notification disclosures. In this circumstance the shortfall penalty will be reduced by 40%. Pre- and post-notification voluntary disclosures are further discussed at \[79\] and \[85\] below. No reduction in the quantum of a shortfall penalty is available where a disclosure is made after an investigation has commenced. Voluntary disclosures and section 113 25. A voluntary disclosure provided by a taxpayer that discloses a tax shortfall is both a request that the Commissioner form an opinion that the disclosure amounts to a full voluntary disclosure, and a request that the Commissioner exercise the discretion contained in s 113 to amend the relevant assessment. 26. If a taxpayer makes a full voluntary disclosure to the Commissioner, s 113 provides the legislative authority for effecting the reassessment (but see discussion below regarding proposed tax positions (at \[43\]) and conditional disclosures (at \[44\] – \[47\] ). 27. The discretion contained in s 113 is a broad one allowing the Co mmissioner to amend assessments to ensure their correctness. The Commissioner will generally agree to amend assessments that are requested if making the requested adjustment will result in a correct assessment being issued. 28. A full discussion on how the Commissioner will use the s 113 discretion can be found in SPS 16/01: Requests to amend assessments, published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28 No 4, May 2016 and at www.ird.govt.nz 4 . 2 Section 3(1) 3 For the purposes of this Statement, the term audit or investigation will be referred to as an investigation 4 Search term: 16/01 6 UNCLASSIFIED How to make a voluntary disclosure 29. Voluntary disclosures may be made by a taxpayer in person, by telephone or in writing 5 6 . 30. If a voluntary disclosure is made in person to an officer of Inland Revenue, the officer will either • record the disclosure in writing and ask the taxpayer to sign that document as being a correct record of the voluntary disclosure; or • ask the taxpayer to make the disclosure in writing, including by email, completing the Voluntary disclosure (IR 281) form 7 or letter, as is most convenient for the taxpayer. 31. To ensure there is a clear record of all the details of the voluntary disclosure, the ability to accept a voluntary disclosure by telephone is limited to calls that are received by Inland Revenue at a site that has call recording. For practical purposes, this means that a taxpayer will need to call using one of Inland Revenue’s 0800 numbers. If a call is received by a site that does not have call recording, the taxpayer will be asked to put their voluntary disclosure in writing and/or complete either an IR 281 or IR 281P form as appropriate. 32. Whether the voluntary disclosure is made in person, by telephone or in writing, in order for a “full” voluntary disclosure to be made requires the disclosure of all relevant details of the tax shortfall. This is so the Commissioner can make a correct assessment in terms of s 113 with little requirement for further resources and time to be spent on the matter. The taxpayer must disclose all the details of the difference between the tax effect of the tax position(s) originally taken by the taxpayer, and the correct tax position(s). Note that full voluntary disclosures may be made for a number of different tax positions. This is discussed further at \[54\] – \[59\] below. 33. Making a “full” voluntary disclosure involves the taxpayer disclosing the following information to the Commissioner in relation to each tax shortfall (as a minimum): • sufficient details for the Commissioner to satisfactorily identify the taxpayer (name, trade name, IRD number) and confirm the taxpayer’s contact details (postal address, contact telephone number(s), email address); and • the tax periods and tax types involved; and • an explanation as to why the tax shortfall occurred; and • sufficient detail of the tax shortfall including its amount (but see further discussion at \[35\] and \[ 52\] – \[53\] below), and full details of the facts and circ umstances leading to the tax shortfall so as to enable the Commissioner to make a correct assessment of the tax shortfall; and • any further information that is necessary for the Commissioner to make a correct assessment. 34. Where a voluntary disclosure is made by a taxpayer using myIR to modify an existing tax return, much of the above information will be supplied while undertaking that modification. Despite this it will still be necessary for a taxpayer to provide an explanation as to why the tax shortfall occurred as well as full details of the facts and circumstances leading to the tax shortfall. When modifying a tax return this information can be provided in the space provided for the “description” of the “amendment information”. 5 “in writing” includes by electronic means, including using myIR to modify a tax return 6 For a GST return, taxpayers may also use the “make an amendment” option in myIR 7 Or our Voluntary disclosure (IR281P) form if a taxpayer wishes to disclose the sale of a property 7 UNCLASSIFIED 35. When a taxpayer makes a voluntary disclosure in writing, the Commissioner will acknowledge its receipt and advise the taxpayer whether the disclosure meets all of the requirements of a full voluntary disclosure. Irrespective of how a taxpayer makes a voluntary disclosure (by person, by telephone or in writing) if, in examining the voluntary disclosure, the Commissioner requires additional information, the taxpayer will be contacted and allowed a reasonable period of time to provide that information. The time period for providing the information will be negotiated between the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officer. So long as the additional information is supplied within the agreed period (or such other period as is subsequently negotiated), the failure to supply that information in the first instance will not prevent the taxpayer’s initial voluntary disclosure from being treated as a full voluntary disclosure, on the date that the initial disclosure was made. Unprompted disclosures 36. The wording of s 141G(1) discloses four essential elements to a full voluntary disclosure. A full voluntary disclosure: • must disclose a tax shortfall; and • must disclose all the details of the tax shortfall; and • must disclose something to the Commissioner; and • must be made voluntarily. All these elements must be present before the Commissioner will form an opinion that what has been disclosed by a taxpayer amounts to a full voluntary disclosure. 37. Many disclosures made to the Commissioner are unprompted. That is, they are not made as a consequence of the Commissioner first contacting the taxpayer; often they arise because the taxpayer notices an error or omission in a tax return that has been filed and proactively contacts Inland Revenue (often by telephoning one of the department’s contact centres) to have it corrected 8 . 38. Some of these unprompted disclosures will not be liable to a shortfall penalty. In this circumstance, the fact that the disclosure is accepted as being a full voluntary disclosure is moot as there will be no reduction in the amount of a shortfall penalty that needs to be considered. 8 Note that s 113A also allows taxpayers to self-correct some low value errors in a subsequent return. Discussion on this can be found in SPS 16/01 Requests to amend assessments (at \[86\]). Where the disclosure is treated as a full voluntary disclosure, then if the unprompted disclosure attracts the imposition of a shortfall penalty, because there has been no relevant prior contact by the Commissioner the voluntary disclosure will be treated as a pre-notification disclosure and the appropriate voluntary disclosure reduction applied. When an unprompted disclosure is made, then as long as the taxpayer provides all the details of the tax shortfall (per \[32\] and \[33\] above), the Commissioner accepts that all the essential elements of a voluntary disclosure will have been met; that is, the disclosure has been made “voluntarily” and “discloses” a tax shortfall that the taxpayer believes that the Commissioner is not aware of. As long as all the details of the tax shortfall are provided, the Commissioner accepts that a full voluntary disclosure has been made by the taxpayer. 8 UNCLASSIFIED A voluntary disclosure must disclose a tax shortfall 39. A shortfall penalty is applied to a “tax shortfall”. A tax shortfall is defined by s 3(1) as being the difference between the tax effect of the tax position taken by a taxpayer and the correct tax position, where that difference results in an increase in the tax payable by the taxpayer (or a decrease in a tax benefit). 40. In making a voluntary disclosure, a taxpayer is disclosing to the Commissioner a tax position that the taxpayer now believes to be incorrect and requesting that the Commissioner make an assessment that they believe is based on the correct tax position. Any discussion regarding a taxpayer’s culpability for a shortfall penalty (including any matter pertaining to a taxpayer’s perceived guilt or wrongdoing) is a matter for separate discussion between the CIR and the taxpayer. 41. For a voluntary disclosure to be effective and reduce the amount of a shortfall penalty, the Commissioner must first impose a shortfall penalty. If the Commissioner does not impose a shortfall penalty, then the fact that the disclosure of the tax shortfall has been made voluntarily can have no effect (in this regard see also \[38\] above). Where this occurs, the voluntary disclosure will simply be treated as a request to amend the relevant assessment in terms of s 113. 42. If a taxpayer purports to make a voluntary disclosure that discloses a tax position that is merely proposed or is conditional, the Commissioner will not accept that the taxpayer has made a full voluntary disclosure. A full voluntary disclosure will also not be accepted where the taxpayer supplies false or misleading information in support of the proposed tax position. Proposed tax positions 43. Given that in making a full voluntary disclosure, a taxpayer is disclosing to the Commissioner both a previously incorrect tax position and what they now believe to be the correct tax position, t here are two matters that need to be noted. Firstly, a voluntary disclosure cannot be made for a tax position that is yet to be taken. A taxpayer could not make what purports to be a voluntary disclosure, as a means of having the Commissioner give a view on a tax position that was merely being considered. Conditional disclosures 44. Secondly, it is the Commissioner’s view that a taxpayer is not able to make a voluntary disclosure on a matter that they wish to dispute. Nor will the Commissioner accept as a voluntary disclosure, a disclosure that is conditional on a particular outcome, or on the Commissioner doing (or not doing) something. This is because, given the definition of “tax shortfall” discussed above, a voluntary disclosure can only disclose a tax position that the taxpayer believes to be the correct tax position. For instance, the Commissioner would not accept as a voluntary disclosure the disclosure of a purported tax shortfall when it was the taxpayer’s intention to engage in the disputes process with the The detailed discussion that now follows considers in some depth the above four essential elements of a disclosure that are stated at \[36\] above. Given the statements at \[37\] and \[38\] regarding unprompted disclosures, this discussion is only relevant if a shortfall penalty is imposed, the disclosure is not clearly an unprompted voluntary disclosure, and/or the voluntary disclosure has not disclosed all the details of the tax shortfall (per \[32\] and \[33\] above). 9 UNCLASSIFIED Commissioner once the relevant assessment had been made on the basis that the new tax position was incorrect. 45. It is implicit in the scheme of s 141G that the taxpayer is committed to the disclosed tax position being the correct tax position. The disclosure of a tax shortfall is not a negotiation between the taxpayer and the Commissioner where the correctness of the tax position being disclosed is arguable by the taxpayer. Nor is it an opportunity for a taxpayer to make partial disclosures of the tax shortfall (for instance, making only a partial disclosure of their understated sales). Section 141G is a voluntary, “all cards on the table” approach for a taxpayer to disclose how their original tax position differs from what they now believe to be the correct tax position. Non-committal to, or non- acceptance of this correct tax position is inconsistent with the purpose of s 141G. 46. A taxpayer may make a voluntary disclosure and subsequently have a change of view as to whether the tax position disclosed is correct. This may occur, for instance, if further facts become available to the taxpayer, judicial authority is released, or the Commissioner changes her view in a public statement or ruling. If this occurs before the Commissioner makes the relevant assessment, a taxpayer can: • resile from the tax position that they took in their initial voluntary disclosure and provide a new voluntary disclosure to the Commissioner providing the full details of what they now consider to be the correct tax position (but see \[59\] below regarding the timing of any new voluntary disclosure). Where this new tax position does not disclose a tax shortfall the disclosure will be treated as a request to amend an assessment in terms of s 113. • resile from the tax position that they took in their full voluntary disclosure and revert to their original tax position. Where the Commissioner agrees with this outcome, nothing further will occur. However, if the Commissioner believes that the tax position disclosed in the voluntary disclosure is correct then the taxpayer is free to dispute any adjustment (including the imposition of a shortfall penalty) that the Commissioner subsequently makes. In this circumstance a voluntary disclosure reduction of the shortfall penalty will still be available to the taxpayer. This is based on the fact that the Commissioner accepts that the tax position disclosed in the voluntary disclosure is the correct tax position and despite resiling from it, the taxpayer did initially make a full voluntary disclosure of that tax position. • resile from the tax position that they took in their initial voluntary disclosure, but only to the extent of the quantum of the tax shortfall. This may occur, for instance, where the taxpayer and the Commissioner are unable to agree on the correct quantum of the tax shortfall. For further discussion on this matter see \[43\] – \[45\] above and \[52\] – \[53\] below. 47. Once an assessment has been made and the applicable response period for the taxpayer to issue a Notice of Proposed Adjustment has passed, a taxpayer is not able to enter into a dispute with the Commissioner 9 . A voluntary disclosure must disclose all the details of a tax shortfall 48. Disclosing all the details of a tax shortfall is known as making a full voluntary disclosure. A “full” voluntary disclosure under s 141G requires a clear statement by the taxpayer of all the details of the difference between the tax effect of the tax position taken by the taxpayer, and the correct tax position. 9 Sections 89C(c), 89D(1), 10 UNCLASSIFIED 49. The voluntary disclosure regime is predicated on the fact that under a self-assessment regime, the taxpayer has the best knowledge of their tax affairs. In order for a voluntary disclosure to be said to be a full voluntary disclosure, there is the expectation that all the details of a tax shortfall, including the monetary difference between the original tax position taken by the taxpayer and the correct tax position, should be disclosed, as well as details of how this monetary difference (the tax shortfall) was arrived at (but see \[52\] – \[53\] below). 50. Making a full voluntary disclosure will generally involve the taxpayer disclosing the following information to the Commissioner in relation to each tax shortfall (as a minimum): • sufficient details for the Commissioner to satisfactorily identify the taxpayer (name, trade name, IRD number) and confirm the taxpayer’s contact details (postal address, contact telephone number(s) and email address); and • the tax periods and tax types involved; and • an explanation as to why the tax shortfall occurred; and • sufficient detail of the tax shortfall including its amount (but see \[35\] above and\[52\] – \[53\] below for further discussion on this matter), and full details of the facts and circumstances leading to the tax shortfall so as to enable the Commissioner to make a correct assessment of the tax shortfall; and • any further information that is necessary for the Commissioner to make a correct assessment. Sufficient detail of the tax shortfall 51. To make a correct assessment, the Commissioner requires details of the amount of the tax shortfall and how this has been calculated. 52. This does not necessarily require quantification of the tax shortfall to the last dollar in every circ umstance. What is required is that the taxpayer attempts to quantify the amount of the tax shortfall to the best of their ability, given their knowledge and expertise. If the taxpayer makes little or no attempt to quantify the tax shortfall, or deliberately understates the tax shortfall, the voluntary disclosure cannot be a full voluntary disclosure. If the taxpayer is unable to quantify the exact amount of the tax shortfall, then in order to allow the disclosure to be treated as a full voluntary disclosure, there is an expectation that the taxpayer will co-operate with the Commissioner to arrive at the correct calculation of the tax shortfall within an agreed timeframe (see \[35\] for further discussion on this matter). This co-operation will also fulfil the final requirement of what constitutes a full voluntary disclosure (per \[50\] above), any further information that is necessary for the Commissioner to make a correct assessment. 53. This does not obligate the taxpayer to agree with the Commissioner in all circumstances (but see further discussion at \[43\] – \[45\] above). Where, despite the honest endeavours of both parties, agreement is unable to be reached on the exact quantum of the tax shortfall, the taxpayer is able to dispute any adjustment that the Commissioner subsequently makes, and their disclosure will be treated as a full voluntary disclosure. 11 UNCLASSIFIED The relationship between a tax shortfall and a taxpayer’s tax position 54. As already discussed (at \[39\] above), a “tax shortfall” is the difference between the tax effect of the tax position taken by a taxpayer and the correct tax position. 55. A taxpayer’s tax return is made up of a number of tax positions and an error in any one of them may lead to a tax shortfall for that tax position. A taxpayer’s tax return that contains a number of incorrect tax positions means that there may be a number of tax shortfalls that may have a shortfall penalty imposed on each of them separately. In these circumstances, a taxpayer may make a full voluntary disclosure in respect of each separate tax shortfall. If full voluntary disclosures are made in respect of some incorrect tax positions and not others, a voluntary disclosure reduction in the quantum of any shortfall penalty subsequently imposed will only be available in respect of those tax positions (and tax shortfalls) that were the subject of a full voluntary disclosure. 56. This same rationale applies to voluntary disclosures made in respect of some tax types (and not others) and/or some tax periods (and not others). If full voluntary disclosures are made in respect of some separate tax types and/or periods and not others, a voluntary disclosure reduction will only be available in respect of the tax positions (and tax shortfalls) that were the subject of a full voluntary disclosure. 57. Sometimes making a full voluntary disclosure in relation to a tax position will result in a consequential adjustment being required to another tax type. For instance, an income tax adjustment may have a consequential impact for GST purposes. In addition, a full voluntary disclosure made in relation to a tax position in one tax period may result in the same or similar adjustments being required in other tax periods. Despite the statements Example 1: Treatment of unprompted voluntary disclosure of a partial tax shortfall Peter is the owner of a popular restaurant. Peter is aware that a number of local restaurants have recently been subject to investigation by Inland Revenue. He decides that he should disclose to the Commissioner that he has not been declaring all the cash sales that are made by the restaurant. Peter will often remove amounts of cash from the till for his personal use but has not kept any record of how much has been taken over the years. He makes a voluntary disclosure to the Commissioner disclosing the nature of the understated sales, providing a rough estimate of how much he believes he has taken (and how he has calculated these takings) and makes an offer to assist the Commissioner to arrive at a more accurate figure if required. Peter is true to his word and after the Commissioner and Peter have undertaken a thorough analysis of the restaurant’s sales data, Peter and the Commissioner come to an agreement as to the likely amount of the omitted sales. On this basis the Commissioner accepted that Peter voluntarily disclosed a tax shortfall. Because Peter initially quantified the tax shortfall to the best of his ability and then assisted the Commissioner to arrive at the correct tax shortfall, his voluntary disclosure amounted to a full voluntary disclosure. As the disclosure was unprompted it was treated as a pre-notification disclosure (per box at \[37\] above). The 2 nd bullet point of \[46\], and \[53\] above provides discussion of the potential outcome should Peter and the Commissioner not be able to agree on the quantum of the tax shortfall. Because he made an unprompted voluntary disclosure, Peter received a 75% reduction on the evasion shortfall penalty that was imposed. This can be compared to the 40% reduction that would have applied if Peter had waited until he was notified of a pending investigation before making a voluntary disclosure. 12 UNCLASSIFIED made at \[55\] above, where a taxpayer initially (and inadvertently) omits to include these additional tax types/periods in their voluntary disclosures and this fact is obvious to the Commissioner, the Commissioner will advise the taxpayer of the apparent omission(s) and allow the taxpayer to include these additional facts. If this consequential alteration is made in a timely manner after the inadvertent omission is brought to the taxpayer’s attention (per \[35\] above), the initial full voluntary disclosure will continue to be treated as a full voluntary disclosure in relation to these additional facts. 58. As can be seen from the above discussion and example, the term “tax position” is able to be viewed quite narrowly and, in these circ umstances, a failure to disclose every incorrect tax position will not necessarily invalidate full voluntary disclosures that have been made for one or more of these incorrect tax positions. 59. Because separate full voluntary disclosures may be made for each of the various tax positions taken by a taxpayer in their tax returns, the timing of the making of each full voluntary disclosure may impact the level of shortfall penalty reduction available for each shortfall. For instance, a full voluntary disclosure made for a tax position before the taxpayer receives a notification of a pending investigation will attract a reduction of either 100% or 75% (depending on the type of shortfall penalty imposed). If that same taxpayer were to make a separate full voluntary disclosure in respect of a different tax position they have taken (or make a new voluntary disclosure in respect of the same tax position), and not make that disclosure until after being notified of the pending investigation ( but before the investigation had commenced), then the shortfall penalty reduction for that separate tax position and tax shortfall would be only 40%. No reduction would be available if the disclosure was made after the investigation had Example 2: Voluntary disclosures only disclose some of the tax shortfalls discovered during an investigation Carol operates a café and has been notified by the Commissioner that the department intends to carry out an investigation of her tax affairs for the 2016 income year. Before this investigation commences, Carol and her agent take the opportunity to review the café’s 2016 income tax return and discover that some private expenditure has been claimed in error as business purchases. The over-claimed expenditure is for the purchase of private food items. Carol makes a post-notification voluntary disclosure of all the details of this over-claimed expenditure. During the subsequent investigation other errors are located in the 2016 income tax return. These additional errors relate to an incorrect trading stock calculation and the use of incorrect depreciation rates for some asset types. The tax positions taken for purchases, trading stock and depreciation are all separate tax positions that result in separate tax shortfalls. The fact that a voluntary disclosure was made by Carol only for the tax position taken for purchases does not mean that this voluntary disclosure is not a full voluntary disclosure specifically for this tax position. Carol’s full voluntary disclosure in relation to business purchases initially related to income tax only. When the Commissioner pointed out to Carol that this would have a consequential effect on her GST return Carol immediately amended her initial voluntary disclosure to include this fact. This amendment was accepted by the Commissioner as part of the initial full voluntary disclosure, as it was made in a timely manner after she was advised of the consequential adjustment that was required. In this case Carol received a reduction in the shortfall penalty imposed for the over-claimed purchases (for both income tax and GST). Because they were not included in Carol’s full voluntary disclosure, no voluntary disclosure reduction was available for the shortfall penalties imposed for the other incorrect tax positions taken. 13 UNCLASSIFIED commenced. Treatment of multiple, similar tax positions 60. In some circ umstances the Commissioner is required to amalgamate a number of tax shortfalls and create one aggregated tax shortfall for which only one shortfall penalty will be imposed. This occurs because of s 141(10). This section states that if a taxpayer takes various tax positions in the same return period, that are a “similar or identical taxpayer’s tax position”, any tax shortfalls resulting from these tax positions must be aggregated and are treated as one tax shortfall. 61. Because a voluntary disclosure must contain all the details of a tax shortfall, i f a number of tax shortfalls have been aggregated by the Commissioner in terms of s 141(10), then to be effective any voluntary disclosure made by a taxpayer will need to disclose all the details of all the individual incorrect tax positions taken for the aggregated tax shortfall. A voluntary disclosure must disclose something to the Commissioner 62. As stated at \[36\] above, another essential voluntary disclosure element is that a taxpayer must “disclose” something to the Commissioner. While this term is not defined in any of the revenue Acts, the Concise Oxford English dictionary defines “disclose” in the following terms: Disclose v 1. Make (secret or new information) known... 63. The ordinary meaning of a “disclosure” emphasises that the information being imparted is “new”. It is the Commissioner’s view that, for the purpose of the voluntary disclosure regime, whether information that is being disclosed is new is judged from the taxpayer’s perspective. That is, a “disclosure” is made if the taxpayer reasonably believes that the information being disclosed is not known to the Commissioner. This is an objective test; whether the taxpayer’s belief that the Commissioner was unaware of the details of the tax shortfall at the time that it was disclosed was reasonable in all the circumstances. The Commissioner’s actual knowledge is not relevant in this context. 64. Although s 141G contemplates that it is the Commissioner’s opinion that is relevant as to whether a taxpayer has made a full voluntary disclosure, this does not mean that whether a “disclosure” has been made is tested from the Commissioner’s perspective. It simply means that it is for the Commissioner to form an opinion as to whether a disclosure of information is a “full voluntary disclosure”. Disclosures made when the Commissioner is already aware of the tax shortfall 65. For the purposes of the voluntary disclosure regime, it is the taxpayer’s knowledge when making a disclosure that requires consideration. Taxpayers should not be put into a position of having to second guess the Commissioner’s knowledge regarding a tax shortfall to gain a full voluntary disclosure reduction. 66. It is the Commissioner’s view that, if a voluntary disclosure is made by a taxpayer of a tax shortfall and the Commissioner is already aware of that tax shortfall, this will generally still amount to a “disclosure” by the taxpayer. It will not amount to a disclosure when the taxpayer, viewed objectively, was “clearly aware” that the Commissioner already knew of a tax shortfall. 67. Generally, a taxpayer will be said to be clearly aware of the C ommissioner’s knowledge of a tax shortfall if: • the Commissioner has expressly advised the taxpayer of an incorrect tax position and a tax shortfall; or • the facts and circumstances of the interactions between the taxpayer and the 14 UNCLASSIFIED Commissioner clearly indicate that it was reasonable for the taxpayer to infer that the Commissioner already knew of a tax shortfall. For the purposes of this paragraph, it is not necessary for the Commissioner to advise the taxpayer of “the” tax shortfall; that is, the exact amount of the tax shortfall. It will be sufficient for the taxpayer to be advised that the Commissioner is aware that the tax position that they have taken is incorrect and there is “a” tax shortfall. 68. This inference (that the Commissioner was aware of the tax shortfall, per \[67\] above) may include situations where there has been so much interaction between the Commissioner and the taxpayer narrowing down the tax shortfall through, for instance, repeated correspondence, interviews and information requests, that it would be reasonable for a taxpayer to infer that the Commissioner knew that there was an incorrect tax position and a tax shortfall. This represents a high bar and instances of this occurring will be highly fact specific. It is the Commissioner’s view that it will only be in rare instances that the level of interaction will be such that it would be reasonable for a taxpayer to infer that the Commissioner already knew of the incorrect tax position and a tax shortfall. Any decision to not accept a voluntary disclosure on this basis will be made by a senior officer. Example 3: Making a voluntary disclosure when Commissioner is aware of a likely tax shortfall The Commissioner has received information from Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) regarding sales of residential properties by taxpayers in the 2017 income year. The Commissioner commences a project to contact all taxpayers who have acquired and on-sold properties within a two-year timeframe. The first step in that project is to contact affected taxpayers and gain a greater understanding of the individual circumstances of each transaction. Note that this contact would not constitute a notification of a pending investigation (for further discussion on notifications see \[81\] – \[85\] and \[88\] – \[90\] below). One of the affected taxpayers is Sally. The LINZ information available to the Commissioner shows that she has sold a residential property 10 months after it was acquired, and that the property’s land transfer tax statement did not show it as being used as Sally’s family home. Sally is contacted by letter and asked to confirm the sale details and provide her explanation of the circ umstances of this transaction. Also included in this letter are details of the brightline test and the exemptions available from it. Although the Commissioner believes that it is likely that this transaction may be liable to income tax, until this further information is received that is by no means certain (it could be for instance, that the properties land transfer tax statement did not correctly claim the property as a family home, or one of the other brightline exemptions applies). Sally responds by confirming the details of the transaction and notifies the Commissioner of the tax shortfall from the sale of the property. Sally’s notification of a tax shortfall is a “disclosure” under s 141G because, although Sally is aware that the Commissioner knows of the transaction, the Commissioner has not advised her of a tax shortfall (and as a matter of fact, at this early stage the Commissioner would not be certain that a tax shortfall existed) nor does the limited interaction between Sally and Commissioner reasonably indicate to Sally that the Commissioner was aware of the tax shortfall. This can be contrasted with the example of Sally being in the business of property development. In this scenario the Commissioner may be in a position to advise Sally from the outset that the Commissioner believes that there was a tax shortfall (irrespective of the brightline test. If the Commissioner were to advise Sally of the tax shortfall in this circumstance Sally would not be in a position to make a full voluntary “disclosure”, as she would be aware that she was not disclosing anything new to the Commissioner; she would merely be confirming a tax shortfall that she knew the Commissioner was already aware of. 15 UNCLASSIFIED A voluntary disclosure must be made voluntarily 69. The final essential element of the voluntary disclosure regime (per \[36\] above) is that the disclosure must be “voluntary”. This term is not defined in any of the revenue Acts, so will take its ordinary meaning. 70. The Concise Oxford English dictionary 10 defines “voluntary” as: Voluntary adj 1 done, given, or acting of one’s own free will... This definition has been affirmed by case law. For instance, in AG v Ellis 11 t he meaning of “voluntarily” (in the context of the Customs and Inland Revenue Act 1881) was held to mean: “Voluntarily” is not used in the sense of “without consideration”, but in its ordinary sense of “freely”, “without compulsion”, and “not under any obligation”. 12 71. Bearing this definition in mind, it is the Commissioners view that a disclosure will always be made voluntarily unless a taxpayer, in making the disclosure, was acting under an obligation to do so, such that the making of the disclosure was not as a result of “acting on one’s own free will”. The Concise Oxford English dictionary defines “obligation” in the following terms: Obligation n 1. An act or course of action to which a person is morally or legally bound; the condition of being so bound... 72. Sections 17 – 17M impose legal requirements for taxpayers to disclose information to the Commissioner on request, and ss 15B(e) and (f) impose less formal obligations on taxpayers to disclose information and co-operate with the Commissioner. If the Commissioner makes either formal or informal requests for documents or information, it could be argued that any information subsequently disclosed cannot be said to have been disclosed voluntarily by the taxpayer; in the circ umstances they were under an obligation to make a disclosure. 73. Merely meeting the Commissioner’s request for information does not necessarily mean that the taxpayer could not subsequently (or additionally) “voluntarily” make a disclosure of a tax shortfall. These two acts can be mutually exclusive. Section 141G is clear that the voluntary disclosure must be of a tax shortfall. In the context of a Commissioner’s request for information, this would require the specific disclosure of a tax shortfall and not just a provision of documents and/or information more generally. For a disclosure not to have been made voluntarily in these circ umstances would require the information provided to the Commissioner to clearly show a tax shortfall, without the need for the Commissioner to undertake “further investigatory work”. In this context “further investigatory work” is limited to any further investigatory work required in order for the Commissioner to be satisfied that a correct assessment is able to be issued in respect of the tax position disclosed by the information provided. 74. Whether further investigatory work would be necessary, such that the disclosure may not be a full voluntary disclosure, will be determined on a case by case basis. It is the Commissioner’s view that this will be a high threshold and the information requested and provided would need to clearly show a tax shortfall. 75. For instance, if a taxpayer was under an obligation to supply personal bank statements and those statements showed a number of deposits, the Commissioner would not be able to state that those deposits were assessable income (and therefore disclosed a tax 10 Concise Oxford English dictionary (12 th Ed.) 11 \[1895\] 2 QB 466 12 See also Re Wilkinson, Page v Public Trustee \[1926\] Ch 842, 850 16 UNCLASSIFIED shortfall) without having to undertake further investigatory work. They could, for instance, be capital or private in nature. In this circ umstance, any disclosure made by the taxpayer relating to these deposits would be treated as having been made voluntarily. It needs to be noted that, in order to be eligible for a voluntary disclosure reduction of any subsequent shortfall penalty that was applied, the taxpayer would need to make a “full” voluntary disclosure of all of the tax shortfall in relation to the tax position in question; in the example given, the taxpayer would need to disclose all of the assessable income and not just that shown on the bank statements (see also discussion at \[49\] and \[52\] above). 76. This can be contrasted with the scenario of bank statements that showed the receipt of amounts of “interest”. In the situation where that interest had not been returned, the taxpayer could not argue that the provision of these statements amounted to a voluntary disclosure. The taxpayer was under an obligation to provide the bank statements and the statements clearly show a tax shortfall with no further investigatory work required of the Commissioner. 77. A general invitation/suggestion by the Commissioner for a taxpayer (or group of taxpayers) to consider making a voluntary disclosure cannot amount to an “obligation” being imposed on those taxpayers. Section 141G does not impose any legal obligation on taxpayers to make voluntary disclosures and so, in these circ umstances the Commissioner is merely pointing out the existence and purpose of the voluntary disclosure regime. If this type of suggestion is made to a taxpayer and that taxpayer subsequently makes a full voluntary disclosure, that disclosure will be treated as having been made voluntarily. 78. The filing of tax returns is not a voluntary act, but rather a legislative requirement imposed on taxpayers generally. Neither could the contents of these returns usually amount to a voluntary disclosure. This is because the tax return merely records the various tax positions taken by a taxpayer and therefore cannot disclose a tax shortfall as is required by s 141G. If a taxpayer wished to make a voluntary disclosure in respect of a period for which they had not filed the required return, the Commissioner would expect that return to be filed before or at the time that the voluntary disclosure was made. Example 4: Whether a disclosure is being made “voluntarily” George owns a dairy and has been notified by the Commissioner that the department intends to carry out an investigation of his tax affairs for the 2016 income year. The notification includes a request for business records. Before sending his business records to the Commissioner, George and his accountant review these records and his tax returns for the 2016 year. This review reveals that George has failed to make an allowance for groceries that he and his family have taken for their personal use. This has resulted in purchases being overstated in his income tax return, as well as errors being made in his GST returns. George then provides the business records to the Commissioner and discloses the relevant tax shortfalls. While George is involuntarily discharging an obligation to provide information to the Commissioner (his business records), the disclosure of the tax shortfalls has been made separately and voluntarily. This is because the business records, by themselves, are not capable of disclosing a tax shortfall without further investigatory work by the Commissioner. In this case George received a post-notification shortfall penalty reduction. 17 UNCLASSIFIED Related matters Reductions in shortfall penalties 79. As stated at \[21 \] above, ss 141A to 141EB impose a shortfall penalty for taking an incorrect tax position or for doing or failing to do anything described in one of these shortfall penalty provisions. Shortfall penalties are imposed on a graduating scale from 20% to 150% of the difference between the tax effect of a taxpayer’s original tax position and the correct tax position; the “tax shortfall”. An important feature of the shortfall penalties and voluntary disclosure regimes is that, once imposed on a taxpayer, shortfall penalties are reduced if the Commissioner forms the opinion that the taxpayer has made a full voluntary disclosure to the Commissioner of all the details of the tax shortfall 13 . 80. The reductions available to taxpayers that make a full voluntary disclosure are: • If the full voluntary disclosure is made before the taxpayer is first notified of a pending investigation (pre-notification disclosure), the shortfall penalty will be reduced by 100% if that shortfall penalty was initially imposed for not taking reasonable care, taking an unacceptable tax position, or for an unacceptable interpretation. All other shortfall penalties will be reduced by 75% 14 . • If the full voluntary disclosure is made after a taxpayer is first notified of an investigation, but before that investigation commences (post-notification disclosure), the shortfall penalty will be reduced by 40% 15 . • The above reductions also apply if the shortfall penalty is for a temporary tax shortfall 16 . • The amount of shortfall penalty payable by a taxpayer for not taking reasonable care, or for taking an unacceptable tax position, must not exceed $50,000 if the tax shortfall was voluntarily disclosed by the taxpayer within a specified timeframe 17 . It should be noted that this is a monetary cap rather than a reduction and that the cap only applies after all other reductions in the amount of the shortfall penalty have been taken 18 . Notification and commencement of an investigation 81. As stated above, crucial to deciding the level of reduction that is available to a taxpayer that makes a voluntary disclosure to the Commissioner is whether that voluntary disclosure qualifies as a pre- or post-notification disclosure. In turn, this is dependent on the taxpayer being “notified” that an investigation is either pending or has commenced. 82. Inland Revenue will notify a taxpayer when they are about to be investigated and/or advise them when an investigation has commenced 19 . This notification will specifically use the word “audit” or “investigation”. 83. This notification will be in writing and communicated by post, fax, personal delivery or by electronic means. The notice will inform the taxpayer of the tax periods and tax types that are being investigated. If the scope of an investigation widens during that investigation and other tax types or periods are to be reviewed, the taxpayer will be 13 See \[19\] for details of other circumstances that may give rise to a reduction in the level of shortfall penalty imposed by the Commissioner 14 Section 141G(3) 15 Section 141G(3)(b) 16 Section 141J 17 Section 141JAA 18 Interpretation Statement IS0053 Shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care and Interpretation Statement IS0055 Shortfall penalty – unacceptable interpretation and unacceptable tax position. Included in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 17 No 9 (November 2005). See www.ird.govt.nz (search term: IS0053) 19 Section 141G(4) sets out who the Commissioner may notify of a pending audit or investigation. See Appendix attached to this SPS. 18 UNCLASSIFIED promptly notified in writing of this change. Each party to an investigation will be separately notified. 84. An investigation commences at the earlier of:  the end of the first interview; and  the time when an officer inspects information and the taxpayer is notified in writing of the inspection 20 . Until the notification of inspection is given or the first interview has ended, a taxpayer will still qualify for a post-notification voluntary disclosure reduction. 85. Further information regarding these matters may be found in Standard Practice Statement SPS 16/03 Notification of a pending audit or investigation 21 . When does a taxpayer make a full voluntary disclosure? 86. For a disclosure to be “full”, all information relating to the tax shortfall must be provided. The timing of when a disclosure can be accepted as being “full” is when all the details relating to that tax shortfall have been received by the Commissioner. For instance, if the initial details of a tax shortfall are disclosed before the taxpayer receives the notification of a pending investigation, but the final details of that tax shortfall are not supplied to the Commissioner until after the taxpayer receives that notification, the “full” disclosure has occurred after the notification of the pending investigation and would only qualify for a post-notification disclosure reduction. 87. Exceptions arise where, per \[35\] and \[ 52\] above, the taxpayer is assisting the Commissioner to make a final quantification of the tax shortfall, or per \[56\] above, when the taxpayer is in the process of confirming a consequential alteration to their initial voluntary disclosure. Where these occur, and the agreed timeframes are adhered to, the Commissioner will accept that the full voluntary disclosure was made on the date of the initial voluntary disclosure. Disclosures for another tax type, another tax period or another entity 88. As stated at \[83\] above, the notification of a pending investigation will advise the taxpayer of the tax periods and tax types that are to be investigated. If a taxpayer subsequently makes a full voluntary disclosure that is for a tax shortfall in a tax period or to a tax type that is not covered by this notification, that full voluntary disclosure will qualify as a pre-notification voluntary disclosure. 89. Similarly, if a full voluntary disclosure is made on behalf of an entity not subject to a notice of pending investigation (for instance, another company in a group of companies), that full voluntary disclosure will be treated as a pre-notification voluntary disclosure. Note however that when a company has a branch, the branch and company are considered to have been notified of a pending investigation at the same time. This is because the branch is not a separate entity to the company. 90. It is not uncommon for an investigation to be extended beyond the scope of that stated in the original notification of a pending investigation to include, for instance, additional revenue types, tax periods or entities. As stated at \[83 \] above, if this occurs, the Commissioner will promptly notify the taxpayer in writing of the intention to extend the investigation and the scope of this extension. For the purposes of the voluntary disclosure regime this additional notification will be treated as the first notification of a 20 Section 141G(5) 21 This may be found at www.ird.govt.nz (search term: 16/03) 19 UNCLASSIFIED pending investigation for, as appropriate, the additional revenue(s), tax period(s) or entities stated in the notification. Voluntary disclosures and subsequent prosecution action 91. If a taxpayer makes a full voluntary disclosure before they are first notified of a pending investigation, the Commissioner’s usual practice is not to prosecute those taxpayers. The decision not to prosecute in such cases is an exercise of the prosecutorial discretion on the basis that any subsequent prosecution action in this circumstance would not aid voluntary compliance. While it may be the Commissioner’s usual practice not to prosecute in such circumstances, the Commissioner may not abdicate the exercise of the prosecutorial discretion by a pre-emptive blanket policy of not prosecuting in every case of a pre-notification voluntary disclosure 22 . However, the Commissioner may, where there are proper authorised alternatives to prosecution, decide that prosecution is not justified in the public interest 23 . This is likely to be the case where an appropriate shortfall penalty will ensure that the integrity of the tax system is not undermined. 92. In circ umstances where the Commissioner forms the view that a taxpayer’s actions or omissions are such that non-prosecution could lead to voluntary compliance more generally being undermined, the Commissioner may still proceed with that subsequent prosecution action. For instance, this may occur when the taxpayer has a history of serious non-compliance such that a decision not to prosecute would suggest that the integrity of the tax system in general, and voluntary compliance in particular, would be undermined; for example, where a taxpayer has been guilty of serious tax evasion in the past and, despite shortfall penalties being imposed at that time, further instances of evasion had been identified. Simply because a full voluntary disclosure had been received should not stand in the way of the Commissioner prosecuting when the previous imposition of other penalties have had little or no effect on the taxpayer’s subsequent compliance behaviour. A decision to prosecute in these circumstances will be an exceptionally rare occurrence, limited to serious offences, and will require the approval of a very senior officer. 93. Prosecution action may be considered by the Commissioner when a taxpayer does not make a full voluntary disclosure of a tax shortfall (see \[50\] – \[57\] for further discussion) before they are first notified of a pending investigation or when a taxpayer makes a full voluntary disclosure after they have been notified of a pending investigation. Challenge rights 94. After receiving and fully considering a disclosure received from a taxpayer, the Commissioner may form the opinion that the taxpayer has not provided a “full voluntary disclosure” as required by s 141G(1), or that a disclosure was not made before either the taxpayer was first notified of a pending investigation (s 141G(1)(a)) or before the investigation commenced (s 141G(1)(b)). If such an opinion is formed, the Commissioner may not provide the taxpayer with the level of reduction in a shortfall penalty to which the taxpayer believes they are entitled. 95. In these circ umstances the taxpayer can challenge the amount of the shortfall penalty, including the fact that they may disagree with the level of reduction provided by the Commissioner. 22 See Po lynesian Spa Ltd v Osborne \[2005\] NZAR 408 (HC) at \[69\], approved in Osborne v Worksafe \[2017\] NZCA 11 at \[35\] 23 Solicitor-General’s Prosecution Guidelines, http://www.crownlaw.govt.nz/publications/prosecution-guidelines/ at 5.9.13 20 UNCLASSIFIED Reconsideration and complaint rights 96. If a taxpayer is concerned that their circumstances have not been given proper consideration, they should raise their concern with the staff member that considered their disclosure and ask for the decision to be reviewed by a more senior officer. 97.

1 UNCLASSIFIED Standard practice statement SPS 19/03 Income equalisation deposits and refunds Introduction Standard practice statements describe how the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) will exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. This Statement sets out the Commissioner’s practice regarding the statutory powers to accept income equalisation deposits for a tax year outside the specified period, and to accept refund applications for a tax year outside the specified period. Unless specified otherwise, all legislative references in this Statement refer to the Income Tax Act 2007 (“ITA”). Application This Statement applies from 4 April 2019 and replaces SPS 17/01 Income equalisation deposits and refunds issued in August 2017. The Statement applies to income equalisation deposits and refunds made under: • the main income equalisation scheme (under ss EH 3 to EH 36), and • the thinning operations income equalisation scheme (under ss EH 63 to EH 79). However, it does not apply to: • the adverse event income equalisation scheme (under ss EH 37 to EH 62) – repealed effective for income years beginning after 18/03/2019. • refunds from the main income equalisation account to: o persons who retire, die or are made bankrupt (under ss EH 17 to EH 24), or o companies that are put into liquidation (under ss EH 25 and EH 26) • refunds from the thinning operations income equalisation account to companies that carry on a forestry business in New Zealand and are put into liquidation (under ss EH 75 and EH 76). ~ Inland Revenue ~ ~ Te Tari Taake 2 UNCLASSIFIED Standard Practice Summary Deposits 1. Eligible taxpayers may make a deposit into the applicable income equalisation scheme. 2. To be deductible in an accounting year, the deposit must be received by the Commissioner: • within the accounting year; • within the specified period after the end of the accounting year; or • within a time after the end of the specified period for an accounting year that the Commissioner allows in a case or class of cases (a “late deposit”). 3. The taxpayer must, at the time the deposit is made, notify the Commissioner if the deposit is not for the current accounting year. 4. The Commissioner will accept a late deposit where the deposit is provided by the earlier of: • one month from the date the taxpayer’s income tax return was filed for an accounting year; • one month from the taxpayer’s income tax return due date for an accounting year. 5. In exceptional circumstances, the Commissioner will extend her discretion beyond the timeframe set out in \[8\]. This is discussed in more detail at \[91\] to \[102\]. 6. The Commissioner must consider every request to allow a late deposit on a case- by-case basis and will decide whether to accept a deposit for the nominated accounting year after careful consideration of the taxpayer’s particular circumstances. 7. Where the Commissioner declines to allow a late deposit for the accounting year nominated by the taxpayer, the deposit may still be applied to the accounting year the deposit was made in. In this situation, the Commissioner will first contact the taxpayer to give them the option of continuing with the deposit or having it returned to them. 8. The taxpayer is allowed a deduction for a deposit made into the applicable income equalisation scheme for the accounting year that was set out in the taxpayer’s notice, provided it is accepted by the Commissioner for the relevant accounting year. If the taxpayer’s income tax return was filed before the deposit was made, the Commissioner will reassess the return to include the deduction. Refunds 9. An eligible taxpayer may apply for a refund from the applicable income equalisation scheme. 3 UNCLASSIFIED 10. A deposit cannot generally be refunded until it has been in the scheme for one year unless specific circumstances apply. However, the Commissioner may allow an early refund where she is satisfied that the early refund is required for a purpose a refund should be given for. 11. A refund within the one-year period can only be allowed when certain legislative criteria are met. The criteria discussed in this statement are: • To enable the taxpayer to undertake planned development work; • To enable the taxpayer to buy livestock or replacement livestock; • To avoid them suffering serious hardship; • To do anything else that the Commissioner determines in a case or class of case is a purpose for which a refund should be given. 12. In every case the taxpayer is required to provide evidence to support the reason for the early refund. 13. A refund from the scheme is income in the income year in which the Commissioner receives the application except where the taxpayer chooses the income to be allocated to an accounting year. 14. To be allocated as income in an accounting year, the application must be received by the Commissioner: • within the accounting year; or • within the specified period after the end of an accounting year; or • within a time after the end of the specified period for an accounting year that the Commissioner allows in a case or class of cases (a “late application”). 15. If the application for a refund is made within or after the specified period for an accounting year the taxpayer must, at the time of applying for the refund, notify the Commissioner that they elect the refund be allocated as income to that accounting year. 16. The Commissioner will accept a late application where the application is received by the earlier of: • one month from the date the taxpayer’s income tax return was filed for an accounting year; or • one month from the taxpayer’s income tax return due date for an accounting year. 17. In exceptional circumstances, the Commissioner will extend her discretion to accept a late application beyond the timeframe set out in \[16\]. This is discussed in more detail at \[91\] to \[102\]. 18. The Commissioner must consider every request to allow a late application on a case-by-case basis and decide whether to allow the refund for the requested accounting year after careful consideration of the taxpayer’s particular circumstances. 4 UNCLASSIFIED 19. Where the Commissioner declines a late application for the accounting year elected by the taxpayer, the refund may still be applied to the accounting year the application was made in. In this situation, the Commissioner will first contact the taxpayer to give them the option of continuing with or withdrawing the application for a refund. 20. The taxpayer must return the income equalisation refund as income in the accounting year nominated in the taxpayer’s notice, provided it is accepted by the Commissioner for the relevant accounting year. If the taxpayer’s income tax return was filed before the application was made, the Commissioner will reassess the return to include the income equalisation refund as income. 21. The Commissioner must issue a refund of a deposit that is in a person’s income equalisation account at the end of five years after the end of the accounting year the deposit was made for. Background 22. The income equalisation scheme was introduced in 1965. At the time of introduction of the scheme it was stated that it would: • enable farmers to iron out rates of tax due to rises and falls in income; • encourage farmers to put aside part of their income in good years and to use this money for farm development in years when farm income falls; • help to remove a cause of inflation and therefore help to maintain a steadier rate of economic growth. 23. The scheme enables eligible taxpayers to: • make income equalisation deposits with the Commissioner; and • claim a deduction against their income in the accounting year; or • the deposit is made in, or • requested by the taxpayer in their notice to the Commissioner when they make a deposit, provided the request is accepted by the Commissioner. 24. When a refund is made from the scheme, the amount is included as part of the taxpayer’s income in the accounting year: • in which the application for the refund is received by the Commissioner; or • elected by the taxpayer. 25. Since the implementation of the scheme use-of-money interest has been introduced. Farmers are not usually in a position to know their final financial position until after liability for use-of-money interest applies. Also, many farmers do not receive the bulk of their income until near the end of their tax year, so they have not had the use of that money throughout the year. The income equalisation scheme provides an avenue for farmers to limit their exposure to use-of-money interest. 5 UNCLASSIFIED Detailed discussion Meanings The following meanings describe terms used in this statement. Accounting year 26. “Accounting year” is defined under s YA 1 and means a tax year or another 12- month period that ends with the taxpayer’s balance date. 27. The definition of “accounting year” for a company also includes: • a period, shorter than twelve months, that is the period accounts are prepared for, including under the international tax rules, because of the formation of the company or the termination of the company’s existence; and • a period, shorter or longer than twelve months, that is the period accounts are prepared for, including under the international tax rules, because of the company or a person adopting a new accounting balance date under ss EX 25 or EX 69. Eligible taxpayers 28. “Eligible taxpayers” may reduce their net income for a tax year by making an income equalisation deposit into the applicable income equalisation scheme with the Commissioner pursuant to s EH 1(1). 29. Section EH 3(1) provides that eligible taxpayers in respect of the main income equalisation scheme are: • persons who carry on a farming or agricultural business on land in New Zealand; or • persons who carry on a fishing business; or • persons who derive income from forestry, but are not a company, public authority, Māori authority, or an unincorporated body. 30. Section EH 63(1) provides that eligible taxpayers for the thinning operations income equalisation scheme are companies that carry on a forestry business on land in New Zealand and derive income from carrying out thinning operations on the land. 31. The thinning operations income equalisation scheme does not apply to natural persons. Serious hardship 32. The term “serious hardship” is not defined in the legislation. Although the ordinary meaning of the words “serious” and hardship” would require that there is a degree of suffering or privation that is relatively significant in the circumstances, the historical background to the scheme suggests that “serious hardship” should not be an unduly high standard to satisfy. 33. However, a taxpayer must still show evidence that an early refund would be used to avoid them suffering serious hardship. 6 UNCLASSIFIED 34. This would include a situation where, if the refund were not made, the future farming operation may be seriously jeopardised, or the farmer and their family may suffer significant hardship. Examples of this could include the need to dispose of breeding stock or being unable to undertake essential farm maintenance. Note that the Commissioner considers that deferring the application of fertiliser for one year would not seriously jeopardise future farming operations. 35. Factors likely to count against an early refund to avoid serious hardship are: • There are alternative and more traditional sources of credit available; or • The early refund, or the saving as a result of an early refund, will effectively be spent on things other than maintaining the farming operations or keeping debt lower (buy a new vehicle or spending more to upgrade machinery than is reasonable, for instance). Specified period 36. “Specified period” is defined for the purposes of the applicable income equalisation schemes under ss EH 36, EH 79 and YA 1 and means the shorter of: • the period of six months after the end of the accounting year that corresponds to the tax year; • the period from the end of the accounting year that corresponds to the tax year to the date one month after the date the person must, under s 37 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, file their return of income for the accounting year that corresponds to the tax year. Examples Calculating the specified period with an extension of time arrangement In the case of a taxpayer with a balance date of 30 June 2018 and an extension of time arrangement to file their income tax return by 31 March 2019, the specified period is the shorter of: • the period of six months after the end of the accounting year that corresponds to the tax year—1 July 2018 to 31 December 2018 • the period from the end of the accounting year to one month after the tax return is due—1 July 2018 to 30 April 2019. The specified period ends on 31 December 2018. Calculating the specified period without an extension of time arrangement In the case of a taxpayer with a balance date of 30 June 2018 without an extension of time arrangement, the specified period is the shorter of: • the period of six months after the end of the accounting year that corresponds to the tax year—1 July 2018 to 31 December 2018 • the period from the end of the accounting year to one month after the tax return is due—1 July 2018 to 7 November 2018. The specified period ends on 7 November 2018. 7 UNCLASSIFIED Main income equalisation scheme Section EH 4 – Deposit 37. The minimum deposit is $200. Deposit amounts cannot exceed a taxpayer’s net income derived from carrying out their farming or agricultural, fishing or forestry activity in the accounting year the deposit is accepted. Any interest received from lending or investment activities will not form part of the deposit. 38. Where the net profit has been paid as a salary to trust beneficiaries or company shareholders, the Commissioner is not likely to reassess the taxpayer’s income tax return and amend the salary paid to an income equalisation deposit. She will apply her discretion in the manner set out in SPS 18/01: Retrospective adjustments to salaries paid to shareholder-employees and SPS 16/01: Requests to amend assessments. 39. An eligible taxpayer may make a deposit into the main income equalisation scheme for an accounting year at any time during the accounting year or within the specified period for the accounting year. 40. The Commissioner has neither the ability nor the discretion under the Act to accept an early deposit into the main income equalisation scheme. 41. Section EH 4(4)(c) gives the Commissioner the discretion to accept a late deposit, ie, a deposit made within a time after the end of the specified period for an accounting year in a case or class of cases allowed by the Commissioner. Refer to \[91\] to \[102\] for discussion on how the Commissioner will apply this discretion. 42. If the deposit is made within or after the specified period for an accounting year the taxpayer must, at the time of making the deposit, notify the Commissioner that the deposit is for that accounting year. 43. Where the Commissioner does not accept a late deposit, it may, subject to consultation with the taxpayer, be applied to the accounting year in which the deposit was made. 44. Sections DQ 1 and EH 7 provide that the taxpayer can claim a deduction for the amount of the deposit in the applicable accounting year. 45. No deduction is allowed until the deposit is physically received and accepted by the Commissioner. If this occurs after the taxpayer’s income tax return has been filed, the Commissioner will reassess the return to allow the deduction. Section EH 13 – Refund on request 46. A taxpayer may apply in writing for a refund from the main income equalisation scheme under s EH 13. If the taxpayer wants a refund from the main income equalisation scheme and none of the other relevant refund provisions apply the Commissioner must refund the amount applied for. This is to the extent to which the refund can be made up of one or more deposits that have been in the main income equalisation scheme for at least one year. 47. Section EH 14 provides that a refund under s EH 13 is allocated as income to the accounting year the Commissioner receives the application for the refund, unless either of these two situations apply: 8 UNCLASSIFIED • The application is received within the specified period for an accounting year and the taxpayer chooses that the refund is to be treated as income in the accounting year the specified period relates to. In this case the refund is allocated as income to the accounting year the specified period relates to. • A late application is received. That is: o the application is received within a longer period after the end of the specified period for an accounting year that is allowed by the Commissioner in a case or class of cases; and o the taxpayer chooses that the refund be treated as income in the accounting year the longer period relates to. In this case the refund is allocated as income to the accounting year nominated by the taxpayer. Refer to \[91\] to \[102\] for discussion on how the Commissioner will apply this discretion. 48. Where the Commissioner does not accept a late application, the refund may, subject to consultation with the taxpayer, be allocated to the accounting year the application was made in. 49. Sections CB 27 and EH 14 provide that the taxpayer must return the refund as income in the applicable accounting year. 50. The refund may not be allocated as income to an accounting year until the application for a refund is physically received and accepted by the Commissioner. If this occurs after the taxpayer’s income tax return has been filed, the Commissioner will reassess the return to allocate the refund as income. Section EH 15 – Refund for development or recovery 51. A taxpayer may apply, in writing, for an early refund from the main income equalisation scheme in specific circumstances under s EH 15. 52. The Commissioner must refund an amount that has been in the main income equalisation scheme for more than six months to an eligible taxpayer to enable them to: • undertake planned development or maintenance work; or • buy, immediately after the refund is given, livestock for use in their farming business (other than to replace livestock disposed of or lost as a result of a self-assessed adverse event). 53. The Commissioner must refund an amount regardless of the length of time it has been in the main income equalisation scheme to an eligible taxpayer to enable them to: • buy, immediately after the refund is given, livestock for use in their farming business to replace livestock replaced or lost as a result of a self-assessed adverse event; • avoid suffering serious hardship; • do anything else the Commissioner determines, in a case or class of cases, is a purpose for which a refund should be given. 9 UNCLASSIFIED 54. The Commissioner has the discretion to allow a refund from the main income equalisation scheme, regardless of the length of time the deposits have been in the account, for the taxpayer to do anything the Commissioner determines in a case or class of cases is a purpose for which a refund should be given. Refer to \[91\] to \[102\] for discussion on how the Commissioner will apply this discretion. 55. If refund requests are made on the grounds that they will be used to avoid serious hardship, the taxpayer will need to be able to explain to the Commissioner how the refund will be applied to avoid serious hardship. 56. A forecast reduction in income as part of the normal fluctuations in prices which primary producers would expect to experience from time-to-time would not be enough, on its own, to meet the criteria. Although some degree of “hardship” may be on the horizon, the taxpayer will need to be able to show how that event will, or is likely to, lead to them experiencing “serious hardship”. 57. It may be hard to show where money is deposited into the scheme and then asked to be withdrawn at the same time or shortly after. In that situation, the financial impact of an early withdrawal will only be the tax deferral and cash-flow benefits. 58. Section EH 16 of the Act provides that a refund under s EH 15 is allocated to the accounting year the Commissioner receives the application for the refund in, unless either of these two situations apply: • The application is received within the specified period for an accounting year and the taxpayer chooses that the refund is to be treated as income in the accounting year the specified period relates to. In this case the refund is allocated as income to the accounting year the specified period relates to. • A late application is received. That is: o the application is received within a longer period after the end of the specified period for an accounting year that is allowed by the Commissioner in a case or class of cases, and o the taxpayer chooses that the refund be treated as income in the accounting year the longer period relates to. In this case the refund is allocated as income to the accounting year nominated by the taxpayer. Refer to \[91\] to \[102\] for discussion on how the Commissioner will apply this discretion. 59. Where the Commissioner does not accept the late application, the refund may, subject to consultation with the taxpayer, be allocated to the accounting year the application was made in. 60. Sections CB 27 and EH 16 provide that the taxpayer must return the refund as income in the applicable accounting year. 61. The refund may not be allocated as income to an accounting year until the application for a refund is physically received and accepted by the Commissioner. If this occurs after the taxpayer’s income tax return has been filed, the Commissioner will reassess the return to allocate the refund as income. 10 UNCLASSIFIED Thinning operations income equalisation scheme Section EH 64 – Deposit 62. The minimum deposit is $200. Deposit amounts cannot exceed a taxpayer’s net income derived from carrying out thinning operations in the accounting year the deposit is accepted. Any interest received from lending or investment activities will not form part of the deposit. 63. Where the net profit has been paid as a salary to company shareholders, the Commissioner is not likely to reassess the company’s income tax return and amend the salary paid to an income equalisation deposit. She will apply her discretion in the manner set out in SPS 18/01: Retrospective adjustments to salaries paid to shareholder-employees and SPS 16/01: Requests to amend assessments. 64. An eligible taxpayer may make a deposit into the thinning operations income equalisation scheme for an accounting year at any time during the accounting year or within the specified period for the accounting year. 65. Section EH 64(4)(c) allows the Commissioner to accept a late deposit, ie, a deposit made within a time after the end of the specified period for an accounting year in a case or class of cases allowed by the Commissioner. Refer to \[91\] to \[102\] for discussion on how the Commissioner will apply this discretion. 66. If the taxpayer makes the deposit within or after the specified period the taxpayer must, at the time of making the deposit, notify the Commissioner that the deposit is for that accounting year. 67. Where the Commissioner does not accept a late deposit, it may, subject to consultation with the taxpayer, be applied to the accounting year the deposit was made in. 68. Sections DQ 3 and EH 67 provide that the taxpayer can claim a deduction for the amount of the deposit in the accounting year. 69. No deduction is allowed until the deposit is physically received and accepted by the Commissioner. If this occurs after the taxpayer’s income tax return has been filed, the Commissioner will reassess the return to allow the deduction. Section EH 71 – Refund on request 70. A taxpayer may apply, in writing, for a refund from the thinning operations income equalisation scheme under s EH 71. If the taxpayer wants a refund of some or all of the amount in the scheme, and none of the other relevant refund provisions in the Act apply, the Commissioner must refund the amount applied for. This is to the extent the refund can be made up of one or more deposits that have been in the scheme for at least one year. 71. Section EH 72 provides that a refund under s EH 71 is allocated to the accounting year the Commissioner receives the application for the refund in, unless either of these two situations apply: • The application is received within the specified period for an accounting year and the taxpayer chooses that the refund is to be treated as income in the accounting year the specified period relates to. In this case the refund is allocated as income to the accounting year the specified period relates to. 11 UNCLASSIFIED • A late application is received. That is: o the application is received within a longer period after the end of the specified period for an accounting year that is allowed by the Commissioner in a case or class of cases, and o the taxpayer chooses that the refund be treated as income in the accounting year to which the longer period relates, in which case the refund is allocated as income to the accounting year nominated by the taxpayer (refer to \[91\] to \[102\] for discussion on how the Commissioner will apply this discretion). 72. Where the Commissioner does not accept a late application, the refund may, subject to consultation with the taxpayer, be allocated to the accounting year in which the application was made. 73. Sections CB 27 and EH 72 provide that the taxpayer must return the refund as income in the applicable accounting year. 74. The refund may not be allocated as income to an accounting year until the application for a refund is physically received and accepted by the Commissioner. If this occurs after the taxpayer’s income tax return has been filed, the Commissioner will reassess the return to allocate the refund as income. Section EH 73 – Refund for development or recovery 75. A taxpayer may apply, in writing, for an early refund from the thinning operations income equalisation scheme in specific circumstances under s EH 73: • The Commissioner must refund an amount that has been in the scheme for more than six months to an eligible taxpayer to enable them to undertake planned development or maintenance work for their forestry business. • The Commissioner must refund an amount regardless of the length of time it has been in the scheme to an eligible taxpayer to enable them to: o avoid suffering serious hardship; or o do anything else the Commissioner determines, in a case or class of cases, is a purpose a refund should be given for. 76. If requests for refunds made on the grounds that they will be used to avoid serious hardship, the taxpayer will need to be able to explain to the Commissioner how the refund will be applied to avoid serious hardship. 77. That may be hard to show where money is deposited and a refund request is made at the same time or shortly after. In that situation the financial impact will only be the tax deferral and cash-flow benefits. 78. The Commissioner has the discretion to allow a refund from the thinning operations income equalisation scheme, regardless of the length of time the deposits have been in the account, for the taxpayer to do anything the Commissioner determines in a case or class of cases is a purpose for which a refund should be given. Refer to \[91\] to \[102\] for discussion on how the Commissioner will apply this discretion. 12 UNCLASSIFIED 79. Section EH 74 provides that a refund under s EH 73 is allocated to the accounting year in which the Commissioner receives the application for the refund, unless either of these two situations apply: • The application is received within the specified period for an accounting year and the taxpayer chooses that the refund is to be treated as income in the accounting year the specified period relates to. In this case the refund is allocated as income to the accounting year the specified period relates to. • A late application is received. That is: o the application is received within a longer period after the end of the specified period for an accounting year that is allowed by the Commissioner in a case or class of cases, and o the taxpayer chooses that the refund be treated as income in the accounting year the longer period relates to. In this case the refund is allocated as income to the accounting year nominated by the taxpayer. Refer to \[91\] to \[102\] for discussion on how the Commissioner will apply this discretion. 80. Where the Commissioner does not accept a late application, the refund may, subject to consultation with the taxpayer, be applied to the accounting year in which the application was made. 81. Sections CB 27 and EH 74 provide that the taxpayer must return the refund as income in the applicable accounting year. 82. The refund may not be allocated as income to an accounting year until the application for a refund is physically received and accepted by the Commissioner. If this occurs after the taxpayer’s income tax return has been filed, the Commissioner will reassess the return to allocate the refund as income. Commissioner’s discretion – “a case or class of cases” 83. As stated above, the Commissioner has the discretion to accept a deposit into or an application for a refund from the applicable income equalisation scheme after the specified period for an accounting year. Relevant case law 84. The Courts have established some principles around the exercise of a statutory discretion that require the Commissioner to act reasonably in applying her discretion and consider the merits of the taxpayer’s particular circumstances and explanation. 85. The Commissioner must exercise her discretion reasonably, as stated by Lord Wrenbury in Roberts v Hopwood \[1925\] AC 578, as follows: A person in whom is vested a discretion must exercise his discretion upon reasonable grounds. A discretion does not empower a man to do what he likes merely because he is minded to do so – he must in the exercise of his discretion do not what he likes but what he ought. In other words, he must, by the use of his reason, ascertain and follow the course which reason directs. He must act reasonably. 86. When exercising her discretion, the Commissioner must consider each case on its own merits. This is supported by the Court of Appeal’s decision in Lawton v 13 UNCLASSIFIED Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2003\] 2 NZLR 48 in which the Court held that the Commissioner had not properly exercised his discretion in respect of s 30(2) of the Income Tax Act 1976, which provided that the Commissioner may accept a late objection, on the basis that there had been a failure to consider and properly weigh the merits of the taxpayer’s late objection. 87. Justice Glazebrook, delivering the unanimous judgment of the Court, quoted the Court of Appeal’s previous decision in CIR v Wilson (1976) 17 NZTC 12,512: ... the merits of a proposed objection must be considered unless the explanation for the lateness of the objection is so inadequate that this is unnecessary. 88. The Court also found that the taxpayer had given a full and credible explanation for the lateness of the objection. Justice Glazebrook stated: ... In such a case, unless this explanation was palpably untrue or quite unjustified, it would be rare for the explanation to be deemed so inadequate that the merits need not be examined. 89. Another principle established by the Court is that the Commissioner may make policies, but the policies cannot be overly rigid. This is highlighted in Gisborne Mills Ltd v CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,194. Justice Robertson found that the Commissioner is required to weigh the particular circumstances which exist in each individual case, rather than adhere to policy: The test is whether, by the rigid and inflexible application of policy, there has been a reasoned exercise of the discretion ... In my view, however the discretion required him to weigh the particular circumstances which existed ... In as much as none of these exceptional matters appear to have been addressed because of the preoccupation with the policy issue, I am forced to the conclusion that there has been a failure by the Commissioner to exercise the discretion which Parliament has given him. ... I find therefore, that the respondent has abused his powers by refusing to consider the specific circumstances of this case. What is reasonable? 90. What needs to be considered is how the Commissioner should exercise her discretion, with reference to the principles established by the Courts. Late deposits and applications for a refund 91. In most instances, the taxpayer’s financial position for an accounting year will not be known until the taxpayer’s set of accounts and tax return have been completed. At this point, the decision on whether to make a deposit to the applicable income equalisation scheme, and of how much, may be made. 92. So an eligible taxpayer could reasonably be expected to make a deposit into or request a refund from the applicable income equalisation scheme for a particular accounting year at the time of filing their tax return, provided the tax return is filed by the due date. 93. However, it may not be possible or practicable for the deposit or application to be sent to the Commissioner with the tax return. It may also take a tax agent a period of time to arrange for the deposit or application for a refund to be sent to Inland Revenue. So eligible taxpayers should be allowed a reasonable period of time after either: 14 UNCLASSIFIED • the taxpayer’s income tax return due date, or • the date the taxpayer’s income tax return was filed on to forward the deposit or application to Inland Revenue. 94. The Commissioner considers it is reasonable to apply her discretion and accept late deposits and late applications for a refund in relation to the applicable income equalisation scheme by the earlier of: • one month from the date of filing the tax return for that accounting year; and • one month from the date the tax return for that accounting year is due to be filed. 95. If the specified period for an accounting year is longer than the extended timeframe set out in \[94\] the taxpayer may still make the deposit or application for a refund within the specified period. The Commissioner is not likely to further extend this to provide a late deposit or late application for a refund unless exceptional circumstances apply. Refer \[91\] to \[102\] for discussion of exceptional circumstances. 96. Taxpayers without a tax agent who require an extension of time to file their income tax return should refer to SPS 09/03: Extension of time applications from taxpayers without tax agents. Examples Making a late deposit with an extension of time arrangement A taxpayer has a tax agent. The taxpayer has a balance date of 31 March. The taxpayer’s income tax return due date for the 2018 accounting year is 31 March 2019, incorporating an extension of time arrangement. The taxpayer’s income tax return was filed on 31 October 2018. The specified period for making deposits into the applicable income equalisation scheme ends on 30 September 2018, which is the shorter of: • the period of six months after the end of the accounting year that corresponds to the tax year—1 April 2018 to 30 September 2018 • the period from the end of the accounting year to one month after the tax return is due—1 April 2018 to 30 April 2019. For a deposit to be accepted for the 2018 accounting year, the taxpayer must make the deposit within the discretionary extended timeframe, ie, by 30 November 2018, which is the earlier of: • one month from the date of filing the tax return for that accounting year— 30 November 2018 • one month from the date that the tax return for that accounting year is due to be filed—30 April 2019. 15 UNCLASSIFIED In the same scenario, if the taxpayer’s income tax return was filed on 1 May 2019, a deposit would need to be paid by 30 April 2019, which is the earlier of: • one month from the date of filing the tax return for that accounting year—1 June 2019 • one month from the date that the tax return for that accounting year is due to be filed—30 April 2019. In the above scenarios, if there are valid reasons why the taxpayer cannot make the deposit within the specified period or discretionary extended timeframe for an accounting year, the Commissioner will consider the merits of the taxpayer’s situation on a case-by-case basis and may still accept the late deposit. Making a late deposit without an extension of time arrangement A taxpayer with a 30 June 2018 balance date, with no extension of time arrangement, must file their income tax return by 7 October 2018. The taxpayer filed their income tax return on 30 September 2018. The specified period for making deposits into the applicable income equalisation scheme ends on 7 November 2018, which is the shorter of: • the period of six months after the end of the accounting year that corresponds to the tax year – 1 July 2018 to 31 December 2018, and • the period from the end of the accounting year to one month after the tax return is due—1 July 2018 to 7 November 2018. The taxpayer should make the deposit by the end of the specified period, ie, 7 November 2018. This is a later date than would be allowed by applying the discretionary extended timeframe, ie 31 October 2018, which is the earlier of: • one month from the date of filing the tax return for that accounting year—30 October 2018 • one month from the date that the tax return for that accounting year is due to be filed—7 November 2018. However, if there are valid reasons why the taxpayer cannot make the deposit by 7 November 2018, the Commissioner will consider the merits of the taxpayer’s situation on a case-by-case basis and may still accept the late deposit. Early applications for a refund 97. The Commissioner will allow applications for an early refund for unforeseen development, ie, development work not anticipated when the deposit was made, which arose through an adverse event (for example, a flood, drought, fire, livestock disease). Unforeseen development is not confined to deductible development expenditure and may also include any capital expenditure that will result in increased production. Adverse events 98. If an event is classified as an adverse event, the Commissioner may extend the timeframe for eligible taxpayers to make a deposit or request an early refund from 16 UNCLASSIFIED the main income equalisation scheme under ss EH 4 and EH 15(3)(c). Note that a taxpayer must still explain how the adverse event has affected them before these provisions can apply. 99. Where the Commissioner extends her discretion due to an adverse event being declared, this is published on Inland Revenue’s website: http://www.ird.govt.nz/business-income-tax/income-equalisation/special- provisions/ Exceptional circumstances 100. Where an eligible taxpayer makes a late deposit, or an application for an early refund or a late application for a refund outside of the circumstances detailed above, it may still be accepted by the Commissioner. Each request will be considered on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the merits of the taxpayer’s particular situation. 101. Reasons to accept a late deposit, an application for an early refund, or a late application for a refund could include, but are not limited to: • a taxpayer receiving incorrect advice from their tax agent, or • a taxpayer experiencing a sudden or unexpected change in circumstances. 102. However, these examples are not indicative of situations when a late deposit, an application for an early refund, or a late application for a refund will automatically be accepted. All factors must be considered before the Commissioner accepts the deposit as being made in the requested tax year.

UNCLASSIFIED 1 Standard Practice Statement SPS 19/05 Options for relief from child support debt Introduction Standard practice statements describe how the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. This Statement sets out the Commissioner’s practice for providing relief when the immediate payment of an overdue child support or domestic maintenance obligation is not possible. The relief is provided in the form of an agreement to pay the debt in instalments; writing off penalties in certain situations; or in limited circumstances, writing off part or all the child support debt. Inland Revenue may collect a debt owed by a receiving carer in the same manner as for financial support owed by a liable person. References to “liable person” may therefore include a receiving carer. All references to child support debt or a child support obligation are to be read as including a domestic maintenance debt or obligation unless otherwise noted. All references are to the Child Support Act 1991 (the “Act”), unless otherwise stated. The relevant legislative provisions of the Act are set out in Appendix 1. Application This Statement applies from the date of signing. It replaces SPS 11/02 Child Support debt – Requesting an instalment arrangement that was issued on 16 February 2011. This Statement does not extend to other tax debt or student loan arrears. For more information on these, see SPS 18/04 Options for relief from tax debt and SPS 11/03 Student Loans – Relief from repayment obligations or any statements issued in replacement. UNCLASSIFIED 2 Standard practice Summary 1. This Statement applies to the Commissioner’s discretion to provide relief when considering requests for payment agreements to settle child support debt. 2. The Act provides limited discretion when a liable person is unable to pay their child support debt in full and on time. A l iable person is encouraged to contact Inland Revenue as soon as possible if they think that they may have trouble paying their child support obligations. We can then discuss options for payment, which may include a payment agreement and/or writing off penalties (in full or in part). 3. Although it is best to contact Inland Revenue before getting behind with child support payments, it is never too late to discuss the options for resolving child support debt and minimising related penalties. 4. Requests for a payment agreement may be made in writing, by telephone, or any other manner acceptable to the Commissioner – for example, through myIR secure online services at https://www.ird.govt.nz/ 5. Requests for financial relief will be considered on a case-by-case basis. A liable person will need to be able to show why they cannot make immediate payments towards their child support obligation. They may be asked to supply further information about their financial circumstances in support of their request for a payment agreement. 6. If the Commissioner is satisfied that a liable person is not able to make immediate payment, a payment agreement may be agreed to. 7. A payment agreement will be for more than the annual assessed amount of child support payable. This is because payment agreements must include the annual assessed rate of child support payable for a current year, plus a reasonable amount toward reducing the child support debt. 8. A payment agreement will be structured so that the child support debt will be paid in the shortest possible time. 9. When the Commissioner agrees to a payment agreement, the terms will be confirmed and both the liable person’s and the Commissioner’s obligations under the payment agreement will be set out. For liable persons with a myIR Secure Online Services account, confirmation may be made electronically. 10. A l iable person who enters into a payment agreement should inform the Commissioner as soon as possible if there is a change to their circumstances that may affect: • an earlier decision to provide financial relief; or • their ability to repay their child support debt. 11. In certain circumstances, the initial late payment penalty and/or incremental penalties that were incurred prior to a payment agreement being made may be written off. UNCLASSIFIED 3 12. When a payment agreement has been made, the Commissioner will provide relief to the liable person from ongoing incremental penalties for a particular month if all the payments that are due in that month are made. 13. Missing payments of an instalment may not undo the overall payment agreement. When the Commissioner is satisfied that a liable person is unable to pay their child support debt under a payment agreement, the terms of the payment agreement may be changed at the request of the liable person. 14. However, when a payment agreement is cancelled because a liable person does not comply with their repayment obligations, the Commissioner will consider whether other options may be available to collect the child support debt. Penalties will accrue on any unpaid amount. 15. Where a liable person has defaulted on child support obligations, the Commissioner will look to make automatic deductions from their salary/wages or benefit income, as generally required under ss 130 and 131. Detailed Discussion 16. A l iable person should contact Inland Revenue as soon as possible if they think they are unable to pay their child support obligations on time and in full. Options for payment, which may include a payment agreement, can be discussed. The Commissioner will consider requests for relief on a case-by-case basis. Early contact may also minimise penalties where a payment agreement can be entered into. 17. Applications may be made by telephone, in person, in writing or by electronic means. Details on contact methods for Child Support are available at: http://www.ird.govt.nz/contact-us/# . Available options for relief 18. The Commissioner may, when satisfied that immediate payment of child support debt is not possible, grant relief to a liable person by: • agreeing to a payment agreement; • in some instances, being able to grant relief from initial late payment penalties and/or incremental late payment penalties; or • writing off part or all of the debt to the extent it is child support that was payable in respect of a period in which the receiving carer was a social security beneficiary (Crown entitlement) and payment will place the liable person in serious hardship. 19. Mandatory relief is also available for initial late payment penalties charged on the first payment due, if a payment arrangement is entered into, or a deduction notice is issued, (which includes that first payment), within 3 months of the issue date of the first assessment. 20. Where a payment agreement is adhered to, a mandatory write-off of related incremental penalties will occur. UNCLASSIFIED 4 When will relief be provided? 21. For the Commissioner to consider a payment agreement, she must be satisfied that the liable person is not able to make immediate payment of their child support debt. 22. The Commissioner will consider all options available for payment but will look for arrangements that will see this debt repaid in the shortest possible time while also ensuring the liable person maintains their current child support obligations. Payment agreements 23. A payment agreement may consist of one or more payments to settle a child support debt. T o ensure that the liable person meets their current child support obligations a payment agreement will include any current-year child support payable. 24. The liable person will be expected to meet their current-year child support obligations, as well as providing a reasonable amount toward reducing the outstanding debt. Information to support application 25. The Commissioner’s decision on whether to agree to a payment agreement will be based on the circumstances of each case, with the aim of recovering the child support debt in the shortest possible time. The Commissioner will also consider whether the liable person can reasonably afford to pay their child support debt at the rate proposed in their payment agreement application. 26. The liable person may be asked to provide information to support their application for a payment agreement, including their proposed payment plan. Alternatively, they may be asked to complete a Child support – repayment of arrears ( IR130) form. The information provided will be used to assist the Commissioner in considering the application and to determine whether the liable person has other options for settling their child support debt. The IR130 form is available on our website at www.ird.govt.nz/forms-guides . 27. A liable person may ask for the payment agreement to be renegotiated at any time. Although the legislation does not prevent the Commissioner from reviewing a payment agreement at any time, generally the Commissioner will renegotiate a payment agreement only after two years from the date the agreement was entered into. This is to provide the liable person with some certainty as to the level of payments towards their child support debt. However, where the Commissioner becomes aware of a material change in the circumstances of the liable person, the Commissioner reserves the right to renegotiate the agreement at any time. Defaulting on instalments 28. Inland Revenue acknowledges that a liable person’s circumstances can change for reasons outside their control. F or example, they may face an unforeseen household expense or default by debtors can erode their cash flow and affect their ability to maintain a payment agreement. 29. If this happens, the liable person should contact Inland Revenue promptly to discuss an adjustment to their payment agreement. If the Commissioner is UNCLASSIFIED 5 satisfied that the liable person is unable to continue to meet their payment agreement, it may be re-negotiated or other options to recover the debt will be considered. 30. If a liable person does not comply with the terms of a payment agreement, the Commissioner may cancel that arrangement and look to collect the debt in another way. In considering whether to cancel the arrangement, where possible, the reasons for the default will be considered and the Commissioner will take into account the liable person’s overall child support compliance behaviour, including: • r egularity of payments; • c urrent financial circumstances; • t he circumstances under which the payments were missed; and • the liable person’s cooperativeness and willingness to maintain current child support obligations and resolve their debt. 31. The Commissioner may also decline to enter into a payment agreement if the liable person has not complied with earlier agreements and there was no reasonable cause for the non-compliance. 32. The Commissioner may cancel a payment agreement if it was entered into on the basis of false or misleading information provided by the liable person. Charging of penalties 33. If child support obligations are not paid in full and on time, an initial late payment penalty is charged on the unpaid amount as follows: • The greater of 2% of the unpaid amount or $5.00 is charged on the day after the due date; • 8% of the unpaid amount (excluding the 2%) is charged 8 days after the due date. 34. Amounts remaining unpaid during the following 11 months will be charged an incremental late payment penalty of 2% each month. Amounts still unpaid after this will be charged a penalty of 1% each month. Discretionary relief from penalties 35. When a liable person enters into a payment agreement, the Commissioner can grant the liable person relief from the payment of late payment penalties, either the initial or the incremental penalties (or both). The Commissioner can grant relief by writing off the whole or part of the penalty. Each of the write offs that may be available are discussed below. Incremental penalties unpaid before agreement entered into (s 135FA) 36. The Commissioner may grant relief in respect of incremental penalties that were unpaid at the time a payment agreement was entered into if she is satisfied that the recovery of those penalties would place the liable person in serious hardship, or that it would be fair and reasonable to grant relief. 37. The payment agreement must be entered into on or after 1 April 2016 and require the liable person to pay, in 1 sum or 2 or more instalments under a payment agreement, the amount of child support outstanding and the initial UNCLASSIFIED 6 late payment penalties as well as any child support that the person will become liable to pay during the term of the payment agreement. 38. Before the Commissioner decides to grant relief due to serious hardship, she must have regard to the matters referred to in ss 6 and 6A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 which pertain to protecting the integrity of the tax system and encouraging voluntary compliance. Incremental penalties where some or all of the debt paid (s 135G) 39. Where the liable person has paid some or all of the financial support debt and initial late payment penalties, the Commissioner may grant relief from the payment of the related incremental penalties if she is satisfied that the recovery of the penalties would place the liable person in serious hardship, or it would be fair and reasonable to grant relief. Residual initial/incremental penalties (s 135GA) 40. The Commissioner may grant relief to a liable person from the payment of initial late payment penalties and/or incremental penalties if the liable person has paid or had written off all their financial support debt and the Commissioner is satisfied that recovery of those penalties would place the person in serious hardship or that it would be fair and reasonable to grant relief. 41. Similarly, the Commissioner may grant relief to a liable person from the payment of initial late payment penalties and/or incremental penalties if the Commissioner has written off some or all of the benefit component of an amount of child support that is payable by the person and the Commissioner is satisfied that the recovery of those penalties would place the person in serious hardship or that it would be fair and reasonable to grant relief. 42. In this instance the Commissioner must be satisfied that the penalties relate to, or arise from, some or all of the written-off benefit component. Determining serious hardship 43. In determining whether serious hardship exists, the Commissioner will consider whether the liable person will suffer significant financial difficulties that arise because: (a) the liable person would likely be unable to meet minimum living expenses estimated according to normal community standards; or (b) the liable person must meet the cost of medical treatment for an illness or injury of the liable person, or their dependant; or (c) the liable person or their dependant has a serious illness; or (d) the liable person must meet the cost of education for their dependant. 44. Serious hardship does not include significant financial difficulties due to having to pay tax or child support, because the liable person may become bankrupt or that the person’s social activities and entertainment may be limited, or the liable person may not be able to afford expensive or high-quality goods or services. 45. The definition of serious hardship refers to “normal community standards”. While these standards must be considered in the context of the wider community of New Zealand, the actual expenditure of liable persons in different parts of the country may vary. When calculating a liable person’s minimum UNCLASSIFIED 7 living expenses, the Commissioner will consider the reasonable costs of food, heating and accommodation in the liable person’s area, based on information provided by Statistics New Zealand. However, this is just a starting point and the Commissioner will have regard to expenditure incurred that is outside the norm due to the liable person’s specific circumstances. 46. The definition of serious hardship also refers to a “dependant”. Whether a person is a liable person’s dependant will be determined on a case-by-case basis. The Commissioner will consider whether the person depends on the liable person for financial support, what degree of financial support is provided, and to what extent providing financial support affects the liable person’s ability to meet minimum living expenses according to normal community standards. Fair and reasonable test 47. Whether it is fair and reasonable to write off incremental penalties depends on the circumstances of each case. Some of the factors that the Commissioner will consider include: • whether the payment was late due to a circumstance beyond the liable person’s control, including medical or mental incapability, incarceration, hospitalisation, travel disruption, natural disasters, civil emergencies; • whether the person generally has a good payment history; • whether the person took reasonable steps to mitigate the debt; • whether the person genuinely misunderstood the payment requirements; • whether the person paid other debts or acquired assets in preference to paying financial support. Mandatory relief 48. Other provisions of the Act direct the Commissioner to grant relief from the payment of initial late payment penalties or incremental penalties if certain criteria are met. Full or substantial compliance with payment arrangement (s 135GB) 49. Where a liable parent has a child support debt that includes their first payment of child support and they entered into a payment arrangement after 1 April 2016 within 3 months of the date of the assessment, the initial late payment penalty will be written off if the arrangement is fully or substantially adhered to. 50. A payment arrangement includes a payment agreement, or a deduction notice issued under s 154. 51. A first payment is the first time a person is liable to make a payment of child support under a new liability. This includes when a liable person’s liability ceases then restarts at a later date (except when this is due to the person’s status changing between a person who is entitled to receive child support to being the person who is liable to pay). It does not include the situation where a liable person has an existing liability and they incur an additional liability, for example, the addition of a qualifying child. 52. An assessment may be a formula assessment, voluntary agreement or an order of the court. The payment arrangement needs to have been made within 3 months of the date the assessment is issued. 53. A payment arrangement has been fully or substantially complied with when: UNCLASSIFIED 8 • it has operated for a period that the Commissioner considers reasonable; and; • there has been no default in the payments under the arrangement; or • the only default is to an extent, or arising from a cause, that the Commissioner considers reasonable. 54. The extent of the default means the level or range of the default. Is the level or range of the default reasonable in the Commissioner’s opinion? This will depend upon the facts of each case. 55. A default that arises from a reasonable cause will include a default due to a cause beyond the control of the liable person such as a serious illness, accident or disaster. 56. The Commissioner considers that the payment arrangement has operated for a reasonable period when the first payment of child support that was due, is cleared by the arrangement. If the arrangement has been fully or substantially complied with over this time, then the initial late payment penalty can be written off. Relief from incremental penalties unpaid before agreement entered into on or after 26 September 2006 (s 135J) 57. The Commissioner must write off incremental penalties unpaid at the time a payment agreement is entered into if the liable person has complied with the payment agreement up to a particular review date. 58. Any payment agreement must require the liable person to pay the amount of the initial debt (child support plus initial late payment penalties) along with the amount of child support that the person will become liable to pay during the term of the agreement. 59. A review date will be set for a payment agreement. That review date will be at 26-week intervals from the date the liable person enters into the payment agreement. 60. A person has complied with the payment agreement up to a particular review date if the person has paid every instalment in full when required to by the agreement. 61. If a person has satisfied the criteria above, the incremental penalties will be written off proportionally to the amount of the initial debt that has been repaid over the last 26-week period. 62. In addition, if the liable person makes all the payments as agreed during the last month, the Commissioner must write off all the ongoing incremental penalties charged during that last month (s 135M). 63. When a liable person has not complied with a payment agreement, but the Commissioner is satisfied that the non-compliance was caused by: • circumstances beyond that person’s control and a reasonable cause for the delay of payment; or • the delay in payment of the debt was caused by an honest oversight, and there is no history of default with previous payments of financial support, and the oversight was corrected promptly; or UNCLASSIFIED 9 • the liable person had acted on in good faith, on an error made by Inland Revenue leading to the debt, and it would be fair and reasonable to grant relief; the incremental penalties may still be written off . 64. If a liable person has not complied with a payment agreement and has not contacted Inland Revenue to discuss options, it is likely that the payment agreement will be cancelled. Should a payment agreement be cancelled, incremental penalties will remain and continue to accrue on any unpaid child support debt. 65. After the payment agreement has been completed, and the child support debt and any initial late payment penalties have been paid, some incremental penalties may still remain. Those remaining incremental penalties may be written off (refer paragraph 38). Write-off of Crown entitlement (s180A) 66. Child support (not including domestic maintenance) will be payable to the Crown in respect of the period that the receiving carer is in receipt of a social security benefit. 67. A write-off of the amount of child support that is owed to the Crown may be available if the Commissioner is satisfied that recovery of part or all of the amount will place the liable person in serious hardship and/or would involve an inefficient use of the Commissioner’s resources. 68. A liable person cannot request that their child support debt be written off because they consider that collection would be an inefficient use of the Commissioner’s resources. That is a decision solely for the Commissioner to make under the duties charged to her under ss 6 and 6A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Other relief that may be available Reasonable cause (s 135B) 69. Where the Commissioner is satisfied that the delay in payment was due to a reasonable cause and the liable person made payment of the debt as soon as practicable, relief may be granted. 70. Reasonable cause means an event or circumstance that is beyond the control of the liable person and includes a serious illness, an accident or a disaster. The Commissioner must be satisfied that it was the event or circumstance that caused a reasonable delay in the payment of the debt. Failure by another person to make deduction (s 135C) 71. Where the Commissioner is satisfied that the circumstances that contributed to the delay in the payment of the debt were due to or caused directly or indirectly by the failure of any person to make a deduction as instructed by a notice issued by the Commissioner under Part 10 of the Act and the liable person has taken reasonable steps to mitigate the effects of those circumstances, the Commissioner may grant relief if after having regard to the nature of those circumstances it would be fair and reasonable to do so. UNCLASSIFIED 10 Honest oversight (s 135D) 72. The Commissioner may grant relief to a liable person if she is satisfied that the penalty arose due to an honest oversight and the person has no history of missing payments and the person paid the debt as soon as they became aware of the oversight. 73. Whether a liable person has a history of missing payments will be a matter of fact in each case. Error made by Inland Revenue (s 135E) 74. The Commissioner may grant relief to a liable person if she is satisfied that the delay in payment which resulted in the penalty being applied was due to an error made by an officer of Inland Revenue and the person has acted in good faith and has altered his or her position in reliance on the error and it would be fair and reasonable to do so. Debt waived or uplifted (s 135F) 75. Where the Commissioner is satisfied that the payee has waived the right to the payment to which the penalty relates or has uplifted the debt, relief may be granted if it would be fair and reasonable to do so. Reviewing a decision 76. If a liable person is concerned that their circumstances have not been given proper consideration, they should raise their concern and ask for the decision to be reviewed. 77. If a liable person is still not satisfied with the level of service they receive, they can obtain more information about the Inland Revenue Complaints Management Service at https://www.classic.ird.govt.nz/contact-us/disputes- process/complaints-process/complaints-process.html or phone 0800 274 138 (Monday to Friday between 8am and 5pm).

1 UNCLASSIFIED Standard practice statement SPS 19/04 Late Filing Penalties This statement also appears in the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31, No 6 (July 2019). Introduction Standard practice statements describe how the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) will exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. This Statement sets out the Commissioner's practice for imposing late filing penalties under section 139A and 139AAA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). The New Zealand tax system is based on voluntary compliance. It relies on taxpayers voluntarily meeting the Inland Revenue obligations under the tax laws, for example, by filing tax returns by the due date. Sections 139A and 139AAA impose a penalty on a taxpayer for not filing certain returns by the due date. The purpose of the penalty is to promote voluntary compliance and to ensure penalties for breaches are imposed impartially and consistently. The penalties also cover costs related to following up outstanding returns. Note that this statement only discusses penalties in respect of late filed returns. It is not intended to cover penalties for late payments of tax. The legislation covering each of these penalties types is different. All section references set out in this statement are to the Tax Administration Act 1994. Sections 139A and 139AAA are set out in the appendix to this statement. Application This Statement applies from 30/05/2019 and replaces Standard Practice Statement 12/02 Late filing penalty, published in Tax Information Bulletin Volume 24, No 5 (June 2012). 2 UNCLASSIFIED Standard practice Summary 1. Under section 139A and 139AAA, a late filing penalty applies to: • annual tax returns; • annual ICA returns required to be filed under section 69(1) and (2)(a) by an Australian ICA company that is not required to file a return of income; • ACC reconciliation statements; • a multi-rate PIE return required under section 57B; • a Resident Land Withholding Tax (RLWT) statement required under section 54B; • employment income information; • GST returns (section 139AAA). 2. Except in the case of a late filing penalty for employment income information or GST returns, the Commissioner must give at least 30 days’ notice to the taxpayer of the intention to impose a late filing penalty. The Commissioner must provide such a notice either in writing or by public notification to a taxpayer or group of taxpayers. If the outstanding return is filed within the 30-day period, or an extension of time is granted to file the outstanding return, the penalty will not be imposed. 3. For employment income information and GST returns, the Commissioner must notify the taxpayer that the late filing penalty is payable when a taxpayer fails to file the information or GST return on time. If the taxpayer files that same type of return (GST or employment income information) late in the succeeding 12 months, a late filing penalty will automatically be applied. 4. The amount of the late filing penalty for annual tax returns is based on the amount of net income. If the net income is: • below $100,000, the penalty is $50 • between $100,000 to $1,000,000 $250 • above $1,000,000 $500 5. The amount of the late filing penalty for employment income information and an annual ICA return required to be filed by an Australian ICA company is $250. The amount of late filing penalty for multi-rate PIE returns and RLWT statements is also $250. 6. The amount of the late filing penalty for a GST return is: • $250 for registered persons who account for GST using the invoice or hybrid basis; 3 UNCLASSIFIED • $50 for registered persons who account for GST using the payments basis. Detailed discussion Imposing the late filing penalty 7. The Commissioner's practice is that a late filing penalty may be imposed on the following: • income tax returns for individuals and companies (IR3 & IR4) • annual ICA returns required to be filed under section 69(1) and 69(2)(a) by an Australian ICA company that is not required to file a return of income for an income year that corresponds to an imputation year (IR4J) • multi-rate PIE returns • RLWT statements • employment income information; and • GST returns. 8. A late filing penalty will be imposed in the following circumstances. Income Tax returns 9. A late filing penalty will be imposed in respect of an outstanding IR3 or IR4 income tax return in the following circumstances: • the return is not filed by the due date, and is not subject to an extension of time arrangement; or • the return is subject to an extension of time arrangement, and is not filed by the date agreed to in that arrangement; or • an extension of time arrangement is withdrawn from a tax agent, and the return(s) are not filed by the date specified when the extension of time was withdrawn; or • the return is for a client of a tax agent with an extension of time arrangement and is not filed by the 31st of March in the year immediately following the income year to which the return applies. 10. Before imposing a late filing penalty, the Commissioner will provide written notification of at least 30 days, either by public notification or directly to the taxpayer. 11. The amount of the penalty for outstanding income tax returns is initially based on the minimum penalty of $50. Once the return is received the amount of the penalty is checked and if the net income is in a different bracket to that minimum amount, the penalty is amended. The minimum penalty remains payable if the return is subsequently filed and shows a loss. 4 UNCLASSIFIED 12. The due date for payment of a late filing penalty is the later of a date specified by the Commissioner, not being less than 30 days after the date of the notice informing of the imposition of the penalty, and the terminal tax date for the tax year to which the return relates. Annual ICA returns 13. An annual ICA return required to be filed under section 69(1) and 69(2)(a) by an Australian ICA company that is not required to file a return of income for an income year that corresponds to an imputation year (IR4J) are also subject to the late filing penalty regime. A 30-day notice will automatically be issued when the annual ICA return has not been filed by the due date. 14. Following that period, the $250 penalty is automatically imposed. Multi-rate PIE returns 15. The late filing penalty process for these returns is the same as for annual ICA returns. The amount of the penalty is also set at $250. Residential Land Withholding Tax statements 16. The person liable to file an RLWT statement under section 54B is liable to a late filing penalty when the statement is not filed by the due date. This is not an automated process. However, the 30-day notice will still be issued when appropriate. Note that this provision also applies when a “Nil” return is required under section 54B(2). Following that 30-day period, the $250 late filing penalty will be imposed. Employment income information 17. From 1 April 2019, most employers must payday file requiring them to file employment income information within certain timeframes for each payday instead of filing an Employer monthly schedule (IR348). 18. While employers are getting used to the new payday filing rules Inland Revenue will take a three-stage approach to the application of any late filing penalties. • The first time an employer fails to file employment income information by the due date, the Commissioner may initially look to educate and assist employers to comply with this requirement. • Future defaults may result in the issue of a warning notice to the employer advising a late filing penalty will not be imposed this time, but in future if the information is not filed on time a late filing penalty of $250 will be imposed. • If, within 12 months of the warning notice being issued, a further default in filing employment income information occurs, a late filing penalty will be imposed in respect of that employment income information. Note that this three-stage approach, involving the first education step, is intended to apply only while employers get used to their new pay- day filing obligations. In time it is intended that Inland Revenue will revert to using a two-stage approach, involving a warning letter, and 5 UNCLASSIFIED then imposing a late filing penalty if a further default occurs within 12 months. Taxpayers will be advised before any change to the two-stage approach is implemented. 19. The late filing penalty of $250 will be a single penalty imposed monthly regardless of how many times an employer fails to provide the employment income information during a month. 20. If, following the warning notice, the employer files all employment income information on time for 12 months and then defaults again, a further warning notice will be issued. That is, the customer has a “clean sheet” and the process restarts. 21. There is no longer a requirement for employers to file “Nil” returns when no employment occurs for a month. Inland Revenue expects to be able to determine when late filing penalties should be imposed. However, employers should advise Inland Revenue if they expect in future not to file employment income information in some months when this has previously happened. 22. The due date for payment of a late filing penalty is 30 days after the end of the month in which the information was due to be filed. GST returns 23. The first time a registered person files the GST return late, they will be advised that if they are late in filing another of the GST returns within the next 12 months a late filing penalty will be imposed on that second late return. If the registered person files all the GST returns on time for the 12 months following a warning notice and then defaults again, a further warning notice will be issued. That is, the customer has a “clean sheet” and the process restarts. 24. The amount of the late filing penalty for GST returns are: • $250 if the invoice or hybrid basis is used at the time the return is due; or • $50 if the payments basis is used at the time the return is due. 25. The penalty is due by the 28th of the second month following the end of the relevant taxable period (or 15 February if the late return was due 15 January or 7 June if the late return was due 7 May). Reversal or remission of late filing penalty 26. The Commissioner's practice is that the late filing penalty may be reversed if: • the return was filed before the date the late filing penalty was imposed, but had not been "lodged" by Inland Revenue; or • the return or employment income information was not required to be filed; or 6 UNCLASSIFIED • In respect of employment income information, the taxpayer did not pay any salary or wages even though a registered employer. 27. The Commissioner's practice is that the late filing penalty may be remitted if the legislative criteria regarding the remission of penalties and interest contained in sections 183A or 183D are met. Remission of penalties and interest is discussed in Standard Practice Statement 18/04 28. The Commissioner's practice is that the late filing penalty will not be remitted if: • The taxpayer has an extension of time arrangement as a client of a tax agent, but the agent had not notified the Commissioner that the taxpayer was their client before the late filing penalty was imposed. • The taxpayer was granted an extension of time arrangement (either as a client of a tax agent or individually), after the late filing penalty was imposed. This Standard Practice Statement is signed on 30 May 2019.

Double Taxation Relief (Kingdom of Sweden) Order 1980
=====================================================

Archived legislative commentary on the Double Taxation Relief (Kingdom of Sweden) Order 1980 (SR 1980/214) from PIB vol 112, suppl 4 May 1982.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 112, Supplement No. 4, May 1982

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_](/about/about-our-publications)
.

Part I - Introduction
---------------------

A new Double Taxation Convention has been concluded between New Zealand and Sweden to replace the 1956 Convention between the two countries. The text of the new Convention has been published as a schedule to an Order-in-Council (SR 1980/214) which has been distributed to district offices and is also available from Government Bookshops.

The new Convention has come into force and its provisions apply in New Zealand for any income year commencing on or after 1 April 1981. In Sweden it takes effect for the calendar years commencing on or after 1 January 1981.

Consequently the provisions of the 1956 Convention ceased to have effect in New Zealand in respect of income derived during any income year commencing on or after 1 April 1981. In Sweden the 1956 Convention ceased to have effect in respect of income derived on or after 1 January 1981.

Part II - Notes on the Convention Article by Article
----------------------------------------------------

### Article 1 - Taxes Covered

In Sweden the Convention covers the State income tax (including the sailor's tax and the coupon tax), the tax on the undistributed profits of companies, the tax on public entertainers and the communal tax. In New Zealand the Convention covers the income tax and excess retention tax. Paragraph 3 confirms that the New Zealand bonus issue tax is not subject to the Convention.

### Article 2 - General Definitions

(1) **"Industrial or Commercial Profits": Paragraph 1(j)**

The primary concept of the definition is that industrial or commercial profits are profits derived from the conduct of a trade or business. As in all double tax conventions the definition is most important because under Article 5 such profits will be exempt in the country of origin unless the recipient has a permanent establishment in that country.

(2) Undefined Terms: Paragraph 2

This is a standard provision. Where a term is not defined it has the meaning applicable under the domestic law of the country applying the Convention.

### Article 3 - Resident

(1) This Article takes positive steps to solve problems that arise when a taxpayer is a resident of both countries by virtue of the domestic law of each country. The terms "resident in New Zealand" and "resident of Sweden" are defined in paragraph 1 and will apply wherever used in the Convention. The definition of these terms is in the first instance a reference to the domestic law of each country. However, where the domestic laws of each country clash so that the taxpayer is a resident of both countries the tests set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 3 apply.

(2) Paragraph 2 sets out the tests to be applied to solve the problem of a dual resident **individual**. Dual residence arises when a taxpayer is resident in both countries by virtue of the domestic law of each country. The paragraph gives preference to the country in which the individual has a permanent home available to him. This criterion will frequently be sufficient to solve the conflict, eg, where the individual has a permanent home in one country and has only stayed a certain length of time in the other country.

(3) Paragraph 3 sets out the rule to determine the case of a company or other legal person which is resident in both countries. These cases will be decided by the competent authorities (defined in Article 2(1)(d)) under the mutual agreement procedure(prefer Article 25). Generally, competent authority intervention will not be necessary as residence will be where the place of administrative or practical management of the enterprise is situated. In this respect New Zealand views the term "administrative or practical management" as meaning the practical day to day management, irrespective of where the overriding control is exercised.

(4) In applying the tests to dual residents it should be remembered that these tests apply only for the purposes of the tax Convention. If the person **resident in New Zealand** (domestic law test) becomes for the purposes of the Convention a "Resident of Sweden" after the tests have been applied, this does **not** mean that he is a non-resident for all purposes of New Zealand tax law. For example he can never be subject to non-resident withholding tax, the reason being that although he is treated as a non-resident for certain purposes of the Convention, he is still a resident under the New Zealand Income Tax Act. What it does mean is that he is entitled to any benefits granted by the Convention to a "Resident of Sweden". Thus, although not subject to withholding tax on, for example, New Zealand royalty income, the royalty income would be subject to New Zealand income tax and he would still qualify for the 10 percent limitation in the Convention.

### Article 4 - Permanent Establishment

This Article defines the term "permanent establishment". This concept determines the right of a Contracting State to tax the profits of an "enterprise of the other Contracting State". Due to the inclusion of the words "include especially" in paragraph 2, the examples cited as constituting a permanent establishment are by no means exhaustive.

The definition of "permanent establishment" is fairly standard but the following points should be noted:

*   A building site or construction, installation or assembly project constitutes a permanent establishment if it lasts for more than 6 months.
*   An enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment if it carries on supervisory activities for more than 6 months in connection with a construction, installation or assembly project.
*   The term permanent establishment includes the use or installation of substantial equipment or machinery for more than 6 months.

### Article 5 - Business Profits

(1) This Article is in many respects a continuation of, and a corollary to, Article 4 on the definition of the concept of permanent establishment. Under Article 5 a Contracting State cannot tax the profits of an enterprise of the other Contracting State unless it carries on its business through a permanent establishment situated therein. If a permanent establishment exists the Article goes on to lay down a set of rules by reference to which the profits of the permanent establishment are to be calculated.

(2) Before dealing with the salient features of the Article it should be noted that reference to this Article and Article 4 will not always be necessary to determine the liability of specific types of income. This Article will only be applicable to business profits which do not belong to the categories of income covered by the special Articles, nor to dividends, royalties and interest which **specifically** come with in the **circumstances** detailed in paragraphs 4 of Articles 8 and 10 and paragraph 3 of Article 9, and consequently fall within Article 5.

(3) Paragraph 1 expresses the general rule that profits of a Swedish enterprise are exempt from New Zealand tax unless the enterprise is engaged in trade or business in New Zealand through a permanent establishment, in which case New Zealand may tax the profits of the permanent establishment.

It is important to note that only income attributable **directly** to the permanent establishment's operations can form part of the establishment's operations. This does not mean that income which is not directly attributable to the establishment's operations escapes liability for tax (see paragraph 2 above). For example, the restriction on the rate of tax imposed by paragraph 2 of Articles 8, 9 and 10, which concern dividend, interest and royalty payments respectively, would apply if such income did not arise from the permanent establishment's operations.

(4) Paragraph 2 deals with the converse situation of a New Zealand enterprise engaged in trade or business in Sweden.

(5) Paragraph 3 contains the normal provisions enabling arm's-length profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment if necessary. Where there is inadequate information the paragraph allows the taxation authorities of each State to apply its domestic law in determining the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment whether by the exercise of a discretion or making an estimate, provided the arm's-length principle is adhered to.

(6) Paragraph 4 merely expresses the taxpayer's right to deduct from the profits of the permanent establishment the expenses incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment even if those expenses are incurred outside the country where the permanent establishment is situated.

(7) Paragraph 5 precludes the attribution of profits to a permanent establishment by reason of merely purchasing activities carried on by the permanent establishment for the enterprise.

(8) In terms of paragraph 6 income from the business of any form of insurance is not subject to the provisions of this Article. Such income may be taxed in accordance with the domestic law of each country.

(9) Paragraph 7 is intended to cover the situation where a New Zealand enterprise manufactures or processes goods for export on behalf of a Swedish enterprise which has a permanent establishment in New Zealand and the Swedish and New Zealand enterprises are not at arm's-length. In this situation the goods are manufactured or processed virtually entirely for export at cost, with selling a minor part of total activities in New Zealand, leaving little or no profit that can be attributed to the New Zealand permanent establishment of the Swedish enterprise. Under paragraph 7 the major part of the profit from the eventual sale of the goods is related to the manufacturing or processing of the goods and is attributed to the permanent establishment of the Swedish enterprise in New Zealand thus being subject to New Zealand tax.

### Article 6 - Associated Enterprises

This is a standard Article enabling arm's-length profit to be attributed to associated enterprises.

### Article 7 - Shipping and Air Transport

(1) Under this Article profits from operating ships or aircraft in "international traffic" - defined in Article 2(1)(k) - are to be taxed only in the country of residence of the enterprise. International shipping and aircraft profits include income from:

*   carriage of passengers and cargo;
*   sale of passenger tickets on behalf of other enterprises;
*   commercial advertising;
*   charter fees (but refer paragraph (3) below).

(2) Due to the definition of "international traffic" exemption does not extend to profits derived from coastal traffic. Further, investment income of shipping and air transport enterprises is subject to the treatment ordinarily applied to that class of income, eg dividends derived would be subject to Article 8.

(3) Profits obtained from leasing a ship or aircraft on charter fully equipped, manned and supplied, whether or not the enterprise providing the ship or aircraft actually owns them, would be treated as profits from the operation of a ship or aircraft. However, the Article does not extend to profits from leasing a ship or aircraft on a bare boat charter basis **except** when it is an occasional source of income for an enterprise engaged in the international operation of ships or aircraft. Apart from this one exception, bare boat charter fees would normally be classified as business profits and consequently dealt with under Article 5.

### Article 8 - Dividends

(1) Paragraph 1 simply states that dividends may be taxed in the State of the recipient's residence.

(2) Paragraph 2 provides that the Contracting State from which the dividends are paid also has the right to tax, but the maximum tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 15 percent of the gross amount of the dividends. Therefore, in terms of the Convention New Zealand's taxing rights will be restricted to 15 percent of the gross dividend even though the rate under domestic law is 30 percent from 1 April 1982.

In Sweden, dividends paid to non-residents are subject to withholding tax of 30 percent, this tax being known as the coupon tax. Under this Article the tax is reduced to 15 percent. Generally, with regard to the larger Swedish companies which are registered at the Securities Register Centre, the reduction of the coupon tax under the Convention will be observed automatically at the time of payment of the dividends. However, in respect of dividends paid by many smaller Swedish companies the reduction is not made automatically. Where a resident of New Zealand receives dividends from such a company, reduction of the coupon tax will be observed at the time of payment of the dividends upon presentation of a special form "18b". On this form a New Zealand authority or bank has to certify that the recipient of the dividends is a resident of New Zealand. Copies of the form 18b will be available in district offices.

The paragraph also allows the Contracting States to settle the mode of application of the limitation in paragraph 2.

(3) Paragraph 3 provides that any exemption on domestic inter-company dividends allowable under Swedish tax laws is to be extended to dividends received by a Swedish company from a New Zealand company. For the exemption to apply the New Zealand company must be actively engaged in trade or business in New Zealand and not merely deriving investment income.

(4) Paragraph 4 concerns shares which are effectively connected with a permanent establishment. The paragraph merely provides that in the State of source the dividends are taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment there owned by the recipient which is a resident of the other State, **provided** they are paid in respect of holdings forming part of the assets of the permanent establishment or otherwise effectively connected with that establishment. In effect this relieves the State of source of the dividends from any limitations under the Article.

The rules set out above also apply where the recipient of the dividends has in the other State, for the purpose of performing any of the kinds of independent personal services mentioned in Article 15, a fixed base with which the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected.

Up until 1 April 1982 these qualifications had no effect on the New Zealand tax position because our domestic law provided for a 15 percent final withholding tax in all cases on the gross payment and no convention or agreement can extend the taxing rights under domestic law. However, in view of the change in the New Zealand domestic law from 1 April 1982 the New Zealand tax on dividends paid in respect of shares effectively connected with a permanent establishment will be 30 percent.

(5) Paragraph 5 prevents extra-territorial taxation of dividends, ie, the practice by which a State taxes dividends distributed by a non-resident company solely because the corporate profits from which the distribution is made originated from sources in that State (for example, realised through a permanent establishment situated therein). In practice this provision has no application in New Zealand as New Zealand does not impose tax on distributions made by non-resident companies.

### Article 9 - Interest

(1) Paragraph 1 affirms the taxing right of the State in which the recipient of the interest is a resident.

(2) Paragraph 2 also affirms the taxing right of the State in which the interest arises, but the maximum tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 10 percent of the gross amount of the interest. New Zealand's tax is therefore limited to 10 percent on gross interest paid to residents of Sweden instead of the usual 15 percent. Interest paid from Sweden to a non-resident recipient is normally not subject to Swedish tax.

The paragraph also allows the competent authorities to settle the mode of application of the limitation in paragraph 2.

(3) Paragraph 3 provides that in the State of source interest is taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment there owned by a resident of the other State, **provided** the interest is paid in respect of debt-claims forming part of the assets of the permanent establishment or otherwise effectively connected with that establishment. In effect this paragraph relieves the State of source of the interest from any limitation under the Article.

This qualification ties in with the New Zealand domestic law which provides that if a non-resident has a fixed establishment in New Zealand, then interest derived is not subject to non-resident withholding tax but is to be assessed on an annual basis.(See section 310 Income Tax Act 1976).

The rules set out above also apply where the recipient of the interest has in the other State, for the purpose of performing any of the kinds of independent personal services mentioned in Article 15, a fixed base with which the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected.

(4) Paragraph 4 is a source rule and precludes argument as to the source of the interest.

The paragraph also deals with interest arising through a permanent establishment or fixed base. Where a loan was contracted for the requirements of that establishment and the interest is borne by the latter, the paragraph determines that the source of the interest is in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated, leaving aside the place of residence of the owner of that establishment or base.

(5) Paragraph 5 is an anti-avoidance provision to ensure that only a reasonable interest payment is taxed at the reduced rate specified in the Convention.

(6) Paragraph 6 excludes from the term "interest" income which would be classified as a dividend under a State's domestic law. Therefore, in New Zealand for example, interest received by debenture holders from debentures to which section 192 or 195 of the Income Tax Act 1976 apply would be dealt with under the Dividend Article.

### Article 10 - Royalties

(1) Paragraph 1 affirms the taxing right of the State in which the recipient of the royalties is a resident.

(2) Paragraph 2 also affirms the taxing right of the State in which the royalty arises but the maximum tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 10 percent of the gross amount of the royalty. Again New Zealand's domestic law is restricted as our non-resident withholding tax rate is 15 percent. The convention supersedes the New Zealand domestic law.

Claims for reduction of Swedish tax under this Article should be made by way of a tax return filed in Sweden as, under Swedish domestic law, royalties paid to non-resident recipients are considered to be income from business carried on in Sweden and tax is levied after an ordinary assessment procedure.

The paragraph also allows the competent authorities to settle the mode of application of the limitation in paragraph 2.

(3) Paragraph 3 defines "royalties" for the purposes of the Article. The term includes lump sum payments and certain rents. However, variable or fixed payments for the working of mineral deposits or other natural resources do not fall within the defined term as they are governed by Article 11.

It should be noted that if a payment is made in the form of rent rather than on a royalty basis and the payment comes within the term "royalties", as defined in the Convention, then the 10 percent maximum rate on gross applies. However, rental payments do not constitute royalties under our domestic law and there is, therefore, no non-resident withholding tax applicable. Payments of this nature will be subject to an annual assessment on the net amount after expenses and if the tax so levied exceeds 10 percent of the gross rental, a rebate will be given by virtue of the Convention to bring the tax down to 10 percent of gross.

(4) Paragraph 4: The comments relating to paragraph 4 of the Dividend Article apply equally here, except that New Zealand's domestic law in relation to royalties provides for a withholding tax rate of 15 percent final on cultural royalties or where the aggregate annual royalty payment does not exceed $1,000, and minimum final in all other cases.

(5) Paragraphs 5 and 6: The comments relating to paragraphs 4 and 5 respectively of the Interest Article apply equally here.

(6) Paragraph 7 exempts from tax in the State of source income derived therefrom by a resident of the other State from the sale of patent rights provided the recipient does not have a permanent establishment in the State of source with which the patent rights are effectively connected.

### Article 11 - Income from Real Property

This Article recognises the internationally accepted practice in relation to income from land and the exploitation of land or landed property. The Article also applies to such items as rents, natural resource royalties, farming profits, etc. The principle of the Article is that income from "real property" may be taxed in the country where the property is situated. "Real property" is not defined in our general law but the Article provides an extensive definition. Ships and aircraft are specifically excluded from the term "real property".

The Article involves no change in current practice in relation to the income covered, ie, our domestic law applies.

### Article 12 - Gains from the Alienation of Property

This Article mainly concerns income or gains derived from the alienation of **real** property. Income from such alienation may be taxed in the State where the property is situated. For example if a resident of Sweden sells at a profit a real property situated in New Zealand the profit can be taxed in New Zealand if the New Zealand domestic law permits that taxation. The Article also extends to income or gains from the alienation of shares of a company.

### Article 13 - Government Service

(1) This Article deals with remuneration paid to an individual in respect of services rendered to a Contracting State.

(2) Under paragraph 1 remuneration (other than pensions) paid by a State in respect of services rendered to it shall be taxable only by that State, ie, country of origin or source of the payment.

(3) Paragraph 2 provides that such remuneration may also be taxed in the other State if the services are rendered in that State by an individual who is a citizen of that State **or** who is a resident of that State and did not become a resident of that State solely for the purpose of rendering those services.

This situation can be illustrated as follows.

Remuneration paid by the Swedish Government for services rendered in New Zealand by an individual who is a resident or citizen of New Zealand may be taxed in New Zealand. This is still the position even though the individual, although a citizen of New Zealand, did become a resident of New Zealand for the purposes of rendering those services for the Swedish Government.

(4) Paragraph 3 is a source rule for the purpose of allowing credit under Article 23. Its effect is that the State paying the remuneration has the first right to tax with the other State being required to allow the credit.

(5) Paragraphs 1 and 2 do not apply if the services are performed in connection with trade or business carried on by either State.

### Article 14 - Pensions and Annuities

This Article gives the State of residence exclusive right to tax pensions and annuities. However, Government pensions and pensions paid under a social security system may be taxed in the State paying the pensions, ie, State of source.

### Article 15 - Independent Personal Services

(1) This Article concerns income from professional services (ie, independent personal services) as distinct from income from dependent personal services (eg, remuneration such as salary or wages) which is dealt with separately under Article 16. Income from independent personal services is to be taxed only in the country of residence unless the services are performed in the other State. If the services are performed in the other State they may be taxed in that State but only if:

*   the recipient is present in that State for a period or periods exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in the income year, or
*   the recipient maintains a fixed base in that other State for a period or periods exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in that income year.

The term "fixed base" is intended to cover a centre of activity of a fixed or permanent character, for instance, a doctor's consulting room or the office of an architect or lawyer.

(2) The Article does not apply to public entertainers or athletes who are dealt with under Article 18.

### Article 16 - Dependent Personal Services

(1) Paragraph 1 states the general rule that personal services performed by a resident of one of the Contracting States may be taxed in that other Contracting State, only if the services are performed in that other Contracting State.

(2) Paragraph 2 states the case where exemption will be given by the State visited. The main requirements are that:

*   the visit does not exceed 183 days in the aggregate in the income year,
*   the remuneration is paid by an employer not resident in that State, and
*   the remuneration is not borne by a permanent establishment or fixed base which the employer has in that State.

When a visitor from Sweden undertakes employment in New Zealand, New Zealand PAYE tax will be required to be deducted from the remuneration paid but will be refunded at the time of departure provided the requirements of the Article are fully met. In this respect a certificate must be obtained, by the person seeking exemption, from the Swedish tax authorities which certifies that that person is a resident of Sweden for the purposes of Swedish tax.

(3) Paragraph 3 provides that remuneration derived from employment aboard a ship or aircraft operating in international traffic may be taxed in the State of residence of the shipping or airline enterprise. This means that if the enterprise is a resident of Sweden then Sweden has the right to tax the remuneration derived by the employee. New Zealand would allow credit for any Swedish tax on such remuneration if derived by a New Zealand resident.

### Article 17 - Directors' Fees

This Article allows the State in which the company paying the fees or other similar payments is resident to have the right to tax such income. The income may also be taxed in the country of residence of the director which would therefore, have to allow credit for tax paid in the country of source.

### Article 18 - Public Entertainers and Athletes

(1) Paragraph 1 enables the State in which the entertainer or athlete is performing the services to tax the income derived from these personal activities.

(2) Paragraph 2 deals with the situation where income for the performance of an entertainer or athlete is not paid or not paid in full to the entertainer or athlete himself but to another person. The paragraph permits the State in which the performance is given to impose a tax on the profits diverted from the income of the entertainer or athlete to the enterprise where for instance the entertainer or athlete has control over or rights to the income thus diverted or has obtained or will obtain some benefit directly or indirectly from that income. Without this paragraph the State where the services are being performed would in such cases, be unable to tax:

*   because it would not be personal service income to the entertainer, and
*   in the absence of a permanent establishment the payments could not be taxed as business profits in he hands of the other person.

### Article 19 - Professors and Teachers

Under this Article a Swedish teacher is exempt from New Zealand tax on his income from teaching in New Zealand if:

*   the teachhing income is subject to tax in Sweden;
*   he visits New Zealand for not more than two years;
*   he is a resident of Sweden;
*   his visit is for the purpose of teaching at a university, college, school or other educational institution.

The same rules apply conversely to residents of New Zealand visiting Sweden.

### Article 20 - Students

This Article exempts from New Zealand tax maintenance, education or training payments received here from overseas by a student or a business or trade apprentice from Sweden. Note:

*   The student or apprentice must have been a resident of Sweden immediately before he comes to New Zealand.
*   He must be in New Zealand **solely** for the purpose of his education or training.
*   The payments must be made from sources outside New Zealand.
*   There is no time limit on the period spent in New Zealand.
*   The exemption is restricted to the payments mentioned, ie, for maintenance.

The converse applies to a New Zealand student or apprentice going to Sweden.

### Article 21 - Dual Residents Receiving Income

(1) This Article provides a general rule relating to income not dealt with in the other Articles of the Convention. The effect of the Article is that income derived by a resident of New Zealand is taxed exclusively in New Zealand unless the income is derived from sources in Sweden. If the income is derived from sources in Sweden it may also be taxed there and a credit for the Swedish tax is given in New Zealand should that income be liable for New Zealand tax. The converse will apply in the case of a resident of Sweden. Cases of conflict as to residence are to be determined by reference to Article 3.

(2) A secondary effect of the Article is to clarify the situation of income derived from a third country by a person who could be "resident in" both Sweden and New Zealand under the general laws of each country. Under the Convention that person can be a "resident of" only one country. In such a situation the taxing rights as to the third country income are allocated to the country "of" which he is a resident for the purposes of the Convention.

### Article 22 - Swedish Undivided Estates

Undivided estates in Sweden are taxed as separate entities at progressive rates whilst the beneficiaries are not taxed on distributions. Under this Article Sweden gives exemption or relief to the estate from tax on a New Zealand resident's share of such estate income similar to exemption or relief provided to New Zealand residents under any of the provisions of the Convention. For example, Sweden will tax a New Zealand resident beneficiary's share of interest derived from Swedish sources by the estate at the rate of 10 percent in accordance with Article 9. New Zealand will allow credit for the tax so paid by the estate.

### Article 23 - Credits

(1) This Article contains the normal rules whereby each State gives credit for the other State's tax when assessing its residents on income derived from sources in the other State. It should be noted that the credit provisions in the Article are subject to the domestic law of each country. Under the 1956 Convention Sweden granted exemption by way of deduction from income rather than allowing credit for tax.

(2) Paragraph 3 contains source rules for the purposes of the Article in order to solve any dual source cases which may arise thus facilitating the allowance of a tax credit. Where there is conflict of source rules the paragraph allows the country of origin to tax income under its own source rule and the country of residence will allow credit while retaining the right to tax under its own source rule.

(3) Paragraph 4 provides for a credit to be allowed in respect of the extra tax chargeable where an arm's-length profit has been attributed to an associated enterprise and consequently has been taxed in both States.

(4) Under paragraphs 5 and 6 income exempted from tax in the hands of recipients under the Convention may be included in the amount of total income for rate purposes when calculating the amount of tax credit allowable. In practice in New Zealand the only case where paragraph 6 is applicable is that of remuneration in respect of Government Service. In no other case can a New Zealand resident be exempted by the Convention from tax in the country of residence, ie, New Zealand.

### Article 24 - Exchange of Information

### Article 25 - Mutual Agreement Procedure

### Article 26 - Territorial Extension

These are standard Articles and require no additional comment.

### Article 27 - Entry Into Force

(1) This Article provides that the Convention shall enter into force on the date of exchange of instruments of ratification and shall have effect in New Zealand in respect of income derived during any income year commencing on or after 1 April in the calendar year next following that in which the instruments of ratification are exchanged. As the instruments of ratification were exchanged on 14 November 1980 the Convention will take effect in New Zealand for any income year commencing on or after 1 April 1981. In Sweden the Convention takes effect in respect of income derived on or after 1 January 1981.

(2) Under paragraph 3 the 1956 Convention between the two countries is terminated and its provisions ceased to have effect in New Zealand in respect of income derived during any income year commencing on or after 1 April 1981. In Sweden the 1956 Convention ceased to have effect in respect of income derived on or after 1 January 1981.

### Article 28 - Termination

This Article sets out the procedure if either State wishes to terminate the Convention. Unless notice of termination is given in accordance with the Article the Convention continues indefinitely.

===============================================================

Archived legislative commentary on the Double Taxation Relief (Republic of the Philippines) Order 1980 (SR 1980/215) from PIB vol 112, suppl 4 May 1982.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 112, Supplement No. 4, May 1982

.

Part I - Introduction
---------------------

A double taxation convention has been concluded between the Republic of the Philippines and New Zealand. The text of the convention has been published as a schedule to an Order-in-Council (SR 1980/215) which was recently distributed to district offices and is also available from Government Bookshops.

The convention came into force on 14 May 1981 with effect in New Zealand in respect of income assessable for any income year beginning on or after 1 April 1981. In the Philippines it takes effect for taxation years beginning on or after 1 January 1981.

Part II - Notes on the Convention Article by Article
----------------------------------------------------

### Article 1 - Personal Scope

In terms of paragraph 1 the Convention applies to persons who are residents of one or both of the Contracting States. In this context the term "persons" includes companies, estates and trusts. Under paragraph 2 the Philippines reserves the right to tax its citizens who may be residents of New Zealand. In this case New Zealand **cannot** give credit in the New Zealand tax assessment for Philippines tax paid on any New Zealand source income which is taxed by the Philippines.

### Article 2 - Taxes Covered

The Convention covers income taxes imposed under Title II of the National Internal Revenue Code of the Philippines. With regard to New Zealand the Convention covers income tax and excess retention tax. Paragraph 1(a) of the Protocol confirms that the bonus issue tax in New Zealand is not subject to the Convention. Paragraph 1(b) of the Protocol excludes from the terms "Philippine tax" and "New Zealand tax" any amount which represents a penalty or interest under either country's domestic law.

### Article 3 - General Definitions

(1) **"New Zealand": Paragraph 1(a)(i)**

The term "New Zealand" means the metropolitan territory of New Zealand (including the outlying islands) but does not include the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau. It also includes areas adjacent to the territorial sea of the metropolitan territory of New Zealand over which New Zealand has sovereign rights in respect of the sea, seabed and its subsoil.

(2) "Philippines": Paragraph 1(a)(ii)

"Philippines" means the Republic of the Philippines and when used in a geographical sense means the national territory comprising the Republic of the Philippines.

(3) "National": Paragraph 1(f)

The term "national" is used in paragraphs 2(c) and (d) of Article 4 in determining resident status. It is also used in Article 19 Government Service.

The term covers any citizen of either country and any legal person, partnership or association under the laws of either country.

(4) Undefined Terms: Paragraph 2

This is a standard provision. Where a term is not defined it has the meaning applicable under the domestic law of the country applying the Convention.

### Article 4 - Resident

(1) Paragraph 1 defines the meaning of the term "resident of a Contracting State" (ie, for the purposes of Article 1). In effect the defined term is a reference to the domestic law of each country. Whenever the term is used in the Convention, the residence of the taxpayer must first be determined in accordance with this Article.

(2) Paragraph 2 sets out the tests to be applied to solve the problem of a dual resident **individual**. Dual residence arises when a taxpayer is resident in both countries by virtue of the domestic law of each country. The paragraph gives preference to the country in which the individual has a permanent home available to him. This criterion will frequently be sufficient to solve the conflict, eg, where the individual has a permanent home in one country and has only stayed a certain length of time in the other country. See also paragraph (4) below.

(3) Paragraph 3 sets out the rule to determine the case of a company or other legal person which is resident in both countries. These cases will be decided by the competent authorities (defined in Article 3(1)(h)) under the mutual agreement procedure(refer Article 24). Generally, competent authority intervention will not be necessary as residence will be decided on where the place of day to day management of the enterprise is situated, irrespective of where the overriding control is exercised.

(4) In applying the tests to dual residents it should be remembered that these tests apply only for the purposes of the tax convention. If the person **resident in New Zealand** (domestic law test) becomes for the purposes of the Convention a "resident of the Philippines" after the tests have been applied, this does **not** mean that he is a non-resident for all purposes of New Zealand tax law. For example he can never be subject to non-resident withholding tax, the reason being that although he is treated as a non-resident for certain purposes of the Convention, he is still a resident under the New Zealand Income Tax Act. What it does mean is that he is entitled to any benefits granted by the Convention to a "resident of the Philippines". Thus, although not subject to withholding tax on, for example, New Zealand royalty income, the royalty income would be subject to New Zealand income tax and would still qualify for the 15 percent limitation in the Convention.

### Article 5 - Permanent Establishment

This Article defines the term "permanent establishment". This concept determines the right of a Contracting State to tax the profits of an "enterprise of the other Contracting State". Due to the inclusion of the words "includes especially" in paragraph 2, the examples cited as constituting a permanent establishment are by no means exhaustive.

The definition of "permanent establishment" is fairly standard and the following points should be noted:

*   A building site or construction or installation or assembly project constitutes a permanent establishment if it lasts for more than 6 months.
*   An enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment if it carries on supervisory activities for more than 6 months in connection with a building site or construction or installation or assembly project.
*   A place for the furnishing of services, including consultancy services, by an enterprise through employees or other personnel constitutes a permanent establishment where the service activities last for more than 183 days within any twelve month period.

### Article 6 - Income from Immovable Property

This Article recognises the internationally accepted practice in relation to income from land and the exploitation of land or landed property. The Article also applies to such items as rents, natural resource royalties, farming profits, etc. The principle of the Article is that income from "immovable property" may be taxed in the country where the property is situated. "Immovable property" is not defined in our general law but the Article provides extensive definition. Ships and aircraft are specifically excluded from the term "immovable property".

The Article involves no change in current practice in relation to the income covered.

### Article 7 - Business Profits

This Article is in many respects a continuation of, and a corollary to, Article 5 on the definition of the concept of permanent establishment. Under Article 7 a Contracting State cannot tax the profits of an enterprise of the other Contracting State unless it carries on its business through a permanent establishment situated therein. If a permanent establishment exists the Article goes on to lay down a set of rules by reference to which the profits of the permanent establishment are to be calculated.

Before dealing with the salient features of the Article some comment is warranted on the importance of paragraph 8. This is because reference to this Article and Article 5 will not always be necessary to determine the liability of specific types of income. In effect paragraph 8 gives first preference to the other Articles in the Convention. It follows that this Article will only be applicable to business profits which do not belong to the categories of income covered by the special Articles, and in addition, to dividends, royalties and interest which **specifically** come within the **circumstances** detailed in paragraph 4 of Articles 10 and 12, paragraph 3 of Article 11 and consequently fall within Article 7.

(1) Paragraph 1 expresses the general rule that profits are taxable only in the country of residence unless the enterprise is engaged in business in the other country through a permanent establishment, in which case the other country may tax the profits of the permanent establishment.

*   It is important to note that only income attributable directly to the permanent establishment's operations can form part of the establishment's operations. This does not mean that income which is not directly attributable to the establishment's operations escapes liability for tax. For example, the restriction on the rate of tax imposed by paragraph 2 of Articles 10, 11 and 12, which concern dividend, interest and royalty payments respectively, would apply if such income did not arise from the permanent establishment's operations.
*   Note also that where an enterprise carries on in another country, any sales or business activities which are the same or similar to those carried out by its permanent establishment in that country, then the profits from those sales or business activities are deemed to be part of the permanent establishment's income.

(2) Paragraph 2 contains the normal provision enabling arm's-length profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment if necessary.

(3) Paragraph 3 merely expresses the taxpayer's right to deduct from the profits of the permanent establishment, the expenses incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, even if those expenses are incurred outside the country where the permanent establishment is situated.

(4) Paragraph 4 provides that where the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment are determined, not on the basis of separate accounts or by making an estimate or arm's-length profit, but simply by apportioning the total profits of the enterprise by reference to various formulae, then such a method may continue to be employed provided it has been customary to adopt such a practice. Such a method differs from those envisaged in paragraph 2 of Article 7, since it contemplates not an attribution of profits on a separate enterprise footing, but an apportionment of total profits. However, in general the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment should be determined by reference to the establishment's accounts if these reflect the real facts. A method of allocation which is based on apportioning total profits is generally not as appropriate as a method which has regard only to the activities of the permanent establishment and should be used only where it has as a matter of history been customary in the past and is accepted by the Department and taxpayer as being satisfactory.

(5) Paragraph 5 precludes the deduction by the permanent establishment of payments made to its head office by way of patent royalties, commission or management charges, and interest (except for interest in respect of money borrowed by a bank).

(6) Paragraph 6 precludes the attribution of profits to a permanent establishment by reason of merely purchasing activities carried on by the permanent establishment for the enterprise.

(7) Paragraph 7 provides that unless there are good and sufficient reasons to the contrary the profits attributed to a permanent establishment must be determined by the same method each year.

(8) Paragraph 8: refer second paragraph of preamble above.

(9) In terms of paragraph 2 of the Protocol, income from the business of any form of insurance is not subject to the provisions of this Article. Such income may be taxed in accordance with the domestic law of each country.

### Article 8 - Shipping and Aircraft

(1) Under paragraph 1 profits from operating ships or aircraft in "international traffic" - defined in Article 3(1)(f) - are to be taxed only in the country of residence of the enterprise. However, under paragraph 2 if the profits are derived from business conducted in the other country, ie, not the country of residence but the country of source, that other country may impose a tax of up to 1 1/2 percent of the gross revenue derived therefrom by the non-resident enterprise. In this instance, the country of residence would have to give credit for tax paid in the country of source.

International shipping and aircraft profits include income from:

*   carriage of passengers and cargo;
*   sale of passenger tickets on behalf of other enterprises;
*   commercial advertising;
*   charter fees (but refer paragraph (3) below).

(2) Due to the definition of "international traffic" exemption does not extend to profits derived from coastal traffic. Further, investment income of shipping and air transport enterprises is subject to the treatment ordinarily applied to that class of income, eg, dividends derived would be subject to Article 10.

(3) Profits obtained from leasing a ship or aircraft on charter fully equipped, manned and supplied, whether or not the enterprise providing the ship or aircraft actually owns it, would be treated as profits from the operation of a ship or aircraft. However, the Article does not extend to profits from leasing a ship or aircraft on a bare boat charter basis **except** when it is an occasional source of income for an enterprise engaged in the international operation of ships or aircraft. Apart from this one exception, bare boat charter fees would normally be classified as business profits and consequently dealt with under Article 7.

### Article 9 - Associated Enterprises

This is a standard Article enabling an arm's length profit to be attributed to associated enterprises.

### Article 10 - Dividends

For the purposes of this Article, paragraph (5) of the Protocol provides that dividends in respect of which a trustee is subject to tax in New Zealand may be treated as being beneficially owned by that trustee.

(1)Paragraph 1 of the Article simply states that dividends may be taxed in the State of the recipient's residence.

(2) Paragraph 2 provides that the Contracting State from which the dividends are paid also has the right to tax, but the maximum tax that can be imposed is not to exceed:

*   15 percent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company;
*   25 percent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases.

Therefore, in terms of the Convention New Zealand's taxing rights will be restricted to 15 percent or 25 percent of the gross dividend even though the rate under domestic law is 30 percent. This also means that the withholding tax rate on gross dividends flowing to individuals resident in the Philippines increased from 15 percent to 25 percent as from 1 April 1982. The Philippines tax is reduced from a 35 percent domestic rate to 15 percent or 25 percent as above. In the case of New Zealand the limitation is to be achieved by withholding tax of 15 percent or 25 percent being deducted by companies paying the dividends to residents of the Philippines.

(3) Paragraph 3 defines "dividends" for the purposes of the Article. The effect is that "dividends" has the meaning given to it by section 4 of the Income Tax Act 1976.

(4) Paragraph 4 concerns shares which are effectively connected with a permanent establishment. The paragraph provides that in the State of source the dividends are taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment there owned by the recipient which is a resident of the other State, **provided** they are paid in respect of holdings forming part of the assets of the permanent establishment or otherwise effectively connected with that establishment. In effect this relieves the State of source of the dividends from any limitations under the Article.

The rules set out above also apply where the recipient of the dividends has in the other State, for the purposes of performing any of the kinds of independent personal services mentioned in Article 14, a fixed base with which the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected.

Up until 1 April 1982 these qualifications had no effect on the New Zealand tax position because our domestic law provided for a 15 percent final withholding tax in all cases on the gross payment and no convention can extend the taxing rights under domestic law. However, in view of the change in the New Zealand domestic law from 1 April 1982 the New Zealand tax on dividends paid in respect of shares effectively connected with a permanent establishment is 30 percent.

(5) Paragraph 5: The main effect of this paragraph is that it restricts the application of taxes on undistributed profits. For example, New Zealand cannot impose excess retention tax or bonus issue tax (refer paragraph 4 of Protocol) on a privately controlled company which is a "resident of the Philippines".

(6) Paragraph 6 limits to 15 percent of the amount remitted abroad the remittance tax which the Philippines may impose on profits remitted from the Philippines by a permanent establishment of a New Zealand company.

### Article 11 - Interest

For the purposes of this Article, paragraph (5) of the Protocol provides that interest in respect of which a trustee is subject to tax in New Zealand may be treated as being beneficially owned by that trustee.

(1) Paragraph 1 affirms the taxing right of the State in which the recipient of the interest is a resident.

(2) Paragraph 2 also affirms the taxing right of the State in which the interest arises, but the maximum tax that can be imposed is 15 percent of the gross amount of the interest. New Zealand's tax is therefore limited to a maximum of 15 percent in all cases. The Philippines tax is reduced from a 35 percent domestic rate to 15 percent under this Convention.

(3) Paragraph 3 defines interest for the purpose of the Article. Penalty charges are excluded from the term.

(4) Paragraph 4 provides that in the State of source, interest is taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment there owned by the recipient which is a resident of the other State, **provided** the indebtedness in respect of which the interest is paid forms part of the assets of the permanent establishment or otherwise is effectively connected with that establishment. In effect this paragraph relieves the State of source of the interest from the 15 percent limitation under the Article.

The rules set out above also apply where the recipient of the interest has in the other State, for the purposes of performing any of the kinds of professional services mentioned in Article 14, a fixed base with which the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected.

These qualifications tie in with the New Zealand domestic law which provides that if a non-resident has a fixed establishment in New Zealand, then interest derived is not subject to non-resident withholding tax but is to be assessed on an annual basis.

(5) Paragraph 5 is a source rule and precludes argument as to the source of the interest. The paragraph also deals with interest arising through a permanent establishment or fixed base. Where a loan was contracted for the requirements of that establishment and the interest is borne by the latter, the paragraph determines that the source of the interest is in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated, leaving aside the place of residence of the owner of that establishment or base.

(6) Paragraph 6 is an anti-avoidance provision to ensure that only a reasonable interest payment is taxed at the reduced rate specified in the Convention.

(7) Paragraph 7 exempts in the country of source interest derived by the Government, governmental body or central bank of the other State.

(8) Paragraph 8 limits to 10 percent the withholding tax which can be imposed by the Philippines on interest paid by a resident Philippines **company** to a New Zealand resident of public issues of bonds, debentures or other similar obligations.

### Article 12 - Royalties

For the purposes of this Article, paragraph 5 of the Protocol provides that royalties in respect of which a trustee is subject to tax in New Zealand may be treated as being beneficially owned by that trustee.

(1) Paragraph 1 affirms the taxing right of the State in which the recipient of the royalties is a resident.

(2) Paragraph 2 also affirms the taxing right of the State in which the royalty arises, but the maximum tax that can be imposed is not to exceed:

*   in the case of New Zealand, 15 percent of the gross amount of the royalty; and
*   in the case of the Philippines,
    *   15 percent of the gross amount of the royalties where the royalties are paid by an enterprise registered with the Philippine Board of Investment and engaged in preferred areas of activities; and
    *   in all other cases, 25 percent of the gross amount of the royalties.

New Zealand's tax is therefore limited to a maximum of 15 percent in all cases. The Philippines tax is reduced from a 35 percent domestic rate to 15 percent or 25 percent as above. With regard to royalties paid to a resident of New Zealand by an enterprise registered with the Philippine Board of Investments and engaged in preferred areas of activities refer to the Credit Provisions set out in paragraph 2 of Article 23.

(3) Paragraph 3 defines "royalties" for the purposes of the Article. The term includes lump sum payments and certain rents. It should be noted that under paragraph 6 of the Protocol the definition is extended to include payments which are dependent upon production, sales, performance, results or any other similar basis. However, variable or fixed payments for the working of mineral deposits or other natural resources do not fall within the defined term as they are governed by Article 6.

It should also be noted that if a payment is made in the form of rent rather than on a royalty basis and the payment comes within the term "royalties", then the 15 percent or 25 percent maximum rate on gross applies. However, rental payments do not constitute royalties under our domestic law and there is, therefore, no non-resident withholding tax applicable. Payments of this nature will be subject to an annual assessment on the net amount after expenses and if the tax so levied exceeds 15 percent of the gross rental, a rebate will be given by virtue of the Convention to bring the tax down to 15 percent of gross.

(4) Paragraph 4 provides that in the State of source royalties are taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment there owned by the recipient which is a resident of the other State, **provided** the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with that establishment. In effect this relieves the State of source of the royalties from the 15 percent limitation under the Article.

The rules set out above also apply where the recipient of the royalties has in the other State, for the purpose of performing any of the kinds of professional services mentioned in Article 14, a fixed base with which the knowledge, information, assistance, right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected.

New Zealand's domestic law in relation to royalties provides for a withholding tax rate of 15 percent final on copyright (cultural) royalties or where the aggregate annual royalty payments do not exceed $1,000, and minimum final in all other cases.

(5) Paragraphs 5 and 6: The comments to paragraphs 5 and 6 respectively of the Interest Article apply equally here.

### Article 13 - Income from Alienation of Property

(1) Paragraph 1 concerns income or gains derived from the alienation of **real** property. Income from such alienation may be taxed in the State where the property is situated. For example, if a resident of Germany sells at a profit a real property situated in New Zealand, the profit can be taxed in New Zealand if the New Zealand domestic law permits that taxation. In terms of paragraph 7 of the Protocol the Article extends to income or gains from the alienation of shares of a company or gains from the alienation of an interest in a partnership or trust.

(2) Paragraph 2 deals with income or gains derived from the alienation of **movable** property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment or pertaining to a fixed base used for the performing of independent personal services. This may be taxed in the State where the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.

(3) Paragraph 3 provides that income or gains from the alienation of ships or aircraft operated in international traffic are taxable only in the State of residence of the enterprise.

(4) Paragraph 4 stipulates that any income or gains from any property not covered by the Article is to be taxable only in the State in which the alienator is a resident.

### Article 14 - Dependent Personal Services

(1) This Article concerns income from professional personal services (ie, independent personal services) as distinct from income from dependent personal services (eg, remuneration such as salary and wages) which is dealt with separately under Article 15. Under paragraph 1 income from independent personal services is taxable only in the State of residence unless the services are performed in the other State, in which case that other State also has the right to tax the income therefrom. However, an exemption will be given by the State visited provided:

*   the visit or visits do not exceed 183 days in the aggregate in the income year, **or**
*   the income is not attributable to a fixed base regularly available to the taxpayer in that other State.

The term "fixed base" is intended to cover a centre of activity of a fixed or permanent character, for instance, a doctor's consulting room or the office of an architect or lawyer.

(2) Where a resident of a Contracting State derives income from residents of the other State in respect of independent personal services, paragraph 2 allows the income derived to be taxed in that other State provided that income exceeds $11,000.

(3) This Article does not apply to artistes and athletes They are dealt with under Article 17.

### Article 15 - Dependent Personal Services

(1) Paragraph 1 states the general rule that personal services performed by a resident of one of the Contracting States may be taxed in that other Contracting State, only if the services are performed in that other Contracting State.

(2) Paragraph 2 states the case where exemption will be given by the State visited. The main requirements are that the visit does not exceed 183 days in the aggregate in the income year, that the remuneration is paid by an employer not resident in that State, and is not borne by a permanent establishment or fixed base which the employer has in that state. Initially New Zealand PAYE tax will be required to be deducted from the remuneration paid but will be refunded at the time of departure provided the requirements of the Article are fully met. In this respect a certificate must be obtained, by the person seeking exemption, from the Philippines tax authorities which certifies that that person is a resident of the Philippines for the purpose of Philippines tax.

(3) Paragraph 3 provides that remuneration derived from employment aboard a ship or aircraft operating in international traffic may be taxed in the State of residence of the shipping or airline enterprise. This means that if the State of residence of the enterprise is the Philippines then the Philippines has the right to tax the remuneration derived by the employee. New Zealand would allow credit for any Philippine tax on such remuneration if derived by a New Zealand resident.

### Article 16 - Directors' Fees

This Article allows the State in which the company paying the fees or other similar payments is resident, to have the right to tax such income and the country of residence is obliged to give credit for a tax so charged.

Paragraph 2 precludes the Article from applying to income from personal services. This is dealt with under Article 15.

### Article 17 - Artistes and Athletes

(1) Paragraph 1 enables the State in which the entertainer or athlete is performing the services to tax the income derived from these personal services.

(2) Paragraph 2 deals with the situation where income for the performance of an entertainer or athlete is not paid to the entertainer or athlete himself but to an enterprise providing the services of the entertainer or athlete. The paragraph permits the State in which the performance is given, to impose a tax on the profits diverted from the income of the entertainer or athlete to the enterprise where, for instance, the entertainer or athlete has control over or rights to the income thus diverted, or has obtained or will obtain some benefit directly or indirectly from that income. Without this paragraph the State where the services are being performed would in such cases, be unable to tax:

*   because it would not be personal service income to the entertainer, and
*   in the absence of a permanent establishment the payments could not be taxed as business profits in the hands of the other person.

(3) The effect of paragraph 3 is that the State in which the activities are performed will not tax the income derived there, in the following circumstances:

*   the visit to that State is substantially supported by the public funds of the other State, or
*   the income from the visit is derived by a non-profit making organisation which is certified as qualifying by the competent authority of the other State.

The term "substantially supported" is not defined, therefore to qualify under this provision each case will have to be determined on the facts available. For practical purposes, in respect of visits to New Zealand it will be necessary for the Philippine artistes or athletes to produce written evidence from the Philippine competent authority certifying that they qualify under the provisions of paragraph 3 of Article 17.

### Article 18 - Pensions

(1) Paragraph 1 gives the State of **residence** exclusive right to tax pensions and annuities where they are paid in consideration of past employment. However, this rule is subject to Article 19(2) wherein Government pensions paid in respect of services rendered are taxed exclusively in the State of source but if the recipient is a resident **and** a national of the other State the pensions are taxable on a residence basis. (See definition of "national" in Article 3.) This means that a Philippines Government pension paid to a resident of New Zealand is taxed only in the Philippines and exempt in New Zealand unless the recipient is also a national of New Zealand in which case the pension is taxed only in New Zealand and exempt in the Philippines.

(2) Paragraph 2 states that social security pensions are taxable only in the State paying the pensions, ie, State of source.

(3) Paragraph 3 defines the terms "pensions" and "annuities" respectively.

### Article 19 - Government Service

This Article deals with remuneration paid to an individual in respect of services rendered to a State or political subdivision or local authority thereof.

(1) Paragraph 1 provides for two situations:

*   Remuneration received by Government servants is generally to be taxed only in the country paying the remuneration, ie, country of origin or source of the payment.
*   However, such remuneration is taxable only in the country where the services are performed provided the services are performed there:
    *   by an individual who is a resident and also a national of that country, or
    *   by an individual who is a resident of that country and did not become a resident of that country solely for the purpose of performing those services.

(2) The second situation can be illustrated as follows.

*   Remuneration paid by the Philippines Government for services rendered in New Zealand by an individual who is a resident and national of New Zealand shall be taxed exclusively in New Zealand. This is still the position even though the individual, although a national (citizen) of New Zealand, became a resident of New Zealand for the purposes of rendering those services for the Philippines Government.

(3) Paragraph 2 deals with Government pensions. (See explanation to Article 18 in this supplement).

(4) Paragraphs 1 and 2 do not apply if the services are performed in connection with business carried on by that State, or one of its political subdivisions or local authorities, paying the remuneration. Under paragraph 3 the ordinary rules apply: Article 15 for wages and salaries, Article 16 for directors' fees and Article 18 for pensions. Article 17 is not mentioned because paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 19 are to apply to remuneration paid to artistes employed by the State irrespective of whether such artistes could be said to be rendering services in connection with business carried on by the State.

### Article 20 - Professors and Teachers

(1) Under paragraph 1 a Philippines teacher is exempt from New Zealand tax on income from teaching or carrying out advanced study or research in New Zealand if:

*   he visits New Zealand for not more than 2 years;
*   he is a resident of the Philippines;
*   his visit is for the purpose of teaching or carrying out advanced study or research at a university, college, school or other educational institution.

The same rules apply conversely to residents of New Zealand visiting the Philippines for the same purpose.

(2) Paragraph 2 sets out the condition that this Article is not to apply if the research is undertaken for the private benefit of a specific person or persons, ie, the research should be undertaken in the public interest.

(3) Paragraph 3 states that remuneration received in terms of paragraph 1 includes payments made from sources outside the State visited to enable the professor or teacher to carry out his teaching or research activities.

### Article 21 - Students and Trainees

(1) Under paragraph 1 students or business apprentices visiting a Contracting State for the purpose of education or training are exempt from tax on payments they receive from overseas for their maintenance, education or training. In the case of a Philippine student visiting New Zealand, note:

*   The student, apprentice or trainee must have been a resident of the Philippines immediately before he comes to New Zealand.
*   He must be in New Zealand solely for the purpose of his education or training or as a trainee solely for the purpose of acquiring technical, professional or business experience.
*   The payments must be made from sources outside New Zealand.
*   There is no time limit on the period spent in New Zealand.
*   The exemption is restricted to the payments mentioned, ie, for maintenance.

The converse applies to a New Zealand student or apprentice going to the Philippines.

(2) Paragraph 2 exempts from New Zealand tax the amount received by a student or trainee from a grant, allowance or award made under an arrangement or assistance programme entered into by the Government of New Zealand. The conditions under which the exemption is given are similar to those set out in paragraph 1. In applying this provision refer to section 60(1) and section 61(38) of the Income Tax Act 1976.

### Article 22 - Other Income

This Article provides a general rule relating to income not expressly mentioned in the other Articles of the Convention. A secondary effect of the Article is to clarify the situation of income derived from a third country by a person who could be "resident in" both the Philippines and New Zealand under the general laws of each country. Under the Convention that person can be a "resident of" only one country. In such a situation the taxing rights as to the third country income are allocated to the country "of" which he is a resident for the purposes of the Convention.

The effect of paragraph 1 is that income derived by a resident of New Zealand is taxed exclusively in New Zealand unless the income is derived from sources in the Philippines. If the income is derived from sources in the Philippines it may also be taxed there and a credit for the Philippine tax is given in New Zealand, should that income be liable for New Zealand tax. The converse will apply in the case of a resident of the Philippines. Cases of conflict between two residences are to be determined by reference to Article 4.

### Article 23 - Relief from Double Taxation

This Article contains the normal rules whereby each State gives credit for the other State's tax when assessing its residents on income derived from sources in the other State. It should be noted that the credit provisions in the Article are subject to the domestic law of each country.

(1) Paragraph 1 sets out the credit provisions in the case of the Philippines where credit will be allowed for New Zealand tax on income from sources in New Zealand up to the amount of the Philippines tax on that income.

(2) Paragraph 2 sets out the credit provisions in the case of New Zealand. It should be noted that under this paragraph New Zealand is to provide "tax sparing" in respect of income from royalties derived from a New Zealand resident from an enterprise registered with the Philippine Board of Investments and engaged in preferred areas of activity. This means that in addition to allowing credit for the Philippine tax paid on such royalties (15 percent as per Article 12) New Zealand allows a notional credit of 10 percent of the gross amount of such royalties. Therefore New Zealand can allow a credit of up to 25 percent of the gross amount of the royalties against the income tax payable by a resident of New Zealand.

(3) The final sentence is a source rule for the purposes of the Article to facilitate the allowance of a tax credit or complete exemption.

### Article 24 - Mutual Agreement Procedure

### Article 25 - Exchange of Information

These Articles are to be implemented solely through Head Office.

### Article 26 - Territorial Extension

This is a standard Article and requires no additional comment.

### Article 27 - Diplomatic and Consular Officers

The aim of this Article is to ensure that diplomatic officers shall, under the Convention, receive no less favourable treatment than that to which they are entitled under international law or under special international agreements.

### Article 28 - Entry into Force

This Article provides that the Convention shall enter into force upon the exchange of the instruments of ratification and shall have effect in New Zealand in respect of income assessable for any income year beginning on or after 1 April in the calendar year in which such exchange of instruments takes place. As the instruments of ratification were exchanged on 14 May 1981 the Convention will generally take effect in New Zealand from the income year which commenced on 1 April 1981 and in the Philippines from the taxation year which commenced on 1 January 1981.

### Article 29 - Termination

This Article sets out the procedure if either State wishes to terminate the Convention. Unless notice of termination is given in accordance with the Article the Convention continues indefinitely.

### Protocol

The Protocol forms an integral part of the Convention containing additional provisions in relation to certain Articles of the Convention. The main points are referred to earlier in this supplement on an Article by Article basis.

Double Taxation Convention With The Kingdom Of Denmark
------------------------------------------------------

Part I - Introduction
---------------------

The text of the Convention has been published as a schedule to an Order-in-Council (SR 1981/108) which was recently distributed to district offices. It is available to the public from Government Bookshops.

The Convention entered into force on 22 June 1981 with effect in New Zealand from the income year beginning on 1 April 1981. In Denmark it takes effect from 1 January 1981.

The Convention is generally drafted in accordance with the 1977 OECD Model Double Taxation Convention.

Part II - Notes on the Convention Article by Article
----------------------------------------------------

Article 1 - Personal Scope
--------------------------

The Convention applies to persons who are **residents** of one or both of the Contracting States. In this context the term "persons" includes a company.

Article 2 - Taxes Covered
-------------------------

In Denmark the Convention covers income taxes imposed by the State and Municipalities. With regard to New Zealand the Convention covers income tax and excess retention tax. Paragraph (a) of the Protocol confirms that the bonus issue tax in New Zealand is not subject to the Convention.

### Article 3 - General Definition

1\. **"National": Paragraph 1. (f)**

The term "national" is used in paragraph 2(c) and 2(d) of Article 4 in determining residence status. It is also used in Article 19 Government Service.

In New Zealand the term covers any individual who is a New Zealand citizen. In Denmark the term covers any individual who is a Danish citizen.

2\. Undefined Terms: Paragraph 4

This is a standard provision. Where a term is not defined it has the meaning applicable under the domestic law of the country applying the Convention.

### Article 4 - Resident

1\. Paragraph 1 defines the meaning of the term "resident of a Contracting State" (ie, for the purposes of Article 1). In effect the defined term is a reference to the domestic law of each country. Whenever the term is used in the Convention, the residence of the taxpayer must first be determined in accordance with this Article.

2\. Paragraph 2 sets out the tests to be applied to solve the problem of a dual resident individual. Dual residence arises when a taxpayer is resident in both countries by virtue of the domestic law of each country. The paragraph gives preference to the country in which the individual has a permanent home available to him. This criterion will frequently be sufficient to solve the conflict, eg, where the individual has a permanent home in one country and has only stayed a certain length of time in the other country. See also paragraph 4. below.

3\. Paragraph 3 sets out the rule to determine the case of a company or other legal person which is resident in both countries. Residence will be where the place of effective management of the enterprise is situated. In this respect New Zealand views the term "effective management" as meaning the practical day to day management, irrespective of where the overriding control is exercised.

4\. In applying the tests to dual residents it should be remembered that these tests apply only for the purposes of the tax convention. If the person **resident in New Zealand** (domestic law test) becomes for the purposes of the Convention a "Resident of Denmark" after the tests have been applied, this does not mean that he is a non-resident for all purposes of New Zealand tax law. For example he can never be subject to non-resident withholding tax, the reason being that although he is treated as a non-resident for certain purposes of the Convention, he is still a resident under the New Zealand Income Tax Act. What it does mean is that he is entitled to any benefits granted by the Convention to a "Resident of Denmark". Thus, although not subject to withholding tax on, for example, New Zealand royalty income, the royalty income would be subject to New Zealand income tax and he would still qualify for the 10 percent limitation in the Convention.

### Article 5 - Permanent Establishment

This Article defines the term "permanent establishment". This concept determines the right of a Contracting State to tax the profits of an "enterprise of the other Contracting State". Due to the inclusion of the words "includes especially" in paragraph 2, the examples cited as constituting a permanent establishment are by no means exhaustive.

The definition of "permanent establishment" is fairly standard and the following points should be noted:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Para 3 | A building site or construction or installation project constitutes a permanent establishment if it lasts for more than 12 months. |
| Para 5(a) | An enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment if it carries on for more than 12 months supervisory activities in connection with a building site or construction or installation project. |
| Para 5 (b) | An enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment if it carries on for more than 12 months activities in connection with the exploration or exploitation in the sea-bed and subsoil and their natural resources. In this context "activities" includes the activities of supply ships and deep sea divers. |

### Article 6 - Income from Immovable Property

This Article recognises the internationally accepted practice in relation to income from land or landed property. The Article also applies to such items as rents, natural resource royalties, farming profits, etc. The principle of the Article is that income from "immovable property" is not defined in our general law but the Article provides an extensive definition. Ships and aircraft are specifically excluded from the term "immovable property".

The Article involves no change in current practice in relation to the income covered, ie, our domestic law applies.

### Article 7 - Business Profits

This Article is in many respects a continuation of, and a corollary to, Article 5 on the definition of the concept of permanent establishment. Under Article 7 a Contracting State cannot tax the profits of an enterprise of the other Contracting State unless it carries on its business through a permanent establishment situated therein. If a permanent establishment exists the Article goes on to lay down a set of rules by reference to which are to be calculated the profits of the permanent establishment.

Before dealing with the salient features of the Article some comment is warranted on the importance of paragraph 7. This is because reference to this Article and Article 5 will not always be necessary to determine the liability of specific types of income. In effect paragraph 7 gives first preference to the other Articles in the Convention. It follows that this Article will only be applicable to business profits which do not belong to the categories of income covered by the special Articles, and in addition, to dividends, interest and royalties which specifically come within the circumstances detailed in paragraphs 4 of Articles 10, 11 and 12, and consequently fall within Article 7.

1\. Paragraph 1 expresses the general rule that profits are taxable only in the country of residence unless the enterprise is engaged in business in the other country through a permanent establishment, in which case the other country may tax the profits of the permanent establishment.

It is important to note that only income attributable directly to the permanent establishment's operations can form part of the establishment's operations. This does not mean that income which is not directly attributable to the establishment's operations escapes liability for tax (see para 2. above). For example, the restriction on the rate of tax imposed by paragraph 2 of Articles 10, 11 and 12, which concern dividend, interest and royalty payments respectively, would still apply if such income did not arise from the permanent establishment's operations.

2\. Paragraph 2 contains the normal provision enabling arm's-length profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment if necessary.

3\. Paragraph 3 merely expresses the taxpayer's right to deduct from the profits of the permanent establishment the expenses incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment even if those expenses are incurred outside the country where the permanent establishment is situated.

4\. Paragraph 4 provides that where the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment are determined, not on the basis of separate accounts or by making an estimate of arm's-length profit, but simply by apportioning the total profits of the enterprise by reference to various formulae then such a method may continue to be employed provided it has been customary to adopt such a practice. Such a method differs from those envisaged in paragraph 2 of Article 7, since it contemplates not an attribution of profits on a separate enterprise footing, but an apportionment of total profits. However, in general the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment should be determined by reference to the establishment's accounts if these reflect the real facts. A method of allocation which is based on apportioning total profits is generally not as appropriate as a method which has regard only to the activities of the permanent establishment and should be used only where it has as a matter of history been customary in the past and is accepted by the Department and taxpayer as being satisfactory.

5\. Paragraph 5 precludes the attribution of profits to a permanent establishment by reason of merely purchasing activities carried on by the permanent establishment for the enterprise.

6\. Paragraph 6 provides that unless there are good and sufficient reasons to the contrary the profits attributed to a permanent establishment must be determined by the same method each year.

7\. Paragraph 7: refer to second paragraph of preamble above.

8\. In terms of paragraph (b) of the Protocol income from the business of any form of insurance is not subject to the provisions of this Article. Such income may be taxed in accordance with the domestic law of each country.

### Article 8 - Shipping and Air Transport

1\. Under this Article profits from operating ships or aircraft in "international traffic" - defined in Article 31. (g) are to be taxed only in the country of residence of the enterprise. International shipping and aircraft profits include income from:

*   carriage of passengers and cargo;
*   sale of passenger tickets on behalf of other enterprises;
*   commercial advertising;
*   charter fees (but refer paragraph 3. below).

2\. Due to the definition of "international traffic" exemption does not extend to profits derived from coastal traffic. Further, investment income of shipping and air transport enterprises is subject to the treatment ordinarily applied to that class of income, eg, dividends derived would be subject to Article 10.

3\. Profits obtained from leasing a ship or aircraft on charter fully equipped, manned and supplied, whether or not the enterprise providing the ship or aircraft actually owns them, would be treated as profits from the operation of a ship or aircraft. However, the Article does not extend to profits from leasing a ship or aircraft on a bare boat charter basis except when it is an occasional source of income for an enterprise engaged in the international operation of ships or aircraft. Apart from this one exception, bare boat charter fees would normally be classified as business profits and consequently dealt with under Article 7.

### Article 9 - Associated Enterprises

This is a standard Article enabling an arm's-length profit to be attributed to associated enterprises.

### Article 10 - Dividends

1\. Paragraph 1 of the Article simply states that dividends may be taxed in the State of the recipient's residence.

2\. Paragraph 2 provides that the Contracting State from which the dividends are paid also has the right to tax, but the maximum tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 15 percent of the gross amount of the dividends. Therefore, in terms of the Convention New Zealand's taxing rights will be restricted to 15 percent of the gross dividend even though the rate under domestic law is 30 percent from 1 April 1982. The Danish tax is, however, reduced from a 30 percent domestic rate to 15 percent. In the case of New Zealand the limitation is to be achieved by withholding tax of 15 percent being deducted by companies paying the dividends to residents of Denmark.

The paragraph also allows the competent authorities to settle the mode of application of paragraph 2.

3\. Paragraph 3 defines "dividends" for the purposes of the Article. The effect is that "dividends" has the meaning given to it by section 4 of the Income Tax Act 1976.

4\. Paragraph 4 concerns shares which are effectively connected with a permanent establishment. The paragraph provides that in the State of source the dividends are taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment there owned by the recipient which is a resident of the other State, **provided** they are paid in respect of holdings forming part of the assets of the permanent establishment or otherwise effectively connected with that establishment. In effect this relieves the State of source of the dividends from the 15 percent limitations under the Article.

The rules set out above also apply where the recipient of the dividends has in the other State, for the purpose of performing any of the kinds of independent personal services mentioned in Article 14, a fixed base with which the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected.

Up until 1 April 1982 these qualifications had no effect on the New Zealand tax position because our domestic law provided for a 15 percent final withholding tax in all cases on the gross payment and no convention can extend the taxing rights under domestic law. However, in view of the change in the New Zealand domestic law from 1 April 1982 the New Zealand tax on dividends paid in respect of shares effectively connected with a permanent establishment will be 30 percent.

5\. Paragraph 5: The main effect of this paragraph is that it restricts the application of taxes on undistributed profits. For example, New Zealand cannot impose excess retention tax on a private controlled company which is a "resident of Denmark".

6\. Under paragraph 6 New Zealand resident individuals receiving dividends from Danish companies are entitled to the imputation tax credit equivalent to the credit available to Danish residents under their imputation system of taxing dividends. The effect of this is that the qualifying New Zealand resident shareholders receive, in addition to the dividend, a payment from the Danish Government, currently equal to 15 percent of the dividend. The aggregate payment of the dividend and imputation tax credit is subject to Danish withholding tax at the rate of 15 percent. In New Zealand the amount of the imputation credit is, along with the dividends, regarded as assessable income in the hands of the New Zealand resident individual. A tax credit for Danish tax paid is allowable up to 15 percent of the aggregate payment. According to pending proposals in Denmark the imputation tax credit is to be increased from 15 to 25 percent of the dividend.

### Article 11 - Interest

1\. Paragraph 1 affirms the taxing right of the State in which the recipient of the interest is a resident.

2\. Paragraph 2 also affirms the taxing right of the State in which the interest arises, but the maximum tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 10 percent of the gross amount of the interest. New Zealand's tax is therefore limited to 10 percent on gross interest paid to residents of Denmark instead of the usual 15 percent. The paragraph also allows the competent authorities to settle the mode of application of the limitation.

3\. Paragraph 3 defines "interest" for the purposes of the Article. Penalty charges are excluded from the term as is income which would, because of a State's domestic law, be classified as a dividend. Therefore, in New Zealand, for example, interest received by debenture holders under debentures to which section 192 or 195 of the Income Tax Act 1976 applies would be dealt with under the dividend Article.

4\. Paragraph 4 provides that in the State of source interest is taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment there owned by a resident of the other State, provided the interest is paid in respect of debt-claims forming part of the assets of the permanent establishment or otherwise effectively connected with that establishment. In effect this paragraph relieves the State of source of the interest from any limitation under the Article.

The rules set out above also apply where the recipient of the interest has in the other State, for the purpose of performing any of the kinds of independent personal services mentioned in Article 14, a fixed base with which the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected.

These qualifications tie in with the New Zealand domestic law which provides that if a non-resident has a fixed establishment in New Zealand, then interest derived is not subject to non-resident withholding tax but is to be assessed on an annual basis.(Section 310 of the Income Tax Act 1976.)

5\. Paragraph 5 is a source rule and precludes argument as to the source of the interest.

The paragraph deals with interest arising through a permanent establishment or fixed base. Where a loan was contracted for the requirements of that establishment and the interest is borne by the latter, the paragraph determines that the source of the interest is in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated, leaving aside the place of residence of the owner of that establishment or base.

6\. Paragraph 6 is an anti-avoidance provision to ensure that only a reasonable interest payment is taxed at the reduced rate specified in the Convention.

### Article 12 - Royalties

1\. Paragraph 1 affirms the taxing right of the State in which the recipient of the royalties is a resident.

2\. Paragraph 2 also affirms the taxing right of the State in which the royalties arise, but the maximum tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 10 percent of the gross amount of the royalties. New Zealand's tax is therefore limited to 10 percent on gross royalties paid to residents of Denmark instead of the usual 15 percent. The paragraph also allows the competent authorities to settle the mode of application of the limitation in paragraph 2.

3\. Paragraph 3 defines "royalties" for the purposes of the Article. The term includes lump sum payments and certain rents. However, variable or fixed payments for the working of mineral deposits or other natural resources do not fall within the defined term as they are governed by Article 6.

It should be noted that if a payment is made in the form of rent rather than on a royalty basis and the payment comes within the term "royalties", as defined in the Convention, then the 10 percent maximum on gross applies. However, rental payments do not constitute royalties under our domestic law and there is, therefore, no non-resident withholding tax applicable. Payments of this nature will be subject to an annual assessment on the net amount after expenses and if the tax so levied exceeds 10 percent of the gross rental, a rebate will be given by virtue of the Convention to bring the tax down to 10 percent of gross.

4\. Paragraph 4 provides that in the State of source royalties are taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment there owned by the recipient which is a resident of the other State, **provided** the knowledge, information, assistance, right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with that establishment. In effect this relieves the State of source of the royalties from the 15 percent limitation under the Article.

The rules set out above also apply where the recipient of the royalties has in the other State, for the purpose of performing any of the kinds of professional services mentioned in Article 14, a fixed base with which the knowledge, information, assistance, right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected.

The comments relating to paragraph 4 of the dividend Article apply equally here except that New Zealand's domestic law in relation to royalties provides for a withholding tax rate of 15 percent final on copyright (cultural) royalties or where the aggregate annual royalty payments do not exceed $1,000, and minimum final in all other cases.

5\. Paragraphs 5 and 6: The comments to paragraphs 5 and 6 respectively of the Interest Article apply equally here.

### Article 13 - Alienation of Property

1\. Paragraph 1 concerns income or gains derived from the alienation of **immovable** property. Income from such alienation may be taxed in the State where the property is situated. For example if a resident of Denmark sells at a profit immovable property situated in New Zealand the profit can be taxed in New Zealand if the New Zealand domestic law permits that taxation.

2\. Paragraph 2 deals with income or gains derived from the alienation of **personal** property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment or pertaining to a fixed base used for the performing of independent personal services. This may be taxed in the State where the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.

3\. Paragraph 3 provides that income or gains from the alienation of ships or aircraft operated in international traffic are taxable only in the State of residence of the enterprise.

4\. Paragraph 4 stipulates that any income or gains from any property not covered by the Article is to be taxable only in the State which the alienator is a resident.

### Article 14 - Independent Personal Services

1\. This Article concerns income from professional personal services (ie, independent personal services) as distinct from income from dependent personal services (eg, remuneration such as salary or wages) which is dealt with separately under Article 15. Under paragraph 1 income from independent personal services is taxable only in the State of residence unless the services are performed in the other State and the recipient of the income:

*   is present in the other State for a period or periods in an income year exceeding **in the aggregate** 183 days, or
*   has a fixed base regularly available to him in the other State for the purpose of performing his activities.

If either of the above exceptions applies the State in which the services are performed also has the right to tax the income therefrom.

The term "fixed base" is intended to cover a centre of activity of a fixed or permanent character, for instance a doctor's consulting room or the office of an architect or lawyer.

2\. The Article does not apply to artistes or athletes which are dealt with under Article 17.

### Article 15 - Dependent Personal Services

1\. Paragraph 1 states the general rule that personal services performed by a resident of one of the Contracting States may be taxed in that other Contracting State, only if the services are performed in that other Contracting State.

2\. Paragraph 2 states the case where exemption will be given by the State visited. The main requirements are that:

*   the recipient of the income is present in the State visited for a period or periods in an income year which does not exceed **in the aggregate**183 days; and
*   the remuneration is paid by an employer not resident in that State; and
*   the remuneration is not connected with the activities of a permanent establishment or fixed base which the employer has in that State.

When a visitor from Denmark undertakes employment in New Zealand, New Zealand PAYE tax will be required to be deducted from the remuneration paid but will be refunded at the time of departure provided the requirements of the Article are fully met. In this respect a certificate must be obtained, by the person seeking exemption, from the Danish tax authorities which certifies that that person is a resident of Denmark for the purposes of Danish tax.

3\. Paragraph 3 provides that remuneration derived from employment aboard a ship or aircraft operating in international traffic may be taxed in the State of residence of the shipping or airline enterprise. This means that if the enterprise is a resident of Denmark then Denmark has the right to tax the remuneration derived by the employee. New Zealand would allow credit for any Danish tax on such remuneration if derived by a New Zealand resident.

### Article 16 - Directors' Fees

This Article allows the State in which the company paying the fees or other similar payments is resident to have the right to tax such income. The income may also be taxed in the country of residence which would therefore have to allow credit for tax paid in the country of source.

### Article 17 - Artistes and Athletes

1\. Paragraph 1 enables the State in which the entertainer or athlete is performing the services to tax the income derived from these personal activities.

2\. Paragraph 2 deals with the situation where income for the performance of an entertainer or athlete is not paid or paid in full to the entertainer or athlete himself but to an enterprise providing the services of the entertainer or athlete. The paragraph permits the State in which the performance is given to impose a tax on the profits diverted from the income of the entertainer or athlete to the enterprise where for instance the entertainer or athlete has control over or rights to the income thus diverted or has obtained or will obtain some benefit directly or indirectly from that income. Without this paragraph the State where the services are being performed would in such cases, be unable to tax:

*   because it would not be personal service income to the entertainer, and
*   in the absence of a permanent establishment the payments could not be taxed as business profits in the hands of the other person.

### Article 18 - Pensions

1\. Paragraph 1 gives the State of **residence** exclusive right to tax pensions where they are paid in consideration of past employment. However, this rule is subject to Article 192. wherein Government pensions paid in respect of services rendered are taxed exclusively in the State of source **but** if the recipient is a resident **and** a national of the other State the pensions are taxable on a residence basis. (See definition of "national" in Article 3.) This means that a Danish Government pension paid to a resident of New Zealand is taxed only in Denmark and exempt in New Zealand unless the recipient is also a national of New Zealand in which case the pension is taxed only in New Zealand and exempt in Denmark.

2\. Paragraph 2 states that social security pensions are taxable only in the State paying the pensions, ie, State of source.

### Article 19 - Government Service

1\. This Article deals with remuneration paid to an individual in respect of services rendered to a State or political subdivision or local authority thereof.

2\. Paragraph 1 provides for two situations:

*   Remuneration paid by a State in respect of services rendered to it by an individual shall be taxable only by that State, ie, country of origin of the payment.
*   However, such remuneration is taxable only in the country where the services are performed provided the services are performed there:
    *   by an individual who is a resident and also a national of that country, or
    *   by an individual who is a resident of that country and did not become a resident of that country solely for the purpose of performing those services.

The second situation can be illustrated as follows.

Remuneration paid by the Danish Government for services rendered in New Zealand by an individual who is a resident and national of New Zealand shall be taxed exclusively in New Zealand. This is still the position even though the individual, although a national of New Zealand, did become a resident of New Zealand for the purposes of rendering those services for the Danish Government.

3\. Paragraph 2 deals with Government pensions. (See explanation to Article 18 in this Bulletin.)

4\. Paragraphs 1 and 2 do not apply if the services are performed in connection with business carried on by the State, or one of its political subdivisions or local authorities, paying the remuneration. Under paragraph 3 the ordinary rules apply: Article 15 for wages and salaries, Article 16 for directors' fees and Article 18 for pensions. Article 17 is not mentioned because paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 19 are to apply to remuneration paid to artistes employed by the State irrespective of whether such artistes could be said to be rendering services in connection with business carried on by the State.

### Article 20 - Students

This Article exempts from New Zealand tax maintenance, education or training payments received here from overseas by a student or business apprentice from Denmark. Note:

*   The student or apprentice must have been a resident of Denmark immediately before he comes to New Zealand.
*   He must be in New Zealand solely for the purpose of his education or training.
*   The payments must be made from sources outside in New Zealand.
*   There is no time limit on the period spent in New Zealand.
*   The exemption is restricted to the payments mentioned, ie, for maintenance.

The converse applies to a New Zealand student or apprentice going to Denmark.

### Article 21 - Other Income

1\. This Article provides a general rule relating to income not dealt with in the other Articles of the Convention. The income concerned is not only income of a class not expressly dealt with but also income from sources not expressly mentioned. A secondary effect of the Article is to clarify the situation of income derived from a third country by a person who could be "resident in" both Denmark and New Zealand under the general laws of each country. In such a situation the taxing rights as to the third country income are allocated to the country "of" which he is a resident for the purposes of the Convention.

2\. The effect of the Article is that income derived by a resident of New Zealand is taxed exclusively in New Zealand unless the income is derived from sources in Denmark. If the income is derived from sources in Denmark it may also be taxed there and a credit for the Danish tax is given in New Zealand, should that income be liable for New Zealand tax. The converse will apply in the case of a resident of Denmark. Cases of conflict as to residence are to be determined by reference to Article 4.

3\. In terms of paragraph (b) of the Protocol income from the business of any form of insurance is not subject to the provisions of this Article. Such income may be taxed in accordance with the domestic law of each country.

### Article 22 - Methods of Elimination of Double Taxation

1\. This Article contains the normal rules whereby each State gives credit for the other State's tax when assessing its residents on income derived from sources in the other State. It should be noted that the credit provisions in the Article are subject to the domestic law of each country.

2\. Paragraph (b) is a source rule for the purposes of the Article in order to solve any dual source cases which may arise thus facilitating the allowance of a tax credit.

### Article 23 - Mutual Agreement Procedure

### Article 24 - Exchange of Information

These are standard Articles and require no additional comment.

### Article 25 - Diplomatic Agents and Consular Officers

The aim of this Article is to ensure that diplomatic agents or consular officers shall, under the Convention, receive no less favourable treatment than that to which they are entitled under international law or under special international agreements.

### Article 26 - Territorial Extension

This is a standard Article and requires no additional comment.

### Article 27 - Entry Into Force

This Article provides that the provisions of the Convention will have effect in New Zealand in respect of income assessable for the income year beginning on 1 April 1981 and subsequent years. In Denmark the Convention will have effect in respect of income arising on or after 1 January 1981.

### Article 28 - Termination

This Article sets out the procedure if either State wishes to terminate the Convention. Unless notice of termination is given in accordance with the Article the Convention continues indefinitely.

### Protocol

The Protocol, which forms an integral part of the Convention, contains additional provisions in relation to certain Articles of the Convention.

1\. Paragraph (a) provides that for the purposes of sub-paragraph (a) of paragraph 1. of Article 2 the bonus issue tax in New Zealand is not subject to the Convention.

2\. Paragraph (b) provides that income from the business of any form of insurance is not subject to the provisions of Articles 7 and 21. Such income may be taxed in accordance with the domestic law of each country.

Paragraph (c) refers to the possible inclusion in the Convention of a non-discrimination article should New Zealand include such an article in any other convention.

Double Taxation Relief (French Republic) Order 1981
===================================================

Archived legislative commentary on the Double Taxation Relief (French Republic) Order 1981 (SR 1981/20) from PIB vol 112, suppl 5 Aug 1982.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 112, Supplement No. 5, August 1982

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_](/about/about-our-publications)
.

Part I - Introduction
---------------------

A double taxation convention has been concluded between the French Republic and New Zealand. The text of the convention has been published as a schedule to an Order-in-Council (SR 1981/20) and is available from Government Bookshops. The convention entered into force on 30 March 1981 with effect in New Zealand from any income year beginning on or after 1 April 1982. In France it takes effect from the assessment year which commences on 1 January 1982.

Part II - Notes on the Convention Article by Article
----------------------------------------------------

### Article 1 - Personal Scope

The convention applies to persons who are RESIDENTS of one or both of the Contracting States.

### Article 2 - Taxes Covered

The convention covers income tax and corporation tax imposed by the French Republic. With regard to New Zealand, the convention covers income tax and excess retention tax but not bonus issue tax.

### Article 3 - General Definition

(1) "National": Paragraph 1(f)

The term "national" is used in paragraph 2(c) and (d) of Article 4 in determining resident status. It is also used in Article 19 Government Service.

In New Zealand the term covers a citizen of New Zealand and any legal person, partnership and association under the law in force in New Zealand.

In the French Republic the term covers any individual possessing French nationality, any legal person, partnership and association under the law in force in the French Republic.

(2) Undefined Terms: Paragraph 3

This is a standard provision. Where a term is not defined it has the meaning applicable under the domestic law of the country applying the convention.

### Article 4 - Resident

(1) Paragraph 1 defines the meaning of the term "resident of a state" (ie, for the purposes of Article 1). In effect the defined term is a reference to the domestic law of each country. Whenever the term is used in the convention, the residence of the taxpayer must first be determined in accordance with this Article.

(2) Paragraph 2 sets out the tests to be applied to solve the problem of a dual resident individual. Dual residence arises when a taxpayer is resident in both countries by virtue of the domestic law of each country. For example, an individual may have his permanent home in State A, where his wife and children live, and consequently, he is deemed to be resident in that State under its domestic law. However, he has spent six months of the year in State B and for that reason he is deemed to be resident in that State under its domestic law. This conflict is solved by the tests set out in paragraph 2 giving preference to the claim of State A.

(3) Paragraph 3 sets out the rule to determine the case of a company or other legal person which is resident in both countries. Residence will be decided on where the place of effective management of the enterprise is situated. In this respect New Zealand views the term "effective management" as meaning the practical day to day management, irrespective of where the overriding control is exercised.

(4) In applying the tests to dual residents it should be remembered that these tests apply only for the purposes of the tax convention. If the person **resident in New Zealand** (domestic law test) becomes for the purposes of the convention a "resident of France" after the tests have been applied, this does NOT mean that he is a non-resident for all purposes of New Zealand tax law. For example he can never be subject to non-resident withholding tax, the reason being that although he is treated as a non-resident for certain purposes of the convention, he is still a resident under the New Zealand Income Tax Act. What it does mean is that he is entitled to any benefits granted by the convention to a "resident of France". Thus, although not subject to withholding tax on, for example, New Zealand royalty income, he would still qualify for the 10 percent limitation in the convention.

### Article 5 - Permanent Establishment

This Article defines the term "permanent establishment". This concept is the criteria used to determine the right of a Contracting State to tax the profits of an "enterprise of the other state". Due to the inclusion of the words "includes especially" in paragraph 2, the example cited as constituting a permanent establishment are by no means exhaustive.

The definition of "permanent establishment" is fairly standard but the following points should be noted:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Paragraph 3 | A building site or construction or installation project constitutes a permanent establishment if it lasts for more than 12 months. |
| Paragraph 5(a) | An enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment if it carries on supervisory activities for more than 12 months in connection with a construction, installation or assembly project. |
| Paragraph 5(b) | Includes the use or installation of substantial equipment or machinery for more than 12 months. |

### Article 6 - Income from Real Property

This Article recognises the internationally accepted practice in relation to income from land and the exploitation of land or landed property. The Article also applies to such items as rents, natural resource royalties, farming profits, etc. The principle of the Article is that income from "real property" may be taxed in the country where the property is situated. "Real property" is not defined in our general law but the Article provides extensive definition. Ships and aircraft are specifically excluded from the term "real property".

In paragraph 2 of the Protocol, France retains the possibility of applying its domestic laws relative to the taxation of income from shares or rights which are treated therein as income from real property.

The Article involves no change in current practice in relation to the income covered.

### Article 7 - Business Profits

(1) This Article is in many respects a continuation of, and a corollary to, Article 5 on the definition of the concept of permanent establishment. Under Article 7 a Contracting State cannot tax the profits of an enterprise of the other Contracting State unless it carries on its business through a permanent establishment situated therein. If a permanent establishment exists the Article goes on to lay down a set of rules of reference for calculating the profits on which that permanent establishment should pay tax.

(2) Before dealing with the salient features of the Article some comment is warranted on the importance of paragraph 7. This is because reference to this Article and Article 5 will not always be necessary to determine the liability of the specific types of income. In effect paragraph 7 gives first preference to the other Articles in the convention. It follows that this Article will only be applicable to business profits which do not belong to the categories of income covered by the special Articles, and in addition, to dividends, royalties and interest which specifically come within the circumstances detailed in paragraph 5 of Article 10, paragraph 4 of Article 12, paragraph 5 of Article 11 and consequently fall within Article 7.

(3) Paragraph 1 expresses the general rule that profits are taxable only in the country of residence unless the enterprise is engaged in business in the other country through a permanent establishment, in which case the other country may tax the profits of the permanent establishment.

It is important to note that only income attributable directly to the permanent establishment's operations can form part of the establishment's operations. This does not mean that income which is not directly attributable to the establishment's operations escapes liability for tax (see paragraph 2 above). For example, the restriction on the rate of tax imposed by paragraph 2 of Articles 10, 11 and 12, which concern dividend, interest and royalty payments respectively, would apply if such income did not arise from the permanent establishment's operations.

(4) Paragraph 2 contains the normal provision enabling arm's-length profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment if necessary.

(5) Paragraph 3 merely expresses the taxpayer's right to deduct from the profits of the permanent establishment the expenses incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment even if those expenses are incurred outside the country where the permanent establishment is situated.

(6) Paragraph 4 provides that where the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment are determined, not on the basis of separate accounts or by making an estimate of arm's-length profit, but simply by apportioning the total profits of the enterprise by reference to various formulae then such a method may continue to be employed provided it has been customary to adopt such a practice. Such a method differs from those envisaged in paragraph 2 of Article 7, since it contemplates not an attribution of profits on a separate enterprise footing, but an apportionment of total profits.

However, in general the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment should be determined by reference to the establishment's accounts if these reflect the real facts. A method of allocation which is based on apportioning total profits is generally not as appropriate as a method which has regard only to the activities of the permanent establishment and should be used only where it has, as a matter of history, been customary in the past and is accepted by the Department and taxpayer as being satisfactory.

(7) Paragraph 5 precludes the attribution of profits to a permanent establishment by reason of merely purchasing activities carried on by the permanent establishment for the enterprise.

(8) Paragraph 6 provides that unless there are good and sufficient reasons to the contrary the profits attributed to a permanent establishment must be determined by the same method each year.

(9) Paragraph 7: refer paragraph 2 above.

(10) The Protocol contains certain provisions which relate to this Article:

*   Firstly, both situations cited in paragraph 3(a) were inserted at the request of the French Republic. They are of no consequence as far as New Zealand is concerned, since New Zealand abides by the arm's-length principle and associated rules contained in Article 7.
*   Secondly, in terms of paragraph 3(b) income from the business of any form of insurance is not subject to the provisions of this Article. Such income may be taxed in accordance with the domestic law of each country.

### Article 8 - Shipping and Aircraft

(1) Under this Article profits from operating ships or aircraft in "international traffic" - defined in Article 3(1)(e) are to be taxed only in the country in which the place of effective management of the enterprise is situated.

International shipping and aircraft profits include income from:

*   carriage of passengers and cargo;
*   sale of passenger tickets on behalf of other enterprises;
*   commercial advertising;
*   (d) charter fees (but refer paragraph 3 below).

(2) Due to the definition of "international traffic" exemption does not extend to profits derived from coastal traffic. Further, investment income of shipping and air transport enterprises is subject to the treatment ordinarily applied to that class of income, eg, dividends derived would be subject to Article 10.

(3) Profits obtained from leasing a ship or aircraft on charter fully equipped, manned and supplied, whether or not the enterprise providing the ship or aircraft actually owns them, would be treated as profits from the operation of a ship or aircraft. However, the Article does not extend to profits from leasing a ship or aircraft on a bare boat charter basis **except** when it is an occasional source of income for an enterprise engaged in the international operation of ships or aircraft. Apart from this one exception, bare boat charter fees would normally be classified as business profits and consequently dealt with under Article 7

(4) Protocol paragraph 1 includes in the definition of "international traffic" any transport by a container where such transport is incidental to transport in "international traffic".

### Article 9 - Associated Enterprises

This is a standard Article enabling an arm's-length profit to be attributed to associated enterprises.

### Article 10 - Dividends

(1) Paragraph 1 of the Article simply states that dividends may be taxed in the State of the recipient's residence.

(2) Paragraph 2 provides that the Contracting State from which the dividends are paid also has the right to tax, but the maximum rate of tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 15 percent of the gross amount of the dividends. New Zealand's domestic law is not therefore restricted, as our withholding tax rate is 15 percent of the gross dividend. However, the 1980 Income Tax Amendment Act contains an amendment to the New Zealand domestic law by increasing the withholding tax rate to 30 percent of the gross dividend as from 1 April 1982. Therefore, in terms of the agreement New Zealand's taxing rights will be restricted to 15 percent of the gross dividend even though the rate under domestic law, as proposed, will be 30 percent.

(3) Dividends received by residents in France from French Corporations entitle the recipient to a tax credit ("avoir fiscal") equal to 50 percent of the dividend where the company pays corporation tax. However, the resident must include the tax credit in his taxable income (ie, gross the dividends to 150 percent).

Paragraph 3 provides that where a New Zealand resident individual receives a dividend which qualifies for the tax credit ("avoir fiscal") the French Treasury will refund the tax credit ("avoir fiscal") subject to paragraph 2 provided that the New Zealand resident is liable to tax on the payment. The subject to tax test means that New Zealand companies cannot obtain the refund as they are not liable to tax in New Zealand on the dividends, eg:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Dividends distributed to New Zealand resident individual | $100.00 |
| Tax Credit ("avoir fiscal") | $50.00 |
| Aggregate income liable to tax in New Zealand | $150.00 |
| French tax calculated at 15% on $150.00 | $22.50 |

District offices will certify for taxpayers that they are resident in New Zealand and liable to tax in New Zealand on dividends received from French Corporations to enable them to obtain refunds from the French Treasury.

(4) Paragraph 4 defines "dividends" for the purposes of the Article. The effect is that "dividends" has the meaning given to it by section 4 of the Income Tax Act 1976.

(5) Paragraph 5 concerns shares which are effectively connected with a permanent establishment. The paragraph merely provides that in the State of source, the dividends are taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment there owned by the recipient which is a resident of the other State, provided they are paid in respect of holdings forming part of the assets of the permanent establishment or otherwise effectively connected with that establishment. In effect this relieves the State of source of the dividends from any limitations under the Article.

At present this qualification has no effect on the New Zealand tax position because our domestic law provides for a 15 percent final withholding tax in all cases on the gross payment and no agreement can extend the taxing rights under domestic law. However, in view of the change in the New Zealand domestic law from 1 April 1982 the New Zealand tax on dividends paid in respect of shares effectively connected with a permanent establishment will be increased to a maximum rate of 30 percent.

The above comments apply equally to an individual resident in a State and who has a fixed base in the other State for the purposes of performing any of the kinds of independent personal services mentioned in Article 14.

(6) Where French Corporations have not paid corporation tax the tax credit ("avoir fiscal") is not available in respect of dividends distributed and the corporations are required to make a pre-payment (precompte) equal to half the amount of the dividend distributed.

Paragraph 6 provides that a New Zealand resident may be refunded the pre-payment (precompte) which is deemed to be a dividend subject to the conditions in paragraph 2, eg:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Dividends distributed to New Zealand resident | $100.00 |
| Pre-payment(precompte) | $50.00 |
| Aggregate income liable to tax in New Zealand | $150.00 |
| French tax calculated at 15 percent on $150.00 | $22.50 |

(7) Paragraph 7: The main effect of this paragraph is that it restricts the application of taxes on undistributed profits. For example, New Zealand cannot impose excess retention tax on a privately controlled company which is a "resident of France". Protocol, paragraph 4 confirms that bonus issue tax is not included in the expression "tax on the company's undistributed profits".

(8) Paragraph 8 restricts the French withholding tax on a permanent establishment which a New Zealand resident has in France.

### Article 11 - Interest

(1) Paragraph 1 gives the State that the recipient of the interest is a resident of, the right to tax that income.

(2) Paragraph 2 also gives the State in which the interest arises the right to tax the payment, but the maximum rate of tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 10 percent of the gross amount of the interest. New Zealand's tax is therefore limited to 10 percent on gross interest paid to residents of France instead of the usual 15 percent.

(3) Paragraph 3 exempts from tax interest if:

*   it is paid to the Government, a local authority or an agency wholly owned by the Government or local authority.
*   it is paid to any person who is a resident of a State in respect of a loan made or guaranteed, or of a credit made or guaranteed, by the other State or by an agency of that other State.

(4) Paragraph 4 defines "interest" for the purposes of the Article. Penalty charges are excluded from the term as is income which would, because of a State's domestic law, be classified as a dividend. Therefore, in New Zealand, for example, interest received by debenture holders under debentures to which section 192 or 195 of the Income Tax Act 1976 applies would be dealt with under the dividend Article.

(5) Paragraph 5 provides that in the State of source, interest is taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment there owned by the recipient which is a resident of the other State, provided it is paid in respect of debt-claims forming part of the assets of the permanent establishment or otherwise effectively connected with that establishment. In effect this paragraph relieves the State of source of the interest from any limitation under the Article.

This qualification ties in with the New Zealand domestic law which provides that if a non-resident has a fixed establishment in New Zealand, then interest derived is not subject to non-resident withholding tax but is to be assessed on an annual basis.

The above comments apply equally to an individual resident in a State and who has a fixed base in the other State for the purposes of performing any of the kinds of independent personal services mentioned in Article 14.

(6) Paragraph 6 is a source rule and precludes argument as to the source of the interest.

The paragraph also deals with interest arising through a permanent establishment or fixed base. Where a loan was contracted for the requirements of that establishment and the interest is borne by the latter, the paragraph determines that the source of the interest is in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated, leaving aside the place of residence of the owner of that establishment or base.

(7) Paragraph 7 is an anti-avoidance provision to ensure that only a reasonable interest payment is taxed at the reduced rate specified in the convention.

### Article 12 - Royalties

(1) Paragraph 1 gives the State that the recipient of the royalties is a resident of, the right to tax that income.

(2) Paragraph 2 also gives the State in which the royalty arises the right to tax the payment, but the maximum rate of tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 10 percent of the gross amount of the royalty. Again New Zealand's domestic law is restricted as our withholding tax rate is 15 percent.

(3) Paragraph 3 defines "royalties" for the purposes of the Article. The term includes lump sum payments and certain rents. However, variable or fixed payments for the working of mineral deposits or other natural resources do not fall within the defined term as they are governed by Article 6. Although all royalties and know-how payments (whether lump sum or not) are covered, the following should be noted:

*   Payments for the use of industrial, commercial or scientific **equipment** are royalties as defined. However, due to paragraph 5 of the Protocol such payments are treated as royalties only if they are "dependent upon production, sales, performance, results or any similar basis related to the use of that equipment". Where this is not the case, the payment is deemed to be profits of an enterprise to which the provisions of Article 7 apply.
*   Likewise payments for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientificexperience come within the definition of royalties. However, paragraph 6 of the Protocol negates the application of Article 12 if the payments received are for technical, consultant or supervisoryservices. In such cases the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14 apply.
*   If a payment is made in the form of rent rather than on a royalty basis and the payment comes within the term "royalties" then the 10 percent maximum rate on gross applies. However, rental payments do not constitute royalties under our domestic law and there is, therefore, no non-resident withholding tax applicable. Payments of this nature will be subject to an annual assessment on the net amount after expenses and if the tax so levied exceeds 10 percent of the gross rental, a rebate will be given by virtue of the convention to bring the tax down to 10 percent of gross.

(4) Paragraph 4: The comments relating to paragraph 5 of the Dividend Article apply equally here, except that New Zealand's domestic law in relation to royalties provides for a withholding tax rate of 15 percent final on cultural royalties or where the aggregate annual royalty payment does not exceed $1,000, and minimum final in all other cases.

(5) Paragraphs 5 and 6: The comments in paragraphs 6 and 7 respectively of the Interest Article apply equally here.

### Article 13 - Income from Alienation of Property

(1) Paragraph 1 concerns income or gains derived from the alienation ofreal property. Income from such alienation may be taxed in the State where the property is situated. For example, if a resident of France sells at a profit a real property situated in New Zealand the profit can be taxed in New Zealand if the New Zealand domestic law permits that taxation.

(2) Paragraph 2 deals with income or gains derived from the alienation ofpersonal property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment or pertaining to a fixed base used for the performing of independent personal services. This may be taxed in the State where the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.

(3) Paragraph 3 provides that income or gains from the alienation of ships or aircraft operated in international traffic are taxable only in the State where the effective management of the enterprise is situated.

(4) Paragraph 4 provides that income or gains from the alienation of shares, the property of which consists principally of real property situated in a State, may be taxed in the other State. In paragraph 7 of the Protocol, France retains the possibility of applying the provisions in its laws relative to the taxation of gains from the alienation of shares or rights which are part of a substantial participation in a company which is a resident of France, or of shares or rights of companies the assets of which consist mainly of real property situated in France.

(5) Paragraph 5 stipulates that any income or gains from any property not covered by the Articles is to be taxable only in the State in which the alienator is a resident.

### Article 14 - Independent Personal Services

(1) This Article concerns income from professional personal services (ie, independent personal services) as distinct from income from dependent personal services (eg, remuneration such as salary or wages) which is dealt with separately under Article 15. Income from independent personal services is to be treated in much the same way as "business profits", that is, taxable only in the country of residence unless attributable to a fixed base regularly available to the taxpayer in the other State. The term "fixed base" is intended to cover a centre of activity of a fixed or permanent character, for instance, a doctor's consulting room or the office of an architect or lawyer.

(2) The Article does not apply to artistes and athletes which are dealt with under Article 17.

### Article 15 - Dependent Personal Services

(1) Paragraph 1 states the general rule that personal services performed by a resident of one of the Contracting States may be taxed in that other Contracting State, only if the services are performed in that other Contracting State.

(2) Paragraph 2 states the case where exemption will be given by the State visited. The main requirements are that the visit does not exceed 183 days in the aggregate in the income year, that the remuneration is paid by an employer not resident in that State, and is not borne by a permanent establishment or fixed base which the employer has in that State. Initially New Zealand PAYE tax will be required to be deducted from the remuneration paid but will be refunded at the time of departure provided the requirements of the Article are fully met. In this respect a certificate must be obtained, by the person seeking exemption, from the French tax authorities which certifies that that person is a resident of France for the purposes of French tax.

(3) Paragraph 3 provides that remuneration derived from employment aboard a ship or aircraft operating in international traffic may be taxed in the State in which the place of effective management of the shipping or airline enterprise is situated. This means that if the place of effective management of the enterprise is in France then France has the right to tax the remuneration derived by the employee. New Zealand would allow credit for any French tax on such remuneration if derived by a New Zealand resident.

### Article 16 - Directors' Fees

This Article allows the State in which the company paying the fees or other similar payments is resident to have the first right to tax such income.

### Article 17 - Artistes and Athletes

(1) Paragraph 1 enables the State in which the entertainer or athlete is performing the services to tax the income derived from these personal activities.

(2) Paragraph 2 deals with the situation where income for the performance of an entertainer or athlete is not paid or paid in full to the entertainer or athlete himself but to another person. The paragraph permits the State in which the performance is given to impose a tax on the profits diverted from the income of the entertainer or athlete to the enterprise where for instance the entertainer or athlete has control over or rights to the income thus diverted or has obtained or will obtain some benefit directly or indirectly from that income. Without this paragraph the State where the services are being performed would in such cases, be unable to tax:

*   because it would not be personal service income to the entertainer, and
*   in the absence of a permanent establishment the payments could not be taxed as business profits in the hands of the other person.

(3) Paragraph 3 gives the sole right of taxation to the country of residence if the entertainer or athlete is supported substantially by public funds, political subdivisions, local authorities or a statutory body.

(4) Paragraph 4 covers the same circumstances as paragraph 3 but extends it to cover cases where the income accrues to a person other than the athlete and is supported substantially by public funds, political subdivisions, local authorities or a statutory body.

### Article 18 - Pensions

(1) Paragraph 1 gives the state ofresidence exclusive rights to tax pensions where they are paid in consideration of past employment. However, this rule is subject to Article 19 2 wherein Government pensions paid in respect of services rendered are taxed exclusively in the State of source but if the recipient and a national of the other State the pensions are taxable on a residence basis. (See definition of "national" in Article 3.) This means that a French Government pension paid to a resident of New Zealand is taxed only in France and exempt in New Zealand unless the recipient is also a national of New Zealand in which case the pension is taxed only in New Zealand and exempt in France.

(2) Paragraph 2 states that social security pensions are taxable only in the State paying the pensions, ie, State of source.

(3) In paragraph 3 payments made by both countries in respect of war pensions are exempt in the country of residence as long as they remain exempt in the country of source.

### Article 19 - Government Service

(1) This Article deals with remuneration paid to an individual in respect of services rendered to a State or political subdivision or local authority thereof.

(2) Paragraph 1 provides for two situations:

*   Remuneration paid by a State in respect of services rendered to it by an individual shall be taxable only by that State.
*   However, such remuneration shall be taxed exclusively in the other State if the services are rendered in that State by an individual who is a resident of that State,**and** who is also a national of that State or did not become a resident of that State solely for the purposes of rendering those services.

The second situation can be illustrated as follows.

Remuneration paid by the French Government for services rendered in New Zealand by an individual who is a resident and national of New Zealand shall be taxed exclusively in New Zealand. This is still the position even though the individual, although a national of New Zealand, did become a resident of New Zealand for the purposes of rendering those services for the French Government.

(3) Paragraph 2 deals with Government pensions. (See explanation to Article 18 in this supplement.)

(4) Paragraphs 1 and 2 do not apply if the services are performed in connection with business carried on by the State, or one of its political subdivisions or local authorities, paying the remuneration. Under paragraph 3 the ordinary rules apply: Article 15 for wages and salaries, Article 16 for directors' fees and Article 18 for pensions. Article 17 is not mentioned because paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 19 are to apply to remuneration paid to artistes employed by the State irrespective of whether such artistes could be said to be rendering services in connection with business carried on by the State.

### Article 20 - Students

This Article exempts from New Zealand tax a student or business apprentice from France on maintenance, education or training payments received here from overseas. Note:

*   The student or apprentice must have been a resident of France immediately before he comes to New Zealand.
*   He must be in New Zealand solely for the purpose of his education or training.
*   The exemption is restricted to the payments mentioned, ie, for maintenance.
*   The payments must be made from sources outside New Zealand.
*   There is no time limit on the period spent in New Zealand.

The converse applies to a New Zealand student or apprentice going to France.

### Article 21 - Teachers and Researchers

(1) Under paragraph 1 a French teacher or researcher is exempt from New Zealand tax for two years on his income from carrying out teaching or research in New Zealand irrespective of the length of the visit or whether he will be taxed in France on that income if:

*   he is or was a resident of France immediately before visiting New Zealand.
*   his visit is solely for the purpose of teaching or research.

This article is different from other conventions which require a person's visit not to exceed two years for the exemption to apply.

The same rules apply conversely to residents of New Zealand visiting France for the same purpose.

(2) Paragraph 2 sets out the condition that for paragraph 1 to apply the research must be undertaken in the public interest and not for the private benefit of a specific person or persons.

### Article 22 - Other Income

(1) This Article provides a general rule relating to income not dealt with in the other Articles of the convention. The income concerned is not only income of a class not expressly dealt with but also income from sources not expressly mentioned. A secondary effect of the Article is to clarify the situation of income derived from a third country by a person who could be "resident in" both France and New Zealand under the general laws of each country. Under the convention that person can be a "resident of" only one country. In such a situation the taxing rights are allocated to the country "of" which he is a resident.

(2) The effect of this Article is that income derived by a resident of New Zealand is taxed exclusively in New Zealand unless the income is derived from sources in France. If the income is derived from sources in France it may also be taxed there and a credit for the French tax is given in New Zealand, should that income be liable for New Zealand tax. The converse will apply in the case of a resident of France. Cases of conflict between two residences are to be determined by reference to Article 4.

### Article 23 - Methods of Elimination of Double Taxation

(1) This Article contains the normal rules whereby each State gives credit for the other State's tax when assessing its residents on income derived from sources in the other State. It should be noted that the credit provisions in the Article are subject to the domestic law of each country.

### Article 24 - Mutual Agreement Procedure

### Article 25 - Exchange of Information

These are standard articles and require no additional comment.

### Article 26 - Diplomatic and Consular Privileges

(1) The aim of this Article is to ensure that diplomatic agents or consular officers shall, under the convention, receive no less favourable treatment than that to which they are entitled under international law or under special international agreements. Paragraph 2 establishes that the sending State is to be the State of residence for members of diplomatic or consular missions provided they are regarded as residents under the domestic law of that State.

(2) Paragraph 3 ensures that international organisations, organs or officials, or members of a diplomatic mission of a third State, who are liable in one of the Contracting States in respect only of income from sources therein shall not have the benefit of the convention.

### Article 27 - Territorial Scope

(1) Paragraph 1 of this Article provides the definitions of France and New Zealand which in conventions with other countries are generally found in "Article 3 - General Definitions".

The Convention applies in the case of France to its European and Overseas Departments.

The French Overseas Departments at present are Guadeloupe, Guyane, Martinique, Reunion and Saint Pierre-et-Miquelon and do not include their Overseas Territories such as Tahiti and New Caledonia.

(2) Paragraphs 2 and 3 are standard in respect to extensions of territory of either country and require no additional comments.

### Article 28 - Entry into Force

This Article provides that the convention will take effect in New Zealand from any income year commencing on or after 1 April 1982 and in France from the assessment year which commences on 1 January 1982.

### Article 29 - Termination

This Article sets out the procedure if either State wishes to terminate the convention. Unless notice of termination is given in accordance with the Article the convention continues indefinitely.

### Protocol

The Protocol deals with those items where some further explanation is required of points not covered in the Article concerned. The main points are explained earlier in this supplement on an Article by Article basis.

Double Taxation Relief (Switzerland) Order 1981
===============================================

Archived legislative commentary on the Double Taxation Relief (Switzerland) Order 1981 from PIB vol 112, supp 7 Mar 1983.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 112, Supplement No. 7, March 1983

.

Part I - Introduction
---------------------

The text of the Convention has been published as a schedule to an Order-in-Council (SR 1981/285) which is available from Government Bookshops.

The Convention entered into force on 21 November 1981 with effect in New Zealand for any income year beginning on or after 1 April 1981. In Switzerland it applies to any taxable year beginning on or after 1 January 1981. The Convention is generally drafted in accordance with the 1977 OECD Model Double Taxation Convention.

Part II - Notes on the Convention Article by Article
----------------------------------------------------

### Article 1 - Personal Scope

The Convention applies to persons who are residents of one or both of the Contracting States.

### Article 2 - Taxes Covered

In the case of Switzerland, the Convention covers federal, cantonal and communal taxes on income (total income, income from capital, industrial and commercial profits, capital gains and other items of income). Paragraph 1. (b) of the Protocol excludes the Federal anticipatory tax withheld at source on prizes in lotteries.

With regard to New Zealand, the Convention covers income tax and excess retention tax, but not bonus issue tax. Paragraph 1. (c) excludes penalties imposed by either country from the definitions of taxes.

### Article 3 - General Definition

**New Zealand": Paragraph 1(a)(i)**

The term "New Zealand" means the metropolitan territory of New Zealand (including the outlying islands) but does not include the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau. It also includes areas adjacent to the territorial sea of the metropolitan territory of New Zealand over which New Zealand has sovereign rights in respect of the sea, sea-bed and its subsoil.

2\. "Switzerland": Paragraph 1(a)(ii)

The term "Switzerland" means the Swiss Confederation.

3\. "National": Paragraph 1(f)

The term "national" is used in paragraph 2. (c) and (d) of Article 4 in determining resident status. It is also used in Article 19 Government Service.

For both countries the term covers a citizen and any legal person, partnership and association under the law in force in the relevant country.

4\. Undefined Terms: Paragraph 2

This is a standard provision. Where a term is not defined it has the meaning applicable under the domestic law of the country applying the convention.

### Article 4 - Resident

1\. Paragraph 1 defines the meaning of the term "resident of a Contracting State". In effect the defined term is a reference to the domestic law of each country. Whenever the term is used in the Convention the residence of the taxpayer must first be determined in accordance with this Article.

2\. Paragraph 2 sets out the tests to be applied to solve the problem of a dual resident individual. Dual residence arises when a taxpayer is resident in both countries by virtue of the domestic law of each country. For example, an individual may have his permanent home in State A, where his wife and children live, and consequently, he is deemed to be resident in that State under its domestic law. However, he has spent 6 months of the year in State B and for that reason he is deemed to be resident in that State under its domestic law. This conflict is resolved by the tests set out in paragraph 2 giving preference to the claim of State A.

3\. Paragraph 3 sets out the rule to determine the case of a company or other legal person which is resident in both countries. Residence will be where the place of effective management of the enterprise is situated. In this respect New Zealand views the term "effective management" as meaning the practical day to day management, irrespective of where the overriding control is exercised.

4\. In applying the tests to dual residents it should be remembered that these tests apply only for the purposes of the tax convention. If the person resident in New Zealand (domestic law test) becomes for the purposes of the Convention a "resident of Switzerland" after the tests have been applied, this does not mean that he is a non-resident for all purposes of New Zealand tax law. For example he can never be subject to non-resident withholding tax, the reason being that although he is treated as a non-resident for certain purposes of the Convention he is still a resident under the New Zealand Income Tax Act. What it does mean is that he is entitled to any benefits granted by the Convention to a "resident of Switzerland". Thus, although not subject to withholding tax on, for example, New Zealand royalty income, he would still qualify for the 10 percent limitation in the Convention.

### Article 5 - Permanent Establishment

This Article defines the term "permanent establishment". This concept determines the right of a Contracting State to tax the profits of an "enterprise of the other State". Due to the inclusion of the words "includes especially" in paragraph 2, the examples cited as constituting a permanent establishment are by no means exhaustive.

The definition of "permanent establishment" is fairly standard but the following points should be noted:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Paragraph 3 | A building site or construction or installation project constitutes a permanent establishment if it lasts for more than 12 months. |
| Paragraph 5(a) | An enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment if it carries on supervisory activities for more than 12 months in connection with a construction, installation or assembly project. |
| Paragraph 5(b) | Includes the use of substantial equipment or machinery for more than 12 months in the exploration, or the exploitation of, natural resources or in activities connected with such exploration or exploitation. |

### Article 6 - Income from Real Property

This Article recognises the internationally accepted practice in relation to income from land and the exploitation of land or landed property. The article also applies to such items as rents, natural resource royalties, farming profits, etc. The principle of the Article is that income from "real property" may be taxed in the country where the property is situated. "Real property" is not defined in our general law but the Article provides extensive definition. Ships and aircraft are specifically excluded from the term "real property".

The Article involves no change in current practice in relation to the income covered.

### Article 7 - Business Profits

1\. This Article is in many respects a continuation of, and a corollary to, Article 5 on the definition of the concept of permanent establishment. Under Article 7 a Contracting State cannot tax the profits of an enterprise of the other Contracting State unless it carries on its business through a permanent establishment situated therein. If a permanent establishment exists the Article goes on to lay down a set of rules by reference to which the profits of the permanent establishment are to be calculated.

2\. Before dealing with the salient features of the Article some comment is warranted on the importance of paragraph 7. This is because reference to this Article and Article 5 will not always be necessary to determine the liability of the specific types of income. In effect paragraph 7 gives first preference to the other Articles in the convention. It follows that this Article will only be applicable to business profits which do not belong to the categories of income covered by the special Articles, and in addition, to dividends, royalties and interest which specifically come within the circumstances detailed in paragraphs 4 of Articles 10, 11 and 12 and consequently fall within Article 7.

3\. Paragraph 1 expresses the general rule that profits are taxable only in the country of residence unless the enterprise is engaged in business in the other country through a permanent establishment, in which case the other country may tax the profits of the permanent establishment.

It is important to note that only income attributable directly to the permanent establishment's operations can form part of the establishment's operations. This does not mean that income which is not directly attributable to the establishment's operations escapes liability for tax (see paragraph 2 above). For example, the restriction on the rate of tax imposed by paragraph 2 of Articles 10, 11 and 12, which concern dividend, interest and royalty payments respectively, would apply if such income did not arise from the permanent establishment's operations.

4\. Paragraph 2 contains the normal provision enabling arm's-length profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment if necessary.

5\. Paragraph 3 merely expresses the taxpayer's right to deduct from the profits of the permanent establishment the expenses incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment even if those expenses are incurred outside the country where the permanent establishment is situated.

6\. Paragraph 4 provides that where the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment are determined, not on the basis of separate accounts or by making an estimate of an arm's-length profit, but simply by apportioning the total profits of the enterprise by reference to various formulae, then such a method may continue to be employed provided it has been customary to adopt such a practice. Such a method differs from those envisaged in paragraph 2 of Article 7, since it contemplates not an attribution of profits on a separate enterprise footing, but an apportionment of total profits. However, in general the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment should be determined by reference to the establishment's accounts if these reflect the real facts. A method of allocation which is based on apportioning total profits is generally not as appropriate as a method which has regard only to the activities of the permanent establishment and should be used only where it has, as a matter of history, been customary in the past and is accepted by the Department and taxpayer as being satisfactory.

7\. Paragraph 5 precludes the attribution of profits to a permanent establishment by reason of merely purchasing activities carried on by the permanent establishment for the enterprise.

8\. Paragraph 6 provides that unless there are good and sufficient reasons to the contrary the profits attributed to a permanent establishment must be determined by the same method each year.

9\. Paragraph 7: refer paragraph 2. above.

10\. The Protocol contains certain provisions which relate to this Article:

*   Firstly, paragraph 2(a) was inserted at the request of Switzerland. It is of no consequence as far as New Zealand is concerned, since New Zealand abides by the arm's-length principle and associated rules contained in Article 7.
*   Secondly, in terms of paragraph 2(b), the computation of taxable profits from life insurance is not subject to the provisions of this Article. Such income may be taxed in accordance with the domestic law of each country.

### Article 8 - Shipping and Aircraft

1\. Under this Article profits from operating ships or aircraft in "international traffic" - defined in Article 31. (g) are to be taxed only in the country in which the place of effective management of the enterprise is situated. International shipping and aircraft profits include income from:

*   carriage of passengers and cargo;
*   sale of passenger tickets on behalf of other enterprises;
*   commercial advertising;
*   charter fees (but refer paragraph 3. below).

2\. Due to the definition of "international traffic" exemption does not extend to profits derived from coastal traffic. Further, investment income of shipping and air transport enterprises is subject to the treatment ordinarily applied to that class of income, eg, dividends derived would be subject to Article 10.

3\. Profits obtained from leasing a ship or aircraft on charter fully equipped, manned and supplied, whether or not the enterprise providing the ship or aircraft actually owns them, would be treated as profits from the operation of a ship or aircraft. However, the Article does not extend to profits from leasing a ship or aircraft on a bare boat basis except when it is an occasional source of income for an enterprise engaged in the international operation of ships or aircraft. Apart from this one exception, bare boat charter fees would normally be classified as business profits and consequently dealt with under Article 7.

### Article 9 - Associated Enterprises

This is a standard Article enabling an arm's-length profit to be attributed to associated enterprises.

### Article 10 - Dividends

1\. Paragraph 1 of the Article simply states that dividends may be taxed in the State of the recipient's residence.

2\. Paragraph 2 provides that the Contracting State from which the dividends are paid also has the right to tax, but the maximum rate of tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 15 percent of the gross amount of the dividends. Therefore, in terms of the Convention New Zealand's taxing rights will be restricted to 15 percent of the gross dividend even though the rate under domestic law is 30 percent from 1 April 1982.

3\. Paragraph 3 defines "dividends" for the purposes of the Article. The effect is that "dividends" has the meaning given to it by section 4 of the Income Tax Act 1976.

4\. Paragraph 4 concerns shares which are effectively connected with a permanent establishment. The paragraph merely provides that in the State of source the dividends are taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment there owned by the recipient which is a resident of the other State, provided they are paid in respect of holdings forming part of the assets of the permanent establishment or otherwise effectively connected with that establishment. In effect this relieves the State of source of the dividends from any limitations under this Article.

The rules set out above also apply where the recipient of the dividends has in the other State, for the purposes of performing any of the kinds of independent personal services mentioned in Article 14, a fixed base with which the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected.

Up to 1 April 1982 these qualifications had no effect on the New Zealand tax position because our domestic law provided for a 15 percent final withholding tax in all cases on the gross payment and no agreement can extend the taxing rights under domestic law. However, in view of the change in the New Zealand domestic law from 1 April 1982 the New Zealand tax on dividends paid in respect of shares effectively connected with a permanent establishment or fixed base will be increased to a maximum rate of 30 percent as against the 15 percent maximum applying under the Convention to "non-connected" dividends.

5\. Paragraph 5: The main effect of this paragraph is that it restricts the application of taxes on undistributed profits. For example, New Zealand cannot impose excess retention tax on a privately controlled company which is a "resident of Switzerland".

### Article 11 - Interest

1\. Paragraph 1 affirms the taxing right of the State in which the recipient of the interest is a resident.

2\. Paragraph 2 also affirms the taxing right of the State in which the interest arises, but the maximum rate of tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 10 percent of the gross amount of the interest. New Zealand's tax is therefore limited to 10 percent on gross interest paid to residents of Switzerland instead of the usual 15 percent.

3\. Paragraph 3 defines "interest" for the purposes of the Article. Penalty charges are excluded from the term as is income which would, because of a State's domestic law, be classified as a dividend. Therefore, in New Zealand, for example, interest received by debenture holders under debentures to which section 192 or 195 of the Income Tax Act 1976 applies would be dealt with under the dividend Article.

4\. Paragraph 4 provides that in the State of source interest is taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment there owned by a resident of the other State, provided the interest is paid in respect of debt-claims forming part of the assets of the permanent establishment or otherwise effectively connected with that establishment. In effect this paragraph relieves the State of source of the interest from any limitation under the Article.

This qualification ties in with the New Zealand domestic law which provides that if a non-resident has a fixed establishment in New Zealand, then interest derived is not subject to non-resident withholding tax but is to be assessed on an annual basis. (See section 310 Income Tax Act 1976.)

The rules set out above also apply where the recipient of the interest has in the other State, for the purposes of performing any of the kinds of independent personal services mentioned in Article 14, a fixed base with which the debt-claim in respect of which interest is paid is effectively connected.

5\. Paragraph 5 is a source rule and precludes argument as to the source of the interest.

The paragraph also deals with interest arising through a permanent establishment or fixed base. Where a loan was contracted for the requirements of that establishment and the interest is borne by the latter, the paragraph determines that the source of the interest is in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated, leaving aside the place of residence of the owner of that establishment or base.

6\. Paragraph 6 is an anti-avoidance provision to ensure that only a reasonable interest payment is taxed at the reduced rate specified in the Convention.

### Article 12 - Royalties

1\. Paragraph 1 affirms the taxing right of the State in which the recipient of the royalties is a resident.

2\. Paragraph 2 also affirms the taxing right of the State in which the royalty arises, but the maximum rate of tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 10 percent of the gross amount of the royalty. Again New Zealand's domestic law is restricted as our withholding tax rate is 15 percent.

3\. Paragraph 3 defines "royalties" for the purposes of the Article. The term includes lump sum payments and certain rents. However, variable or fixed payments for the working of mineral deposits or other natural resources do not fall within the defined term as they are governed by Article 6. Although all royalties and know-how payments (whether lump sum or not) are covered the following should be noted:

*   If a payment is made in the form of rent rather than on a royalty basis and the payment comes within the term "royalties" then the 10 percent maximum rate on gross applies. However, rental payments do not constitute royalties under our domestic law and there is, therefore, no non-resident withholding tax applicable. Payments of this nature will be subject to an annual assessment on the net amount after expenses and if the tax so levied exceeds 10 percent of the gross rental, a rebate will be given by virtue of the Convention to bring the tax down to 10 percent of gross.

4\. Paragraph 4: The comments relating to paragraph 4 of the Dividend Article apply equally here, except that New Zealand's domestic law in relation to royalties provides for a withholding tax rate of 15 percent final on cultural royalties or where the aggregate annual royalty payment does not exceed $1,000, the minimum final in all other cases.

5\. Paragraphs 5 and 6: The comments on paragraphs 5 and 6 respectively of the Interest Article apply equally here.

### Article 13 - Income from Alienation of Property

1\. Paragraph 1 concerns income or gains derived from the alienation of real property. Income from such alienation may be taxed in the State where the property is situated. For example if a resident of Switzerland sells at a profit a real property situated in New Zealand the profit can be taxed in New Zealand if the New Zealand domestic law permits that taxation.

2\. Paragraph 2 deals with income or gains derived from the alienation of personal property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment or pertaining to a fixed base used for the performing of independent personal services. This may be taxed in the State where the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.

3\. Paragraph 3 provides that income or gains from the alienation of ships or aircraft operated in international traffic are taxable only in the State where the effective management of the enterprise is situated.

4\. Paragraph 4 stipulates that any income or gains from any property not covered by the Article is to be taxable only in the State which the alienator is a resident.

### Article 14 - Independent Personal Services

1\. This Article concerns income from professional personal services (ie, independent personal services) as distinct from income from dependent personal services (eg, remuneration such as salary or wages) which is dealt with separately under Article 15. Income from independent personal services is to be treated in much the same way as "business profits", that is, taxable only in the country of residence unless attributable to a fixed base regularly available to the taxpayer in the other State. The term "fixed base" is intended to cover a centre of activity of a fixed or permanent character, for instance, a doctor's consulting room or the office of an architect or lawyer.

2\. The Article does not apply to artistes and athletes which are dealt with under Article 17.

### Article 15 - Dependent Personal Services

1\. Paragraph 1 states the general rule that personal services performed by a resident of one of the Contracting States may be taxed in that other Contracting State, only if the services are performed in that other Contracting State.

2\. Paragraph 2 states the case where exemption will be given by the State visited. The main requirements are that:

*   the visit does not exceed 183 days in the aggregate in the income year; and
*   the remuneration is paid by an employer not resident in that State; and
*   the remuneration is not borne by a permanent establishment or fixed base which the employer has in that State.

Initially New Zealand PAYE tax will be required to be deducted from the remuneration paid but will be refunded at the time of departure provided the requirements of the Article are fully met. In this respect a certificate must be obtained, by the person seeking exemption, from the Swiss tax authorities which certifies that that person is a resident of Switzerland for the purposes of Swiss tax.

3\. Paragraph 3 provides that remuneration derived from employment aboard a ship or aircraft operating in international traffic may be taxed in the State in which the place of effective management of the shipping or airline enterprise is situated. This means that if the place of effective management of the enterprise is in Switzerland then Switzerland has the right to tax the remuneration derived by the employee. New Zealand would allow credit for any Swiss tax on such remuneration if derived by a New Zealand resident.

### Article 16 - Directors' Fees

This Article allows the State in which the company paying the fees or other similar payments is resident to have the first right to tax such income.

### Article 17 - Artistes and Athletes

1\. Paragraph 1 enables the State in which the entertainer or athlete is performing the services to tax the income derived from these personal activities.

2\. Paragraph 2 deals with the situation where income for the performance of an entertainer or athlete is not paid or paid in full to the entertainer or athlete himself but to another person. The paragraph permits the State in which the performance is given to impose a tax on the profits diverted from the income of the entertainer or athlete to he enterprise where for instance the entertainer or athlete has control over or rights to the income thus diverted or has obtained or will obtain some benefit directly or indirectly from that income. Without this paragraph the State where the services are being performed would in such cases, be unable to tax:

*   because it would not be personal service income to the entertainer, and
*   in the absence of a permanent establishment the payments could not be taxed as business profits in the hands of the other person.

### Article 18 - Pensions and Annuities

1\. Paragraph 1 gives the State of residence exclusive rights to tax pensions where they are paid in consideration of past employment and annuities. However, this rule is subject to Article 192. wherein Government pensions paid in respect of services rendered are taxed exclusively in the State of source but if the recipient is a resident and a national of the other State the pensions are taxable on a residence basis. (See definition of "national" in Article 3.) This means that a Swiss Government pension paid to a resident of New Zealand is taxed only in Switzerland and exempt in New Zealand unless the recipient is also a national of New Zealand in which case the pension is taxed only in New Zealand and exempt in Switzerland.

2\. Paragraph 2 defines annuity for the purpose of this Article.

### Article 19 - Government Service

1\. This Article deals with remuneration paid to an individual in respect of services rendered to a State or political subdivision or local authority thereof.

2\. Paragraph 1 provides for two situations:

*   Remuneration paid by a State in respect of services rendered to it by an individual shall be taxable only by that State.
*   However, such remuneration shall be taxed exclusively in the other State if the services are rendered in that State by an individual who is a resident of that State, and who is also a national of that State or did not become a resident of that State solely for the purposes of rendering those services.

The second situation can be illustrated as follows.

_Remuneration paid by the Swiss Government for services rendered in New Zealand by an individual who is a resident and national of New Zealand shall be taxed exclusively in New Zealand. This is still the position even though the individual, although a national of New Zealand, did become a resident of New Zealand for the purposes of rendering those services for the Swiss Government._

3\. Paragraph 2 deals with Government pensions. (See explanation to Article 18 in this supplement.)

4\. Paragraphs 1 and 2 do not apply if the services are performed in connection with business carried on by the State, or one of its political subdivisions or local authorities, paying the remuneration. Under paragraph 3 the ordinary rules apply: Article 15 for wages and salaries, Article 16 for directors' fees and Article 18 for pensions.

### Article 20 - Students

This Article exempts from New Zealand tax maintenance, education or training payments received here from overseas by a student or business apprentice from Switzerland. Note:

*   The student or apprentice must have been a resident of Switzerland immediately before he comes to New Zealand.
*   He must be in New Zealand solely for the purpose of his education or training.
*   The payments must be made from sources outside New Zealand.
*   There is no time limit on the period spent in New Zealand.
*   The exemption is restricted to the payments mentioned, ie, for maintenance.

The converse applies to a New Zealand student or apprentice going to Switzerland.

### Article 21 - Other Income

1\. This Article provides a general rule relating to income not dealt with in the other Articles of the Convention. The income concerned is not only income of a class not expressly dealt with but also income from sources not expressly mentioned. A secondary effect of the Article is to clarify the situation of income derived from a third country by a person who could be "resident in" both Switzerland and New Zealand under the general laws of each country. Under the convention that person can be a "resident of" only one country. In such a situation the taxing rights are allocated to the country "of" which he is a resident.

2\. The effect of this Article is that income derived by a resident of New Zealand is taxed exclusively in New Zealand unless the income is derived from sources in Switzerland. If the income is derived from sources in Switzerland it may also be taxed there and a credit for the Swiss tax is given in New Zealand, should that income be liable for New Zealand tax. The converse will apply in the case of a resident of Switzerland. Cases of conflict between two residences are to be determined by reference to Article 4.

### Article 22 - Methods for Elimination of Double Taxation

This Article contains the normal rules whereby each State gives credit for the other State's tax when assessing its residents on income derived from sources in the other State. It should be noted that the credit provisions in the Article are subject to the domestic law of each country.

### Article 23 - Mutual Agreement Procedure

### Article 24 - Exchange of Information

These are standard Articles and require no additional comment.

### Article 25 - Diplomatic Agents and Consular Officers

1\. The aim of this Article is to ensure that diplomatic agents or consular officers shall, under the Convention, receive no less favourable treatment than that to which they are entitled under international law or under special international agreements. Paragraph 2 establishes that the sending State is to be the State of residence for members of diplomatic or consular missions provided they are regarded as residents under the domestic law of that State.

2\. Paragraph 3 ensures that international organisations, organs or officials, or members of a diplomatic mission of a third State, who are liable in one of the Contracting States in respect only of income from sources therein shall not have the benefit of the Convention.

### Article 26 - Territorial Extension

This is a standard Article and requires no additional comments.

### Article 27 - Entry Into Force

This Article provides that the Convention will apply in New Zealand for any income year beginning on or after 1 April 1981 and in Switzerland it applies to any taxable year beginning on or after 1 January 1981.

### Article 28 - Termination

This Article sets out the procedure if either state wishes to terminate the Convention. Unless notice of termination is given in accordance with the Article the Convention continues indefinitely.

### Protocol

The protocol deals with those items where some further explanation is required of points not covered in the Article concerned. The main points are explained earlier in this Bulletin on an Article by Article basis.

Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979, Amendment No 3
==================================================================

Archived legislative commentary on the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979, Amendment No 3 from PIB vol 115 Nov 1981.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 115, November 1981

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_.](/about/about-our-publications)

### Withholding Tax on Non-Resident Contractors

The Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979, Amendment No 3 has recently been made by Order-in-Council. It gives effect to the Government's announcement in July this year that a withholding tax on payments to overseas contractors would be introduced.

The main features of the withholding tax are:

### _Rate of Tax and Application Date_

The rate is 15 percent of gross payments made to non-residents, whether they are companies or individuals (other than employees), in respect of specified contract activities or services. It applies to payments made on or after 1 January 1982.

### _Interim Tax_

The withholding tax is not an additional tax but a payment on account of the non-resident's annual income tax liability. The tax is neither a minimum nor a final liability. The non-resident's final tax liability will be determined by annual assessment in the normal way. Any refund or further tax to pay will be determined when the tax return for the year is filed.

### _Liable Payments_

The withholding tax will be required to be deducted from payments to non-residents in respect of any "contract activity ". A "contract activity" is:

1.  work carried on in New Zealand in relation to:
    *   construction, installation, assembly and similar projects, or
    *   consultancy, advisory and other professional or technical services in respect of such projects.
2.  the hire of personnel or equipment to be used in New Zealand.

### Exempt Payments

*   Payments which are a direct reimbursement of the non-resident's costs will be exempt from the withholding tax except where the non-resident and the payer are associated persons.
*   Payments which are 'royalties' within the meaning of the Tax Act.

(**Note:** Royalty payments to non-residents are subject to Non-Resident Withholding Tax).

### _Exemption Certificates_

Exemption certificates may be granted, on written application by the non-resident contractor, where:

1.  the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is satisfied that, by reason of a double tax treaty or for any other reason, the income is exempt from New Zealand tax.
2.  the non-resident contractor provides a bond or other form of security satisfactory to the Commissioner, securing payment of any tax which is, or may become, payable in respect of the contract activity.
3.  the Commissioner is satisfied that the non-resident contractor has complied with his tax obligations in the 24 months immediately preceding the application and will continue to comply in the future.

### _Special Rate Certificates_

The Inland Revenue Department can issue, on application by a non-resident contractor, special tax rate certificates authorising a lower or higher rate of withholding tax. An amended rate would normally be based on a certified budget of expected revenues and expenditure or on the basis of previous years tax returns. Any special rate would be for a limited period and would be reviewed in the light of actual results.

### _Accounting for the Withholding Tax_

The withholding tax is to be deducted by the payer of contract monies in a similar manner to that applying to other withholding payments. The tax so deducted is to be accounted for to the Department as part of the normal monthly PAYE tax remittances. An IR13 withholding payment deduction form is also to be completed in respect of each non-resident contractor.

### _Enquiries_

Any enquiries about the tax or applications for exemption or special rate certificates should be addressed to:

_**The District Commissioner,** Inland Revenue Department, Private Bag, WELLINGTON._

Double Taxation Relief (United States of America) Order 1983
============================================================

Archived legislative commentary on the Double Taxation Relief (United States of America) Order 1983 (SR 1983/196) from PIB vol 112, suppl 11 Dec 1983.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 112, Supplement No. 11, December 1983

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_](/about/about-our-publications)
.

Part I - Introduction and General Summary
-----------------------------------------

A new double taxation convention has been concluded between the United States of America and New Zealand which replaces the Agreement signed at Washington on 16 March 1948 between the two countries. The text of the new convention has been published as a schedule to an Order in Council (SR 1983/196) which was recently distributed to district offices and is also available from Government Bookshops.

The Convention came into force on 2 November 1983 with effect in New Zealand:

*   for any income year beginning on or after 1 April 1984;
*   from 1 April 1982 in the case of dividends beneficially owned by a resident of the United States. Since 1 April 1982 dividends paid to residents of the United States have been subject to non-resident withholding tax at the New Zealand domestic rate of 30 percent. As the Convention came into force before 1 April 1984 the treaty rate of 15 percent applies from 1 April 1982 to dividends paid by a New Zealand resident company. Taxpayers may obtain refunds of tax overpaid by applying to the Dunedin District Office of the Department.

In the United States it takes effect:

*   on 1 January 1984 in respect of taxes withheld at source;
*   for taxable years beginning on or after 1 January 1984.

There is no need for transitional provisions in this Convention as the 1948 Agreement ceases to apply when the provisions of the 1983 Convention take effect.

**NB:**The new Convention is generally drafted in accordance with the 1977 OECD Model Double Taxation Convention. The notes and commentaries in the OECD booklet "Model Double Taxation Convention on Income and Capital" are therefore useful resource material in understanding the application of the Convention. Care should be taken to identify differences in the text of the Convention from that in the Model if using those notes and commentaries as an aid in the interpretation or application of this new Convention with the United States.

Part II - Notes on the Convention Article by Article
----------------------------------------------------

### Article 1 - General Scope

1\. The Convention applies to persons who are **residents** of New Zealand or of the United States or of both States except as otherwise provided.

2\. Paragraph 2 confirms the principle that the Convention should not take away any benefits given under the domestic law of a country or other Agreement by way of exclusion, exemption, deduction, credit or other allowance. Although this provision is not in any of our other double taxation treaties it is a principle which New Zealand adheres to in the interpretation of double tax treaties.

3\. Paragraph 3 and paragraph 4 are the most significant departures from New Zealand's other double taxation treaties and are included at the request of the United States.

The reason for the provision in paragraph 3, known as the "saving clause", is that the United States views treaties as affecting a Contracting State's right to tax residents and citizens of the other Contracting State, and not its right to tax its own residents and citizens.

The United States considers the "saving clause" is necessary for the United States to retain its statutory right to tax its citizens and residents on world-wide income. The United States also retains the right to tax a former citizen on United States source income for a 10 year period if the former citizen renounced citizenship to avoid United States tax.

New Zealand does not consider for its part that a "saving clause" is necessary to allow taxation of New Zealand residents on world-wide income.

**Example**

A United States citizen who lives in New Zealand and who is under Article 4 of the Convention a "resident of New Zealand", derives dividends from the USA amounting to $100.

Assuming that this person's New Zealand tax rate on the dividends, after taking into account all income derived, is 45 cents in $1, while in the United States by applying the same basis the rate is 60 cents in $1, the position would be as follows:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st level | US tax is limited under Article 10 of the Convention to 15 percent of $100 | $15 |
| 2nd level | NZ tax on $100 at 45 cents less credit for tax paid under Level 1 | 30  |
|     |     | $45 |
| 3rd level | US tax on $100 at 60 cents less credit for tax paid under Levels 1 and 2 | 15  |
|     | Total Tax Paid | $60 |

Under the credit provisions of Article 22 the credit available against the New Zealand tax payable is limited to the tax levied by the United States under Level 1.

See also the example set out in the notes on Article 22.

4\. Paragraph 4 sets out the exclusions from the application of paragraph 3.

**Example**

Article 9 of the Convention provides safeguards against trading between associated parties, eg, if a New Zealand company which is a subsidiary of a United States company has been overcharged by the United States company for its purchases, the New Zealand company's profits would be increased to the extent of the excess charged.

The United States company as a consequence would request the United States Tax Authorities to adjust its profits to prevent double taxation. The adjustments made by the New Zealand Inland Revenue are in accordance with Article 92. . The benefit the United States company is claiming from the United States Authorities could be denied under Article 13. but for the exclusion provided for by Article 14. .

### Article 2 - Taxes Covered

The Convention covers income tax for both countries and excise taxes imposed on private foundations by the United States. The latter tax is imposed effectively in lieu of income taxes. It would cover such situations as a person purchasing a painting and donating it to a foundation for exhibition purposes for part of the year only. Excess retention tax and bonus issue tax imposed by New Zealand are excluded from the Convention and the United States equivalents of excess retention tax being accumulated earnings tax and personal holding company tax are also excluded.

Film Hire tax is not covered by this Convention.

### Article 3 - General Definitions

1\. This Article groups together a number of general provisions required for the interpretation of the terms used in the Convention.

2\. Paragraph 2 makes it clear that the terms "New Zealand tax" and "United States tax" do not include penalties or interest imposed.

3\. Paragraph 3 is a standard provision. Where a term is not defined it has the meaning applicable under the domestic law of the country applying the Convention.

### Article 4 - Residence

1\. Paragraph 1 defines the meaning of the term "resident of a Contracting State". In effect the defined term is a reference to the domestic law of each country. Whenever the term is used in the Convention, the residence of the taxpayer must first be determined in accordance with this Article.

The thrust of this first sentence concentrates on the idea of physical presence in a country but because the United States' basis of taxation in many cases is based solely on "citizenship" it was necessary to include that term. Paragraph 1(a) precludes a United States citizen living in, say, a tax haven, or a country other than the United States or New Zealand, saying that he is a "resident of the United States" and claiming the benefits provided by the Convention such as reduced rates of non-resident withholding tax or the 183 day rule in Article 15 (Dependent Personal Services).

Paragraph 1(b) provides that a partnership, estate or trust will only be regarded as a "resident of a Contracting State" if its income is taxed in its hands or the hands of its partners or beneficiaries. Partnership is included here as certain United States partnerships are liable to tax as an entity.

Finally paragraph 1 provides that non-taxable organisations such as charities will receive the benefit of the Convention such as reduced non-resident withholding tax rates for interest, dividends or royalties, eg, if a United States charity invested money in New Zealand and was exempt from tax in the United States it could be argued that the Convention does not apply to the charity under the first paragraph of this Article as it is not "subject to tax therein" and New Zealand could impose 30 percent non-resident withholding tax on the dividends as the charity could not be exempt from tax in New Zealand. This provision ensures that the Convention applies and that New Zealand's non-resident withholding tax is limited to 15 percent under Article 10.

2\. Paragraph 2 sets out the tests to be applied to solve the problem of a dual resident individual. Dual residence arises when a taxpayer is resident in both countries by virtue of the domestic law of each country.

3\. Paragraph 3 provides that where a person other than an individual or a company (eg, estate or trust) is resident in both countries the competent authorities shall endeavour to settle the question by mutual agreement.

4\. Paragraph 4 provides that where a company is resident in both countries the competent authorities shall endeavour to settle the question by mutual agreement and where they are unable to agree they shall be treated as a resident of neither for the purpose of the Convention.

In applying the tests to dual residents as set out in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 it should be remembered that these tests apply only for the purposes of the tax convention. If the person **resident in New Zealand** (domestic law test) becomes for the Convention a "Resident of the United States" after the tests have been applied, this does not mean that he is a non-resident for all purposes of New Zealand tax law. For example, he can never be subject to non-resident withholding tax, the reason being that although he is treated as a non-resident for certain purposes of the Convention, he is still a resident under the New Zealand Income Tax Act. What it does mean is that he is entitled to any benefits granted by the Convention as a "resident of the United States". For example, although New Zealand royalty income derived by him is not subject to non-resident withholding tax, he is liable for New Zealand income tax on the royalty income but qualifies for the 10 percent limitation in the Convention.

### Article 5 - Permanent Establishment

This Article defines the term "permanent establishment". This concept determines the right of a Contracting State to tax the profits of an "enterprise of the other Contracting State". Due to the inclusion of the words "includes especially" in paragraph 2, the examples cited as constituting a permanent establishment are by no means exhaustive.

The definition of "permanent establishment" is fairly standard; however the following points should be noted:

### Article 6 - Income from Real Property

This Article recognises the internationally accepted practice in relation to income from land or landed property. The Article also applies to such items as rents, natural resource royalties, farming profits, etc. The principle of the Article is that income from "real property" may be taxed in the country where the property is situated. "Real property" is not defined in our general law but the Article provides an extensive definition. Ships and aircraft are specifically excluded from the term "real property".

The Article involves no change in current practice in relation to the income covered, ie, our domestic law applies.

### Article 7 - Business Profits

This Article is in many respects a continuation of, and a corollary to, Article 5 on the definition of the concept of permanent establishment. Under Article 7 a Contracting State cannot tax the business profits of an enterprise of the other Contracting State unless it carries on its business through a permanent establishment situated therein. If a permanent establishment exists the Article goes on to lay down a set of rules by reference to which are to be calculated the profits of the permanent establishment.

Before dealing with the salient features of the Article some comment is warranted on the importance of paragraph 6. This is because reference to this Article and Article 5 will not always be necessary to determine the liability of specific types of income. In effect paragraph 6 gives first preference to the other Articles in the Convention. It follows that this Article will only be applicable to business profits which do not belong to the categories of income specifically covered in other Articles of the Convention, and in addition, to dividends, interest and royalties which **specifically** come within the **circumstances** detailed in paragraph 3 of Article 10, and paragraph 4 of Articles 11 and 12, and consequently fall within Article 7.

1\. Paragraph 1 expresses the general rule that profits are taxable only in the country of residence unless the enterprise is engaged in business in the other country through a permanent establishment, in which case the other country may tax the business profits of the permanent establishment.

It is important to note that only income attributable **directly** to the permanent establishment's operations can form part of the establishment's operations. This does not mean that income which is not directly attributable to the establishment's operations escapes liability for tax. For example, the restriction on the rate of tax imposed by paragraph 2 of Articles 10, 11 and 12, would still apply if such income did not arise from the permanent establishment's operations.

2\. Paragraph 2 contains the normal provision enabling arm's length profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment if necessary.

3\. Paragraph 3 expresses the taxpayer's right to deduct from the profits of the permanent establishment the expenses incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment even if those expenses are incurred outside the country where the permanent establishment is situated.

4\. Paragraph 4 precludes the attribution of profits to a permanent establishment by reason of merely purchasing activities carried on by the permanent establishment for the enterprise.

5\. Paragraph 5 provides that unless there are good and sufficient reasons to the contrary the business profits attributed to a permanent establishment must be determined by the same method each year.

6\. Paragraph 6: refer to initial comments on this Article above.

7\. Paragraph 7 provides that income from the business of any form of insurance is not subject to the provisions of this Article. Such income may be taxed in accordance with the domestic law of each country.

### Article 8 - Shipping and Air Transport

1\. Under this Article profits from operating ships or aircraft in "international traffic" - defined in Article 31. (e) are to be taxed only in the country of residence of the enterprise. International shipping and aircraft profits include income from:

*   carriage of passengers and cargo;
*   sale of passenger tickets on behalf of other enterprises;
*   commercial advertising;
*   charter fees (but refer paragraph 2. below).

Due to the definition of "international traffic" exemption does not extend to profits derived from coastal traffic. Further, investment income of shipping and air transport enterprises is subject to the treatment ordinarily applied to that class of income, eg, dividends derived would be subject to Article 10.

2\. Paragraph 2 specifically brings within the scope of this Article profits arising from the rental of ships or aircraft or from the use, maintenance, or rental of containers and ancillary equipment provided:

*   the ships, aircraft or containers are used in international traffic, and
*   the enterprise receiving the profits is in the business of operating ships and aircraft in international traffic, and
*   the rental income is incidental to the profits derived from those activities.

It follows that bare boat charter fees will be taxed only in the State of residence of the lessor provided the conditions set out in subparagraphs (a) to (c) above are met.

In the case of container leasing where the conditions in subparagraphs (a) to (c) are not met, the lease payments would come within the scope of Article 12 Royalties, ie, payments for the use of commercial or scientific equipment.

This provision does not change current policy in relation to profits from leasing ships or aircraft on charter fully equipped, manned and used in international traffic. Such profits will continue to be treated as coming within the scope of paragraph 1 of the Article.

New Zealand does not normally include this paragraph in double tax treaties as we apply a liberal interpretation to paragraph 1 which has the same effect.

### Article 9 - Associated Enterprises

This Article enables an arm's-length profit to be attributed to associated enterprises in accordance with the taxation laws of the State applying the Convention.

### Article 10 - Dividends

1\. Paragraph 1 of the Article simply states that dividends may be taxed in the State of the recipient's residence.

2\. Paragraph 2 provides that the Contracting State from which the dividends are paid also has the right to tax, but the maximum tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 15 percent of the gross amount of the dividends. Therefore, in terms of the Convention New Zealand's taxing rights will be restricted to 15 percent of the gross dividend even though the rate under domestic law is 30 percent. In the case of New Zealand the limitation is to be achieved by withholding tax of 15 percent being deducted by companies paying the dividends to residents of the United States.

Although the rest of the Convention has effect from 1 April 1984, for the purposes of this Article paragraph 3 of Article 27 (Entry Into Force) is backdated to 1 April 1982 as the 1948 Agreement did not impose any rate restriction on New Zealand's taxation of dividends. Without this provision the rate of non-resident withholding tax on dividends paid to residents of the United States would have to have been 30 percent for the period 1 April 1982 to 31 March 1984 (refer Introduction).

3\. Paragraph 3 deals with dividends arising from shares which are attributable to a permanent establishment. It provides that in the State of source the dividends are taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment, provided they are paid in respect of holdings forming part of the assets of the permanent establishment or are otherwise attributable to that establishment. In effect this relieves the State of source of the dividends from the 15 percent limitation under the Article.

The rules set out above also apply where the recipient of the dividends has in the other State, for the purpose of performing any of the kinds of independent personal services mentioned in Article 14, a fixed base with which the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is attributable.

Prior to 1 April 1982 these qualifications would have had no effect on the New Zealand tax position because our domestic law provided for a 15 percent final withholding tax in all cases on the gross payment and no convention can extend the taxing rights under domestic law. However, in view of the change in the New Zealand domestic law from 1 April 1982 the New Zealand tax on dividends paid in respect of shares attributable to a permanent establishment will be 30 percent.

4\. Paragraph 4 departs from the OECD model to the extent that it allows for example the United States to tax dividends paid by a New Zealand company to say an Austrian resident where the profits from which the dividend is paid are attributable to a permanent establishment in the United States and such profits make up at least 50 percent of the gross income from all sources of the company paying the dividend.

"Dividends" are not defined in the Convention, therefore the domestic law applies.

### Article 11 - Interest

1\. Paragraph 1 affirms the taxing right of the State in which the recipient of the interest is a resident.

2\. Paragraph 2 also affirms the taxing right of the State in which the interest arises, but the maximum tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 10 percent of the gross amount of the interest. New Zealand's tax is therefore limited to 10 percent on gross interest paid to residents of the United States instead of the usual 15 percent.

3\. Paragraph 3 exempts interest which arises in New Zealand where the interest is:

*   derived by the United States Government or an instrumentality of the United States Government which is not subject to tax in the United States; or
*   derived by a resident of the United States the loans having been guaranteed or insured by the United States Government or an instrumentality of the United States Government which is not subject to tax on its income by the United States.

This provision is so worded that exemption would apply in similar circumstances to interest arising in the United States and derived by the New Zealand Government or New Zealand residents.

4\. Paragraph 4 provides that in the State of source, interest is taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment there owned by a resident of the other State, provided the interest is paid in respect of debt-claims forming part of the assets of the permanent establishment or otherwise attributable to that establishment. In effect this paragraph relieves the State of source of the interest from any limitation under the Article.

The rules set out above also apply where the recipient of the interest has in the other State, for the purpose of performing any of the kinds of independent personal services mentioned in Article 14, a fixed base to which the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is attributable.

These qualifications tie in with the New Zealand domestic law which provides that if a non-resident has a fixed establishment in New Zealand, then interest derived is not subject to non-resident withholding tax but is to be assessed on an annual basis. (Section 310 of the Income Tax Act 1976.)

5\. Paragraph 5 is a source rule and precludes argument as to the source of the interest.

The paragraph deals with interest arising through a permanent establishment or fixed base. Where a loan is contracted for the requirements of that establishment and the interest is borne by that establishment, the paragraph determines that the source of the interest is in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated, leaving aside the place of residence of the owner of that establishment or base.

6\. Paragraph 6 is an anti-avoidance provision to ensure that only a reasonable interest payment (eg, arm's-length) is taxed at the reduced rate specified in the Convention.

7\. Paragraph 7 prevents either State from applying unacceptable source rules (colloquially known as "rogue source rules") to interest and imposing tax on that interest.

"Interest" is not defined in the Convention, therefore the domestic law applies.

### Article 12 - Royalties

1\. Paragraph 1 affirms the taxing right of the State in which the recipient of the royalties is a resident.

2\. Paragraph 2 also affirms the taxing right of the State in which the royalties arise, but the maximum tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 10 percent of the gross amount of the royalties. New Zealand's tax is therefore limited to 10 percent on gross royalties paid to residents of the United States instead of the usual 15 percent withheld. In New Zealand the limitation will be achieved by the payer of the royalties deducting withholding tax of 10 percent at the time of payment. In the case of royalties which are subject to annual assessment the tax will be limited to 10 percent of the gross payment.

3\. Paragraph 3 defines "royalties" for the purposes of the Article. The term includes lump sum payments and certain rents. However, variable or fixed payments for the working of mineral deposits or other natural resources do not fall within the defined term as they are governed by Article 6.

It should be noted that if a payment is made in the form of rent rather than on a royalty basis and the payment comes within the term "royalties", as defined in the Convention, then the 10 percent maximum on gross applies. However, rental payments do not constitute royalties under our domestic law and there is, therefore, no non-resident withholding tax applicable. Payments of this nature will be subject to an annual assessment on the net amount after expenses and if the tax so levied exceeds 10 percent of the gross rental, a rebate will be given by virtue of the Convention to bring the tax down to 10 percent of gross.

Section 224 of the Income Tax Act 1976 provides for a special basis for calculating the income of non-resident film renters. This special basis is preserved in paragraph 2 of the Protocol.

4\. Paragraph 4 provides that in the State of source royalties are taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment there owned by the recipient which is a resident of the other State, **provided** the royalties are attributable to that establishment. In effect this relieves the State of source of the royalties from the 10 percent limitation under the Article.

The rules set out above also apply where the recipient of the royalties has in the other State, for the purpose of performing independent personal services, a fixed base to which royalties are attributable.

New Zealand's domestic law in relation to royalties provides for a withholding tax rate of 15 percent final on copyright (cultural) royalties or where the aggregate annual royalty payments do not exceed $1,000, while a minimum final tax applies in all other cases.

5\. Paragraph 5 is a source rule and precludes arguments as to the source of the royalties. Paragraph 5(b) was inserted at the request of the United States because of their domestic source rules for royalties and is known as the "use test".

This provision, for example, gives a royalty a source in the United States if a New Zealand company licences a trademark to a company in a third country. The third country company then markets the product in the United States without having a permanent establishment there. The payment for trademark between the third country and New Zealand has a source in the United States under the "use test" and the United States may tax but must limit the tax to 10 percent of the gross.

6\. Paragraph 6 is an anti-avoidance provision to ensure that only a reasonable royalty payment (arm's-length) is taxed at the reduced rate specified in the Convention.

### Article 13 - Alienation of Property

1\. Paragraph 1 concerns income or gains derived from the alienation of real property. Income from such alienation may be taxed in the State where the property is situated. For example, if a resident of the United States sells at a profit real property situated in New Zealand the profit can be taxed in New Zealand if the New Zealand domestic law permits that taxation.

2\. Paragraph 2 defines "real property" for the purposes of the Article. In the case of New Zealand it includes:

*   real property as defined in Article 6; and
*   shares in a company the assets of which are principally real property situated in New Zealand;
*   an interest in a partnership, trust or estate, the assets of which consist principally of real property situated in New Zealand.

The United States definition includes "real property interest" which is a term used in their domestic law in the taxing of foreign owned interest in real estate situated in the United States.

3\. Paragraph 3 provides that income or gains from the alienation of ships, aircraft or containers operated in international traffic are taxable only in the State of residence of the enterprise. An exception is where depreciation has been allowed in the other country. In this case the other country may add back the depreciation upon alienation of the property.

4\. Paragraph 4 ensures that income or gains from the alienation of royalties are taxed under Article 12 and subject to the limitation of 10 percent.

5\. Paragraph 5 deems the real property defined in 2(b)(ii) and 2(b)(iii) to be situated in New Zealand. This paragraph is necessary as the taxing of real property is dependent on situs under paragraph 1.

6\. Paragraph 6 deals with income or gains derived from the alienation of **personal** property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment or pertaining to a fixed base used for the performing of independent personal services. These gains may be taxed in the State where the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.

7\. Paragraph 7 stipulates that any income or gains from any property not covered by the Article is to be taxable only in the State of which the alienator is a resident.

### Article 14 - Independent Personal Services

1\. This Article concerns income from personal services (ie, independent personal services) as distinct from income from dependent personal services (eg, remuneration such as salary or wages) which is dealt with separately under Article 15. Income from independent personal services is taxable only in the State of residence unless the services are performed in the other State and the recipient of the income:

*   is present in the other State for a period or periods aggregating more than 183 days in any consecutive 12 month period; or
*   has a fixed base regularly available to him in the other State for the purpose of performing his activities.

If either of the above exceptions applies the State in which the services are performed also has the right to tax the income therefrom.

The term "fixed base" is intended to cover a centre of activity of a fixed or permanent character, for instance a doctor's consulting room or the office of an architect or lawyer.

2\. The Article does not apply to artistes or athletes which are dealt with under Article 17.

3\. There is no article specifically dealing with Directors' Fees in this Convention. Director's fees paid by a New Zealand company to a United States resident director will be dealt with under Article 21.

### Article 15 - Dependent Personal Services

1\. Paragraph 1 states the general rule that personal services performed by a resident of one of the Contracting States may be taxed in that other Contracting State, only if the services are performed in that other Contracting State.

2\. Paragraph 2 states the case where exemption will be given by the State visited. The main requirements are that:

*   the recipient of the income is present in the State visited for a period or periods which do not exceed **in the aggregate** 183 days in any consecutive 12 month period; and
*   the remuneration is paid by an employer not resident in that State; and
*   the remuneration is not connected with the activities of a permanent establishment or fixed base which the employer has in that State.

Regarding the 183 day test the term "consecutive 12 month period" should be noted as the treatment effectively differs from the term "income year" which is used in other treaties.

Where the term "income year" is used for the purposes of the 183 day test each income year is looked at separately in determining the number of days present. Therefore the exemption could apply where a visit of more than 183 days straddles two income years provided the visit does not exceed 183 days in either year.

When applying the "consecutive 12 month period" criterion it should be remembered that each day means the commencement of a period of 12 months from that particular day. Thus, although a visit may straddle two income years the exemption will not apply if the visit exceeds 183 days over a period of 12 months. For example, a United States resident who visits New Zealand on 1 November and departs on the following 30 June will not be exempt as he will have been present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in a 12 month period.

In this example, if the criterion was an "income year" instead of "consecutive 12 month period" the visitor could be exempt as at no stage would he be present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in **an income year**.

When a visitor from the United States undertakes employment in New Zealand, New Zealand PAYE tax will be required to be deducted from the remuneration paid but will be refunded at the time of departure provided the requirements of the Article are fully met. In this respect a certificate must be obtained, by the person seeking exemption, from the United States authorities which certifies that that person is resident in the United States for the purposes of United States tax. It is not sufficient that a person is a citizen of the United States. (See comments on Article 4 (Residence).)

3\. Directors' fees: refer to paragraph 3 of Article 14 of this bulletin.

### Article 16 - Limitation on Benefits

This Article is designed to limit the opportunity for third country residents to take advantage of the treaty benefits by organising a holding or investment company in one of the Contracting States.

1\. Paragraph 1 provides, for example, that for a company which is a resident of New Zealand (or person other than an individual) to obtain the benefit of the Convention the following conditions apply:

*   The company must be at least 75 percent owned by:
    *   individuals who are residents of the United States;
    *   citizens of the United States;
    *   individuals who are residents of New Zealand;
    *   companies whose shares are traded on a recognised stock exchange;
    *   the New Zealand or United States governments; OR
*   The New Zealand company's shares are traded on a recognised stock exchange; OR
*   The principal purpose of forming the New Zealand company was not of obtaining benefits under the Convention.

**Example**

A company which is a resident of New Zealand is deriving interest income from the United States. If the company is, say, 40 percent owned by persons resident in the Bahamas the 10 percent source limitation under Article 11 will not apply and the United States would be free to tax the income at source at domestic rates. The same would apply in the converse situation of a United States resident company deriving income from New Zealand and having more than 25 percent ownership by residents in a third (or tax haven) country.

2\. Paragraph 2 defines the term "a recognised stock exchange".

3\. Paragraph 3 denies the benefit of the Convention to trusts deriving income from schemes the principal purpose of which is to obtain benefits under the Convention, eg, it will counter income splitting by, say, a New Zealand resident using United States trusts.

4\. Paragraph 4 provides for consultation between the competent authorities before this Article is applied.

### Article 17 - Artistes and Athletes

1\. Paragraph 1 enables the State in which the entertainer or athlete is performing the services to tax the income derived from these personal activities if the gross receipts derived by him exceed US$10,000. It is important to note that expenses reimbursed to him or borne on behalf of him are to be included in the calculation of the threshold of US$10,000.

**Example**

A United States resident entertainer visits New Zealand to participate in the TV Telethon. He receives a fee of US$6,000 and is reimbursed his air fare and accommodation expenses totalling US$5,000. In this case the gross receipts would exceed US$10,000 and the income of $6,000 would be subject to New Zealand tax.

2\. Paragraph 2 deals with the situation where income for the performance of an entertainer or athlete is not paid or paid in full to the entertainer or athlete himself but to an enterprise providing the services of the entertainer or athlete. The paragraph permits the State in which the performance is given to impose a tax on the profits diverted from the income of the entertainer or athlete to the enterprise where for instance the entertainer or athlete has control over or rights to the income thus diverted or has obtained or will obtain some benefit directly or indirectly from that income. Without this paragraph the State where the services are being performed would, in such cases, be unable to tax:

*   because it would not be personal service income to the entertainer, and
*   in the absence of a permanent establishment the payments could not be taxed as business profits in the hands of the other person.

The onus is on the entertainers or athletes to prove that they are not associated with the enterprise deriving the profits.

### Article 18 - Pensions

1\. Paragraph 1(a) gives the State of **residence** exclusive right to tax pensions where they are paid in consideration of past employment. However, this Article does not cover Government pensions for services rendered which are dealt with in Article 192. .

Paragraph 1(b) states that pensions and other payments made under the social security legislation are taxable only in the country paying them, ie, State of source.

**Example**

A resident of New Zealand receives a pension from a previous employer who is a resident of the United States. He also receives a social security pension from the United States Government. The tax position is as follows:

*   the pension from the United States employer will be subject to tax solely in New Zealand as the country of residence and will be exempt in the United States;
*   the pension from the United States Government will be taxed at source in the United States and will be exempt from tax in New Zealand.

2\. Paragraph 2 gives the State of residence exclusive right to tax annuities.

### Article 19 - Government Service

This Article deals with remuneration paid to an individual in respect of services rendered to a State or political subdivision or local authority thereof.

1\. Paragraph 1 provides for two situations:

*   Remuneration paid by a State in respect of services rendered to it by an individual shall be taxable only by that State, ie, country of origin of the payment.
*   However, such remuneration is taxable only in the country where the services are performed provided the services are performed:
    *   by an individual who is a resident and also a citizen of that country, or
    *   by an individual who is a resident of that country and did not become a resident of that country solely for the purpose of performing those services.

The second situation can be illustrated as follows.

Remuneration paid by the United States for services rendered in New Zealand by an individual who is a resident and citizen of New Zealand shall be taxed exclusively in New Zealand. This is still the position even though the individual, although a citizen of New Zealand, did become a resident of New Zealand for the purposes of rendering those services for the United States Government.

**Example**

A locally recruited employee performing services for the United States Government in New Zealand, such as an individual who is a resident of New Zealand, will be liable for New Zealand tax on the employment income even though he may be a citizen of the United States.

2\. Paragraph 2 provides that Government pensions for services rendered are taxed exclusively in the State of source **but** if the recipient is a resident **and** a citizen of the other State, the pensions are taxable an a residence basis. This means that a United States pension paid to a resident of New Zealand is taxed only in the United States and exempt in New Zealand unless the recipient is also a citizen of New Zealand in which case the pension is taxed only in New Zealand and exempt in the United States.

3\. Paragraphs 1 and 2 do not apply if the services are performed in connection with business carried on by the State, or one of its political subdivisions or local authorities, paying the remuneration. Under paragraph 3 the ordinary rules apply: Article 15 for wages and salaries; Article 18 for pensions and annuities.

### Article 20 - Students

This Article exempts from New Zealand tax maintenance, education or training payments received here from overseas by a student from the United States. Note:

*   The student must have been a resident of the United States immediately before he comes to New Zealand.
*   He must be in New Zealand for the purpose of his education or training.
*   The payments must be made from sources outside New Zealand.
*   There is no time limit on the period spent in New Zealand.
*   The exemption is restricted to the payments mentioned, ie, for maintenance.

The converse applies to a New Zealand student going to the United States.

### Article 21 - Other Income

1\. This Article provides a general rule relating to income not dealt with in the other Articles of the Convention. The income concerned is not only income of a class not expressly dealt with but also income from sources not expressly mentioned. A secondary effect of the Article is to clarify the situation of income derived from a third country by a person who could be "resident in" both the United States and New Zealand under the general laws of each country. Under the Convention that person can be a "resident of" only one country. In such a situation the taxing rights as to the third country income are allocated to the country "of" which he is a resident for the purposes of the Convention.

2\. The effect of the Article is that income derived by a resident of New Zealand is taxed exclusively in New Zealand unless the income is derived from sources in the United States. If the income is derived from sources in the United States it may also be taxed there and a credit for the United States tax is given in New Zealand, should that income be liable for New Zealand tax. The converse will apply in the case of a resident of the United States. Cases of conflict as to residence are to be determined by reference to Article 4.

**Example**

A "resident of New Zealand" who is also a United States citizen derives dividends income from Australia. The United States, although it normally taxes the world income of its citizens, will have to exempt the Australian dividends by virtue of Article 21. New Zealand, as the country of residence will tax the dividends and allow credit for any tax paid in Australia.

### Article 22 - Methods of Elimination of Double Taxation

1\. This Article contains the rules whereby each State gives credit for the other State's tax when assessing its residents on income derived from sources in the other State. It should be noted that the credit provisions in the Article are subject to the domestic law of each country.

2\. Paragraph 3 covers the position of a United States citizen or United States company which is also a resident of New Zealand. The paragraph provides that where a resident of New Zealand derives income from the United States then New Zealand will allow credit for United States tax deducted at source in accordance with the provisions of the Convention. The United States, in taxing its citizens on an annual assessment basis, will credit against any additional United States tax the New Zealand tax assessed less the New Zealand tax credit allowed. (See example below.)

3\. Paragraph 4 is a source rule **for the purposes of the Article** in order to solve any dual source cases which may arise thus facilitating the allowance of a tax credit.

4\. The taxation by the United States on a "citizen" basis rather than a "resident" basis as explained in the notes on Article 1 has complicated the wording of this Article. The following examples may assist:

**Example 22/1**

*   United States citizen living in New Zealand for, say, 5 years. The United States authorities accept that he is a "resident of New Zealand" under Article 4.
*   Receives business profits from the United States but has **no permanent establishment** in the United States.
*   Under Article 7 of the agreement the income is taxable only in New Zealand, however the United States has a residual right to tax under Article 13. but must give credit for the New Zealand tax paid under Article 22 by virtue of Article 14. .

**Example 22/2**

*   The same facts as Example 22/1 (i).
*   Receives the following items of income:
    *   Income of $30,000 from personal services performed in New Zealand.
    *   Dividends from a United States company of $1,000 from which $150 in tax has been withheld by the United States Internal Revenue Service.
    *   Rental income of $2,000 from a house situated in the United States.
*   Under Article 15 New Zealand may tax the personal service income of $30,000. The United States taxes the income under its domestic law but, in certain circumstances, allows an exemption for foreign earned income of its citizens. In the absence of such exemption, New Zealand does not allow a credit for any United States tax imposed as the income has a New Zealand source.
*   Under Article 10 New Zealand may tax the dividends but must allow credit under Article 22 for the $150 tax at source which the United States may impose under paragraph 2 of Article 10. The United States has a residual right to tax under paragraph 3 of Article 1 ("savings clause") but must give credit for the New Zealand tax paid (paragraph 3 of Article 22). New Zealand does not allow credit for any residual tax imposed by the United States.
*   Rental income derived from real property situated in the United States is taxed in New Zealand by virtue of our domestic law concerning residence. Under Article 6 the income may also be taxed in the United States. In this case New Zealand allows credit under Article 22 for tax paid in the United States.

### Article 23 - Non-Discrimination

1\. Paragraph 1 establishes the principle that for purposes of taxation discrimination on the grounds of citizenship is forbidden. The last sentence of the paragraph is a United States provision protecting the taxation liabilities and benefits attached to United States citizens living outside the United States as distinct from non-United States citizens living outside United States. This is because United States citizens are taxed on their world income by the United States wherever they reside.

2\. Paragraph 2 requires non-residents trading through a permanent establishment to be taxed no less favourably than a resident who carries on the same activities.

Despite this provision New Zealand may for example continue to:

*   grant to New Zealand residents special exemptions and rebates which do not extend to non-residents;
*   impose the higher non-resident company tax rate on the profits of a permanent establishment in New Zealand;
*   impose non-resident withholding tax on dividends paid by a New Zealand company to a United States company.

3\. Paragraph 3 is designed to end a particular form of discrimination resulting from the fact that in certain countries the deduction of interest, royalties and other disbursements allowed without restriction when the recipient is resident, is restricted or even prohibited when he is a non-resident. New Zealand does not discriminate in this area between residents and non-residents.

4\. Paragraph 4 prevents discrimination against enterprises which are wholly or partly owned by residents of the other country, eg, a New Zealand subsidiary of a United States company. This has no practical effect in New Zealand - we do not discriminate against such enterprises.

5\. Paragraph 5 provides that this Article shall not apply to any provision in taxation laws which:

*   is reasonably designed to prevent or defeat the avoidance or evasion of taxes; or
*   is in force in the United States and New Zealand at present and any subsequent laws which have substantially similar purpose or intent.

Provided that for example New Zealand does not give greater benefits to residents or citizens of third countries than to residents or citizens of the United States.

6\. Paragraph 6 states that each country may distinguish between residents and non-residents. The paragraph makes it clear that the Article does not prevent different tax treatment solely on the basis of residence. This is the New Zealand view in any case.

7\. Paragraph 7 provides that where either State changes its taxation laws and the other State considers that those laws infringe the principles set out in the Article then the competent authorities consult in an endeavour to resolve the matter.

### Article 24 - Mutual Agreement Procedure

### Article 25 - Exchange of Information

These are standard Articles requiring no further comment.

### Article 26 - Diplomatic Agents and Consular Officers

The aim of this Article is to ensure that diplomatic agents or consular officers shall, under the Convention, receive no less favourable treatment than that to which they are entitled under international law or under special international agreements.

### Article 27 - Entry Into Force

The Convention came into force on 2 November 1983 with effect in New Zealand:

*   for any income year beginning on or after 1 April 1984.
*   from 1 April 1982 in the case of dividends beneficially owned by a resident of the United States.

In the United States it takes effect:

*   on 1 January 1983 in respect of taxes withheld at source.
*   for taxable years beginning on or after 1 January 1983.

There is no need for transitional provisions in this Convention as the 1948 Agreement ceases to apply when the provisions of the 1982 Convention take effect.

### Article 28 - Termination

This Article sets out the procedure if either State wishes to terminate the Convention. Unless notice of termination is given in accordance with the Article the Convention continues indefinitely.

### Protocol

The Protocol which forms an integral part of the Convention contains additional provisions in relation to certain Articles of the Convention.

1\. Paragraph 1 provides that if New Zealand agrees to lower rates for dividends, interest and royalties in future double taxation conventions then New Zealand will inform the United States and renegotiate.

2\. Paragraph 2 provides for the preservation of the special basis of taxation of non-resident film renters under section 224 of the Income Tax Act 1976.

Double Taxation Agreement Convention With Belgium
-------------------------------------------------

Part I - Introduction
---------------------

The text of the convention has been published as a schedule to an Order in Council (SR 1983/207) which is available to the public from Government Bookshops.

The convention entered into force on 8 December 1983 with effect:

(a) In New Zealand:

*   in respect of income assessable for any income year beginning on or after 1 April 1984,

(b) In Belgium:

*   in respect of all taxes due at source, on income credited or payable on or after 1 January 1984,
*   in respect of all taxes other than taxes due at source, on income of taxable periods ending on or after 31 December 1984.

Part II - Notes on the Convention Article by Article
----------------------------------------------------

### Article 1 - Personal Scope

The convention applies to persons who are **residents** of one or both of the contracting states.

### Article 2 - Taxes Covered

The convention covers in the case of:

(a) New Zealand:

*   Income tax and excess retention tax but not bonus issue tax or property speculation tax.

(b) Belgium:

*   the individual tax (L'impot des personnes physiques - de personenbelasting);
*   the corporate income tax (l'impot des societes - de vennootschapsbelasting);
*   the income tax on legal entities (l'impot des personnes morales - de rechtspersonenbelasting);
*   the income tax on non-residents (l'impot des non residents - de belasting der niet-verblijfhouders);
*   the exceptional and temporary solidarity contribution (la participation exceptionelle et temporaire de solidarite - de buitengewone en tijdelijke solidariteitsbijdrage);

including the prepayments, the surcharges on these taxes and prepayments, and the supplements to the individual income tax.

The convention does not apply to the corporate tax payable where a Belgian company repurchases its own shares or in the event of the distribution of its assets.

### Article 3 - General Definition

1\. **"National": Paragraph 1(f)**

The term "national" is used in paragraph 2(c) and (d) of Article 4 in determining resident status. It is also used in Article 19 Government Service.

In New Zealand the term covers a citizen of New Zealand and any legal person, partnership or association under the law in force in New Zealand.

In Belgium the term covers any individual possessing the nationality of Belgium, any legal person, partnership or association under the law in force in Belgium.

2\. Undefined Terms: Paragraph 4

This is a standard provision. Where a term is not defined it has the meaning applicable under the domestic law of the country applying the convention.

### Article 4 - Resident

1\. Paragraph 1 defines the meaning of the term "resident of a state" (ie, for the purposes of Article 1). In effect the defined term is a reference to the domestic law of each country. Whenever the term is used in the convention the residence of the taxpayer must first be determined in accordance with this Article.

A Belgian company which is not limited by shares is included in this term notwithstanding that it has elected to have its profits subject to the individual income tax.

2\. Paragraph 2 sets out the tests to be applied to solve the problem of a dual resident individual. Dual residence arises when a taxpayer is resident in both countries by virtue of the domestic law of each country. For example, an individual may have his permanent home in State A, where his wife and children live, and consequently, he is deemed to be resident in that State under its domestic law. However, he has spent 6 months of the year in State B and for that reason he is deemed to be resident in that State under its domestic law. This conflict is resolved by the tests set out in paragraph 2 giving preference to the claim of State A.

3\. Paragraph 3 sets out the rule to determine the case of a company or other legal person which is resident in both countries. Residence will be where the place of effective management of the enterprise is situated. In this respect New Zealand views the term "effective management" as meaning the practical day to day management, irrespective of where the overriding control is exercised.

4\. In applying the tests to dual residents, it should be remembered that these tests apply only for the purposes of the tax convention. If the person **resident in New Zealand** (domestic law test) becomes for the purposes of the convention a "resident of Belgium" after the tests have been applied, this does **not** mean that he is a non-resident for all purposes of New Zealand tax law. For example he can never be subject to non-resident withholding tax, the reason being that although he is treated as a non-resident for certain purposes of the convention, he is still a resident under the New Zealand Income Tax Act. What it does mean is that he is entitled to any benefits granted by the convention to a "resident of Belgium". Thus, although not subject to withholding tax on, for example, New Zealand royalty income, he would still qualify for the 10 percent limitation in the convention.

### Article 5 - Permanent Establishment

This Article defines the term "permanent establishment". This concept determines the right of a contracting state to tax the profits of an "enterprise of the other state". Due to the inclusion of the words "includes especially" in paragraph 2, the examples cited as constituting a permanent establishment are by no means exhaustive.

The definition of "permanent establishment" is fairly standard but the following points should be noted:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Paragraph 3 | A building site or construction or installation project constitutes a permanent establishment if it lasts more than 12 months. |
| Paragrpah 5 | An enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment if: |
|     | *   it carries on supervisory activities for more than 12 months in connection with a construction, installation or assemble project;<br>*   substantial equipment or machinery is for more than 12 months being used by, for or under contract with the enterprise. |

### Article 6 - Income from Real Property

This Article recognises the internationally accepted practice in relation to income from land and the exploitation of land or landed property. The Article also applies to such items as rents, natural resource royalties, farming profits, etc. The principle of the Article is that income from "real property" may be taxed in the country where the property is situated. "Real property" is not defined in our general law but the Article provides extensive definition. Ships and aircraft are specifically excluded from the term "real property".

The Article involves no change in current practice in relation to the income covered.

### Article 7 - Business Profits

This Article is in many respects a continuation of, and a corollary to, Article 5 on the definition of the concept of permanent establishment. Under Article 7 a contracting state cannot tax the profits of an enterprise of the other Contracting State unless it carries on its business through a permanent establishment situated therein. If a permanent establishment exists the Article goes on to lay down a set of rules by reference to which the profits of the permanent establishment are to be calculated.

Before dealing with the salient features of the Article some comment is warranted on the importance of paragraph 7. This is because reference to this Article and Article 5 will not always be necessary to determine the liability of the specific types of income. In effect paragraph 7 gives first preference to the other Articles in the convention. It follows that this Article will only be applicable to business profits which do not belong to the categories of income covered by the special Articles, and in addition, to dividends, royalties and interest which **specifically** come within the **circumstances** detailed in paragraphs 4 of Articles 10, 11 and 12, and consequently fall within Article 7.

1\. Paragraph 1 expresses the general rule that profits are taxable only in the country of residence unless the enterprise is engaged in business in the other country through a permanent establishment, in which case the other country may tax the profits of the permanent establishment.

It is important to note that only income attributable **directly** to the permanent establishment's operations can form part of the establishment's operations. This does not mean that income which is not directly attributable to the establishment's operations escapes liability for tax (see second paragraph above). For example, the restriction on the rate of tax imposed by paragraph 2 of Articles 10, 11 and 12, which concern dividend, interest and royalty payments respectively, would apply if such income did not arise from the permanent establishment's operations.

2\. Paragraph 2 contains the normal provision enabling arm's-length profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment if necessary.

3\. Paragraph 3 merely expresses the taxpayer's right to deduct from the profits of the permanent establishment the expenses incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment even if those expenses are incurred outside the country where the permanent establishment is situated.

4\. Paragraph 4 provides that where the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment are determined, not on the basis of separate accounts or by making an estimate of arm's-length profit, but simply by apportioning the total profits of the enterprise by reference to various formulae then such a method may continue to be employed provided it has been customary to adopt such a practice. Such a method differs from those envisaged in paragraph 2 of Article 7, since it contemplates not an attribution of profits on a separate enterprise footing, but an apportionment of total profits. However, in general the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment should be determined by reference to the establishment's accounts if these reflect the real facts. A method of allocation which is based on apportioning total profits is generally not as appropriate as a method which has regard only to the activities of the permanent establishment and should be used only where it has, as a matter of history, been customary in the past and is accepted by the Department and taxpayer as being satisfactory.

5\. Paragraph 5 precludes the attribution of profits to a permanent establishment by reason of merely purchasing activities carried on by the permanent establishment for the enterprise.

6\. Paragraph 6 provides that unless there are good and sufficient reasons to the contrary the profits attributed to a permanent establishment must be determined by the same method each year.

7\. Paragraph 7: refer to initial comments above on this Article.

8\. Protocol paragraph (a) provides that the calculation of income and computation of profits from insurance are not subject to the provisions of this Article. Such income may be taxed in accordance with the domestic law of each country.

### Article 8 - Shipping and Aircraft

1\. Under this Article profits from operating ships or aircraft in "international traffic" - defined in Article 31. (g) - are to be taxed only in the country in which the place of effective management of the enterprise is situated. International shipping and aircraft profits include income from:

*   carriage of passengers and cargo;
*   sale of passenger tickets on behalf of other enterprises;
*   commercial advertising;
*   charter fees (but refer paragraph 3. below).

2\. Due to the definition of "international traffic" exemption does not extend to profits derived from coastal traffic. Further, investment income of shipping and air transport enterprises is subject to the treatment ordinarily applied to that class of income, eg, dividends derived would be subject to Article 10.

3\. Profits obtained from leasing a ship or aircraft on charter fully equipped, manned and supplied, whether or not the enterprise providing the ship or aircraft actually owns them, would be treated as profits from the operation of a ship or aircraft. However, the Article does not extend to profits from leasing a ship or aircraft on a bare boat charter basis **except** when it is an occasional source of income for an enterprise engaged in the international operation of ships or aircraft. Apart from this one exception, bare boat charter fees would normally be classified as business profits and consequently dealt with under Article 7.

### Article 9 - Associated Enterprises

This is a standard Article enabling an arm's-length profit to be attributed to associated enterprises.

### Article 10 - Dividends

1\. Paragraph 1 of the Article simply states that dividends may be taxed in the State of the recipient's residence.

2\. Paragraph 2 provides that the Contracting State from which the dividends are paid also has the right to tax, but the maximum rate of tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 15 percent of the gross amount of the dividends. Therefore, in terms of the agreement New Zealand's taxing rights will be restricted to 15 percent of gross dividend even though the rate under domestic law is 30 percent. In the case of New Zealand the limitation is to be achieved by withholding tax of 15 percent being deducted by companies paying the dividends to residents of Belgium.

3\. Paragraph 3 defines "dividends" for the purposes of the Article. The effect is that "dividends" has the meaning given to it by section 4 of the Income Tax Act 1976 with respect to New Zealand. In the case of Belgium the term also includes income - even when paid in the form of interest - which is taxable under the head of income on capital invested by the members of a company, other than a company with share capital, which is a resident of Belgium.

4\. Paragraph 4 concerns shares which are effectively connected with a permanent establishment. The paragraph merely provides that in the State of source the dividends are taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment there owned by the recipient which is a resident of the other State, **provided** they are paid in respect of holdings forming part of the assets of the permanent establishment or otherwise effectively connected with that establishment. In effect this relieves the State of source of the dividends from any limitations under the Article.

The rules set out above also apply where the recipient of the dividends has in the other State, for the purposes of performing any of the kinds of independent personal services mentioned in Article 14, a fixed base with which the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected.

Prior to 1 April 1982 these qualifications had no effect on the New Zealand tax position because our domestic law provided for a 15 percent final withholding tax in all cases on the gross payment and no convention can extend the taxing rights under domestic law. However, in view of the change in the New Zealand domestic law from 1 April 1982 the New Zealand tax on dividends paid in respect of shares effectively connected with a permanent establishment or fixed base will be a maximum of 30 percent as against the 15 percent maximum applying under the convention, to "non-connected" dividends.

5\. Paragraph 5: The main effect of this paragraph is that it restricts the application of taxes on undistributed profits. For example, New Zealand cannot impose excess retention tax on a privately controlled company which is a "resident of Belgium".

### Article 11 - Interest

1\. Paragraph 1 affirms the taxing right of the State in which the recipient of the interest is a resident.

2\. Paragraph 2 also affirms the taxing right of the State in which the interest arises, but the maximum rate of tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 10 percent of the gross amount of the interest. New Zealand's tax is therefore limited to 10 percent on gross interest paid to residents of Belgium instead of the usual 15 percent.

3\. Paragraph 3 defines "interest" for the purposes of the Article. Penalty charges are excluded from the term as is income which would, because of a State's domestic law, be classified as a dividend. Therefore, in New Zealand, for example, interest received by debenture holders under debentures to which section 192 or 195 of the Income Tax Act 1976 applies would be dealt with under the dividend Article.

4\. Paragraph 4 provides that in the State of source interest is taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment there owned by a resident of the other State, **provided** the interest is paid in respect of debt-claims forming part of the assets of the permanent establishment or otherwise effectively connected with that establishment. In effect this paragraph relieves the State of source of the interest from any limitation under the Article.

This qualification ties in with the New Zealand domestic law which provides that if a non-resident has a fixed establishment in New Zealand, then interest derived is not subject to non-resident withholding tax but is to be assessed on an annual basis.(See section 310 of the Income Tax Act 1976.)

The rules set out above also apply where the recipient of the interest has in the other State, for the purpose of performing any of the kinds of independent personal services mentioned in Article 14, a fixed base with which the debt-claim in respect of which interest is paid is effectively connected.

5\. Paragraph 5 is a source rule and precludes argument as to the source of the interest.

The paragraph also deals with interest arising through a permanent establishment or fixed base. Where a loan was contracted for the requirements of that establishment and the interest is borne by the latter, the paragraph determines that the source of the interest is in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated, leaving aside the place of residence of the owner of that establishment or base.

6\. Paragraph 6 is an anti-avoidance provision to ensure that only a reasonable interest payment is taxed at the reduced rate specified in the convention.

### Article 12 - Royalties

1\. Paragraph 1 affirms the taxing right of the State in which the recipient of the royalties is a resident.

2\. Paragraph 2 also affirms the taxing right of the State in which the royalty arises, but the maximum rate of tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 10 percent of the gross amount of the royalty. New Zealand's domestic law is therefore limited to 10 percent on gross royalties instead of the 15 percent minimum. In New Zealand the limitation is achieved by the payer of the royalties deducting 10 percent at the time of payment. In the case of royalties which are subject to annual assessment the tax is limited to 10 percent of the gross payment.

3\. Paragraph 3 defines "royalties" for the purposes of the Article. The term includes lump sum payments and certain rents. However, variable or fixed payments for the working of mineral deposits or other natural resources do not fall within the defined term as they are governed by Article 6. Although all royalties and know-how payments (whether lump sum or not) are covered the following should be noted:

*   Payments of any kind received as a consideration for the use of or the right to use industrial, commercial or scientific **equipment** are royalties as defined. However, due to paragraph (b) of the Protocol such payments are treated as royalties only if they are "based on or related to, production, sales, performance, or any other similar basis". Where this is not the case, the payment is deemed to be profits of an enterprise to which the provisions of Article 7 apply.
*   Likewise payments for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific **experience** come within the definition of royalties. However, paragraph (c) of the Protocol negates the application of Article 12 if the payments received are for technical, consultant or supervisory **services**. In such cases the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14 apply.
*   If a payment is made in the form of rent rather than on a royalty basis and the payment comes within the term "royalties" then the 10 percent maximum rate on gross applies. However, rental payments do not constitute royalties under our domestic law and there is, therefore, no non-resident withholding tax applicable. Payments of this nature will be subject to an annual assessment on the net amount after expenses and if the tax so levied exceeds 10 percent of the gross rental, a rebate will be given by virtue of the convention to bring the tax down to 10 percent of gross.

4\. Paragraph 4: The comments relating to paragraph 4 of the Dividend Article apply equally here, except that New Zealand's domestic law in relation to royalties provides for a withholding tax rate of 15 percent final on cultural royalties or where the aggregate annual royalty payment does not exceed $1,000, and minimum final in all other cases.

5\. Paragraphs 5 and 6: The comments on paragraphs 5 and 6 respectively of the Interest Article apply equally here.

### Article 13 - Income from Alienation of Property

1\. Paragraph 1 concerns income or gains derived from the alienation of **real** property. Income from such alienation may be taxed in the State where the property is situated. For example, if a resident of Belgium sells at a profit a real property situated in New Zealand the profit can be taxed in New Zealand if the New Zealand domestic law permits that taxation.

2\. Paragraph 2 deals with income or gains derived from the alienation of **personal** property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment or pertaining to a fixed base used for the performing of independent personal services. This may be taxed in the State where the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.

3\. Paragraph 3 provides that income or gains from the alienation of ships or aircraft operated in international traffic are taxable only in the State where the effective management of the enterprise is situated.

4\. Paragraph 4 stipulates that any income or gains from any property not covered by the Article is to be taxable only in the State which the alienator is a resident.

### Article 14 - Independent Personal Services

1\. This Article concerns income from professional services (ie, independent personal services) as distinct from income from dependent personal services (eg, remuneration such as salary or wages) which is dealt with separately under Article 15. Income from independent personal services is to be treated in much the same way as "business profits", that is, taxable only in the country of residence unless:

*   the taxpayer is present in the other State for a period or periods exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in the income year concerned for the purpose of performing his activities, **or**
*   the services are attributable to a fixed base regularly available to the taxpayer in the other State.

The term "fixed base" is intended to cover a centre of activity of a fixed or permanent character, for instance, a doctor's consulting room or the office of an architect or lawyer.

2\. The Article does not apply to artistes and athletes who are dealt with under Article 17.

### Article 15 - Dependent Personal Services

1\. Paragraph 1 states the general rule that personal services performed by a resident of one of the Contracting States may be taxed in the other Contracting State only if the services are performed in the other Contracting State.

2\. Paragraph 2 states the case where exemption will be given by the State visited. The main requirements are that:

*   the visit does not exceed 183 days in the aggregate in the income year, or in the taxable period, as the case may be;
*   the remuneration is paid by an employer not resident in that State;
*   the remuneration is not borne by a permanent establishment or fixed base which the employer has in that State.

Initially New Zealand PAYE tax will be required to be deducted from the remuneration paid but will be refunded at the time of departure provided the requirements of the Article are fully met. In this respect a certificate must be obtained, by the person seeking exemption, from the Belgian tax authorities which certifies that that person is a resident of Belgium for the purposes of Belgian tax.

3\. Paragraph 3 provides that remuneration derived from employment aboard a ship or aircraft operating in international traffic may be taxed in the State in which the place of effective management of the shipping or airline enterprise is situated.

This means that if the place of effective management of the enterprise is in Belgium then Belgium has the right to tax the remuneration derived by the employee.

New Zealand would allow credit for any Belgian tax on such remuneration if derived by a New Zealand resident.

### Article 16 - Directors' Fees and Other Remuneration

This Article allows the State in which the company paying the fees or other similar payments is resident to have the first right to tax such income. Where a member of the board of directors of a company also has other functions with the company, eg, as ordinary employee, adviser, consultant, etc, the provisions of Article 15 apply as if the remuneration were remuneration of an employee in respect of an employment.

### Article 17 - Artistes and Athletes

1\. Paragraph 1 enables the State in which the entertainer or athlete is performing the services to tax the income derived from these personal activities.

2\. Paragraph 2 deals with the situation where income for the performance of an entertainer or athlete is not paid in full to the entertainer or athlete himself but to another person. The paragraph permits the State in which the performance is given to impose a tax on the profits diverted from the income of the entertainer or athlete to the enterprise where for instance the entertainer or athlete has control over or rights to the income thus diverted or has obtained or will obtain some benefit directly or indirectly from that income. Without this paragraph the State where the services are being performed would in such cases, be unable to tax:

*   because it would not be personal service income to the entertainer, and
*   in the absence of a permanent establishment the payments could not be taxed as business profits in the hands of the other person.

### Article 18 - Pensions

This Article gives the State of **residence** exclusive rights to tax pensions where they are paid in consideration of past employment. However, this rule is subject to Article 192. wherein Government pensions paid in respect of services rendered need to be paid to an individual who is both a resident **and** a national of the other State for the exclusive rights of the State of residence to apply. (See definition of "national" in Article 3.) This means that a Belgian Government pension paid to a resident of New Zealand may only be taxed in Belgium if the individual is not also a national of New Zealand.

### Article 19 - Government Service

1\. This Article deals with remuneration paid to an individual in respect of services rendered to a State or political subdivision or local authority.

2\. Paragraph 1 provides for two situations:

*   Remuneration paid by a State in respect of services rendered to it by an individual shall be taxed only in that State.
*   However, such remuneration shall be taxed exclusively in the other State if the services are rendered in that State by an individual who is a resident of that State, **and** who is also a national of that State or did not become a resident of that State solely for the purposes of rendering those services.

The situation in (b) can be illustrated as follows.

Remuneration paid by the Belgian Government for services rendered in New Zealand by an individual who is a resident and national of New Zealand shall be taxed exclusively in New Zealand. This is still the position even though the individual, although a national of New Zealand, did become a resident of New Zealand for the purposes of rendering those services for the Belgian Government.

3\. Paragraph 2 deals with Government pensions. (See explanation to Article 18 in this supplement.)

4\. Paragraphs 1 and 2 do not apply if the services are performed in connection with business carried on by the State, or one of its political subdivisions or local authorities, paying the remuneration. Under paragraph 3 the ordinary rules apply: Article 15 for wages and salaries, Article 16 for directors' fees and Article 18 for pensions.

### Article 20 - Professors and Teachers

Under this Article a Belgian teacher or professor is exempt from New Zealand tax on his income from carrying out teaching in New Zealand if:

*   he visits New Zealand for not more than two years;
*   he is a resident of Belgium;
*   his visit is solely for the purpose of teaching.

The same rules apply conversely to a resident of New Zealand visiting Belgium for the same purpose.

### Article 21 - Students

This Article exempts from New Zealand tax, maintenance, education or training payments received here from overseas by a student or business apprentice from Belgium. Note:

*   The student or apprentice must have been a resident of Belgium immediately before he comes to New Zealand.
*   He must be in New Zealand **solely** for the purpose of his education training.
*   The payments must be made from sources outside New Zealand.
*   There is no time limit on the period spent in New Zealand.

\* The exemption is restricted to the payments mentioned, ie, for maintenance.

The converse applies to a New Zealand student or apprentice going to Belgium.

### Article 22 - Other Income

1\. This Article provides a general rule relating to income not dealt with in the other Articles of the Convention. The income concerned is not only income of a class not expressly dealt with but also income from sources not expressly mentioned. A secondary effect of the Article is to clarify the situation of income derived from a third country by a person who could be "resident in" both Belgium and New Zealand under the general laws of each country. Under the agreement that person can be a "resident of" only one country. In such a situation the taxing rights are allocated to the country "of" which he is a resident.

2\. Income derived by a resident of New Zealand is taxed exclusively in New Zealand unless the income is derived from sources in Belgium. If the income is derived from sources in Belgium it may also be taxed there and a credit for the Belgian tax is given in New Zealand, should that income be liable for New Zealand tax. The converse will apply in the case of a resident of Belgium. Cases of conflict between two residences are to be determined by reference to Article 4.

### Article 23 - Elimination of Double Taxation

This Article contains the normal rules whereby each State gives credit for the other State's tax when assessing its residents on income derived from sources in the other State. It should be noted that the credit provisions in the Article are subject to the domestic law of each country.

### Article 24 - Mutual Agreement Procedure

### Article 25 - Exchange of Information

These are standard articles and require no additional comment.

### Article 26 - Diplomatic and Consular Privileges

1\. The aim of this Article is to ensure that diplomatic agents or consular officers shall, under the Convention receive no less favourable treatment than that to which they are entitled under international law or under special international agreements.

2\. Paragraph 2 establishes that the sending State is to be the State of residence for members of diplomatic or consular missions provided they are regarded as residents under the domestic law of that State.

3\. Paragraph 3 ensures that international organisations, organs or officials thereof, or members of a diplomatic mission of a third State, who are liable in one of the Contracting States in respect only of income from sources therein shall not have the benefit of the Convention.

### Article 27 - Territorial Extension

This is a standard article and requires no further comment.

### Article 28 - Entry into Force

This Article provides that the Convention will take effect:

(a) In New Zealand:

in respect of income assessable for any income year beginning on or after 1 April 1984;

(b) in Belgium:

*   in respect of all taxes due at source, on income credited or payable on or after 1 January 1984;
*   in respect of all taxes other than taxes due at source, on income of taxable periods ending on or after 31 December 1984.

### Article 29 - Termination

This Article sets out the procedure if either State wishes to terminate the Convention. Unless notice of termination is given in accordance with the Article the Convention continues indefinitely.

### Protocol

The protocol deals with those items where some further explanation is required of points not covered in the Article concerned. The main points are explained earlier in this supplement on an Article by Article basis.

Double Taxation Convention With Norway
--------------------------------------

Part I - Introduction
---------------------

The text of the convention has been published as a schedule to an Order-in-Council (SR 1983/46) which was recently distributed to district offices. It is available to the public from Government Bookshops.

The convention entered into force on 31 March 1983 with effect in New Zealand from any income year beginning on or after 1 April 1982. In Norway it takes effect from the income year beginning on 1 January 1982.

Part II - Notes on the Convention Article by Article
----------------------------------------------------

### Article 1 - Personal Scope

The convention applies to persons who are **residents** of one or both of the Contracting States. In this context the term "persons" includes a company.

### Article 2 - Taxes Covered

The convention covers the following taxes imposed by the Kingdom of Norway:

1\. The national tax on income (inntektsskatt til staten);

2\. The county municipal tax on income (inntektsskatt til fylkeskommunen);

3\. The municipal tax on income (inntektsskatt til kommunen);

4\. The national contributions to the Tax Equalisation Fund (fellesskatt til Skattefordelingsfondet);

5\. The national tax on capital (formuesskatt til staten);

6\. The municipal tax on capital (formuesskatt til kommunen);

7\. The national tax relating to income and capital from the exploration for and the exploitation of submarine petroleum resources and activities and work relating thereto, including pipeline transport of petroleum produced (skatt til staten vedrorende inntekt og formue i forbindelse med undersøkelse etter og utnyttelse av undersjøiske petroleums-forekomster og dertil knyttet virksomhet og arbeid, herunder rørledningstransport av utvunnet petroleum);

8\. The national dues on remuneration to non-resident artistes (avgift til staten av honorarer som tilfaller kunstnere bosatt i utlandet);

9\. The seamen's tax (sjømannsskatt).

With regard to New Zealand the convention covers income tax and excess retention tax but not bonus issue tax which is excluded in paragraph 3.

### Article 3 - General Definition

1\. **"National": Paragraph 1(f)**

The term "national" is used in paragraph 2(c) and 2(d) of Article 4 in determining residence status. It is also used in Article 19 Government Service.

In New Zealand the term covers any individual who is a New Zealand citizen.

In Norway the term covers any individual who is a Norwegian citizen.

2\. Undefined Terms: Paragraph 4

This is a standard provision. Where a term is not defined it has the meaning applicable under the domestic law of the country applying the convention.

### Article 4 - Resident

1\. Paragraph 1 defines the meaning of the term "resident of a contracting state" (ie, for the purposes of Article 1). In effect the defined term is a reference to the domestic law of each country. Whenever the term is used in the convention, the residence of the taxpayer must first be determined in accordance with this Article.

2\. Paragraph 2 sets out the tests to be applied to solve the problem of a dual resident individual. Dual residence arises when a taxpayer is resident in both countries by virtue of the domestic law of each country. The paragraph gives preference to the country in which the individual has a permanent home available to him. This criterion will frequently be sufficient to resolve the conflict, eg, where the individual has a permanent home in one country and has only stayed a certain length of time in the other country. See also paragraph 4. below.

3\. Paragraph 3 sets out the rule to determine the case of a company or other legal person which is resident in both countries. Residence will be where the place of effective management of the enterprise is situated. In this respect New Zealand views the term "effective management" as meaning the practical day to day management, irrespective of where the overriding control is exercised.

4\. In applying the tests to dual residents it should be remembered that these tests apply only for the purposes of the tax convention. If the person **resident in New Zealand** (domestic law test) becomes for the purposes of the convention a "Resident of Norway" after the tests have been applied, this does **not** mean that he is a non-resident for all purposes of New Zealand tax law. For example he can never be subject to non-resident withholding tax, the reason being that although he is treated as a non-resident for certain purposes of the convention, he is still a resident under the New Zealand Income Tax Act. What it does mean is that he is entitled to any benefits granted by the convention to a "Resident of Norway". Thus, although not subject to withholding tax on, for example, New Zealand royalty income, he would still qualify for the 10 percent limitation in the convention in respect of tax imposed under an annual assessment.

### Article 5 - Permanent Establishment

This Article defines the term "permanent establishment". This concept determines the right of a contracting state to tax the profits of an "enterprise of the other contracting state". Due to the inclusion of the words "includes especially" in paragraph 2, the examples cited as constituting a permanent establishment are by no means exhaustive.

The definition of "permanent establishment" is fairly standard and the following points should be noted:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Paragraph 3 | A building site or construction or installation project constitutes a permanent establishment if it lasts for more than 6 months. |
| Paragraph 5(a) | An enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment if it carries on supervisory activities for more than 6 months in connection with a building site or construction or installation project. |
| Paragraph 5(b) | An enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment if it carries on for more than 6 months land based activities which are directly related to the exploration or exploitation of the sea-bed and subsoil and their natural resources. In this context "land based activities" are akin to "offshore activities" covered by Article 22. |

### Article 6 - Income from Immovable Property

This Article recognises the internationally accepted practice in relation to income from land and the exploitation of land or landed property. The Article also applies to such items as rents, natural resource royalties, farming profits, etc.

The principle of the Article is that income from "immovable property" may be taxed in the country where the property is situated. "Immovable property" is not defined in our general law but the Article provides extensive definition. Ships and aircraft are specifically excluded from the term "immovable property".

The Article involves no change in current practice in relation to the income covered.

### Article 7 - Business Profits

This Article is in many respects a continuation of, and a corollary to, Article 5 on the definition of the concept of permanent establishment. Under Article 7 a Contracting State cannot tax the profits of an enterprise of the other Contracting State unless it carries on its business through a permanent establishment situated therein. If a permanent establishment exists the Article goes on to lay down a set of rules by reference to which are to be calculated the profits of the permanent establishment.

Before dealing with the salient features of the Article some comment is warranted on the importance of paragraph 7. This is because reference to this Article and Article 5 will not always be necessary to determine the liability of specific types of income. In effect paragraph 7 gives first preference to the other Articles in the convention. It follows that this Article will only be applicable to business profits which do not belong to the categories of income covered by the special Articles, and, in addition, to dividends, royalties and interest which **specifically** come within the **circumstances** detailed in paragraphs 4 of Articles 10 and 12, paragraph 5 of Article 11 and paragraph 2 of Article 21, and consequently fall within Article 7.

1\. Paragraph 1 expresses the general rule that profits are taxable only in the country of residence unless the enterprise is engaged in business in the other country through a permanent establishment, in which case the other country may tax the profits of the permanent establishment.

It is important to note that only income attributable **directly** to the permanent establishment's operations can form part of the establishment's operations. This does not mean that income which is not directly attributable to the establishment's operations escapes liability for tax (see second paragraph above). For example, the restriction on the rate of tax imposed by paragraph 2 of Articles 10, 11 and 12, which concern dividend, interest and royalty payments respectively, would still apply if such income did not arise from the permanent establishment's operations.

2\. Paragraph 2 contains the normal provision enabling arm's-length profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment if necessary.

3\. Paragraph 3 merely expresses the taxpayer's right to deduct from the profits of the permanent establishment the expenses incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment even if those expenses are incurred outside the country where the permanent establishment is situated.

4\. Paragraph 4 provides that where the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment are determined, not on the basis of separate accounts or by making an estimate of arm's-length profit, but simply by apportioning the total profits of the enterprise by reference to various formulae then such a method may continue to be employed provided it has been customary to adopt such a practice. Such a method differs from those envisaged in' paragraph 2 of Article 7, since it contemplates not an attribution of profits on a separate enterprise footing, but an apportionment of total profits. However, in general the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment should be determined by reference to the establishment's accounts if these reflect the real facts. A method of allocation which is based on apportioning total profits is generally not as appropriate as a method which has regard only to the activities of the permanent establishment and should be used only where it has as a matter of history been customary in the past and is accepted by the Department and taxpayer as being satisfactory.

5\. Paragraph 5 precludes the attribution of profits to a permanent establishment by reason of merely purchasing activities carried on by the permanent establishment for the enterprise.

6\. Paragraph 6 provides that unless there are good and sufficient reasons to the contrary the profits attributed to a permanent establishment must be determined by the same method each year.

7\. Paragraph 7: Refer second paragraph above in the explanation to this Article.

8\. In terms of paragraph (a) of the Protocol income from the business of any form of insurance is not subject to the provisions of this Article. Such income may be taxed in accordance with the domestic law of each country.

### Article 8 - Shipping and Air Transport

1\. Under this Article profits from operating ships or aircraft in "international traffic" - defined in Article 31. (g) are to be taxed only in the country of residence of the enterprise. International shipping and aircraft profits include income from:

*   carriage of passengers and cargo;
*   sale of passenger tickets on behalf of other enterprises;
*   commercial advertising;
*   charter fees (but refer paragraph 3. below).

2\. Due to the definition of "international traffic" exemption does not extend to profits derived from coastal traffic. Further, investment income of shipping and air transport enterprises is subject to the treatment ordinarily applied to that class of income, eg, dividends derived would be subject to Article 10.

3\. Profits obtained from leasing a ship or aircraft on charter fully equipped, manned and supplied, whether or not the enterprise providing the ship or aircraft actually owns them, would be treated as profits from the operation of a ship or aircraft. However, the Article does not extend to profits from leasing a ship or aircraft on a bare boat charter basis **except** when it is an occasional source of income for an enterprise engaged in the international operation of ships or aircraft. Apart from this one exception, bare boat charter fees would normally be classified as business profits and consequently dealt with under Article 7.

### Article 9 - Associated Enterprises

This is a standard Article enabling an arm's-length profit to be attributed to associated enterprises.

### Article 10 - Dividends

1\. Paragraph 1 of the Article simply states that dividends may be taxed in the State of the recipient's residence.

2\. Paragraph 2 provides that the Contracting State from which the dividends are paid also has the right to tax, but the maximum tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 15 percent of the gross amount of the dividends. Therefore, in terms of the convention New Zealand's taxing rights will be restricted to 15 percent of the gross dividend even though the rate under domestic law is 30 percent from 1 April 1982. The Norwegian tax is reduced from a 25 percent domestic rate to 15 percent. In the case of New Zealand the limitation is to be achieved by withholding tax of 15 percent being deducted by companies paying the dividends to residents of Norway.

3\. Paragraph 3 defines "dividends" for the purposes of the Article. The effect is that "dividends" has the meaning given to it by section 4 of the Income Tax Act 1976.

4\. Paragraph 4 concerns shares which are effectively connected with a permanent establishment. The paragraph provides that in the State of source the dividends are taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment there owned by the recipient which is a resident of the other State, **provided** they are paid in respect of holdings forming part of the assets of the permanent establishment or otherwise effectively connected with that establishment. In effect this relieves the State of source of the dividends from the 15 percent limitation under the Article.

The rules set out above also apply where the recipient of the dividends has in the other State, for the purpose of performing any of the kinds of independent personal services mentioned in Article 14, a fixed base with which the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected.

Up to 1 April 1982 these qualifications had no effect on the New Zealand tax position because our domestic law provided for a 15 percent final withholding tax in all cases on the gross payment and no convention can extend the taxing rights under domestic law. However, in view of the change in the New Zealand domestic law from 1 April 1982 the New Zealand tax on dividends paid in respect of shares effectively connected with a permanent establishment will be 30 percent.

5\. Paragraph 5: The main effect of this paragraph is that it restricts the application of taxes on undistributed profits. For example, New Zealand cannot impose excess retention tax on a privately controlled company which is a "resident of Norway".

### Article 11 - Interest

1\. Paragraph 1 affirms the taxing right of the State in which the recipient of the interest is a resident.

2\. Paragraph 2 also affirms the taxing right of the State in which the interest arises, but the maximum tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 10 percent of the gross amount of the interest. New Zealand's tax is therefore limited to 10 percent on gross interest paid to residents of Norway instead of the usual 15 percent.

3\. Paragraph 3 exempts from tax interest if it is paid:

*   **to** the Government or local authority of a Contracting State, or
*   **to** the Government or local authority of the other State or to any agency or instrumentality (including a financial institution) wholly owned by the other State or local authority thereof.

4\. Paragraph 4 defines "interest" for the purposes of the Article. Penalty charges are excluded from the term as is income which would, because of a State's domestic law, be classified as a dividend. Therefore, in New Zealand, for example, interest received by debenture holders under debentures to which section 192 or 195 of the Income Tax Act 1976 applies would be dealt with under the Dividends Article.

5\. Paragraph 5 provides that in the State of source interest is taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment there owned by a resident of the other State, **provided** the interest is paid in respect of debt-claims forming part of the assets of the permanent establishment or otherwise effectively connected with that establishment. In effect this paragraph relieves the State of source of the interest from any limitation under the Article.

The rules set out above also apply where the recipient of the interest has in the other State, for the purpose of performing any of the kinds of independent personal services mentioned in Article 14, a fixed base with which the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected.

These qualifications tie in with the New Zealand domestic law which provides that if a non-resident has a fixed establishment in New Zealand, then interest derived is not subject to non-resident withholding tax but is to be assessed on an annual basis.

6\. Paragraph 6 is a source rule and precludes argument as to the source of the interest.

The paragraph deals with interest arising through a permanent establishment or fixed base. Where a loan was contracted for the requirements of that establishment and the interest is borne by the latter, the paragraph determines that the source of the interest is in the Contracting State in which the permanent establishment is situated, leaving aside the place of residence of the owner of that establishment or base.

7\. Paragraph 7 is an anti-avoidance provision to ensure that only a reasonable interest payment is taxed at the reduced rate specified in the convention.

### Article 12 - Royalties

1\. Paragraph 1 affirms the taxing right of the State in which the recipient of the royalties is a resident.

2\. Paragraph 2 also affirms the taxing right of the State in which the royalty arises, but the maximum tax that can be imposed is not to exceed 10 percent of the gross amount of the royalty. New Zealand's tax is therefore limited to 10 percent on gross royalties paid to residents of Norway instead of the usual 15 percent. The limitation is to be achieved by withholding tax of 10 percent being deducted by the payer at the time of payment of the royalties. In the case of royalties which are subject to annual assessment the tax assessed is not to exceed 10 percent of the gross payment.

3\. Paragraph 3 defines "royalties" for the purposes of the Article. The term includes lump sum payments and certain rents. However, variable or fixed payments for the working of mineral deposits or other natural resources do not fall within the defined term as they are governed by Article 6.

It should be noted that if a payment is made in the form of rent rather than on a royalty basis and the payment comes within the term "royalties" then the 10 percent maximum rate on gross applies. However, rental payments do not constitute royalties under our domestic law and there is, therefore, no non-resident withholding tax applicable. Payments of this nature will be subject to an annual assessment on the net amount after expenses and, if the tax so levied exceeds 10 percent of the gross rental, a rebate will be given by virtue of the convention to bring the tax down to 10 percent of gross.

4\. Paragraph 4 provides that in the State of source royalties are taxable as part of the profits of the permanent establishment there owned by the recipient which is a resident of the other State, **provided** the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with that establishment. In effect this relieves the State of source of the royalties from the 10 percent limitation under the Article.

The rules set out above also apply where the recipient of the royalties has in the other State, for the purpose of performing any of the kinds of professional services mentioned in Article 14, a fixed base with which the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected.

The comments to paragraph 4 of the Dividends Article apply equally here except that New Zealand's domestic law in relation to royalties provides for a withholding tax rate of 15 percent final on copyright (cultural) royalties or where the aggregate annual royalty payments do not exceed $1,000, and minimum final in all other cases.

5\. Paragraphs 5 and 6: The comments to paragraphs 6 and 7 respectively of the Interest Article apply equally here.

### Article 13 - Alienation of Property

1\. Paragraph 1 concerns income or gains derived from the alienation of **immovable** property. Income from such alienation may be taxed in the State where the property is situated. For example if a resident of Norway sells at a profit immovable property situated in New Zealand the profit can be taxed in New Zealand if the New Zealand domestic law permits that taxation.

2\. Paragraph 2 deals with income or gains derived from the alienation of **personal** property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment or pertaining to a fixed base used for the performing of independent personal services. This may be taxed in the State where the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated.

3\. Paragraph 3 provides that income or gains from the alienation of ships or aircraft operated in international traffic are taxable only in the State of residence of the enterprise.

4\. Paragraph 4 stipulates that any income or gains from any property not covered by the Articles is to be taxable only in the State of which the alienator is a resident.

5\. Paragraph 5 contains a provision for Norway to tax capital gains derived by a resident of New Zealand from the alienation of shares in a company resident of Norway. This is a measure against tax avoidance inserted at the request of Norway.

### Article 14 - Independent Personal Services

1\. This Article concerns income from professional personal services (ie, independent personal services) as distinct from income from dependent personal services (eg, remuneration such as salary or wages) which is dealt with separately under Article 15. Under paragraph 1 income from independent personal services is taxable only in the State of residence **unless** the services are performed in the other State and the recipient of the income:

*   has a fixed base regularly available to him in the other State for the purpose of performing his activities, or
*   is present in the other State for a period or periods in any fiscal year (income year) which together with a period or periods in the preceding or succeeding fiscal year (income year) **exceed** in the aggregate 183 days.

If either of the above exceptions applies the State in which the services are performed also has the right to tax the income therefrom.

Under the paragraph any remuneration which is not taxed in the State in which the recipient is a resident may be taxed in the State where the services are performed.

The term "fixed base" is intended to cover a centre of activity of a fixed or permanent character, for instance, a doctor's consulting room or the office of an architect or lawyer.

2\. The Article does not apply to artistes or athletes which are dealt with under Article 17.

### Article 15 - Dependent Personal Services

1\. Paragraph 1 states the general rule that personal services performed by a resident of one of the Contracting States may be taxed in that other Contracting State, only if the services are performed in that other Contracting State.

2\. Paragraph 2 states the case where exemption will be given by the State visited. The main requirements are that:

*   the recipient of the income is present in the State visited for a period or periods in any fiscal year (income year) which together with a period or periods in the preceding or succeeding fiscal year (income year) do not exceed **in the aggregate** 183 days; and
*   the remuneration is paid by an employer not resident in that State; and
*   the remuneration is not connected with the activities of a permanent establishment or fixed base which the employer has in that State.

However, any remuneration not taxed in the State where the recipient is a resident may be taxed in the State where the services are performed.

Initially New Zealand PAYE tax will be required to be deducted from the remuneration paid but will be refunded at the time of departure provided the requirements of the Article are fully met.

For the purposes of paragraph 1 a certificate must be obtained, by the person seeking exemption, from the Norwegian tax authorities which certifies that that person is a resident of Norway for the purposes of Norwegian tax.

3\. Paragraph 3 provides that remuneration derived from employment aboard a ship or aircraft operating in international traffic may be taxed in the State of residence of the shipping or airline enterprise. This means that if the enterprise is resident of Norway then Norway has the right to tax the remuneration derived by the employee. New Zealand would allow credit for any Norwegian tax on such remuneration if derived by a New Zealand resident.

### Article 16 - Directors' Fees

This Article allows the State in which the company paying the fees or other similar payments is resident to have the right to tax such income. The income may also be taxed in the recipient's country of residence which would therefore have to allow credit for tax paid in the country of source.

### Article 17 - Artistes and Athletes

1\. Paragraph 1 enables the State in which the entertainer or athlete is performing the services to tax the income derived from these personal activities.

2\. Paragraph 2 deals with the situation where income for the performance of an entertainer or athlete is not paid or paid in full to the entertainer or athlete himself but to an enterprise providing the services of the entertainer or athlete. The paragraph permits the State in which the performance is given to impose a tax on the profits diverted from the income of the entertainer or athlete to the enterprise where for instance the entertainer or athlete has control over or rights to the income thus diverted or has obtained or will obtain some benefit directly or indirectly from that income. Without this paragraph the State where the services are being performed would in such cases, be unable to tax:

*   because it would not be personal service income to the entertainer, and
*   in the absence of a permanent establishment the payments could not be taxed as business profits in the hands of the enterprise.

3\. The effect of paragraph 3 is that the State in which the activities are performed will not tax the income therefrom provided the activities are performed within the framework of governmental cultural exchanges between the two States.

### Article 18 - Pensions and Annuities

1\. Paragraph 1 gives the State of residence exclusive right to tax all pensions and annuities (including Government pensions and payments under a Social Security system). The pensions are exempt in the State of source.

2\. Paragraph 2 defines the term "annuities".

3\. Paragraph 3 provides that alimony and maintenance payments are taxable only in the State of source. As such payments are exempt from tax in New Zealand this provision is effective only in Norway.

### Article 19 - Government Service

This Article deals with remuneration paid to an individual in respect of services rendered to a State or political subdivision or local authority thereof.

1\. Paragraph 1 provides for two situations:

*   Remuneration paid by a State in respect of services rendered to it by an individual shall be taxable only in that State, ie, country of origin or source of the payment.
*   However, such remuneration is taxable only in the country where the services are performed provided the services are performed there:
    *   by an individual who is a resident and also a national of that country, or
    *   by an individual who is a resident of that country and did not become a resident of that country solely for the purpose of performing those services.

The second situation can be illustrated as follows:

Remuneration paid by the Norwegian Government for services rendered in New Zealand by an individual who is a resident and national of New Zealand shall be taxed exclusively in New Zealand. This is still the position even though the individual, although a national of New Zealand, did become a resident of New Zealand for the purposes of rendering those services for the Norwegian Government.

2\. Paragraph 1 does not apply if the services are performed in connection with business carried on by the State, or one of its political subdivisions or local authorities, paying the remuneration. Under paragraph 2 the ordinary rules apply: Article 15 for wages and salaries and Article 16 for directors' fees. Article 17 is not mentioned because paragraph 1 of Article 19 is to apply to remuneration paid to artistes employed by the State irrespective of whether such artistes could be said to be rendering services in connection with business carried on by the State.

### Article 20 - Students

This Article exempts from New Zealand tax maintenance, education or training payments received here from overseas by a student or business apprentice from Norway. Note:

*   The student or apprentice must have been a resident of Norway immediately before he comes to New Zealand.
*   He must be in New Zealand solely for the purpose of his education or training.
*   The payments must be made from sources outside New Zealand.
*   There is no time limit on the period spent in New Zealand.
*   The exemption is restricted to the payments mentioned, ie, for maintenance.

The converse applies to a New Zealand student or apprentice going to Norway.

### Article 21 - Other Income

This Article provides a general rule relating to income not dealt with in the other Articles of the convention. The income concerned is not only income of a class not expressly dealt with but also income from sources not expressly mentioned. A secondary effect of the Article is to clarify the situation of income derived from a third country by a person who could be "resident in" both Norway and New Zealand under the general laws of each country. Under the convention that person can be a "resident of" only one country. In such a situation the taxing rights are allocated to the country "of" which he is a resident.

1\. The effect of paragraph 1 is that income derived by a resident of New Zealand is taxed exclusively in New Zealand unless the income is derived from sources in Norway. If the income is derived from sources in Norway it may also be taxed there and a credit for the Norwegian tax is given in New Zealand, should that income be liable for New Zealand tax. The converse will apply in the case of a resident of Norway. Cases of conflict between two residences are to be determined by reference to Article 4.

2\. Paragraph 2 provides for an exception from the provisions of paragraph 1 where the income is effectively connected with the activity of a permanent establishment or fixed base which a resident of a State has in the other State. The effect is that the right to tax is given to the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated. However, such income must be taxed having regard to the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14.

3\. In terms of paragraph (a) of the Protocol income from the business of any form of insurance is not subject to the provisions of this Article. Such income may be taxed in accordance with the domestic law of each country.

### Article 22 - Offshore Activity

This is a new Article which has not been included in any other double taxation convention concluded by New Zealand. The Article affirms the taxing rights of each State in connection with exploration or exploitation activities carried out offshore. The Article is of particular significance to Norway because of the substantial activities of multinational companies associated with North Sea oil. New Zealand is also concerned in view of the activities of overseas residents associated with oil exploration and gas fields off the New Zealand coast.

1\. Under paragraph 1, a resident of a Contracting State is deemed to be carrying on a business through a permanent establishment or fixed base in the other State if he carries on activities offshore in that other State in connection with exploration and exploitation of the sea-bed and subsoil and their natural resources. The effect of paragraph 1 is that income or profits of a Norwegian enterprise engaged in such activities in New Zealand may be taxed in New Zealand and the Norwegians would have to allow credit for any New Zealand tax paid.

2\. Under paragraph 2 a permanent establishment or fixed base can only exist where the activities are carried on for a period exceeding 30 days in aggregate in **any** 12 months period. For the purposes of this paragraph and of paragraph 3 the period of activities of associated enterprises are to be aggregated provided their activities are of substantially the same character.

3\. Paragraph 3 is concerned with offshore transport activities. A permanent establishment is deemed to exist in respect of activities continued for more than 90 days in the aggregate in **any** 12 months period under the following circumstances:

*   transportation of supplies or personnel to a location where activities in connection with the exploration or exploitation of the sea-bed and subsoil and their natural resources are being carried on in a Contracting State, or
*   operation of tugboats and similar vessels in connection with such activities.

4\. Paragraph 4 deals with income from employment connected with offshore activities. Subparagraph 4(a) provides that salaries, wages and other similar remuneration are taxable **only** in the State where the activities are performed provided the employment offshore is carried on for a period exceeding 30 days in aggregate in **any** 12 month period. However, under subparagraph 4(b) any such employment which is exercised aboard a ship or aircraft or tugboat or similar vessel is taxable solely in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 15. In this respect a point to note is that paragraph 3 of Article 15 does not apply as the transport operation is not in "international traffic".

If after applying paragraph 2 of Article 15 the income derived by a Norwegian resident from employment in offshore transport activities in New Zealand is subject to New Zealand tax the Norwegians would have to allow their resident credit for any New Zealand tax paid.

### Article 23 - Capital

This Article provides that capital represented by certain assets owned by a resident of New Zealand and situated in Norway **may** be taxed in Norway. As there is no capital tax in New Zealand this Article will operate only in Norway so there can be no credit allowed in New Zealand for any capital tax payable in Norway.

The capital which **may be taxed** in Norway under this Article is represented by:

*   immovable property, as referred to in Article 6, situated in Norway and owned by a resident of New Zealand,
*   personal property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment which a resident of New Zealand has in Norway and personal property pertaining to a fixed base in Norway available to a resident of New Zealand for performing independent personal services.

Capital represented by ships and aircraft operated in international traffic and by personal property pertaining to the operation of such ships and aircraft shall be **taxable only** in Norway provided the enterprise is resident of Norway. All other elements of capital owned by a resident of New Zealand are not liable to Norwegian tax.

The Article was included to give New Zealand residents the benefit of the convention. This means that the Norwegians are prepared to forgo subjecting New Zealand residents to certain taxes in Norway by virtue of the inclusion of the Article.

### Article 24 - Methods of Elimination of Double Taxation

1\. This Article contains the normal rules whereby each State gives credit for the other State's tax when assessing its residents on income derived from sources in the other State. It should be noted that the credit provisions in the Article are subject to the domestic law of each country. Under Norwegian domestic law overseas income is normally exempted from Norwegian tax unless it is exempt in the country of origin. However, it is Norwegian practice to provide for a credit rather than an exemption in certain cases under a tax convention. Therefore, Norway will be allowing a credit in the following cases:

*   Dividends subject to 15 percent New Zealand tax in accordance with Article 10.
*   Interest subject to 10 percent New Zealand tax in accordance with Article 11.
*   Royalties on which New Zealand tax is limited to 10 percent in accordance with Article 12.
*   Other income taxable in New Zealand in accordance with Article 21.
*   Income from offshore activities subject to New Zealand tax under Article 22.

2\. Paragraph 1(b) is a source rule for the purposes of the Article to facilitate the allowance of a tax credit to New Zealand residents in respect of source taxing rights allocated to Norway under the provisions of the convention.

### Article 25 - Mutual Agreement Procedure

### Article 26 - Exchange of Information

These are standard Articles and require no additional comment.

### Article 27 - Diplomatic and Consular Officers

The aim of this Article is to ensure that diplomatic agents or consular officers shall, under the convention, receive no less favourable treatment than that to which they are entitled under international law or under special international agreements.

### Article 28 - Territorial Extension

This is a standard Article and requires no additional comment.

### Article 29 - Entry Into Force

This Article provides that the convention will generally take effect in New Zealand in respect of income assessable for the income year beginning on 1 April 1982 and in Norway in respect of taxes on income or on capital relating to the income year beginning on 1 January 1982 and subsequent years.

### Article 30 - Termination

This Article sets out the procedure if either State wishes to terminate the convention. Unless notice of termination is given in accordance with the Article the convention continues indefinitely.

### Protocol

The Protocol, which forms an integral part of the convention, contains additional provisions in relation to certain Articles of the convention.

1\. Paragraph (a) provides that income from the business of any form of insurance is not subject to the provisions of Articles 7 and 21. Such income may be taxed in accordance with the domestic law of each country.

2\. Paragraph (b) provides for a review of the maximum rate of tax at source on dividends, interest and royalties, under Articles 10, 11 and 12 respectively of the convention, should New Zealand agree to a lower rate in a subsequent convention with any other OECD member country.

3\. Paragraph (c) provides Norway with an alternative method of elimination of double taxation under Article 24 should Norway's domestic law be amended in future to allow relief by the credit method in all cases.

4\. Paragraph (d) refers to the possible inclusion of a non-discrimination article should New Zealand include such an article in a convention with any other country.
