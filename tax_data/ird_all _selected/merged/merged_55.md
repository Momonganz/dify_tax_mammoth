Bad debt deductions for holders of debt Regulatory Impact Statement Taxation of foreign superannuation Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. The problem addressed in this statement is whether the current tax treatment of interests in, and income from, foreign superannuation schemes is appropriate and, if not, how it should be changed. Key issues were the complexity of the current rules for taxing foreign superannuation held by New Zealand residents, and a lack of clarity on whether the rules resulted in a fair outcome, particularly for lump sum transfers and withdrawals. The complexity arises from the fact that a number of different regimes may apply in taxing interests in foreign superannuation schemes. This has resulted in significant levels of non-compliance, which has been estimated to be approximately 70o/o. The issues were first raised by tax practitioners in 2006, and were included in the Government's tax policy work prograÍrme in 2011. The policy review focused on the application of the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules to foreign superannuation, and taxing lump sums received from foreign schemes, including both transfers and withdrawals. As there were no concerns about the current tax treatment of pensions, no changes to pensions are proposed, except insofar as those interests are currently taxed under the FIF rules. The preferred option for reform will replace a number of different regimes (as they apply to foreign superannuation), simplifyrtrg the applicable tax rules and improving clarity. It also aims to maintain equity and consistency of tax treatment. It is expected that compliance costs for individuals will be reduced. The option proposed involves legislating for two calculation methods for lump sums, in order to determine the amount of foreign superannuation which is assessable income. The calculation methods rely on several key assumptions. Lr particular, the interest rate and the growth rate in the foreign scheme have been calibrated at 5o/o. Although some submitters in the consultation process were concerned that the 5o/o rate was too high and may result in over-taxation, we note that since we are providing an altemative method for taxing actual gains, the 5Yo will effectively act as a cap where actual gains are higher. This is similar to the operation of the fair dividend rate and comparative value methods in the FIF rules. Significant consultation was undertaken during the policy development process. Offrcials met with practitioners from several large accounting firms and the financial services industry, and with pension transfer agents. An issues paper released in July 2012 drew 59 external submissions. Key changes arising from the consultations included: deferring the application date from I April 20ll to I April 2014 as submitters were generally opposed to retrospective legislation, and providing for an alternative method to tax actual investment gains derived while the taxpayer was New Zealand resident. The fiscal implications of the preferred approach arç \\¡ery difficult to quantifii due to a lack of reliable informatior¡ but have been estimated to be broadly fiscally neutral based on migration trends and data on previous transfers provided by some pension transfer companies. The existing policy to tax foreign superannuation is continued under the new rules, which are designed to rnake the rules easierto comply with, rather than to collect any additional revenue. Other than those set out in this statement, no significant gapso assumptions, dependencies, constraints, caveats and uncertainties have been identified. The a¡nendments do not impose additional costs, impair private property rigþts, reduce market eompetition, provide disincentives to innovate or over-ride coÍìmoû law principles. Joanna Clifford Programme Manager, Poliey Inland Revenue STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. New Zealand tax residents with interests in foreign superannuation schemes are liable for tax on those interests. The current rules for taxing foreign superannuation are complex. Foreign superannuation is taxed either annually under the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules, or at the time the person received the income (for example, as a pension, a lump-sum withdrawal, or a transfer to another scheme). 2. The FIF regime is the default method for taxing interests in foreign superannuation, unless a specific statutory exemption applies to aî individual's circumstances. The exemptions recognise that there can be practical problems with applying the FIF rules to foreign superannuation. In particular, as superannuation is often locked in1 until retirement age, the savings may not be accessible, so the FIF tax liability must be satisfied out of other income. The key exemption relevant to foreign superannuation therefore relates to locked-in emplolrnent-related schemes. Subjective elements can make this exemption difficult to apply. 3. A summary of the tax treatment of New Zealand residents'interests in domestic and foreign superannuation schemes is provided in the table below: 1 A locked-in scheme is one where the provider does not permit withdrawals before retirement age or under certain restricted circumstances, for example, KiwiSaver. 2 For example, the comparative value and fair dividend rate (FDR) methods. The comparative value method taxes the net increase in the value of the investment during the year. The FDR method taxes a deemed retum of 50% of the market value ofthe person's interest. a General treatment of retirement savings tr'oreign retirement savings held by New Zealand residents - tr'IF rules tr'oreign retirement savings held by New Zealand residents - FItr' exemption New Zealand taxes savings on a "taxed-taxed-exempf ' (TTE) basis (on accrual). This means: ¡ contributions are made out of after-tax income, . any gains are taxed at the time they are earned, and . all withdrawals are tax-free. Many foreign countries tax their residents' retirement savings on an "exempt-exempt-taxed" (EET) basis (on receipt). This means: o contributions are made before income tax rs deducted, . any galns are not taxed at the time they are earned, and . aîy withdrawals made from the account are fully taxed. This is default method for taxing foreign superannuation interests held by New Zealand residents: ¡ the individual is required to calculate income or loss in respect of the foreign superamuation interest on an annual basis o there are a number of methods for calculating income under the FIF rules2 o distributions from the scheme are tax-free o this is in line with the treatment of domestic savings: gains are taxed, but withdrawals are tax- free o since many foreign countries tax foreign superannuation on receipt, there may be some effective double taxation as New Zealand does not provide foreign tax credits for tax paid on receipt. When a FIF exemption applies, the foreign superannuation interest is still taxable, but under different rules: the individual does not need to calculate tax in respect ofthis interest on an annual basis withdrawals, transfers and pensions are taxable on receipt the amount of tax to be paid on lump sums depends on factors such as the legal structure of the superaruruation scheme, for example a company or trust it can be diffrcult to identifv the correct tax treatment the ultimate tax liability may be very different from that resulting from the FIF rules. a a a a 4. As illustrated in the table above, the rules for taxing New Zealand residents on their foreign superannuation interests are complex and lack consistency and cohesion. There is particular complexity in respect of lump sums. Tax liability can differ substantially based on whether the FIF rules apply or whether - and how - a distribution is taxed under the dividend or trust tax rules. For example, tax on FIF income is likely to be less than or equal to 1.65% per annum of the market value of the interest, whereas tax on a distribution from a trust may equal fully 30% of the lump sum. This creates inequity between people in similar circumstances. These problems serve to make the status quo unsustainable. 5. Furthermore, the complexity and lack of clarity have led to significant levels of non- compliance, some of which was discovered during compliance activity undertaken by Inland Revenue. Some people were incorrectly advised that an exemption from the FIF rules meant that they were exempt from New Zealand tax altogether. Non-compliance is problematic because these individuals may learn they have significant tax liabilities, after they have spent or invested the money. While the exact amount of non-compliance is diffrcult to quantify due to a lack of reliable information, it has been estimated that the rate of non-compliance for the group to whom these rules apply, is approximately 70o/o, based on the data that Inland Revenue has been able to obtain. This figure includes people who should be accounting for tax under the FIF rules, as well as those transferring lump sums to New Zealarrd. 6. Public concerns with the current tax rules were identified in 2006 in submissions on the Taxation (Annual Rates, Savings Investment, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. Submitters considered that the current rules relating to withdrawals from superannuation schemes should be clarified. Officials acknowledged that the tax implications arising from an exemption from the FIF rules were not clear and recommended that further work be undertaken (subject to other Government tax policy priorities). In November 2011, the Minister of Revenue announced a policy review of the taxation of foreign superannuation. An issues paper was released in July 20123. 7. The status quo is unsustainable as non-compliance would remain prevalent, which would be inconsistent with Inland Revenue's focus on encouraging voluntary compliance. As noted above non-compliance is estimated to be approximately 70o/o. This could also pose a risk to the Government's revenue if the tax is not collected. lnland Revenue would also be obliged to resume compliance (i.e. pre-audit) activity on people who have not paid tax with respect to past transfers. The expected imposition of use-oÊmoney interest and late payment penalties may place individuals in financial diffrculty. 8. The problem addressed in this statement is whether the current tax treatment of interests in - and lump sum receipts from - foreign superannuation schemes is appropriate and, if not, how it should be changed. As taxation is imposed by legislation, only legislative amendments are sufficient to address these concerns. 3 Taxation ofþreign supera.nnuation - an fficials'issues paper 4 OBJECTIVES 9. The objectives are to establish a coherent set of rules for the taxation of foreign superannuation held by New Zealandresidents which have the following characteristics: Equity - to ensure that the tax treatment does not differ significantly based on a person's individual circumstances, such as whether they have foreign or domestic superannuation assets, or whether the income is received as a lump sum or a pension. For example, domestic savings are taxed on accrual and are exempt on withdrawal. a Efficiency - to not discourage people from migrating to New Zealand or from transferring their superannuation here. Simplicity - to make the new rules as simple and compliance-friendly as possible, without the complexity that is prevalent in the current framework. This will help to reduce instances of non-compliance. Certaínty - to enable people to determine their expected New Zealand tax liability in advance of transfer or migration, so that they are able to make informed decisions. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 10. To address the concerns regarding tax rules for foreign superannuation, officials identified the following options: a Option I - extend the accrual regime so that all interests in foreign superannuation schemes are taxed on accrual under the FIF rules. This would require repealing the existing FIF exemptions. Option 2 - tax all foreign superannuation on a receipts basis (i.e. when the income is received), in a manner which approximates tax payable on accrual. This would apply to both lump sums and pensions. a a o Option 3 (preferred) - tax lump-sum withdrawals and transfers as per option two, but retain the current tax treatment for pensionsa. This is, in essence, a hybrid of option two and the existing rules. 1 1. Retaining the status quo was not an option under explicit consideration. The inequity, complexity and lack of cohesion inherent in the current rules make them both undesirable and unsustainable. 12. The preferred approach is option three, which consists of taxing lump-sum withdrawals and transfers under the inclusion approach, and pensions under the current rules. The inclusion approach taxes lump sums on receipt and approximates the tax that would have been paid on accrual. The mechanics of the inclusion approach are discussed in paragraph 17. This is the framework presented in the officials' issues paper but with some modifications, 4 Pensions are taxed on receipt at a person's marginal tax rate. a 5 following the consultation process. Off,rcials consider that this option best addresses the concems with the current law and is consistent with the stated objectives. 13. The new rules will apply to New Zealand residents who hold interests in foreign superannuation schemes. This group is expected to comprise new migrants and returning New Zealanders who have worked or earned income overseas. In addition, the transitional rules will affect people who transferred or withdrew their foreign superannuation in a prior year and did not properly comply with their tax obligations in respect of that amount. Again, the group of people who have transferred or withdrew their foreign superannuation in a prior year are likely to have worked or eamed income overseas. 14. The economic and social implications of the options are outlined in a table on pages 9- 11. There are expected to be some compliance cost savings arising from the preferred option, with few administration costs likely. No environmental or cultural costs are expected to arise. Analysis of options 15. Option one would extend accrual taxation by requiring all interests held by New Zealand residents in foreign superannuation schemes to be taxed under the FIF rules. To ensure this outcome, the FIF exemptions would cease to apply to foreign superannuation and several exemptions would accordingly be repealed. The current FIF methods, as discussed on page three, would continue to apply in the same manner. Any income received from the foreign scheme would not be taxable. 16. The main difference from the status quo is that some foreign superannuation income which is (or should be under the current law), taxable on receipt - pensions in particular - would cease to be and would instead be taxed annually on accrual. Typically, this would alter the amount of tax payable. . As illustrated in the table on page three, the tax treatment of FIF and non-FIF treatment can differ significantly, and determining whether an interest falls under the FIF rules or not can be complex. Option one would remove these problems. 17. Option two would also apply accrual taxation to all foreign superannuation (both lump sums and pensions), but instead of this being payable annually under the FIF rules it would be accumulated and payable only on receipt. An interest factor would be incorporated into the calculations to account for the use-of-money benefit that a person receives by not paying tax annually. The eventual tax liability would, therefore, be a function of the length of time that the person holds the interest (as a New Zealand resident) before the income is received. A longer duration implies a greater deferral benefit. This is termed the "inclusion approach", as a portion of the income - calculated as above - would be included in a person's assessable income and the rest would not be taxable. 18. For this option, there are two main differences from the status quo. First, all foreign superannuation interests which are currently taxable under the FIF rules would be excluded from those rules. People would instead be required to return income when the amounts are received. Second, for income which is currently taxed on receipt (especially pensions), the amount of the tax liability would be expected to change. In most cases, except for lump sum amounts which are wholly or largely considered a return of capital, this option would reduce the tax payable. 19. Officials note that some submissions on the issues paper effectively argued for this option: that option three, which was proposed in the issues paper, should be extended to periodic pensions as well. This is not preferred, for reasons which are outlined in the table on pages 9-11. 20. Option three involves the application of option two only to lump-sum withdrawals and transfers, and retaining the current treatment of periodic pensions. The inclusion approach would be applied to lump sums received from foreign superannuation schemes. The inclusion rates will be calculated in the same manner as under option two. It is officials' preferred approach because it removes the complexity of the FIF rules, as well as the cash-flow problems that may arise when individuals have tax to pay on accrual but cannot access the required funds because their scheme is locked. It is also preferred because it recognises that the current tax treatment of periodic pensions is not a problem and therefore will continue to be taxed on receipt at a personal's marginal rate. The officials' issues paper proposed this option. A number of changes have been made following the consultation process (in particular, an alternative method to the inclusion approach to tax acfual investment gains), although these do not affect the basic framework of this option. 2I. There are some common advantages to all three options. In particular: o The distinction between foreign superannuation interests that are subject to the FIF rules and those that are not will be removed. Less reliance will be placed on the current FIF exemptions, which can be subjective and difficult to apply. The tax consequences will no longer depend on whether, for example, a scheme is locked-in. This ensures that the rules are simple, fair, efficient, and provide certainty. a Systematic over-taxation should be avoided by tax being payable to the extent that it would have been paid on accrual (plus an interest factor for the deferral benefit). Full taxation of lump sums, which has the potential to occur under the current rules, was not considered as a viable option. This ensures that the rules are fair. The taxation of lump sums will no longer be assessed under the existing rules that apply where there is a FIF exemption. The rules that apply where there is a FIF exemption are highly complex and depend on factors such as whether the distribution is from a company or a trust. This ensures that the rules are simple, which means that it will be easier to apply and less-information intensive for individuals. There will not be a disincentive to transfer superannuation to New Zealand compared to leaving savings overseas. This will achieve the objective of efficiency as a neutral policy setting is desirable. a 22. The new rules will be implemented within the existing legislative and regulatory framework. A number of provisions have specific relevance to this policy reform. The transitional residents' rules provide an exemption from New Zealand tax (including both the FIF rules and tax on receipt) for most sources of foreign income during the first four or so years of residence. The agreement on trans-Tasman portability of superannuation between New Zealand and Australia will, when it comes into force on I July 2013, ensure that 7 qualifying transfers from certain Australian schemes into KiwiSaver schemes are not taxable. The 2010 double tax agreement between New Zealand and Australia also provides a similar result for lump sums. 23. The preferred option incorporates the existing measures described in paragraph22. For example, transitional residents receiving lump sums will only be taxed on investment gains that would accrue after the end of their four-year exemption for foreign income. As transfers from AustraTia are exempt under the above international agreements, the preferred option addresses a revenue risk by providing for tax to be payable on foreign superannuation transfers into either New Zealand or Australian schemes. 24. Several key assumptions underpin these options. The amount of accrued gains and the use-of-money interest charge which are to be payable on receipt, use interest and growth rates of 5o/o. It is further assumed that the investment gains that accrue in the foreign scheme are not taxed (i.e. the foreign country operates an "EET" regime). These assumptions enable the calculation methods to determine the extent of tax that has not been paid in New Zealand on accrual (as under the FIF rules), which forms the basis for the new rules. 25. Officials consider these assumptions are robust. T\\e 5Yo rates were chosen to be consistent with the FDR method, and will effectively serve as a cap where investment gains would be higher. (If investment gains are lower, the alternative approach for taxing actual gains may be used instead.) The assumption of an EET regime is valid as the majority of the source countries from which new migrants come, operate an EET regime. The notable exception is Australia; however, transfers of superannuation from Australia will not be taxable under the international agreements discussed in paragraph22. 26. The fiscal implications of the preferred approach are very difficult to quantify due to a lack of reliable information, but have been estimated to be broadly fiscally neutral. The existing policy is to tax foreign superannuation, and the new rules are simply designed to make the rules easier to comply with rather than to collect any additional revenue. 8 27. In addition to the advantages listed above, which are common to all three options, officials' analysis is summarised in the following tables. Some terms are explained on page three: Not preferred as it retains significant complexþ even though at face value it makes the FIF rules simpler by removing possible exemptions. There are significant practical issues with accrual taxation for people with interests in locked-in and defined benefit schemes, çqmFared with the status quo.

The¡e is a small trade-offof equity (between lump sums and pensions) for simplicity and improved compliance. This inequity exists under the status quo as well. Onbalance, the benefits outweigh the costs. It is an improvement on the status quo as the revenue from periodic pensions is maintained and compliance in respect of lump sums is expected to improve, regardless of the revenue risk identified in the disadvantages column. ji:ltJ-: t¡il1¡!r(rj; l Þli.'t tì i,ir I r rå, r'i'\\', 11 CONSULTATION 28. In the first half of 2012, officials consulted with certain tax practitioners and the members of the financial services industry on problems with the current tax rules for foreign superannuation. Their views were incorporated into the policy design, particularly the application of the FIF exemptions and concems about the taxation of lump sums vis-à-vis pensions. An issues paper, Taxation offoreign superqnnuation, was subsequently released by Inland Revenue and the Treasury in July 2012. Fifty-nine external submissions were received, and the main comments from submitters were as follows: Issues and comments raised in submissionsResponse Support for taxøtion on receipt There was considerable support for taxing foreign superannuation on receipt, rather than on accrual, under the FIF rules. The proposals were considered pragmatic, and the main advantages were said to be clarity and simplicity. N/A Inclusion øpproach mø! over-tøx The inclusion rates assume growth in the foreign scheme of 5%o (after taxes and fees), which was considered to be un¡ealistic. This may result in over- taxation. Consequently, submitters argued there should be an alternative method whereby tax would be payable on actual investment gains. An alternative method has been included in the new rules that will tax lump sum amounts on the actual investment gains derived in a foreign defined contribution scheme while the person is a New Zealand resident. An interest factor will be charged on these gains in recognition of the use-of-money benefit from deferral. The grace period, during which no New Zealand tax will be payable on lump sum transfers or withdrawals, has been lengthened from two years to four years. This will provide a longer tax-free window during which people can transfer to New Zealand, and will be consistent with the duration of the transitional residents' exemption. Rather than the inclusion rates being calculated on the basis of years of residence since migration, they will instead be calculated on years of residence since the end of the grace period, or transitional residents' exemption. Gains which accrue during the grace period or transitional residents' exemption will not, therefore. be taxed on receipt. Application døte The proposed general application date of 1 April 2011 was not favoured. Instead, a prospective application date was preferred, with most suggesting I April 2013 or I April2014. The application date has been deferred from I April 2011, as initially proposed, to I April 2014 in order to provide more certainty to individuals affected by the proposals. Previously, it was proposed that a person must have complied with the FIF rules for the 20ll tax year by the due date for thatyear in order to continue using the FIF rules. Given that the general application date has 12 changed, the criteria for a person to be able to continue to use the FIF rules have also been modified to be less restrictive. The new rules provide that only people who file a tax return including FIF income or loss in respect of a foreign superannuation interest before the introduction of legislation may continue to use the FIF rules for that interest after 1 April2}l4. This is not restricted to any particular tax year. fmplementøtion issue - Low cost option for pøst trønsfers As a concessionary measure, the paper proposed an option for people who transferred a lump sum in the past and who did not previously comply to apply a 15% inclusion rate. The majority of submitters argued that the 1 5% inclusion option for past transfers is unfair, as previous non-compliance was inadvertent. Submitters argued that there should be a full amnesty for transfers made in prior years so there is no fuither tax to pay. A full amnesty is not recommended as it would create an unfair advantage for non-compliant people over people who have complied with the law and fulfilled any resulting tax obligatíons. The l5Yo inclusion option is necessary to reduce potential tax liabilities facing people who did not comply with the tax rules in respect of past transfers. It does not impose taxation retrospectively The eligibility period for the 15% inclusion option has been extended to also apply to transfers up to 31 March 2074, as proposed in some submissions. In the absence of the 15% inclusion option, Inland Revenue's compliance (i.e. pre-audit) activity - which has been deferred pending this policy review - would reconìmence. The application of existing law, plus use-of-money interest and late payment penalties, would be expected to result in signifrcantly higher tax burdens for most people. The l5o/o inclusion option is therefore a concessionary and voluntary alternative to the existing law. 29. The new rules have been developed in consultation with the Treasury. tnland Revenue has also consulted with the Ministry of Social Development and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 30. Officials have assessed the three options discussed in this Regulatory Impact Statement against the stated objectives. The recommended approach, option three, would establish a new, cohesive set of rules in the Úrcome Tax Act 2007 to replace the current rules applying to interests in - and income from - foreign superannuation schemes. The FIF rules will cease to apply to foreign superannuation interests. Instead, lump sum amounts will be taxed on receipt under one of two new calculation methods. These methods are designed to approximate the tax that would have been paid on accrual under the FIF rules, in conjunction with an interest charge that recognises the deferred paynent of tax until receipt. Foreign pensions will continue to be taxable on receipt at a person's marginal tax rate. On balance, the recommended approach achieves all four objectives for taxing interests in foreign superannuation: equity, efficiency, simplicit¡ and certainty. 13 IMPLEMENTATION 31. The new rules will apply to lump sum transfers or withdrawals received from a foreign superannuation scheme on or after 1 Apnl20l4. New rules will also apply to transfers made before that date, which will be optional and operate alongside the existing law. 32. A person who receives a lump sum after 1 April 2014 wlll be required to determine the corresponding amount of assessable income under one of the two calculation methods. The result will be included in the person's income tax return for the tax year in which the lump sum was received. 33. A person who received a lump sum in a prior year, and for which they did not comply with their tax obligations (either under the FIF rules or on receipt) may either apply the law which existed at the time or include 15% of the lump sum in their assessable income. To use the l5o/o inclusion rate, a person will need to return the income in a tax return on or before 31 March 2016. Where the I5Yo inclusion rate is used, use-of-money interest and late payment and filing penalties will generally not be applied. 34. There will be transitional provisions in place with regards to the application of the FIF rules. A person will need to self-assess whether they can continue to use the FIF rules after 1 Apnl2014 according to specified criteria. If they are able to continue to use the FIF rules, they can elect to do so by including their FIF income or loss from a foreign superannuation interest in their income tax returns until their rights in the foreign scheme cease. Altematively, the person can elect to apply the new rules rather than the FIF rules by not including the FIF income or loss in their tax return. Once this election is made, the person will not be able to subsequently apply the FIF rules in respect of that interest. Any income received from that interest will be taxable on receipt. 35. More guidance on implementation and transition issues will be provided when the new rules have been finalised, closer to the enactment of the amending legislation, for example in a Tax Information Bulletin. There are no significant administrative issues arising from these changes. MONITORTNG, EVALUATION At\[D REVIE\\il 36. krland Revenue monitors, evaluates and reviews new legislation under the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage tax policy process that has been used for tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. The implementation and review stage of the GTPP involves reviewing the legislation after implementation and identifying anyremedial issues. 37 . The levels of voluntary compliance in relation to past transfers of foreign superannuation will be assessed through the uptake of, for example, the l5Yo inclusion option before 31 March 2016. 38. The effectiveness of the new rules after I Apnl 2014 will be monitored under the GTPP. Any further changes that are identified as being necessary for the new legislation to have its intended effect would generally be added to the tax policy work progr¿rffne, and those proposals would also go through the GTPP. Further consultation would be implicit in this 14 approach. Extending the new rules to foreign life insurance policies with savings elements, which share a number of characteristics with foreign superaruruation, may be considered by ofEeials at a later date. Regulatory Impact Statement Specified Mineral Mining — Tax Review Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of: • whether the current tax rules for specified mineral mining are appropriate; and • if they are not appropriate, the options to more closely align the rules that operate in respect of specified mineral mining to those that apply to the majority of other taxpayers. There are approximately 200 specified mineral mining operators in the industry. Most of these are relatively small, with a few major operators being responsible for the bulk of production levels. Consultation on these issues took place via an officials' issues paper, Taxation of specified mineral mining, released in September 2012, which sought feedback on various features of a proposed set of tax rules that would replace the existing concessionary rules. Following review of written submissions, officials from Inland Revenue and Treasury met with a number of interested parties. Submissions were received from accounting firms representing clients, mining firms, and mining industry representatives and were overwhelmingly in favour of the retention of the current rules. In addition to their opposition to any general reform in this area, submissions also raised issues with some of the more detailed proposals in the issues paper. Of particular interest to submitters were, the proposed "claw-back" rule, the concept of the "life of the mine", the proposal to make specified mineral mining companies subject to the general tax rules for grouping and shareholder continuity, and rehabilitation expenditure. The preferred option would largely replace the existing concessionary tax rules for specified mineral miners, and Inland Revenue recognises this is contrary to the preference of submitters. However, the reasons for replacing them (and removing most of the current concessions) are considered more compelling when broad principles such as minimising economic distortions, fairness across taxpayer groups and the coherence of the tax system are considered. Submissions have been taken into account on the details of the proposals, such as the proposal to allow specified mineral mining company losses to be carried through a breach in shareholder continuity. There are no other significant gaps, dependencies, constraints or caveats concerning the regulatory analysis undertaken. We do however note that the estimated revenue gain of approximately $30 million per annum associated with these changes is relatively uncertain as it is highly contingent on matters such as relative consistency of production levels and the international price of minerals. The proposed option does not impair private property rights, reduce market competition, or override common law principles. It does arguably provide less incentive to innovate and invest in the specified mineral mining sector than currently, but only to the extent that it proposes the removal of most of the existing concessionary rules. Joanna Clifford Programme Manager - Policy Inland Revenue 11 March 2013 2 - STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1) At present there is a separate set of tax rules that apply to "specified mineral miners". There are approximately 200 specified mineral mining operators in the industry. Most of these are relatively small, with a few major operators being responsible for the bulk of production levels. 2) There are 50 specified minerals, of which gold, silver and iron sands are the most commonly mined. The current tax rules that apply to this group effectively allow a tax deduction for capital expenditure in the year the expenditure is incurred, and, in certain circumstances, allow expenditure to be deducted in anticipation of it being incurred. 3) These immediate deductions for capital expenditure and expenditure yet to be incurred make the tax rules for specified mining very concessionary compared to most sectors, including petroleum mining, which also has concessionary rules) Example: Orthodox tax rules Cuii ent tax rules for specified mineral mining An immediate deduction is available for Deductions for the same expenditure would expenditure that is defined in the Income Tax either not be permitted or deferred and Act as either "mining exploration expenditure" or "mining development expenditure". These terms effectively cover expenditure incurred in searching for mineral deposits and preparing an area for mining. allowed over the economic life of the asset. They include significant items of capital expenditure such as land, buildings and machinery. 4) Tax concessions to particular industries can have the following effects: i) They potentially distort investment decisions and the allocation of capital; ii) They can be perceived as being unfair on other taxpayers that do not have concessions. iii) They reduce the coherence of tax policy. iv) They are also contrary to the Government's objective of a broad-base, low-rate tax system. 5) The benefit of the existing tax rules rests almost entirely with the specified mineral mining sector. Although that sector forms an important part of the New Zealand economy, given the Government's focus on a broad-base, low rate tax policy, it is timely to review whether tax concessions are appropriate given the relative lack of concessions provided to similarly capital-intensive industries. 6) It is also noted that this review is occurring largely simultaneously with a Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) review of the royalty rates that apply to new 1 A person's taxable income is determined after taking deductions off assessable income. The ability to access deductions can therefore reduce the person's tax liability. 3 high-value mineral developments. 2 This review complements the work undertaken by MBIE. Both seek a fair return on the Government's mineral resources consistent with the Government's Business Growth Agenda, by better ensuring that scarce capital and labour is allocated to the most productive areas of the economy. OBJECTIVES 7) The objective of the current review is to ensure the tax rules that apply to specified mineral miners: i) Are efficient (that is, they do not distort investment decisions); ii) Promote equity and fairness across the taxpaying community; iii) Are coherent in terms of the overall tax system; iv) Promote revenue integrity; v) Provide certainty; vi) Do not impose undue compliance costs on business. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 8) We consider there are three main options for dealing with the over-arching issue of the current concessionary rules: i) Status quo: The current rules be retained. ii) Revised rules: A revised set of rules for specified mineral miners be introduced that brings their tax treatment more closely into alignment with other taxpayers. iii) No mining rules: The current rules could be repealed and not replaced so the general tax rules applied to specified mineral miners. 9) Although options 2 and 3 would arguably be similar in effect, option 2 is based on the assumption that some specific rules would be desirable to perform the following functions: i) Clarify areas of uncertainty for types of expenditure relatively unique to specified mineral mining. ii) Provide rules that deviated from the standard tax treatment to cater for relatively unique aspects of mining operations. 10) Officials consider there are strong economic arguments for removing concessions and these apply equally to options 2 and 3. These arguments are summarised below. However, we also consider that, because of its potential to result in higher compliance costs and create greater uncertainty for no discernible benefits over and above those provided by option 2, option 3 is not viable. This option was therefore not consulted on, nor was it raised as a realistic possibility by submitters. 11) "In designing option 2 officials were conscious that there are some unique features to specified mineral mining that may justify special rules. These are: i) The fact that the costs of mining are generally divided into specific definable phases "prospecting expenditure", "exploration expenditure", "development expenditure", "mining expenditure" and "rehabilitation expenditure". It is arguably unfair to treat all of these expenditure types under ordinary principles because the nature of mining operations means that some items that may generally 2 http://www.med.govt.nz/sectors-industrie,s/natural-resources/pdf-docs-library/oil-and-gas/crown-minerals-act - review/consultation-on-the-royalty-regime-for-minerals/discussion-paper.pdf 4 be regarded as capital warrant different tax treatment. There is also scope in mining to incur significant expenditure after all income-earning activity has ceased (such as "rehabilitation costs" of restoring land to the condition required). ii) It is not always clear at the outset how long a mine will last. Under general principles of depreciation, capital assets that decline in value should be depreciated over their useful life. To be consistent with this principle, assets with a useful life contingent on the operation of the mine would need to be depreciated over the "life of the mine". However, a fixed life would arguably produce uneconomic outcomes because the life of a mine can be a variable figure depending on mineral reserves and levels of production. It is therefore necessary to define the "life of mine" concept and incorporate the necessary flexibility. iii) It may be possible for a miner to access tax-free capital gains by disposing of land with the minerals still in place, whereas income from the extraction and sale of those same reserves would be subject to tax. The tax treatment of land should therefore be considered. iv) There are currently rules allow mining companies to carry losses through a change in shareholding (an option not open to most other companies), but restrictions on who mining companies can group with for tax purposes (effectively they can only group with other mining companies). It is important to consider if there is something sufficiently different about the specified mineral mining sector that justify these rules being retained or whether the standard loss and grouping rules should apply. v) How "farm-out" arrangements, insurance receipts and bad debts should be treated. There are currently special rules for insurance receipts and writing off of debt by mining holding companies. Again, it is important to consider if these are still appropriate. 12) Officials consider the following sector-specific rules will provide a more orthodox tax treatment to the sector (by removing the concessionary treatment), while still providing certainty and catering for some distinctive features of the sector, as explained above i) "Prospecting expenditure" and "exploration expenditure" should be immediately deductible, subject to the claw-back rule discussed in point iii), below. ii) "Development expenditure" should be capitalised and deducted over the life of the mine. 3 iii) "Exploration expenditure" on items later used for the extraction of minerals should be added back as income in the year the mine becomes operational and deducted over the life of the mine as if it were development expenditure. iv) The "life of the mine" should be self-assessed by taxpayers based on their expected activities in a particular permit area, but should not be less than the expected life of the mine used for accounting purposes. A mine would have a maximum life for tax purposes of 25 years. v) "Mining expenditure" should be subject to the ordinary capital/revenue distinction that applies to other businesses. 4 vi) "Rehabilitation expenditure" should be deductible in the year it is spent, but a refundable credit should be generated if a loss is incurred in that year to provide 3 Capitalised expenditure is not immediately deductible. Instead, deductions are generally spread over the estimated useful life of the asset created. 4 Taxpayers are able to immediately deduct revenue items, while capital items are either non-deductible or deductible over time through depreciation. 5 for the fact that the expenditure may occur after income-earning activity has ceased. vii) Land should be treated as revenue account property of a mining company, meaning income or a deduction is accounted for in the year of disposa1. 5 As with rehabilitation expenditure, if a loss is incurred in the year of a land sale, a refundable credit should be generated. viii)The existing loss rules for mining companies should remain. That is they should continue to be able to carry losses forward through a continuity breach, but only be able to offset those losses against income from the same permit area. To prevent this loss continuity rule being manipulated, mineral mining companies should still only be allowed to form tax groups with other mining companies. This is consistent with the current mineral mining rules, but differs from the rules that apply more generally. ix) The rules that allow mineral miners to appropriate income for future expenditure should be repealed. To account for the fact that the repeal of this rule may result in unexpected tax liabilities for miners, they should be allowed to spread any income tax liability over the two years following effective date. x) When a "farm-out" of mining rights takes place, the consideration received should be treated as income in the year the rights pass and the consideration paid should be deducted over the expected life of the mine (or be immediately deductible if the mine is still in the prospecting or explorations phases). xi) The normal tax rules should apply in respect of insurance receipts and bad debt/bad debt recovery. 13) The table on the following pages analyses the 3 options discussed above against the objectives of the review: 5 Revenue account property is taxable or deductible in the year of sale, meaning that if it is sold for less than it was bought for, a deduction is available. Conversely, if a profit is made, that profit is taxable. 6 Objectives Met/Not met) Impacts Efficiency Equity Coherence Revenue Certainty Compliance Costs Benefits Net economic Impact Option Not met — Not met — Not met — Not met — Met — The Met — Government: Government: Negative — 1: Status Industry By Industry Lowering rules in their Taxpayers are Lower A specified the benefits to quo — concessions lowering concessions the tax current form familiar with revenue mineral the industry Not distort the tax are contrary obligations have been in the current collection and mining sector are preferred investment obligations to the for certain place for a rules and have issues that is more outweighed decisions of one Government's taxpayers number of systems associated profitable than by broader and sector you overall broad- not only years and are designed for with it otherwise considerations productivity must base, low-rate reduces well them. concessionary would be. of a lack of of capital invariably increase the relative burden on others, tax policy framework. the revenue from that particular source but also puts the overall tax base at understood by industry, rules, such as lobbying from comparable industries for similar concessions.

At a simplistic level, the choice is between keeping a concessionary set of rules (option 1) or applying more orthodox principles to the sector (options 2 and 3). 15) Tax concessions that favour one particular industry distort investment decisions and the productivity of capital. Distortions arise in this context if a tax concession induces people to invest in a particular sector that, in the absence of the tax, they would not invest in. If businesses are effectively subsidised through the tax system, it also has the potential to distort the domestic labour market through that industry being in a position to offer remuneration that a non-subsidised business could not match. 16) New Zealand's framework for taxing inbound capital is based around applying broadly the same tax rules no matter which area of the economy the capital is invested. This is consistent with our broad-base, low rate tax framework. This is why, for example, the same company tax rate applies to companies across the New Zealand economy. The logical extension of option 1 would be to abandon this framework and apply lower effective tax rates on foreign investment into certain areas of the economy. Not only would such an approach put the company tax base at extreme risk, it would likely result in unfair and inefficient outcomes. In addition, it would strongly encourage industries to lobby Goverment for industry-specific tax concessions. 17) Further, we consider that, even if tax settings are a consideration when investing into a certain jurisdiction, they will - provided the rules are not actively discriminatory - be relatively insignificant compared to other factors, such as a country's infrastructure, the skill of its labour force and the market price of the mineral in question. 18) However, officials recognise that some unique features of the specified mineral mining sector justify departure from the standard rules. As a result some special rules should still be in place for the sector. It is therefore considered that option 2 is preferable. CONSULTATION — POLICY FRAMEWORK 19) An officials' issues paper was released by The Treasury and Inland Revenue entitled: Taxation of specified mineral mining in October 2012. 20) A total of 39 submissions were received from a mix of accounting firms representing clients, mining firms, and mining industry representatives. Twenty-six of the submissions received were standard form submissions from West Coast alluvial gold miners. Submissions 21) Submissions were overwhelmingly in favour of retaining the status quo. Most submissions agreed that the current rules were concessionary, but that opposed change on the basis of efficiency. Submitters argued that it is incorrect to look at the distortion of local capital markets in isolation. They consider that there is only a limited capital pool available worldwide for mineral mining and, to the extent that rules in New Zealand change to make it less profitable to operate here, that capital will migrate to a more favourable jurisdiction. 10 Therefore, they suggest, it is more a question of whether the capital comes to New Zealand at all, rather than its efficient allocation once it is here. 22) Submitters also suggested that adverse changes to the tax rules for specified mineral miners could have particularly detrimental effects on rural areas where mining is prevalent — the West Coast of the South Island in particular. 23) Officials do not agree with submitters on the efficiency point for the reasons set out in the analysis section (recommended option), above. 24) Officials understand submitters' concerns about the impact on rural areas. However, as stated above, the tax system is based on the fundamental premises of a broad base and low rate. To the extent that Government support is provided to particular communities, it is more efficient to have this take place through a targeted system, rather than tax concessions to a particular industry. CONSULTATION — POLICY DETAII, 25) As mentioned above, submitters disagreed with the overall objectives of the proposals as described in option 2. However, written submissions on the issues paper and later meetings and conversations between submitters and Inland Revenue and Treasury officials also focussed on the detailed policy proposals put forward in the issues paper. 26) Although many of the features of the final proposal are consistent with the issues paper, the following table sets out the specific proposals that attracted the most submissions. For each issue it then restates the final policy proposal and, if the final policy proposals have been altered as a result of consultation, what has changed and why. Where key submission points were not advanced as part of the final proposals, it explains the reasons why they were not considered appropriate: 11 Issue and proposed rules Submissions and response Claw-back rule: Given that exploration The proposal is consistent with the issues expenditure would be immediately deductible and development expenditure would have to be capitalised, there are incentives to paper. Submissions suggested that the boundary recharacterise development expenditure as between exploration and development exploration expenditure in order to access expenditure are almost always clear, so the those deductions. claw-back rule is unnecessary. However, we consider that this will not always be the case The proposal is that any item treated as as, for example, a tunnel used for exploration exploration expenditure that is used for purposes may later be used to extract mineral extraction is clawed back and then minerals from the functioning mine. In these depreciated over the life of the mine cases, the claw-back rule will provide a (effectively treating it as development useful buttress between the two types of expenditure). expenditure. To the extent that the boundary is clear then taxpayers will be able to account for expenditure in a way that ensures the claw-back rule never operates in practice. 12 Issue and proposed rules Submissions and response Rehabilitation/restoration expenditure: Expenditure necessary to restore the mined land to the condition required by the relevant mining permit. The proposal is that deductions should be allowed in the year that rehabilitation expenditure is actually spent. To recognise the fact that this expenditure may be incurred after income earning activities have ceased, to the extent that such expenditure results in a tax loss, a refundable credit should be generated in the relevant period. This credit would be limited in value to the amount of tax that the miner has paid in respect of mining operations in the relevant permit area. This is the treatment given to similar expenditure under the petroleum mining rules. Under the petroleum rules, such losses can be carried back and offset against previous years' income. The refundable credit is considered to be preferable because it eliminates much of the compliance and administration costs involved in reopening and adjusting prior years' returns. The issues paper suggested that deductions should be given for rehabilitation expenditure to the extent that a grossed-up sum of money was paid into special Inland Revenue account — similar to environmental restoration account rules in subpart EK of the Income Tax Act 2007. So, for example, if a taxpayer wished to obtain a $100 deduction, they would put $28 into an Inland Revenue account (effectively a pre-payment of tax). Submitters suggested the issues paper proposal would generate real cash-flow concerns for them. Submitters have also argued that mineral miners should be able to use the provisioning allowed by IFRS accounting as a basis for deductions. This would result in deductions being available in the year that the miner committed to incurring the expenditure (being the period when the relevant damage to land took place), discounted and then claimed over the period between that date and actual expenditure. Deductions would therefore be able to be taken earlier than under the proposed rules. Although we can see the force in this argument, we do not consider this is something that should be addressed solely in the mineral mining context, as many industries have expected expenditure that they are able to create reserves for in their accounts. A broad review of the tax treatment of future expenditure would seem more appropriate. In the meantime, we do not consider it would be preferable to introduce a regime more favourable than the one that currently applies to petroleum mining. 13 Issue and proposed rules Submissions and response Land expenditure: Land purchased by a miner for the purposes of their mining operations. Currently these expenses are fully deductible. The proposal is to treat land as revenue account property, with gains being taxable and losses deductible in the year of sale. As with rehabilitation expenditure, to recognise the fact that selling of the land will likely be the final act of a mining project, losses attributable to the sale of land should also be available as a refundable credit, up to the value of tax paid in respect of the relevant permit area. The issues paper suggested treating land as revenue account property, but not that a refundable credit be generated. Submissions suggested a regime similar to that which exists for forestry should be considered. Under the forestry rules, the land is separated from the standing timber, with the latter being given revenue account treatment. Again, we can see the force in this argument, but consider such a solution unworkable in the mineral mining context. Unlike timber, which is easily identifiable, mineral deposits under the surface are extremely difficult to accurately estimate in advance. In any event, the 'revenue account' rule is designed to be concessionary in that it recognises that mineral miners will likely be paying a substantial premium for land when the existing landowner realises that they have commercially viable mineral deposits. The land being sold at the end of the mining project will have been devalued by the extraction of the minerals, so a deduction for the loss in value should be available to the miner. 14 Issue and proposed rules Life of the mine: The life of the mine is an important concept, because it sets the timeframe for depreciation of all assets that are tied to the life of the mine, including development expenditure. It is proposed that the "life of mine" should be self-assessed, provided the timeframe used for tax purposes is not less than the one used for the purposes of the company's accounts. Some mines, particularly iron sand mines, have very long estimated lives. To create some certainty for these long-life mines, it is proposed that there be a cap on the "life of mine" concept of 25 years. The "mine" in question should be the permit area. Submissions and response The issues paper suggested that depreciation should be calculated using "proven" plus "probable" reserves, with deductions being based on the proportion of those reserves extracted in any given year. Submissions suggested that the "proven" plus "probable" method would be difficult to operate in practice, particularly for smaller mining operators that may not be required to produce such information for the purposes of their accounts. The proposal therefore aims to simplify the issue for smaller operators while still maintaining some robustness around the life of mine figure actually produced. With regard to what a "mine" is for these purposes, submissions suggested that sometimes several mines exist in one permit area. However, the ability to split permit areas into discrete operations could be used to manipulate the proposed self-assessment regime, and using the entire permit area as a proxy for a "mine" would provide greater certainty. 15 Issue and proposed rules Loss continuity and grouping: Under the current regime, a mining company can carry losses through a breach in shareholder continuity (subject to losses from one permit area being ring-fenced to future profits from the same area), but cannot belong to a group of companies unless all group members are also mining companies. The proposal is that the existing rules remain in place. However, the claw-back rule mentioned above should apply to all relevant expenditure irrespective of whether it was incurred before or after a continuity breach. This is because the benefit of any losses will pass to the new owner, so that owner should account for any resulting income. Submissions and response The issues paper suggested that the normal tax rules for losses and grouping should apply to specified mineral miners. Although the proposal to retain the current system depart from the general tax principles regarding losses and grouping, we consider they are justified in this instance. Submissions suggested that mineral mining companies were more susceptible to continuity breaches because of the nature of their business. Mining is a capital intensive industry that requires significant upfront investment. This is a level of investment that can be beyond the means of founding shareholders. However, unlike other industries, mining companies do not have the option of debt financing because of the high-risk nature of the business. Therefore, with additional equity financing and the associated change in shareholding, they are more at risk of continuity breaches than companies in other industries. We agree that the nature of the business means that mineral mining is somewhat unique in this regard, which is the primary reason that the existing loss-continuity rules should remain in place. This would mean that losses from a permit area can be carried though a continuity breach, but will always be to be ring-fenced to income derived from the same permit area. It also means that mining companies should only be allowed to form tax groups with other mining companies. 16 Issue and proposed rules Submissions and response Appropriation of income: Under the current The issues paper suggested that no rules, a specified mining company can deduct appropriation be permitted, but did not an amount of income appropriated towards allow for any resulting tax liability to be mining exploration or development expenditure. The deduction is allowed in the year that the appropriation is made. spread. The ability to spread the liability over two The proposal is that the normal rules apply and years follows submissions that the removal no special appropriation be permitted.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 27) For the reasons set out in the "Regulatory Impact Analysis" section of this statement, we recommend that a revised set of tax rules for specified mineral mining be enacted that more closely aligns the tax treatment of this sector with orthodox tax principals. 28) We also recommend that the revised rules have the key features set out in paragraph 12 of the "Regulatory Impact Analysis" section. IMPLEMENTATION 29) It is proposed that the revised rules apply to specified mineral miners from the 2014/15 income year. Given that the rules will largely remove existing concessions, no significant transitional issues are expected. The only transitional rule proposed is to allow the payment of any tax attributable to the removal of the income attribution rule to be spread over two years. 30) It is anticipated that there will be some one-off compliance costs for the relevant taxpayers once the revised rules take effect. These costs are expected to largely be associated with ensuring that taxpayers understand the implications of the rules and changes to accounting/software systems necessary to accommodate them. 31) It is not anticipated the introduction of these rules will have significant systems implications for Inland Revenue as most of the changes will simply alter the self-assessment position adopted by taxpayers. The changes will be communicated to taxpayers though the usual legislative means, including a detailed commentary to the bill when introduced and a summary of the final rules in a Tax Information Bulletin once the enacting legislation has received Royal Assent. We will also consult with the industry as to whether more detailed communication on the changes is required — for example, seminars for effected parties and their advisors. 17 MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 32) Monitoring the effect of these changes will fall under Inland Revenue's responsibilities under the generic tax policy process (GTTP). The GTTP is a multi-stage process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. The final stage of this process is the implementation and review stage, which involves Inland Revenue conducting a post- implementation review and identifying any remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. 18 Regulatory Impact Statement Financial arrangements — the treatment of interest-free and reduced-interest loans under IFRS Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of options for clarifying the financial arrangements rules, to ensure that notional amounts of interest or one-off adjustments that arise because of the accounting treatment of interest-free or reduced-interest loans are ignored for tax purposes. There are no significant gaps, assumptions, dependencies, constraints, caveats or uncertainties that have been identified. However, our preferred option will be partly retrospective in that it will affect past positions taken, but from a prospective date. This will ensure that taxpayers who have claimed deductions contrary to the policy intent will be returned to the intended tax position. Taxpayers will be required to pay provisional tax on the basis of the new rule before it is enacted, although the introduction of the bill will give them notice of the required treatment. We believe this is appropriate in these circumstances. Claiming deductions for expenses that are not incurred is clearly inconsistent with the underlying policy and the purpose of the financial arrangements rules. We engaged in only limited consultation as we did not want to draw undue attention to the issue because wider knowledge of this issue poses a revenue risk. We also expect the number of affected taxpayers to be very small (it is estimated that fewer than 20 taxpayers will be affected) and the proposed solution is straightforward. We have consulted with a senior accountant in a large accounting finn, who supported the proposal. We have also consulted with the Treasury, which agrees with our analysis. This clarification of the law will be communicated by releasing a commentary explaining the effect of the clarification on the introduction of the bill, and writing a Tax Information Bulletin item once the bill receives Royal assent. Given the small scale of the problem and the nature of those possibly impacted (large businesses) we believe this is sufficient to communicate this clarification of the law. The proposed change does not impose any new significant compliance costs on affected taxpayers. The proposed rule also does not impair private property rights, reduce market competition, provide disincentives to innovate and invest or override common law principles. Joanna Clifford Programme Manager, Policy Inland Revenue 6 March 2013 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. Interest-free loans are financial arrangements and are thus taxed under the financial arrangements rules. Broadly speaking, the financial arrangements rules require expected income and expenditure to be spread over the life of the financial arrangement using a "spreading method". 2. At present, there is uncertainty as to the correct tax treatment of interest-free (and reduced-interest) loans for taxpayers that comply with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) accounting rules. No actual interest payments will be made under an interest-free loan. Accordingly, there should be no income or deductions to spread for tax purposes. 3. This is not necessarily the tax treatment that such loans receive. For accounting, IFRS requires that the value of an interest-free or reduced-interest loan be reduced on initial recognition, so the loan is effectively split into two components: (a) a full-interest loan for a lesser amount; and (b) a contribution of equity in the case of a related-party loan, or a one-off adjustment in the firm's profit and loss account in the case of unrelated lending. 4. This IFRS accounting treatment therefore gives rise to notional payments in a company's accounts. For example, a company that has an interest-free loan will make book entries for interest payments as if it were a full-interest loan, even though it will make no actual interest payments. 5. Some taxpayers have argued that the current drafting of tax legislation allows these notional payments to have a tax effect (i.e. that they are deductible/ taxable).1 This is because the legislation containing the detailed rules that provide for what is taxable and what is deductible is capable of being read as allowing for deductions in the situation described above. The counter-argument is that Parliament would not have intended for these notional payments to have a tax effect (i.e. that they should not be deductible/taxable) and the rules should be read consistently with that intention so as to deny deductions where there is an interest-free loan. It is unclear which interpretation would be accepted by the Courts. Therefore, it is appropriate that the legislation be amended to make it clear that deductions are not allowed in this situation. 6. We are not aware of many taxpayers who are arguing that these notional amounts should have a tax effect. The size of the problem is small (it is estimated that fewer than 20 taxpayers will be affected). Nevertheless, we consider it important for the law to be clarified because not only is this inconsistent with the policy intent, the potential ability for taxpayers to claim tax deductions on notional payments carries a fiscal risk. 7. It should be noted that if the argument above (that the notional book entries can have a tax effect) is accepted, the result for a taxpayer can either be an increase or decrease in tax liability; its effect depends on how a taxpayer has structured the loan and whether they are a borrower or lender. OBJECTIVES 8. The objectives are to: 1 These anomalies would eventually be cancelled out when the loan is repaid, but in the interim there could be important timing effects. (a) Ensure that one-off adjustments to the value of a loan on initial recognition and notional amounts of interest are ignored for tax purposes, consistent with the policy intent; and (b) Protect the integrity of the tax base by ensuring the fiscal risk associated with the status quo is removed. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS Option one: retain the status quo 9. Under option 1 the ambiguity in the legislation relating to interest-free and reduced interest loans would not be removed. This would mean that taxpayers could continue to argue that tax deductions were available for notional amounts recognised in the IFRS accounts. Option two: amend the legislation to remove the ambiguity 10. Under option two the ambiguity in the legislation relating to interest-free and reduced-interest loans would be removed by ensuring that one-off adjustments to the value of a loan on initial recognition and notional amounts of interest are ignored for tax purposes, consistent with the policy intent. 11. Options one and two are analysed in the table below: Options Meets objective? Comment Fiscal / economic Social environmental Option 1: No. This Not viable.

Amending the legislation to remove the ambiguity would remove taxpayers' ability to argue this position. Amending the legislation to remove the ambiguity would increase certainty. for some taxpayers. Conclusion on the options 12. The recommended approach is to amend the legislation in relation to interest-free or reduced-interest loans to ensure that one-off adjustments to the value of a loan on initial recognition are ignored for tax purposes. This will ensure that taxpayers cannot claim tax deductions for amounts not incurred (or are not taxed on income that is not actually derived). Amending the legislation to remove the ambiguity would remove taxpayers' ability to argue this position. The other option — retaining the status quo — is not recommended as it would preserve taxpayers' ability to argue that tax deductions are available for amounts not economically incurred. This would result in a potential fiscal risk and would not remove the current uncertainty. Date of application 13. In terms of application dates, the two options we considered were: (a) Applying the amendments from the beginning of the income year that the bill containing the amendment is introduced (the 2013-14 income year), and (b) Applying the amendments from the beginning of the income year following the enactment of that bill (the 2014-15 year). 14. We prefer option (a). Option (a) will potentially have a back-dated effect: taxpayers will be required to pay provisional tax on the basis of the new rule before it is enacted, although the introduction of the bill will give them notice of the required treatment. Claiming deductions for expenses that are not incurred is clearly inconsistent with the underlying policy and the purpose of the financial arrangements rules. It is worth noting that only large taxpayers will be affected, who we expect will be well advised and aware that claiming these notional deductions is inconsistent with the purpose of the rules. Option (a) reduces the potential fiscal risks associated with the status quo as early as possible. 15. The later application date, Option (b), carries the risk of making more taxpayers aware of the potential tax advantage of the current situation, increasing the fiscal risk. 16. No social or environmental impacts have been identified for either option. Existing arrangements 17. In terms of existing arrangements (for example, interest-free loans that were entered into in prior years), we considered: (a) clawing back any notional deductions previously claimed (and, for those paying tax on notional interest amounts, providing refunds), with the clawed-back amounts being payable (or returned) in the 2014/15 income year; and 2 (b) not clawing back previously claimed/paid amounts until the loan is repaid. 18. We prefer option (c). Again, this is on the basis that it is inappropriate to claim deductions for expenses that are not incurred. Option (c) returns the taxpayer to the correct position as soon as possible. Option (d) defers (but does not prevent) the adjustment until future income years, which would provide the taxpayer with an ongoing time value of money advantage (or disadvantage in the case of interest income). We therefore consider it appropriate for deductions already claimed to be clawed back; the alternative would be allowing taxpayers to keep an improper advantage and would exacerbate the fiscal impact of the current situation. 19. Option (c) is beneficial for any taxpayers that have had to pay tax on notional amounts arising from the accounting treatment of interest-free or reduced-interest loans. 20. Option (d) will have a slightly negative fiscal impact, but due to the small scale of the problem at present this will not be significant or measurable. 21. No social or environmental impacts have been identified for either option. CONSULTATION 22. We have engaged in limited consultation with a senior accountant in a large accounting firm. He supported our preferred approach as outlined above. He supported a 1 April 2013 application date for the clarification (effectively the same as the application date we propose) and the clawback being performed in the 2013/14 income year. We prefer a later date for the clawback, as it will ensure the relevant bill will have received Royal assent before taxpayers are required to pay back tax on any notional amounts previously claimed. 23. We engaged in only limited consultation as we did not want to draw undue attention to this issue because wider knowledge of this issue poses a revenue risk. As with a prospective application date, drawing attention to the issue would allow taxpayers time to create arrangements that take advantage of the current situation. In addition, based on the small size of the problem and straight-forward nature of our proposed solution we did not consider wider consultation to be necessary. 2 As described above, previously claimed/paid amounts will eventually be clawed back in any event when the loan is repaid (or a base price adjustment is triggered for another reason). 24. We have also consulted with the Treasury, which agrees with our analysis. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 25. The recommended option is to clarify that notional amounts of interest and one-off adjustments to the value of a loan on initial recognition should be ignored in the IFRS financial reporting spreading method. The application date for this clarification should be the beginning of the 2013/14 income year. 26. We recommend the creation of a rule requiring taxpayers who have been claiming deductions for these notional amounts (or paying tax on them) to repay these deductions (or receive a refund of the tax payments) in their 2014/15 income year tax return. 27. This will effectively clarify how the financial arrangements rule spreading methods should apply to reduced-interest or interest-free loans. It also minimises the fiscal risks associated with the status quo. IMPLEMENTATION 28. The necessary legislative changes will be included in the scheduled April 2013 tax bill. There are no administrative impacts. Enforcement will carried out through Inland Revenue's standard risk monitoring and audit processes. 29. We will communicate this clarification by releasing a commentary explaining what a change does on the introduction of a bill, and writing a Tax Information Bulletin item once the bill receives Royal assent. Given the small scale of the problem and the nature of those possibly impacted (large businesses), we believe this is sufficient to communicate this clarification of the law. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 30. The need for this clarification has come from Inland Revenue's standard monitoring of how tax laws are being applied in practice. This monitoring is ongoing and will continue once the clarification is in place. Regulatory Impact Statement Over-crediting of imputation credits in excess of foreign investment fund income Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. The problem addressed is a mismatch arising under the tax rules where imputation credits are calculated on the basis of the dividend paid but income tax arises only on the foreign investment fund (FIF) income. This may lead to a resident having excess imputation credits, which they can use to reduce tax on other income, such as salary and wages. Being able to use the imputation credits to offset other income is contrary to the policy behind the imputation rules of alleviating double taxation of New Zealand company profits. The proposed solution will mean that taxpayers will not be able to use excess imputation credits received from interests in Australian companies to offset their tax liability against other income, e.g. salary and wages (only Australian and New Zealand companies are able to attach imputation credits to dividends paid to New Zealand residents). The class of taxpayers likely to be affected is limited - namely New Zealanders with investments in unlisted Australian companies which use the trans-Tasman imputation rules or are part of a trans-Tasman imputation group. No consultation has been undertaken on the proposal. Officials did not wish to draw attention to a gap in the rules which could be taken advantage of, leading to revenue leakage. There are no other significant constraints, caveats and uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis undertaken, other than as set out above. The recommended approaches to the various issues raised do not impose additional costs on businesses, impair private property rights, restrict market competition, reduce the incentives on businesses to innovate and invest, or override fundamental common law principles. Joanna Clifford Programme Manager, Policy Inland Revenue 12 March 2013 1 I I I I mh\\1116..FIF interest Dividend + ICs NZ shareholder Unlisted Aus Co STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. The problem addressed by this RIS is a mismatch arising under the tax rules where imputation credits are calculated on the basis of the dividend paid but income tax arises only on the foreign investment fund (FIF) income. This mismatch means that a resident may have excess imputation credits, which they can use to reduce tax on other income, such as salary and wage income. 2. Under the trans-Tasman imputation rules, an Australian company can maintain an imputation credit account. Any New Zealand tax paid by that company, or by another company in a wholly-owned group comprising Australian and New Zealand companies, will generate imputation credits. These credits can be attached to dividends paid from the Australian company to New Zealand shareholders. 3. The amount of imputation credits that a New Zealand resident receives is calculated on the value of the actual dividend. However, if the Australian company is unlisted, the New Zealand resident will likely be taxed on their shareholding under the FIF rules, which disregard the actual dividend and deem an amount of taxable (FIF) income. If the dividend is of greater value than the amount of FIF income, there may be an over-crediting of imputation credits. That is, the New Zealand shareholder receives imputation credits in excess of the tax liability resulting from their investment in the Australian company. These credits can be used to reduce tax on other income. 4. This is illustrated in the diagram below: L Australia New Zealand Trans-Tasman imputation group 5. The amendment is primarily for base maintenance (i.e. to prevent revenue leakage) so is unlikely to have any implications for fiscal forecasts. It is considered unlikely that many taxpayers will have taken advantage of the loophole in the current rules. 6. If the status quo was retained, excess imputation credits would continue to be used to offset the New Zealand tax liability arising on other income, such as salary and wages. This is contrary to the policy that imputation credits should only alleviate double taxation of company profits. 2 7. The root cause of the problem is that there is an unintended mismatch between the FIF rules and the trans-Tasman imputation rules, which means New Zealand shareholders may receive excess imputation credits that can offset tax on other income, such as salary and wages. OBJECTIVES 8. The objectives are to: a) address a risk to the tax base; and b) ensure that the legislation aligns more closely with the policy, namely that a person with a FIF interest should only be able to use imputation credits against their tax liability to the extent that there is potential double taxation of an amount and cannot use excess credits to reduce tax on other income. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 9. There are two options that may deal with the problem and achieve the objectives: a) a change so that the amount of imputation credits - which are attached to a dividend received from an Australian company - that a resident can use to offset their New Zealand tax is calculated on the basis of the resident's FIF income from that company, where the dividend exceeds the amount of FIF income; or b) a change so that an Australian company can attach imputation credits to a dividend paid to a New Zealand resident shareholder calculated on the basis of the shareholder's FIF income, whether or not the dividend exceeds the amount of FIF income. Option one (preferred option): 10. This option involves preventing a FIF interest holder from using imputation credits in excess of the tax liability on their taxable FIF income. Accordingly, this option would achieve the policy objective of preventing a FIF interest holder from using excess imputation credits against tax on other income, e.g. salary and wages. 11. The amendment is largely for base maintenance and is not expected to have any revenue implications. 12. The impacts of this option are summarised in the table below. Option two: 13. This option involves a change so that an Australian company can attach imputation credits to a dividend paid to a New Zealand resident shareholder calculated on the basis of the shareholder's FIF income, whether or not the dividend exceeds the amount of FIF income. 14. This option is not favoured, as it is broader than is strictly necessary for addressing the problem identified and may therefore have unintended consequences. This is because this option would involve fundamentally changing the existing basis on which companies impute dividends paid to shareholders and could involve significant compliance costs. In particular, 3 an Australian company would need to know details of their shareholders' FIF income to calculate the amount of imputation credits they could attach. 15. The impacts of this option are summarised in the table below. Summary of impacts of options one and two Option Meets Objective? Impacts Net Impact Fiscal/economic impact Administrative/ compliance costs Risks One Yes Tax system Fiscal risk removed by preventing NZ shareholders in Australian companies from having excess imputation credits. No administrative costs. None Improves status quo by removing fiscal risk and not imposing unnecessary compliance costs. Taxpayers May affect closely-held company situation (i.e. may alter distributions from unlisted Australian companies to NZ shareholders). Slightly more than status quo, but less than option two. Two Yes Tax system Fiscal risk removed by preventing NZ shareholders in Australian companies from having excess imputation credits. Likely to have administrative costs because involves fundamental changes to imputation rules, Wider than necessary Unintended consequences because of complexity of redesigning imputation rules. Improves status quo by removing fiscal risk but imposes higher compliance and administrative costs. Taxpayers May affect closely-held company situation (i.e. may alter distributions from unlisted Australian companies to NZ shareholders). Higher compliance costs than option one and status quo. Social, environment or cultural impacts of both options 16. There are no social, environment or cultural impacts to the options. The groups affected by the amendments proposed are taxpayers that have attributing FIF interests in unlisted Australian companies which elect to use the trans-Tasman imputation rules. 4 Net impact of both options 17. The net impact of both options is to remove a significant fiscal risk to the tax base, without causing a negative economic impact for taxpayers. CONSULTATION 18. No public consultation has been undertaken due to the nature of the issue (being base maintenance). The Generic Tax Policy Process recognises that there are some situations where prior consultation may not be appropriate because it may draw attention to gaps in the tax legislation, which could be exploited and cause significant potential revenue leakage. 19. The Treasury and Inland Revenue were the only agencies involved in developing the proposals and carrying out the analysis. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 20. Option one is the preferred option because it is an effective and simple solution. It prevents a significant fiscal risk and achieves the objective of ensuring that imputation credits are used to eliminate double taxation of company profits in line with the policy intent of the imputation regime and preventing any excess imputation credits from being used to reduce the New Zealand tax liability arising on other income, such as salary and wages. 21. Option two is not favoured because, while it also achieves the objective, it is likely to involve significant changes to the existing imputation rules and is broader than necessary to eliminate the mischief identified. In addition, it could involve significant compliance costs on companies. In particular, an Australian company would need to know details of their shareholders' FIF income to calculate the amount of imputation credits they could attach. IMPLEMENTATION 22. The amendment will be implemented through a tax bill this year. The amendment would apply for tax years beginning 1 April 2014. 23. There should be no significant implementation issues with the amendment. Inland Revenue will communicate the change in rules through existing channels, including updating its guides. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 24. There are no specific plans to monitor, evaluate and review the changes under the Income Tax Act 2007 following the changes, given that this is an isolated base maintenance issue. 25. If any detailed concerns are raised, officials will determine whether there are substantive grounds for review under the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). 26. In general, Inland Revenue monitoring, evaluation and review of new legislation takes place under the Generic Tax Policy Process ("GTPP"). The GTPP is a multi-stage tax policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. The final stage in 5 the GTPP is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of the legislation, and the identification of any remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are also built into this stage. In practice, any changes identified as necessary for the new legislation to have its intended effect would generally be added to the Tax Policy Work Programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. 6 Regulatory Impact Statement Bad debt deductions for holders of debt Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) has been prepared by Inland Revenue. The question addressed in this RIS is whether the tax rules that apply to bad debt deductions for holders of fmancial arrangements should be changed in order to: • ensure the tax rules are fair for all taxpayers by allowing them to take bad debt deductions where they would ordinarily be entitled to them on the cessation of the arrangement, but for technical compliance issues; and • protect the integrity of the revenue base by ensuring that taxpayers can only take bad debt deductions equal to the true economic cost incurred. Public consultation was targeted at five external parties (including four representative groups and one tax advisor). These parties were consulted because they either have a strong interest in general tax policy amendments, or an interest in the particular issues. All feedback received supported the proposals for change. Several comments were also made on technical matters (such as the scope of the compliance costs change). The proposed legislative draft has been amended where appropriate. Two specific changes to the tax rules applying to bad debt deductions are recommended. The first change makes the tax rules fairer and reduces compliance costs. This is a taxpayer-friendly change that will make it easier for holders of debt to take deductions in circumstances where they ordinarily should be entitled to them but for technical compliance issues. The second change is a base maintenance measure to ensure that holders of financial arrangements cannot take excessive bad debt deductions. This change aligns the tax rules with the existing policy intent of the bad debt rules and protects the integrity of the revenue base. We propose that the recommended base maintenance change applies from when the tax bill containing the changes is introduced. This change will be subject to a retrospective claw-back rule that will require taxpayers who have taken excess deductions (that is, deductions for more than the economic cost), to return those amounts as income in the 2014-15 year. The effect of this rule is that the change will be retrospective for financial arrangements that are in existence in the 2014-15 year, but any tax payable will be prospective. This rule is necessary to protect the revenue base. The Treasury has been consulted and agrees with the contents of this statement. There are no key gaps or dependencies, assumptions, significant constraints, caveats or uncertainties concerning the analysis. None of the policy options considered impair private property rights, restrict market competition, impose additional compliance costs, or override fundamental common law principles. oanna Clifford Programme Manager, Policy Inland Revenue 12 March 2013 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. A financial arrangement is an arrangement under which a person receives money in consideration for providing money to any person at a future time, or on the occurrence or non- occurrence of a future event. A simple example is shown below: A — lender/creditor (holder of the financial arrangement) A lends B $1,000 principal B is required to pay back the $1,000 principal plus $100 interest per year B — borrower/debtor (issuer of the financial arrangement) 2. In some situations, the original creditor/holder of the financial arrangement (A) can transfer the financial arrangement to a new creditor/holder (referred to as a "subsequent holder" in this RIS). In these situations, the debtor (B) is required to pay the outstanding interest and principal amounts to the subsequent holder. 3. The financial arrangement rules are separate from the rules for bad debt deductions. A bad debt is a debt where there is no reasonable likelihood that it will be received. In certain circumstances, the bad debt rules allow the creditor (either A or a subsequent holder), to take a deduction for a bad debt where that debt has been written off as bad during the same income year. 4. There is a required process for writing off bad debts arising from financial arrangements. Bad debts for amounts owing under a financial arrangement must be written off before the financial arrangement ends (for instance, by liquidation). This means that if a taxpayer fails to take a bad debt deduction before that time, a bad debt deduction cannot later be taken. 5. The bad debt write-off rules ensure that taxpayers are not taxed on amounts which may have been derived and included as assessable income, but are never actually received. If deductions for bad debts were not allowed, taxpayers would pay too much income tax because they would be assessed on income which substantively was not received. 6. The questions addressed in this RIS are whether the tax rules that apply to bad debt deductions for holders of financial arrangements should be changed in order to: • ensure the tax rules are fair for all taxpayers by allowing them to take bad debt deductions where they would ordinarily be entitled to them on the cessation of the arrangement, but for technical compliance issues; and 0 protect the integrity of the revenue base by ensuring that taxpayers can only take bad debt deductions equal to the true economic cost incurred. Issue 1: Compliance 7. The first issue with the current tax rules is that the strict technical criteria for taking a bad debt deduction are unnecessarily onerous. This gives rise to unfair results and high compliance costs for certain creditors. 8. Currently, the tax rules require that where a borrower (debtor) goes into liquidation or bankruptcy, the creditor can take a bad debt deduction only if the debt was written off as bad in the same income year, and before the liquidation or bankruptcy took place. This requirement can be unnecessarily onerous for certain creditors (particularly small "mum and dad" investors in failed finance companies), as it means they would need to have up-to-date knowledge of the financial state of the debtor in order to take bad debt deduction in time. In some situations, creditors are not informed of upcoming liquidations or bankruptcies and this means they would need to regularly check the companies register or public listings for updates on the financial stability of debtors. 9. The same strict write-off criteria apply to creditors where the debtor company has entered into a composition with them (for example, where the creditor agrees to accept 70 cents for every dollar owed by the debtor). In these cases, the creditor can take a bad debt deduction only if the debt was written off as bad in the same income year and before the composition took place. Again, the write-off requirement can be unnecessarily onerous for creditors because the timeframe to write off the debt can be short (the period between being informed of the financial difficulties of the debtor and the composition itself). 10. Creditors who fail to write off the bad debt in time (before the debtor is liquidated/bankrupted, or before a debtor company enters into a composition with creditors), will have a tax obligation in respect of accrual income they have never received, or remission income that was never written off. This result is unfair and leads to unnecessarily high compliance costs. 11. Following the recent financial crisis, we have become aware that some investors in failed fmance companies have not always met the required criteria of writing off the bad debt before the finance company (debtor) was liquidated or entered into a composition with its creditors. Theoretically, these taxpayers would have been denied a bad debt deduction they would ordinarily have been entitled to claim. Therefore, in theory, these taxpayers would be adversely impacted if no legislative action is taken. We are unable to quantify the magnitude of this impact because we do not know who exactly is affected. 12. When the bad debt deduction rules came into force, the likelihood of some creditors (including creditors of liquidated companies and bankrupt individuals) being unable to meet the "write off' requirement and the implications of this were not fully identified. Issue 2: Base maintenance 13. The second issue with the current tax rules is that holders of debt can take bad debt deductions for amounts owing even where the holder has not suffered an economic loss. This result is not in line with existing policy for bad debt deductions. It also results in an unjustified timing advantage and presents a risk to the integrity of revenue base. 2 14. For example, it is possible for taxpayers to legitimately carry out a business of buying debts in an attempt to recover as much of the amount owing as possible, and thereby make a profit. Currently, these taxpayers would be able to take a deduction for the amount legally owing under the debt even though the (smaller) amount they paid for the debt reflected the fact that the entire amount was unlikely to be received. These taxpayers are required to return income when the base price adjustment (wash-up calculation) is performed at the end of the financial arrangement. However, we are concerned that taxpayers are able to take bad debt deductions earlier than they should, because it gives them an unjustified timing advantage. To protect the tax base, these inappropriate deductions should not be able to be taken. 15. We are aware of one taxpayer who is currently operating in this area and, under the status quo, there is a risk that other taxpayers will take excess bad debt deductions. OBJECTIVES 16. The objectives are to: O ensure the tax rules are fair for all taxpayers by allowing them to take bad debt deductions where they would ordinarily be entitled to them and O protect the integrity of the revenue base by ensuring taxpayers can only take bad debt deductions equal to the true economic cost incurred. 3 REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 17. To achieve the objectives outlined above, a number of options were considered. Issue 1: Compliance 18. The first issue being considered is that, in some situations, the current strict technical requirements for taking a bad debt deduction are unnecessarily onerous and this gives rise to unfair results (whereby taxpayers are treated as receiving income which was never received). Three options were considered for addressing this issue and these are set out below. Options Does it meet the objectives?

Yes Minimises compliance costs — no need for taxpayers to regularly check the companies register or public listings for updates on the financial stability of the debtor. Increases certainty of tax treatment for taxpayers. None Fairness — easier for taxpayers to take deductions for economic losses which, under current policy settings, they are entitled to. In particular, compliance costs are reduced for "mum and dad" investors who are less likely to have thorough knowledge of their accounting and tax obligations. Overall, taxpayers are not assessed on income which was never received. Fiscally negative, but the fiscal effect is not expected to be large. No material fiscal effect on baselines. We are not in a position to estimate the precise fiscal effect because we do not know exactly how many creditors would be affected, No significant administrative implications. None New deduction provisions will make the legislation more complicated, Given the complexity of the relationship between the current financial arrangement rules and bad debt rules, additional complexity is not desirable. Overall, neutral. While the ability for taxpayers to take automatic deductions where appropriate is positive from a policy perspective, the risk of unnecessarily complicating the financial arrangement tax rules is considered undesirable. IC Retain the status quo. Require holders of debt to meet the current criteria so that the debt must be written off as bad before the debt is remitted, and in the same year that the deduction is sought. No Does not require legislative change. Feedback suggests taxpayers are not complying with the current strict technical requirements, but are already taking deductions considered appropriately deductible from a policy perspective, None (other than fairness and compliance), Fairness — arguably unfair if a bad debt that would ordinarily be deductible is not deductible simply because the write-off criteria were not met in time. If Inland Revenue allows taxpayers to take deductions which are not allowed under current legislation, this could be perceived as unfair. None None The current law requires certain compliance criteria to be met. If the criteria are not amended, there will continue to be uncertainty for taxpayers. Overall, negative. The objectives are not met. While it is arguable that legislative change is not necessary because taxpayers are already taking deductions (in line with the policy intent), the strict technical requirements that should legally be met, and the uncertainty around the current law, is considered real and significant. 5 Issue 2: Base maintenance 19. The second issue being considered is that holders of debt can take bad debt deductions for amounts owing even where the holder has not suffered an economic loss. This result is inconsistent with existing policy settings. Three options were considered for addressing this issue: Options Does it meet the objective?

Maintains revenue integrity. Fairness — Addresses the timing advantage that can be obtained under the current bad debt and financial arrangement rules. Increases certainty for taxpayers. Fiscally positive, but insignificant, because it is believed that the majority of taxpayers are correctly applying the law as intended by policy. We are not in a position to estimate the precise fiscal effect because we do not know exactly how many creditors would be affected. There is no material fiscal effect on baselines. No significant administrative implications, None. The (complex) financial arrangements rules generally work well, Amending these rules would add complexity to these rules which may unintention- ally affect other arrangements. Overall, neutral. This option is an improvement on the status quo and the objectives are met. However, the complexity of amending the financial arrangement rules is considered a real and significant risk. 2C Retain the status quo The current legislation is unclear, but it may be possible for bad debt deductions to be taken for more than the cash or economic loss incurred to obtain the debt, No None. Efficiency— If excess deductions can be taken, this could distort behaviour (by providing incentives to invest in financial arrangements rather than other forms of investment), which is inefficient, Fairness — if taxpayers take advantage of the unclear legislation by taking deductions for excess amounts, this would be viewed as unfair, because the deductions are not justified. There is a risk that if a base maintenance change is not made, and taxpayers take deductions for more than their economic loss, this could result in a potentially significant, fiscal loss and a risk to the revenue base. We are not in a position to estimate the precise fiscal effect because we do not know exactly how many creditors would be affected. None. Revenue integrity — if no legislative change is made, there is a risk to the tax base because taxpayers may take deductions that are not justified. Overall, negative. This option is not an improvement on the status quo and the objectives are not met. It can be argued that legislative change is not required because the majority of taxpayers are already interpreting the legislation purposively, in line with the policy intent. However, this is a base maintenance measure, and if legislative change is not made, there is a potential risk to the revenue base, potentially distortions in behaviour and perceived unfairness. 7 Application dates Compliance change 20. We recommend the change which addresses the compliance issue applies from the 2008-09 year. The application date should be retrospective for reasons of fairness, so that investors are not assessed on income which was never received. Taxpayers who will benefit from this change are most likely to be investors in failed finance companies ("mum and dad" investors). The proposed change needs to be retrospective to enable investors to take bad debt deductions for amounts owed following, for example, a finance company going into liquidation or entering into compositions with creditors, otherwise investors would be faced with a tax liability even if they have not received any income. The 2008-09 year was selected on the basis that it would be sufficient to assist affected taxpayers. Base maintenance change 21. We also recommend that the base maintenance change applies from when the tax bill containing the proposed changes is introduced, and that there be a retrospective claw-back rule to require taxpayers who have taken excess deductions (that is, deductions exceeding the cost of acquisition and any income returned), to return those amounts as income in the 2014-15 year. The effect of the claw-back rule is that the rule is retrospective for financial arrangements that are in existence in the 2014-15 year, and affected taxpayers must return extra income prospectively (in the 2014-15 year). We consider that this is justified because it puts them back in the same position they should be in, in line with the policy intent. There is no concern with financial arrangements that have ended prior to the 2014-15 year, as the base price adjustment (wash-up calculation) that would have been performed should have squared- up any excess deductions taken. 22. The benefit that taxpayers get under the current rules is a timing advantage. If the claw-back rule did not apply, the correct result would be reached when the base price adjustment (wash-up calculation) is performed at the end of the arrangement. However, it is possible for taxpayers to drag out financial arrangements so that a base price adjustment is performed much later than appropriate. This application date ensures that when taxpayers have inappropriately taken excess deductions, unknown to Inland Revenue, the advantage obtained for any existing financial arrangements is reversed by requiring the excess amounts to be returned as income. It is also recommended that a savings provisions apply for taxpayers who are, at the date of introduction of the tax bill, involved in assessments subject to the tax disputes process. CONSULTATION 23. In September 2012, targeted consultation was undertaken with five external parties; four representative organisations and an external tax advisor. We consulted with these parties because they either have a strong interest in general tax policy amendments, or have an interest in the particular issues. 24. Four of the consulted parties provided feedback, and all four supported the options lA and 2A. 8 25. Three parties provided feedback on the application dates of the proposed legislative changes. All three submitted that the compliance change should apply on a retrospective basis, and the base maintenance change should apply on a prospective basis. These submissions were partially accepted, as described below: O For pragmatic reasons, the compliance costs change is retrospective only to the 2008-09 year. o The base maintenance change will apply prospectively, but also claw-back excess deductions that have been taken. The effect of the claw back is that the base maintenance rule is retrospective for relevant financial arrangements that are in existence in the 2014- 15 year, but any tax payable is prospective. It is not anticipated that a large number of taxpayers will be affected by the claw-back rule; however, it is necessary for base maintenance reasons. The reason for the claw-back rule is that, notwithstanding the current legislative wording, it is not considered reasonable for taxpayers to take deductions for more than their economic loss under the financial arrangement. There will be a savings provision for taxpayers who are involved in assessments that are subject to the disputes process. This will mean that, as at the introduction date of the bill, disputes will continue as per the regular process and will not be subject to the retrospective claw back of excess deductions. The claw-back rule will still apply to excess deductions taken by taxpayers who are not in the disputes process at the date the tax bill is introduced. 26. Three parties provided feedback on the technical detail of the proposed changes. The technical matters raised are discussed below. Consulted party Technical comments raised by submitters Proposed response to technical comments raised 1 Technical change 1: Extend situations where compliance costs change should apply (for Insolvency Act and other jurisdictions). The compliance costs change should extend, not only to debts remitted by law under the Companies Act 1993, but also to debts remitted by law under the Insolvency Act 2006, or the laws of a country or territory other than New Zealand. It appears that the submitters have requested these additional operations of law to reflect the wording of the provision in the financial arrangement rules that deals with debts remitted by law. This technical change was accepted and the draft legislation will be amended to meet this result. Officials considered it appropriate to align the wording in the two sets of provisions even though they did not consider the change strictly necessary (as creditors of bankrupt individuals should be able to meet the current bad debt criteria). 2 Technical change 2: The compliance costs change should extend to situations where the debt has been remitted when the debtor company is released from making all remaining payments by a deed or agreement of composition with the creditors in the income year (for example, where the creditor agrees to accept 70 cents for every dollar owed). This technical change was accepted and the draft legislation will be amended to meet this result. Officials agreed that, in certain situations where there has been a composition with creditors, an automatic bad debt deduction should be allowed. 3 Technical change 1, described above. Technical change 3: For tax purposes, capitalised interest (interest which has been added to the original capital), should be separated into interest and principal. This technical change was accepted and the draft legislation will be amended to meet this result. Technical change 3 was not accepted. Inland Revenue has a longstanding practice of treating capitalised interest as being paid to the investor and reinvested. Officials do not consider it appropriate to 9 change this practice because capitalised interest is a close substitute for an investor receiving interest and then reinvesting it themselves. If the tax treatment of capitalised interest was amended this would treat similar transactions differently, which would be inequitable. Further, there would be a fiscal cost in doing so. 4 No technical comments raised. Noted 5 No feedback received. 27. As part of accepting technical change 1, a related change should be made for the use of losses after bankruptcy to correct a previous oversight in the tax rules. Currently, when a debtor is released from a financial arrangement debt on discharge from bankruptcy, they can use the losses arising from the financial arrangement debt to offset post-bankruptcy income. From a policy perspective, the debtor should not be entitled to use pre-bankruptcy losses to offset post-bankruptcy income. This correct policy result is the rule that applies to non- fmancial arrangement debt remitted on discharge from bankruptcy, and the rule for financial arrangement debt should align with this. 28. The Treasury has been consulted in the policy proposals and the preparation of this RIS, and agrees with its contents. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 29. The recommended options to address the two issues are 1A and 2A. These options involve: o Amending the current strict technical requirements in the bad debt deduction rules to enable taxpayers to more easily take a bad debt deduction where the debt has been remitted by law, such as by liquidation or bankruptcy; or where the debtor company entered into a composition with creditors. This will remove the strict technical compliance requirements in certain cases and thereby make the tax rules fairer. and o Amending the bad debt deduction tax rules by limiting the deductions that can be taken to the economic loss (subject to an anti-avoidance measure to limit the deductions being taken to the real money at risk). This will protect the integrity of the revenue base by ensuring taxpayers can only take bad debt deductions equal to the true economic cost incurred. 30. Both options meet the objectives and are an improvement on the status quo because the positive impacts identified are considered to outweigh the risks. IMPLEMENTATION 31. No implementation risks have been identified. We consider that implementation can be managed within existing systems and there would be no other significant administrative issues. The changes will be communicated by updating Inland Revenue publications, and 10 advising Inland Revenue staff, tax agents, large enterprises and businesses of the changes. A Tax Information Bulletin item will be published when the legislation is passed. This will fully explain the new rules for taxpayers. 32. Enforcement of the proposed changes will be managed by Inland Revenue as business as usual and there will be no specific enforcement strategy required. There are no transitional arrangements required. It is proposed that any legislative change would be included in the tax bill expected to be introduced in April 2013. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 33. There are no plans to monitor, evaluate and review the changes after they become law. This is because the reforms align the current rules with existing policy and the approach generally adopted in practice. If any specific concerns are raised, officials will determine whether there are substantive grounds for review under the Generic Tax Policy Process. Also, the Income Tax Act 2007 is subject to regular review by officials. As per the normal process, there will be an opportunity for submissions to be made on the proposed changes during the select committee stage of the tax bill that any legislative change is contained in.

Regulatory Impact Statement Further Canterbury earthquake tax measures Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) has been prepared by Inland Revenue. As a result of the Canterbury earthquakes, a number of changes to tax legislation were made in 2011 and 2012. This RIS provides an analysis of options to ensure the existing tax measures work as intended, as taxpayers have begun to receive insurance or compensation payments and commenced rebuilding. The key policy objective behind the existing measures is to ensure the tax rules do not over-tax insurance proceeds or unnecessarily bring forward future tax liabilities for taxpayers affected by the earthquakes. A further objective has been to ensure that the tax rules do not produce unfair results and that they assist recovery and rebuilding in the Canterbury region. The particular questions addressed, in the context of these policy objectives, are: 1. Should the current 2015-16 time limit for a number of Canterbury earthquake-specific tax measures be extended, bearing in mind the pace of the rebuild? 2. How should the existing policy of providing relief to taxpayers with unanticipated tax liabilities from destroyed buildings and other assets be maintained when taxpayers reinvest in Canterbury jointly with other investors, i.e. through multiple owners pooling together to invest in large building complexes? Inland Revenue consulted on most of the proposed policy responses with tax practitioners familiar with the issues faced by taxpayers within the Canterbury region, including all of the large accounting firms and the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants. Consultation has also been undertaken with the Treasury and CERA. Further modifications were made to the final proposals in response to feedback received. The amendments proposed do not affect the fiscal baselines because they relate to what would otherwise be an unanticipated windfall tax revenue gain for the Government (such as depreciation recovery income arising from insurance proceeds). There are no other significant constraints, caveats and uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis undertaken. The recommended approaches to the various issues raised do not impose additional costs on businesses, impair private property rights, restrict market competition, reduce the incentives on businesses to innovate and invest, or override fundamental common law principles. Peter Frawley Policy Manager, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 30 May 2013 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. As a result of the Canterbury earthquakes, a number of changes to tax law were made in 2011 and 2012. These measures included deferring recognition of depreciation recovered in respect of certain assets (“roll-over relief’), and rules to smooth the timing of income recognition for insurance proceeds received for damaged assets. 2. The key policy objective behind the existing measures is to ensure the tax rules do not over-tax insurance proceeds or unnecessarily bring forward future tax liabilities for taxpayers affected by the earthquakes. A further objective has been to ensure that the tax rules do not produce unfair results and that they assist recovery and rebuilding in the Canterbury region. 3. Further tax issues have been identified as the Canterbury recovery plans have developed and the rebuild has commenced. These issues largely relate to ensuring that the existing tax measures work as intended in the context of the rebuilding activity taking place in Canterbury, rather than with providing additional “special relief’ measures. 4. Two key issues have been identified: I. Extending the 2015-16 time limit for Canterbury earthquake tax measures 5. Tax measures introduced to address Canterbury earthquake-specific issues are due to expire at the end of the 2015-16 income year. This time limit was chosen to align with the date that CERA’s special powers expire and with little knowledge of the pace of the rebuild and for how long the measures would be required. The relevant tax measures are: • provision allowing unanticipated depreciation recovery income to be deferred by being rolled over into cost base of replacement asset (“depreciation roll-over relief’) (s EZ 23B); • roll-over relief for buildings and land on revenue account (s CZ 25); • timing rules for smoothing income and deductions/disposal losses when insurance proceeds are received for depreciable assets (ss EZ 23G-F); • provision regarding assets that are uneconomic to repair (s EZ 23C); • provision capping depreciation recovery income arising under s EE 52 (s EZ 23D); • amendment to the “available for use” depreciation rule (s EZ 23E); • provision allowing deduction of expenses where income-earning activity was temporarily interrupted (s DZ 20); and • provision allowing adjustment to assets under thin-capitalisation rules (s FZ 7). 6. As it is taking taxpayers longer to settle insurance claims and replace damaged property than first anticipated, the issue of extending the 2015-16 time limit has been raised. II. Extension of depreciation roll-over relief to joint investment situations 7. A Canterbury-specific rule was introduced in 2011 to allow the deferral of the claw-back of depreciation that ordinarily arises when insurance proceeds are received for items of depreciable property that have been irreparably damaged in an earthquake. It works by rolling over the depreciation recovery income to reduce the acquisition cost of replacement depreciable property. 1 8. The purpose of the rollover relief is to defer any unanticipated tax liability resulting from the destruction of insured depreciable assets in the earthquakes, and to assist the rebuilding in Canterbury. 9. When capital assets (buildings, plant and machinery) are purchased, there is no income tax deduction for that expenditure. However, depreciation is deductible while the asset is available for business use. Depreciation is an estimate of the decline in value of an asset as it is used to earn income. When an asset is sold or destroyed, the actual decline in value of the asset becomes clear. If the asset is sold for less than its depreciated tax value (tax book value), that loss is generally deductible since it demonstrates that depreciation was underestimated. If an asset is sold for more than its tax book value, then the depreciation deducted over the life of the asset was overestimated and the excess depreciation (the difference between the tax book value and the sales proceeds) is included as income. This is a clawing back of excess depreciation previously allowed and is known as “depreciation claw-back” or “depreciation recovery”. 10. Many income-producing assets are insured. In these cases, assets are deemed to be sold for the value of any insurance proceeds received. If the insurance proceeds exceed an item’s tax book value, any excess depreciation is clawed back as income. 11. The Canterbury earthquakes triggered an unanticipated tax liability for a significant number of taxpayers who owned depreciable assets. The purpose of the existing depreciation roll-over relief rule is to relieve this unanticipated tax liability. 12. The current depreciation roll-over relief is designed on the basis that the person who owned the damaged asset is the same person who will purchase the replacement asset. However, we understand that reinvestment in Canterbury is occurring through multiple owners pooling together to invest in large building complexes - this is partly because of CERA’s requirements for the minimum size of new developments in the central city area, and also because of practical design issues, for example, with building foundations. 13. The current roll-over relief rule does not allow taxpayers who reinvest jointly to access roll-over relief, which means that such taxpayers continue to face an unexpected tax liability for their damaged depreciable assets. OBJECTIVES I. Extending the 2015-16 time limit for Canterbury earthquake tax measures 14. The objectives are to: a) Ensure that the time limit for various Canterbury earthquake tax measures introduced in 2011 and 2012 is extended, to take into account that some taxpayers may not have replaced their damaged assets or settled with their insurance companies by the end of the 2015/16 income year. b) Ensure that tax relief is provided only to those taxpayers who are genuinely committed to reinvesting in Canterbury, to assist in the recovery and rebuilding of Canterbury in accordance with the wider objectives outlined in paragraphs 1 and 2. 2 15. The objectives are to: c) Extend the existing depreciation roll-over relief provision to ensure it is accessible to taxpayers seeking to rebuild in Canterbury but who are required to pool with other investors to invest in large building complexes. This necessity to pool with others is partly because of CERA’s requirements for the minimum size of new developments in the central city area, and also because of practical design issues, for example, with building foundations. d) Ensure the original policy intent behind depreciation roll-over relief is maintained, namely, ensuring taxpayers do not have an unexpected tax liability in relation to assets destroyed by the earthquakes and assisting in the rebuilding of Canterbury. 16. The outcomes are subject to a time constraint; any amendments must be enacted reasonably promptly and before the current 2015-16 deadline. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS I. Extension of the 2015-16 time limit for Canterbury earthquake tax measures 17. There are four options that may deal with the problem and achieve the objectives: 1. Extending the time limit by 3 years to 2018-19 combined with requiring taxpayers who wish to access depreciation roll-over relief for buildings to show a firm commitment to rebuilding by the end of the existing 2015-16 time limit (preferred option). This option involves requiring taxpayers to show a substantive commitment by the end of 2015/16 to reinvesting in Canterbury in order to access the extension of depreciation roll-over relief for the 2016-17 to 2018-19 income years. Such commitment could be demonstrated by, for example, applying for the relevant regulatory or planning consents by the end of 2015-16. 2. Extending the time limit by 3 years to 2018 -19; 3. Extending the time limit by a longer period, such as 5 years; 4. Extending the time limit combined with loosening the requirement in the existing depreciation roll-over relief rule that a taxpayer must complete the acquisition of any replacement property by the end of the 2018-19 income year, e.g. by replacing the requirement to “acquire” replacement property by a lesser form of commitment, such as partial construction by the end of the time limit. II. Extension of depreciation roll-over relief to joint investment situations 3 Option Im pacts 1. Extending the time limit by 3 years combined with requiring taxpayers to show a firm commitment to rebuilding by the end of the existing 2015-16 time limit (preferred option). This option meets the objectives of providing more time for taxpayers to replace their damaged assets without facing unexpected and/or unfair tax consequences and ensuring tax relief is provided only to those who are committed to reinvesting, in order to facilitate the recovery and rebuilding of Canterbury. Improves status quo by providing tax relief for a longer period. 2. Extending time limit by 3 years. This option meets the objective of providing more time for taxpayers to settle with their insurance companies and replace their damaged assets without facing unexpected and/or unfair tax consequences but does not meet the objective of ensuring tax relief is provided only to those who are committed to reinvesting. Improves status quo by providing tax relief for a longer period. 3. Extending time limit for a longer period. As above but for a longer period. Officials consider it is preferable to have a slightly shorter time period to incentivise investors to rebuild sooner rather than later. Improves status quo by providing tax relief for a longer period. 4. Extending time limit combined with loosening current rule that requires a taxpayer to construct or purchase any replacement property by the end of the 2018-19 income year. As above but may introduce some uncertainty into the current rules. Social, environment or cultural impacts o f all options 18. There are no social, environment or cultural impacts to the options considered to address any of these issues. The groups affected by the amendments proposed are taxpayers that have assets damaged by the Canterbury earthquakes. Net impact of all options 19. The net impact of all options is to extend the period for which various tax measures apply to taxpayers affected by the Canterbury earthquakes, taking into account the pace of the rebuild. 4 II. Extension of depreciation roll-over relief to joint investment situations 20. There are a number of options that may deal with the problem and achieve the objectives: Option one Depreciation recovery income remains with the original owner of the damaged building. Depreciation recovery income crystallises when: i. the original owner exits the joint investment entity or goes into liquidation or bankruptcy; or ii. the replacement asset is disposed of. The amount of depreciation recovery income that an investor can defer should be proportionate to the ratio of their share of the cost of the replacement asset compared with the original cost of their destroyed asset (Preferred option). Option two Depreciation recovery income remains with the original owner. Any depreciation recovery income is spread over a specified period, e.g. five years, instead of being taxed upfront. A minimum level of investment applies. (Amortisation) Option three Depreciation recovery income is transferred to the new joint investment entity and rolled into the cost base of the replacement asset. Any depreciation recovery income crystallises when: i. the associated person decides not to acquire more replacement property; ii. the association between the original owner and the person acquiring the replacement is broken; iii. the original owner or associated person goes into liquidation or becomes bankrupt; or iv. a person who is not associated with the original owner acquires an interest in the replacement. (Associated investors) Option four Combination of options 2 and 3: i. When the original owner re-invests with associated persons, option 3 applies. ii. Where an original owner reinvests with non-associated persons, the treatment under option 2 applies. (Combination) 5 21. The impacts of these options are summarised in the table below. Summary o f impacts o f options one and two Option Meets Object ive? Impacts Net Impact Fiscal/economic impact Administrative/ compliance costs Risks One (Preferred option) YesTax system No fiscal implications. May assist in reinvestment in Canterbury by deferring tax liability. No administrative costs. None Improves status quo by extending depreciation roll-over relief. Simpler to design and comply with than other options. Taxpayers May act as a barrier to the winding-up of companies (i.e. they may be kept in existence solely to preserve relief). However, probably only an issue where company has non-taxable capital gains. Less than status quo and other options considered. None Two (Amortisation) YesTax system No fiscal implications. May assist in reinvestment in Canterbury by deferring tax liability. Unlikely to have administrative costs. None Improves status quo by providing some depreciation roll-over relief but imposes higher compliance costs than preferred option. TaxpayersProvides some depreciation roll-over relief but may be much less than under existing roll-over relief. Higher compliance costs than option one and status quo. Taxpayers would need to spread their depreciation recovery income over the correct period. Three (Associated investors) YesTax system No fiscal implications. May assist in reinvestment in Canterbury by deferring tax liability. Unlikely to have administrative costs. May be hard to monitor compliance. Improves status quo by extending depreciation roll-over relief to joint investment situations but imposes higher compliance costs than preferred option. TaxpayersMay be complex to apply in practice when there are a number of investors, as would reduce cost base of new asset. Higher compliance costs than option one and status quo. May be complex to apply. Four (Combination) YesTax system No fiscal implications. May assist in reinvestment in Canterbury by deferring tax liability. Unlikely to have administrative costs. May need to monitor whether correct rule is being used by a taxpayer - two different taxpayers in similar situations may be subject to different rules because of investment structure used. Improves status quo by extending depreciation roll-over relief to associated investor situations and providing limited relief in other joint investment situations. Imposes higher compliance costs than preferred option. TaxpayersMay impact on investment structures used as extent of roll-over relief depends on how investment structured. Higher compliance costs than option one and status quo. Taxpayers’ relief would depend on investment structure used. 6 22. There are no social, environment or cultural impacts to the options considered to address any of these issues. The groups affected by the amendments proposed are taxpayers that have assets damaged by the Canterbury earthquakes. Net impact of all options 23. The net impact of all options is to extend roll-over relief for depreciation recovery income to investors who reinvest in Canterbury through pooling with other investors. CONSULTATION 24. The issues addressed by these amendments have been discussed with tax practitioners dealing with Christchurch-based clients. These practitioners also suggested solutions to the specific issues they were seeing in Canterbury, which have been incorporated into the proposed amendments. 25. Consultation was undertaken through a letter containing proposals circulated to interested parties. This group included representatives from all of the large accounting firms, and the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants’ tax advisory group. Written feedback was received from five firms, and officials also met or held telephone conferences with practitioners. Modifications were made to the options outlined above in response to feedback received from consultation. 26. CERA and the Treasury were consulted in the development of the proposals. Summary of feedback 27. The key feedback received was the need for simplicity, certainty and flexibility in the design of the rules. I. Extension of the 2015-16 time limit for Canterbury earthquake tax measures 28. Submitters unanimously supported the proposal to extend the time limit by three years, until the end of the 2018-19 income year. A few submitters suggested that this time limit could be reviewed closer to the end of 2018-19 to determine if a further extension is required. At this stage, there is no intention of reviewing the 2018-19 time limit unless a compelling reason to do so presents itself. 29. One submitter suggested that there should be some flexibility in the time limit, for example, by allowing taxpayers to apply to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue for an extension of time where they can show they will not complete rebuilding by the end of the 2018/19 income year. However, officials consider a problem with this approach is that it would place Inland Revenue in the position of assessing taxpayers’ development plans, for which it does not have the relevant expertise or resource. 30. The proposal to combine an extension of the 2015-16 time limit with tightening the level of commitment that a taxpayer is required to demonstrate before being eligible to access Social, environment or cultural impacts o f all options 7 depreciation roll-over relief for buildings was not consulted on due to time constraints. However, tax practitioners and taxpayers will have the opportunity to comment on this proposal through the select committee process. 31. A related issue was replacing the requirement in the existing depreciation roll-over relief rule that replacement property be “acquired” by the end of the time limit. Submitters generally favoured a lower threshold such as taxpayers having to show a “definitive commitment”, such as entering into a binding contract and incurring some expenditure by the time limit. However, officials consider this might introduce more uncertainty into the current depreciation roll-over relief rule, e.g. taxpayers could be rolling depreciation recovery income into the cost base of a replacement asset without knowing its cost base with any certainty. II. Extension of depreciation roll-over relief to joint investment situations 32. A number of comments were received on proposals to extend roll-over relief to joint investment situations. a. Extending roll-over relief to all qualifying joint investment situations (preferred option) 33. There was general support for this approach as being fairer, simpler and more comprehensive than other options. One issue noted was the requirement that the original tax liability remain with the investor (rather than being transferred to the new entity undertaking the reinvestment) may act as a barrier to the winding up of companies (i.e. they may be kept in existence solely to preserve roll-over relief). However, this is likely to be an issue only where shareholders in a company want to wind up the company to access non-taxable capital gains held in the company. b. Two separate rules - extending roll-over relief to associated investor situations and amortisation over five year period for non-associated investor situations 34. While some submitters supported having two separate rules, others favoured a single rule. They noted (and officials agree) that it is better to have one rule that accommodates different investment structures. In particular, having two rules may create discrepancies in the treatment of different investment structures when, from a policy perspective, the two should be treated equally - for example, two cases where two investors combine to re-invest but in one case, the two investors are associated (e.g. are relatives) and so qualify for more generous treatment. In addition, this option poses a number of complex technical issues that would need to be carefully worked through. 35. In relation to the proposal to have a five year period for spreading depreciation recovery income, submitters generally favoured a ten year period instead. In addition, there was general feedback that a minimum level of investment may not be feasible in practice. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS I. Extension of the 2015-16 time limit for Canterbury earthquake tax measures Option one (three-year extension combined with requiring taxpayers to show a commitment by the end of the 2015-16 income year to rebuilding in order to access depreciation roll-over relief for buildings for the 2016-17 to 2018-19 income years) is the preferred option because it meets the objectives of providing more time for taxpayers to replace their damaged assets without facing unexpected and/or unfair tax consequences and of ensuring tax relief is only provided to those who are substantively committed to reinvesting in Canterbury. 36. This option involves requiring taxpayers to show a substantive commitment by the end of 2015-16 to acquiring a replacement building in Canterbury in order to access depreciation roll-over relief. Commitment could take the form of acquiring the relevant regulatory or planning consents by the end of 2015-16. Another option is that a taxpayer could demonstrate a substantive commitment commercially, such as by entering into binding contracts for the acquisition of a building. 37. This option improves the status quo by reducing compliance costs for taxpayers and providing tax relief for a longer period. The requirement for taxpayers to show a commitment to rebuilding by the end of the 2015-16 year should not impose higher compliance costs, as commitment would be demonstrated through steps that taxpayers need to undertake in the ordinary course of the rebuilding process. 38. Option two (extension by three years) is not favoured, as it would not meet the objective of ensuring tax relief is provided only to those taxpayers who evidence a real commitment to rebuilding in Canterbury. 39. Option three (extension by longer period) is not favoured because, while it also achieves the objective, officials consider it is preferable to have a slightly shorter time period, as it provides an incentive for investors to commence rebuilding sooner rather than later. 40. Option four (extension combined with loosening requirements) is not favoured because it may introduce uncertainty to the rules. II. Extension of depreciation roll-over relief to joint investment situations 41. Option one is the preferred option because it meets the objective of extending depreciation roll-over relief to ensure it is accessible to taxpayers seeking to rebuild in Canterbury but who are required to pool with other investors to invest in large building complexes. In addition, it meets the objective of ensuring that the original policy intent behind depreciation roll-over relief is maintained, namely, ensuring taxpayers do not have an unexpected tax liability in relation to assets destroyed by the earthquakes and assisting in the rebuilding of Canterbury. 42. This option means that depreciation roll-over relief will remain with the original owner of the damaged building. Depreciation recovery income will crystallise when: i. the original owner exits the joint investment entity or goes into liquidation or bankruptcy; or ii. the replacement asset is disposed of. 9 43. The amount of depreciation recovery income that an investor can defer should be proportionate to the ratio of their share of the cost of the replacement asset compared with the original cost of their destroyed asset. For example, a person has depreciation recovery income of $4 million for a destroyed building, which originally cost $5 million. The person reinvests with three other investors into a company which acquires a replacement building at a cost of $30 million. The person’s share of the cost is 10 per cent, i.e. $3 million. The amount of depreciation recovery income they could defer would be: $3m/$5m x $4m = $2.4 million. The remaining $1.6 million would be taxable. 44. The other options are not favoured as, while they would achieve the policy objective of extending depreciation roll-over relief provision to ensure it is accessible to taxpayers seeking to rebuild in Canterbury through joint investments, they are likely to be complex to apply and impose relatively higher compliance costs on taxpayers. IMPLEMENTATION 45. The amendment will be implemented through a Supplementary Order Paper to the Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Bill this year. The amendment would apply for the 2010-11 income year and subsequent income years. 46. There should be no significant implementation issues with the amendment. Inland Revenue will communicate the change in rules through existing channels to taxpayers (such as the Tax Information Bulletin) and tax agents, including updating its guides. 47. Extending the time limit and extending depreciation roll-over relief will assist in reducing compliance costs to Canterbury taxpayers. The preferred options are targeted to resolve particular technical issues which have arisen because of the specific circumstances of the Canterbury earthquakes. Applying for depreciation roll-over relief is optional and applies only in limited circumstances and/or for a limited time period. Therefore, the potential impact should be confined to a relatively small group of taxpayers. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 48. Monitoring, evaluation and review of the extension of the time limit for Canterbury earthquake tax measures will be undertaken closer to the end of the proposed 2018-19 deadline. 49. There are no specific plans to monitor, evaluate and review the extension of depreciation roll-over relief to joint investment situations - however, we anticipate receiving informal feedback from tax practitioners familiar with the tax issues in Canterbury on the effectiveness of the measure. If any detailed concerns are raised, officials will determine whether there are substantive grounds for review under the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). 50. In general, Inland Revenue monitoring, evaluation and review of new legislation takes place under the Generic Tax Policy Process. The GTPP is a multi-stage tax policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. The final stage in the GTPP is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of the legislation, and the identification of any remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are also built into this stage. In practice, any changes identified as necessary for 10 the new legislation to have its intended effect would generally be added to the Tax Policy Work Programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. 11
1 14 August 2013 A special report from Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue Lease inducement and lease surrender payment measures in the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2013 This special report provides early information on the land-related lease inducement and lease surrender payment amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007, contained in legislation introduced in the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill and enacted on 17 July 2013. This special report precedes coverage of the new legislation that will be published in a Tax Information Bulletin later this year. Land-related lease inducement and lease surrender payments Sections CC 1B, CC 1C, DB 20B, DB 20C, EA 3, EI 4B and YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 The tax treatment of land-related lease inducement and lease surrender payments has been reformed for income tax purposes. Lease inducement and lease surrender payments are treat ed as taxable income to the recipient and deductible to the payer under the Income Tax Act 2007. The reforms are intended to make the tax treatment of lease-related payments fairer and more efficient for businesses, by removing a tax advantage that under the previous rules had the effect of distorting business decisions on leases. Background The New Zealand tax system generally maintains the capital-revenue boundary: capital receipts are generally not taxed, whereas revenue receipts are taxed. The boundary, however, became problematic in the context of certain land-related lease payments. Following the recent economic downturn, arrangements involving lease inducement payments became a popular option for landlords to attract tenants without needing to reduce the rental amounts payable. Lease inducement payments are unconditional lump sum cash payments generally made by landlords to induce tenants to enter into a commercial lease. In the absence of specific provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007, lease inducement payments, for income tax purposes, were characterised differently for a payer and a recipient. They were generally non-taxable to a recipient (tenant) and generally deductible to a payer (a 2 commercial landlord who is in the business of leasing). The capital nature of a lease inducement payment was confirmed by the Privy Council in Wattie. 1 Under the previous rules, the tax treatment of lease inducement payments in a commercial context posed a risk to the tax base. It created an opportunity for taxpayers to substitute tax deductible rent payments with non-taxable cash lease inducement payments. Also, compared with other forms of lease inducements such as a rent-free holiday or a contribution towards fit-out costs, these payments provided a tax advantage which distorted business decisions on leases. To address the revenue risk, an officials’ issues paper, The taxation of lease inducement payments, was released in July 2012, containing a proposal to tax lease induce ment payments. In response to concerns raised in submissions, the Government decided to extend the scope of the reform by including another type of lease payment – lease surrender payments. Lease surr ender payments that are generally made by tenants to landlords to surrender existing lease arrangements were treated differently to lease inducement payments for income tax purposes. They were typically taxable to the recipient (commercial landlord) and non-deductible to the payer (tenant). The latter treatment was confirmed by the Court of Appeal in McKenzies. 2 Lease surrender payments were regarded as “black hole” expenditure to the commercial tenant – that is non-deductible business expenditure. Lea se surrender payments can also be made by landlords to tenants to surrender existing lease arrangements and, in this case, the payments were typically non-taxable to the recipient (tenant) and deductible to the payer (commercial landlord). The lease inducement and lease surrender payment reforms were the first stage of the two- stage reform process for reforming the taxation of land-related lease payments. The second stage of the reform reviewed the overall tax treatment of land-related lease payments, such as lease transfer payments. An officials’ issues paper, The taxation of land-related lease payments, was released in April 2013. Key features The changes fall into two groups. The first group includes amendments relating to the tax treatment of lease inducement payments, namely the charging provision (new section CC 1B), the deduction provision (new section DB 20B), and the timing provision (new section EI 4B). The second group includes amendments relating to the tax treatment of lease surrender payments, namely the charging provision (new section CC 1C) and the deduction provision (new section DB 20C). Under the amendments relating to lease inducement payments:  If a person (the payee) derives an amount as consideration for the agreement by the payee to the grant, renewal, extension, or transfer of a right (the land right) that is a leasehold estate or a licence to use land, the amount is taxable to the payee (new section CC 1B).  A related deduction provision is provided (new section DB 20B). 1 Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Wattie \[1999\] 1 NZLR 529. 2 Commissioner of Inland Revenue v McKenzies New Zealand Limited \[1988\] 2 NZLR 736. 3  A new timing rule allocates the income and deductions from section CC 1B and DB 20B evenly over the period of the land right. An exception applies when the person ceases to hold the relevant land right, or the estate in land from which the land right is granted, during an income year. For income, the remaining amount to be spread under the general timing rule is allocated to that income year. For deductions, the remaining amount to be spread is allocated to that income year if the land right, and the estate in land from which the land right is granted, are not held by the person or an associated person (new section EI 4B). Under the amendments relating to lease surrender payments:  If a person (the payee) derives an amount as consideration for the agreement by the payee to the surrender or termination of a land right (the land right) that is a leasehold estate or licence to use land, the amount is taxable to the payee (new section CC 1C).  A related deduction provision is provided (new section DB 20C).  There is no specific timing rule for lease surrender payments. The general principles and provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007 apply to determine the timing of income and deductions for lease surrender payments. Generally, income and deductions arising from lease surrender payments are allocated to the income year in which an amount is derived or incurred. Application dates The amendments relating to lease inducement payments (new sections CC 1B, DB 20B and EI 4B) apply to an amount that is derived or incurred on or after 1 April 2013 in relation to a lease or licence entered, renewed, extended, or transferred, on or after that date. A lease includes an agreement to a lease. 3 The amendments relating to lease inducement payments do not apply to an amount that is derived or incurred on or after 1 April 2013 in relation to a lease or licence entered, renewed, extended or transferred, before 1 April 2013. 3 The definition of “lease” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 is defined as a disposition that creates a leasehold estate. The definition of “leasehold estate” includes any estate, however created, other than a freehold estate. The definition of “estate” includes both a legal or equitable estate as well as a right to the possession of the land. 4 Example A landlord and a tenant entered into a binding lease agreement on 1 January 2013. The landlord is liable to pay the tenant $100,000 on 1 May 2013 for the agreement to a lease. The lease commences on 1 June 2013. 1 April 2013 1 Jan 2013 1 June 2013 Lease commences Agreement to lease 1 May 2013 Payment The amendments relating to lease inducement payments do not apply to the $100,000 payment derived by the tenant. The lease is entered into before 1 April 2013 even though the payment is derived after the 1 April date. The tax treatment of the $100,000 lease inducement payment is determined under the general principles and provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007. The amendments relating to lease surrender payments (new sections CC 1C and DB 20C) apply to an amount that is derived or incurred on or after 1 April 2013. Detailed analysis Tax treatment of lease inducement payments Income New section CC 1B provides that if a person (the payee) derives an amount as consideration for the agreement by the payee to the grant, renewal, extension or transfer of a land right, the amount is taxable to the payee. The land right must be a right that is a leasehold estate or a licence to use land. The term “leasehold estate” is defined broadly in section YA 1 to include any estate, however created, other than a freehold estate. 4 The charging provision, therefore, does not apply to payments from a freehold estate in land, such as the proceeds from the sale of land. The charging provision applies broadly because it only focuses on the person who receives the payment – the payee. The payer is not relevant. If a person receives a lease inducement payment on behalf of another person, the existing nominee rules in section YB 21 apply to treat the amount as derived by that other person. 4 For income tax purposes, an interest in land has the same meaning as an estate in land. 5 Example Examples of payments that are taxable under section CC 1B include: 1. a payment from a landlord (lessor) to a tenant (lessee); 2. a payment from a tenant (sub-lessor) to a sub-tenant (sub-lessee); or 3. a payment from a tenant (assignor) to a new tenant (assignee). Landlord Tenant Sub-tenant New tenant (assignee) Lease transfer Sub-lease Lease 3. $ 2. $ 1. $ The charging provision does not apply to an amount derived by the payee as the holder of a land right and as consideration for the transfer of the land right to the person paying the amount (section CC 1B(2)). Example A lease transfer payment received by an assignor from an assignee for the assignment of an existing lease is not taxable under section CC 1B. Landlord Tenant (assignor) New tenant (assignee) Lease transfer Lease $ X The reference to “amount” in section CC 1B uses the definition of “amount” in section YA 1, which includes any amount in money’s worth. The charging provision therefore includes consideration other than cash. 6 Note that some land-related lease payments can be subject to more than one income-charging provision in the Income Tax Act 2007. For example, lease premiums are taxable under sec tions CC 1 and CC 1B and contributions for fit-out costs are taxable under sections CC 1B and CG 8. However, the tax treatment of amounts that are already subject to sections CC 1 and CG 8, which relate to income from land or capital contributions respectively, do not change. The amount is included in income only once (section BD 3(6)) and the new timing rule for lease inducement payments in section EI 4B does not apply to an amount that is income under section CC 1 and CG 8 (section EI 4B(2)). Exception for a tenant or a licensee of residential premises An exception for a tenant or a licensee of residential premises applies. The amount is not considered income if the payee is a natural person (individual) and derives the amount as a tenant or licensee of residential premises whose expenditure on the residential premises does not meet the requirements of the general permission. This exclusion is intended to provide a consistent tax treatment of income and deductions for a tenant or a licensee of residential premises. An individual tenant or a licensee of residential premises is not allowed a deduction for payments of rent because they do not meet the general permission in section DA 1 and the private limitation in section DA 2(2). On the other hand, an accommodation provider, who is not a natural person, is subject to section CC 1B because they would typically be allowed a deduction for payments of rent under the general permission. If there is a concurrent use of the land right for residential and business purposes, the amount is apportioned accordingly. The amount relating to business purposes is taxable under section CC 1B to the extent that a tenant or a licensee whose expenditure on the premises is allowed a deduction under the general permission in section DA 1. Deductions New section DB 20B provides that lease inducement payments are deductible to a person (the payer) if the following conditions are met:  a person (the payer) incurs an amount of expenditure as consideration for the agreement by another person (the payee) to the grant, renewal, extension or transfer of a right (the land right) that is a leasehold estate or a licence to use land;  the payer is the person who owns the land right or the estate in land from which the land right is granted; and  the payee is the person who is obtaining the land right. The deduction provision allows deductions for other forms of lease inducements, in particular, contributions for fit-out costs. A consequence of this is that the timing rule for deductions in new section EI 4B (discussed below) applies to these payments. New section DB 20B overrides the capital limitation in section DA 2(1). The general permission in section DA 1 must still be satisfied and the other general limitations in section DA 2 still apply. 7 Timing of income and deductions New section EI 4B is a timing provision for lease inducement payments. The timing provision applies to the amount of income under section CC 1B or deductions under section DB 20B that is derived or incurred in relation to –  a right (the land right) that is a leasehold estate or a licence to use land; and  a period (spreading period). The “spreading period” means a period that:  begins with the commencement, or a renewal or extension, of the land right; and  ends before the earliest following date on which the land right may be terminated, or may expire, if not extended or renewed. In other words, the spreading period is an initial fixed period set either at the grant, renewal or extension of the land right. The rationale for this approach is to avoid complexities around adjusting the spreading period (and relevant income and deduction allocations) when the initial fixed period is later modified, renewed or extended. If there is a payment for a renewal or extension of the land right, the payment is spread over the fixed renewal or extension period because that period is regarded as a separate spreading period. Example 1 A landlord and a tenant enter into a 5-year lease, which includes two 5-year renewal rights. The lease commences on 1 April 2013. On the same day, the tenant receives a lease inducement payment from the landlord. The spreading period of the lease inducement payment, which is subject to sections CC 1B and DB 20B, is from 1 April 2013 (being the commencement date of the lease) to 31 March 2018 (being the earliest following date on which the lease expires). Example 2 Following on from the above example, in March 2018, the tenant decides to renew the lease for another 5 years (from 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2023). In January 2022, there is an oversupply of leases in the market. The tenant wants to move to other premises for a lower rent. Knowing this, the landlord makes a lease inducement payment to the tenant for the renewal of the lease for another 5 years (from 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2028). The tenant renews the lease for another 5 years. The spreading period of the second lease inducement payment is from 1 April 2023 (being the commencement date of the second renewal period) to 31 March 2028 (being the earliest following date on which the lease expires). Although the payment was made in January 2022, the tenant derives the payment in relation to the second renewal period of the lease. Section EI 4B(3)(a) allocates income and deductions for lease inducement payments. The amount of income and deductions is allocated proportionately to the number of months in an income year over the spreading period. 8 Given that lease inducement payments are generally made at the commencement of a land right, the amount is allocated evenly over the spreading period. Even when the amount is derived or incurred before the commencement of the land right, the amount is allocated in relation to the spreading period, not when the amount is incurred or derived. Example On 1 April 2013, a tenant receives $100,000 from a landlord as consideration for the agreement to enter into a 10-year lease that commences on the same day. The tenant and the landlord both have a 31 March balance date. The tenant Under section CC 1B, $100,000 is taxable to the tenant. Under section EI 4B, the income is spread evenly over the 10-year period from the 2013–14 to the 2022–23 income years inclusive (i.e. $10,000 income is allocated to the tenant in each income year). The landlord Under section DB 20B, $100,000 is deductible for the landlord. Under section EI 4B, the deductions are spread evenly over the 10-year period from the 2013–14 to the 2022–23 income years inclusive (i.e. a deduction of $10,000 is allocated to the landlord in each income year). The allocation of income and deductions for lease inducement payments is affected by when the income or expenditure is derived or incurred in relation to the spreading period. For example, if the amount is derived or incurred half-way through the spreading period, the amount is spread evenly over the remaining spreading period. If the amount is derived or incurred at or after the end of the spreading period, the amount is allocated to the income year in which it is incurred or derived. If the spreading period is more than 50 years, the amount is allocated evenly over the first 50 income years (section EI 4B(3)(a)(iii)). Note that, under the timing provision, an amount of expenditure incurred by an assignor to induce an assignee to receive an assignment of a lease is allocated to the income year in which the amount is incurred. By assigning the lease, the assignor has no remaining period over which to spread the expenditure. On the other hand, the assignee spreads the amount of income evenly over the remaining period of the lease. 9 Example On 1 April 2014, a tenant enters into a 10-year lease. However, after three years, the tenant finds that their business is not doing well and finds the lease burdensome. The tenant becomes aware that A Ltd is looking for premises. The tenant is keen for A Ltd to take the lease. On 1 October 2017, the tenant pays $30,000 to A Ltd to transfer the lease from that date. Landlord Tenant (assignor) New tenant (assignee) Lease transfer Lease $ The timing of income and deductions for the tenant and A Ltd under section EI 4B is illustrated in the table below. The tenant and A Ltd have a 31 March balance date. Income year The tenant (assignor) A Ltd (assignee) Deduction Income Deduction Income 2014–15 – – – – 2015–16 – – – – 2016–17 – – – – 2017–18 $30,000 – – $2,308 2018–19 – – – $4,615 2019–20 – – – $4,615 2020–21 – – – $4,615 2021–22 – – – $4,615 2022–23 – – – $4,615 2023–24 – – – $4,615 The timing provision does not apply to an amount that is treated as income under section CC 1 or CG 8, which relate to income from land or capital contributions respectively. Income under section CC 1 is taxable when derived unless the timing rule in section EI 7 applies. Income under section CG 8 is spread evenly over 10 years unless the payee chooses to reduce the cost base of the depreciable property under section DB 64. The following example explains how the timing provision would apply to a contribution towards the cost of a fit-out. 10 Example On 1 April 2013, a tenant receives a lease inducement payment of $100,000 from its landlord to enter into a 12-year lease. The terms and conditions of the agreement require that the tenant must use the payment for a fit-out of their lease premises. The tenant spends a total of $300,000 on its fit-out in the 2013–14 income year. The tenant and the landlord both have a 31 March balance date. The tenant The tenant can either choose to return $100,000 as income over the next 10 years, starting from the 2013–14 income year, or reduce the cost base of the fit-out by $100,000. Under the latter option, the tenant is only able to claim depreciation on the remaining $200,000 of expenditure incurred on the fit-out. The landlord The landlord is allowed a deduction of $100,000 under section DB 20B, which is allocated under section EI 4B over the 12-year period from the 2013–14 to the 2024–25 income years inclusive (i.e. a deduction of $8,333 is allocated to the landlord in each income year). Disposal of the land right part-way through the spreading period An exception applies to the new timing rule if the person ceases to hold the relevant land right or the estate in land from which the land right is granted. Generally, a “wash-up” calculation of income and deductions is allowed if a person ceases to hold the land right or the estate in land from which the land right is granted, part-way through the spreading period (section EI 4B(4) and (5)). For income, if there is a remaining amount to be allocated under the main spreading provision in section EI 4B(3), the amount of income is allocated to an income year (the balance year) ending before the end of the spreading period, if –  at the beginning of the balance year, the person holds the land right or the estate in land from which the land right is granted; and  in the balance year, the person ceases to hold the land right or the estate in land from which the land right is granted (section EI 4B(4)). 11 Example On 1 April 2013, a landlord pays a tenant $100,000 as an inducement to enter into a 10-year lease. On 1 June 2016, the tenant transfers the lease to a new tenant. Both the landlord and the tenant have a balance date of 31 March. The $100,000 payment is taxable to the tenant under section CC 1B and deductible to the landlord under section DB 20B. Landlord Tenant (assignor) New tenant (assignee) Lease transfer Lease $100K The timing of income for the tenant under section EI 4B(4) is illustrated in the table below: Income year Tenant Deduction Income 2013–14 – $10,000 2014–15 – $10,000 2015–16 – $10,000 2016–17 – $70,000 2017–18 – – 2018–19 – – 2019–20 – – 2020–21 – – 2021–22 – – 2022–23 – – The landlord continues to allocate the $100,000 deduction under the main spreading provision in section EI 4B(3). For deductions, if there is a remaining amount to be allocated under the main spreading provision in section EI 4B(3), the amount of deductions is allocated to an income year (the balance year) ending before the end of the spreading period if –  at the beginning of the balance year, either or both the land right and the estate in land from which the land right is granted are held by the person or an associated person; and  at the end of the balance year, neither of the land right and the estate in land from which the land right is granted are held by the person or an associated person (section EI 4B(5)). Note that if the land right or the estate in land from which the land right is granted is transferred to an associated person, no “wash-up” calculation for deductions is allowed. The 12 remaining amount of deductions continues to be allocated over the spreading period under section EI 4B(3). This is intended as an anti-avoidance measure to prevent the timing of deductions being accelerated by transferring the land right or the estate in land from which the land right is granted to an associated person. The definition of “land provision” in section YA 1 has been amended so that the definition of “associated person” applying in section EI 4B is the one applicable to land provisions. Example On 1 April 2013, a landlord pays a tenant $100,000 as an inducement to enter a 10-year lease. On 6 June 2016, the landlord sells the freehold land to an unassociated third party. Both the landlord and the tenant have a balance date of 31 March. Landlord (transferor) Tenant New landlord (transferee) Freehold land transfer 10-year lease $ $100K The $100,000 payment is taxable to the tenant under section CC 1B and deductible to the landlord under section DB 20B. The timing of deductions for the landlord under section EI 4B(5) is illustrated in the table below: Income year Landlord Deduction Income 2013–14 $10,000 – 2014–15 $10,000 – 2015–16 $10,000 – 2016–17 $70,000 – 2017–18 – – 2018–19 – – 2019–20 – – 2020–21 – – 2021–22 – – 2022–23 – – If the landlord had transferred the land to their spouse, the landlord would continue to allocate $10,000 of deductions to each income year until the 2022–23 income year. The tenant continues to allocate the $100,000 amount of income under the main spreading provision in section EI 4B(3). 13 To prevent overlap, section EA 3, which relates to the timing of prepayments, has been amended to exclude any amounts subject to this timing provision. Tax treatment of lease surrender payments Income New section CC 1C provides that if a person (the payee) derives an amount as a consideration for their agreement to the surrender or termination of a right (the land right) that is a leasehold estate or licence to use land, the amount is taxable to the payee. The payee must be one of the following:  the person who owns the estate in land from which the land right is granted; or  the person who owns the land right. In most cases, lease surrender payments are made by a tenant to a landlord to surrender an existing lease. However, the charging provision also applies if the payment is made by the landlord to the tenant for them to surrender an existing lease. Example Examples of payments that are taxable under section CC 1C include: 1. A payment from a landlord (lessor) to a tenant (lessee); 2. A payment from a tenant (lessee) to a landlord (lessor); 3. A payment from a tenant (sub-lessor) to a sub-tenant (sub-lessee); or 4. A payment from a sub-tenant (sub-lessee) to a tenant (sub-lessor). Landlord Tenant Sub-tenant Lease 3. $ 1. $ 2. $ 4. $ Sub-lease If a person receives a lease surrender payment on behalf of another person, the existing nominee rules in section YB 21 apply to treat the amount as derived by that other person. 14 The term “leasehold estate” is defined broadly in section YA 1 to include any estate, however created, other than a freehold estate. 5 The charging provision, therefore, does not apply to an amount derived in relation to a freehold estate in land, such as the proceeds from the sale of land. The reference to “amount” in section CC 1B uses the definition of “amount” in section YA 1, which includes any amount in money’s worth. The charging provision therefore includes consideration that is other than cash. Exception for a tenant or a licensee of residential premises An exception for a tenant or a licensee of residential premises applies. The amount is not income if the payee is a natural person (an individual) and derives the amount as a tenant or licensee of residential premises whose expenditure on the residential premises does not meet the requirements of the general permission. This exclusion is intended to provide a consistent tax treatment of income and deductions for a tenant or a licensee of residential premises. An individual tenant or a licensee of residential premises is not allowed a deduction for payments of rent because they do not meet the general permission in section DA 1 and the private limitation in section DA 2(2). On the other hand, an accommodation provider, that is not a natural person (i.e. they are a company), is subject to section CC 1C because they would typically be allowed a deduction for payments of rent under the general permission. If there is a concurrent use of the land right for residential and business purposes, the amount is apportioned accordingly. The amount relating to a business purpose is taxable under section CC 1C to the extent that a tenant or a licensee whose expenditure on the premises is allowed a deduction under the general permission in section DA 1. Deductions New section DB 20C provides that lease surrender payments are deductible to a person (the payer) if the following conditions are met:  the payer incurs an amount of expenditure as consideration for the agreement by another person (the payee) to the surrender of a leasehold estate or the termination of a licence to use land;  the payer is a person who owns the land right or a person who owns the estate in land from which the land right is granted; and  the payee is a person who owns the estate in land from which the land right is granted, or a person who owns the land right. Section DB 20C overrides the capital limitation in section DA 2(1). The general permission in section DA 1 must still be satisfied and the other general limitations in section DA 2 still apply. 5 For income tax purposes, an interest in land has the same meaning as an estate in land. 15 Timing of income and deductions No specific timing provision is provided for lease surrender payments. The timing of an amount derived or incurred under sections CC 1C and DB 20C is, therefore, determined under the general provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007. Generally, income and deductions for lease surrender payments are allocated to the income year in which the amount is derived or incurred. This is considered appropriate for lease surrender payments as there would normally be no remaining period of the land right over which the amount can be spread at the time the lease surrender payment is derived or incurred.
1 14 August 2013 A special report from Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue Mixed-use assets Sections CC 1, CW 8B, CX 17, DB 5, DB 7, DB 8, subpart DG, DZ 21 and YA 1 These rules establish a new basis for apportioning deductible expenditure relating to certain assets which are used both privately and to earn income (mixed-use assets). The changes, which follow the original Budget 2011 announcement and subsequent consultation, are aimed at making the rules fairer. Background For most assets, it is straightforward to determine whether expenditure is deductible. If the asset is only used to derive income or used in business, related expenditure will be deductible. 1 If the asset is only used privately (such as a private house or a car) then no deduction is available for related expenditure. 2 Because mixed-use assets combine both private and income earning use in a single asset, difficult questions arise about the appropriate portion of expenditure that will be deductible. The easiest way to explain this is to divide expenditure into “daily amounts”. If a bach is used by its owners for 40 days in a year, and rented out for 25 days in that year, it is clear that:  40 days’ worth of expenditure is not deductible  25 days’ worth of expenditure is deductible. What is not clear is what happens to the expenditure which relates to the 300 days of the year when the asset is not used at all. Under the previous rules, the 300 days when the asset is “available for income-earning use”, also gave rise to deductions. This means the owner would claim deductions for expenditure relating to 325 days, or 89% (325/365) of total expenditure. This was not considered an equitable outcome, given that the asset was used both for income earning and private purposes, and indeed, the principal purpose of acquisition may well have been private. This special report provides early information for interested parties and precedes the coverage of the legislation that will be provided in a forthcoming Tax Information Bulletin. Key features These amendments apply to real property used for short-term accommodation and to boats and aircraft that cost more than $50,000 – collectively called mixed-use assets. T hey establish an apportionment method to determine the deductibility of expenditure associated with them. The 1 Section DA 1, General Permission, Income Tax Act 2007. 2 Section DA 2, General Limitation, Income Tax Act 2007. 2 proportion of expenditure that is now deductible is calculated by dividing the number of days in which the asset was actually used to earn income by the total number of days the asset was actually used (for both purposes). In th e illustration above, this would mean the owner would now be able to claim 38.5% of expenditure (25 days of income earning / 65 days of total use). This is the key rule in these amendments. A number of other changes have also been made to support the apportionment method:  rules to allow asset owners to treat the asset as outside the tax system (no tax on income but no deductions allowed). Owners can opt out of the tax system if the asset has earned gross income of less than $4,000, or where ring-fenced losses (as described below) are generated;  rules which apply where income-earning use of these assets is low (2% or less of asset value) and tax losses are generated. These tax losses cannot be offset against other income, but must be carried forward to future income years. This deals with the difficulty of knowing whether a loss arising from a mixed-use asset is a genuine loss (that should be allowed) or a loss which arises because the apportionment formula has failed to exclude all of the private benefit (which should be denied). This is described as “deduction quarantining”, but is conceptually the same as loss ring-fencing;  rules to deal with interest expenditure for mixed-use assets that are held in company structures. These rules ensure that fair treatment is delivered to assets in these structures compared with individual ownership, so they do not create a situation where people can avoid apportionment of interest expenditure by moving the asset into a company structure. The rules apply to mixed-use assets owned by all forms of entities except companies that are not close companies. Application date The new rules apply to mixed-use assets which are accommodation from the beginning of the 2013– 14 income year. Mixed-use assets which are boats and aircraft are subject to the rules from the 2014– 15 income year. Detailed analysis The key amendment is new subpart DG. It is structured as follows:  Section DG 1 – High-level description of what subpart DG does;  Section DG 2 – Sets up the relations with the rest of the Income Tax Act, and establishes some general rules about the asset by asset basis, group companies and ascertaining voting and market value interests;  Section DG 3 – Details which assets are subject to the rules;  Section DG 4 – Describes what is private use;  Section DG 5 – Defines interest for the purposes of the subpart and points to later sections that apportion it;  Section DG 6 – Extends the associated persons rule to make a person and company associated if the person has a 5% interest in the company, or the shareholding gives them a right to use the asset;  Section DG 7 – Allows certain income-earning expenditure to be fully deductible;  Sections DG 8 and DG 9 – Set out the key apportionment rule; 3  Sections DG 10 to DG 14 – Set out the interest apportionment rules when the mixed-use asset is owned by a company;  Sections DG 15 to DG 19 – Detail the quarantining or loss ring-fencing rules;  Section DG 20 – Sets out the treatment when the mixed-use asset’s income cannot be directly ascertained;  Section DG 21 – Sets out when an owner can treat the asset as outside the tax system (no tax on income, but no deduction allowed); and  Section DG 22 – Deals with assets held for part of the year. Other new sections or amendments are:  New section CW 8B to provide that certain income from mixed-use assets that would otherwise be gross income is exempt income (and section CC 1 is consequentially modified);  Section CX 17, which deals with fringe benefits provided to shareholders, is amended;  The interest deductibility sections in subpart DB are amended and subpart DG overrides them as appropriate;  Section DZ 21 is added to allow for the depreciation roll-over when a mixed-use asset that was owned by a company is transferred to the shareholders; and  The definitions in section YA 1 are amended. Assets subject to the rules Section DG 3 Section DG 3 sets out which assets will be subject to the mixed-use asset rules in an income year. There are three key criteria:  Use  Type of asset  Ownership of asset. Use Section DG 3(1) defines “asset” (referred to as mixed-use assets). The criteria for a mixed-use asset requires the asset to be used to earn income, and also to be used privately. The important concept of private use is discussed in the next section. Additionally, the asset is required to be unused for at least 62 days in the income year or, where the asset is typically only used on working days, unused for 62 working days. Type of asset The new rules only apply to assets which are:  Land (including improvements to land). The rules will typically apply to holiday homes, but city apartments and such like may also fall inside the rules. In particular the rule applies to the provision of short-term accommodation (long term-accommodation is specifically excluded).  Ships, boats and other water craft.  Aircraft. There are two important points to note about these last two categories of mixed-use asset. 4 The mixed-use asset rules only apply to boats and aircraft which have a cost to the person of $50,000 or more, or if they were not acquired at market value, their market value on acquisition was $50,000 or more. The market value rule covers situations where assets are acquired from related parties at less than market value. Where the asset is acquired by a partnership (including a look-through company) it is the cost to the partnership that is relevant, not to the partners. The concepts of “ships, boats or craft” and “aircraft” are not defined. They are intended to have a broad ordinary meaning. In the case of all three categories of assets, for the purposes of these rules, the asset will include any assets which are related to it. So, in the context of a holiday home, items such as the furniture and appliances will be subject to the rules, and in the context of a yacht, items such as the dinghy and the lifejackets will be included. Entities subject to the rules The rules apply to any person claiming deductions in relation to the asset, not just the person who owns it. For example, a person who leases an aircraft, and then uses it personally and rents it out, will be subject to the rules. The rules apply to deductions claimed in all entities other than companies which are not close companies (i.e., the rules do not apply to assets held by companies known as widely held). Exclusions Some assets which meet the above criteria are still excluded from the rules. An asset is excluded if:  The private use is minor and the asset is primarily used in a business which is not a rental or charter business. If the asset is owned by a company, private use creates an obligation to pay FBT or income tax. This excludes circumstances such as a helicopter which is generally used on a farm but is used for say 3% of its operating time for private purposes. “Minor” is undefined for these purposes and bears its ordinary meaning.  It is a residential property which has long-term rental as its only income-earning use. This deals with situations such as when a person’s home which is occupied by them for the first part of the year, remains empty for a period of three months while they work in another part of the country, and then rented out by them as an ordinary residential rental when they decide to remain in that other part of the country long-term.  A similar rule also applies for boats and aircraft which are initially used by the owner and then undergo a change of use, and are rented out after that change of use (the rule also applies to assets which are initially rented out and then used exclusively by the owner following the change of use). An example would be a boat which is used as a private asset for the first part of the year, and then rented out during the second part of the year following the owner’s acquisition of a new boat for private use. 5 Concept of private use Section DG 4 The concept of private use is important to establish whether an asset is a mixed-use asset, because one of the criteria for an asset to be a mixed-use asset is that it is used both to earn income and privately. There are three categories of private use. The first is use of the asset by a natural person (an individual) who is either the person who owns, leases, licenses, or otherwise has the asset. This will cover the simplest situation where the asset is owned by a natural person, and that person uses their own asset. The second is the use of the asset by a natural person who is associated with the person who owns, leases, licenses or otherwise has the asset. The legislation as enacted extends the associated person test by including people who have a voting interest of 5% or more, and those whose share in the company gives them a right to use the asset. Two common situations which this rule will cover are:  The asset is owned by a natural person, and is used by that person’s close relative (see section YB 4).  The asset is owned by a company (or trust or partnership), and used by a natural person who is associated with that company, a trust or partnership (see section YB 3). Use by a person who falls into one of the above categories will constitute private use even if the person uses the asset along with others – such as when the owner stays in the bach along with some of her friends, even if the friends pay market rental. Use by a person who falls into one of the above categories will also constitute private use regardless of any amount paid for the use. However, any amount which is paid will be treated as exempt income (see sections DG 4(6) and CW 8B) which means that it will not be taxable. The use will not be considered income-earning use for the purposes of the apportionment formula, which means that it does not increase the level of deductibility. The third category is where the asset is used by a person who is not associated with the owner, but who pays less than 80% of the market value of that use. Market value is specifically defined in section DG 3(5) for these purposes using the concepts of open market, ordinary terms and arm’s length. It is intended to capture situations such as when an asset is made available to a friend or a person otherwise connected with the owner for a price which is clearly lower than that ordinarily charged to renters with no connection with the owner. It is not intended to capture situations when an asset is rented by an unrelated person at a lower price for reasons such as:  the asset is being rented in an “off-peak” or “quiet” period;  the asset is being rented for a longer period than it is usually rented for; and  the asset is being rented at a reduced price to establish profile or a market share. If the rate the asset is rented for would have been offered to any other person who wanted it for that period or during that time, that will be a market rate. As with payment for the use of an asset by an associate, any amount received which is less than 80% of market value is not required to be returned as income for tax purposes, and use for which less than 6 80% of market value is paid does not constitute income-earning use for the purposes of the apportionment formula. Private use exemptions There are three exemptions which exclude certain use from the definition of “private use”. The first covers situations when the owner uses the asset to earn income in the ordinary course of their business. For example, a person who owns a boat will not be treated as using the boat privately when he or she takes out skippered fishing charters, if that is in the ordinary course of the business. The second exemption covers situations when the owner uses the asset to carry out repairs caused by someone who rented the asset. For example, a bach might be rented to people who damage it. The owner might then need to stay in the bach to repair that damage because the owner lives some way away, and it will take more than one day to repair the damage. The use by the owner to repair the bach will not constitute private use. The third exemption covers situations when the owner uses the asset to relocate it at the beginning or end of a period of hire, the relocation is necessary to enable the hire, and the income derived by the owner directly or indirectly includes an amount for the relocation. Example Mary owns a launch. During the course of an income year, she takes her family out on the launch, she lets her brother use the launch (paying the market rate of $200 per day) and she lets her friend use the launch (paying fuel costs only at the rate of $50 per day). All these uses are instances of private use. The $200 per day which Mary receives from her brother and the $50 per day that Mary receives from her friend are exempt income so not subject to tax. When Mary rents out the launch to non-associates at market rates, takes the launch to another port for rental to non-associates at $250 per day and then back again to the home port, or takes the launch to a boatyard for repair after damage was caused by a non-associate during a rental period, none of these instances is private use. Expenditure which is deductible in full Section DG 7 The primary objective of the new rules is to set in place an apportionment mechanism so that the deductibility of expenditure is determined by the ratio of income-earning use to total use. However, the new rules recognise that there are some items of expenditure that ought to be deductible in full, even though the underlying asset has some private use. The new rules allow expenditure to be deducted in full where:  it relates solely to the use of the asset for deriving income, and either is expenditure from which the person who owns or otherwise has the asset would not reasonably expect to receive a personal benefit (or, when a company owns or otherwise has the asset, no associate of the company would receive a personal benefit); or 7  the expenditure must be incurred to meet a regulatory requirement to use the asset to earn income. The simplest example would be advertising expenditure – it solely relates to the income-earning use of the asset, and delivers no personal benefit to anyone. An exception to this rule is expenditure on repairs and maintenance. The rules provide that repairs and maintenance cannot generally be treated as falling within this provision, which means that they will always be subject to apportionment. There is one carve-out from this exception. Where costs are incurred to repair explicit damage caused when an asset is used to earn income, that repair cost will be deductible in full. For example, a bach is rented out and the renters leave the barbecue on overnight, causing heat damage to a nearby wall. The costs of repairing that damage will be deductible in full. Example John operates a charter boat which he also uses privately. He incurs expenses, including costs in meeting Maritime New Zealand survey requirements, advertising costs, and general maintenance costs. The advertising costs are fully deductible because they deliver no personal benefit. The survey costs are fully deductible if they are incurred only for charter purposes. The general maintenance costs are not deductible under this provision because they deliver a personal benefit as well as an income- earning benefit. A portion of these maintenance costs may be allowed as a deduction under the apportionment rules. Expenditure subject to apportionment Sections DG 8 and DG 9 The apportionment rules are the core of the new rules for mixed-use assets. The apportionment rule is used to determine the deductibility of expenditure (and depreciation loss) which relates to the asset and is not expenditure which is fully deductible under the provision referred to above, or expenditure which relates purely to the private use of the asset. This expenditure will typically include rates, insurance, general repairs and maintenance. The expenditure will include interest expenditure incurred by owners on debt which relates to the mixed-use asset (debt that has been identified through a tracing rule). However, special rules apply to interest incurred by companies other than qualifying companies as, in the absence of these rules, the interest would generally be fully deductible. The proportion of the expenditure which will be deductible is calculated by multiplying the expenditure by the following formula: income-earning days income-earning days + counted days 8 Income-earning days are those days when the asset is used to earn income, other than exempt income (such as when the asset is rented to associates or for less than 80% of the market value). This includes days when the asset is used in a wider business and therefore the income is derived indirectly. Income-earning days also include days when the asset is used by the owner to repair damage caused by a renter, where the asset is relocated to facilitate a rental and the cost of that relocation is included in the rental, and where the asset is unavailable for use because it had been reserved by someone but they did not use it. Days for which the use of the asset triggers a fringe benefit tax liability also count as income-earning days. Counted days are those days when the asset is in use, but the use is not an income-earning day. Counted days will therefore include days when the asset is used privately, and when the asset is used to earn exempt income – by being rented to associates or for less than market value. Units other than days can be used if they achieve a more appropriate apportionment. For example, nights would probably be a better unit of measurement for accommodation, and flying hours for aircraft. Depreciation itself is usually apportioned by the mixed-use assets rules, but gain or loss on sale is dealt with by the relevant rules in subpart EE. Further, when depreciation is apportioned on the basis of floor area or similar, that basis is not overridden by the mixed-use assets apportionment rules. Example Jim rents out his aeroplane at market value for 100 hours in an income year, and uses it for his personal enjoyment for 50 hours. Jim incurs expenditure of $10,000 for general repairs and maintenance of the plane. He may deduct two-thirds of the expenditure. His deduction is calculated as follows: $10,000 × (100/(100 + 50)) = $6,666.67 9 Example Mary owns a launch. During the course of an income year, she takes her family out on the launch for 20 days, she lets her brother use the launch (paying the market rate of $200 per day) for 5 days and she lets her friend use the launch (paying fuel costs only at the rate of $50 per day) for 1 day. Mary rents out the launch to non-associates at market rates for 30 days, and spends two days taking the launch to another port for one of these rentals and then back again to the home port afterwards. She spends one day taking the launch to a boatyard for repair after damage was caused by one of those renters. Mary’s income-earning use is:  30 days’ rental to non-associates  2 days’ relocation use  1 day s’ repair use for a total of 33 income-earning days. Mary’s counted days are:  20 days’ family use  5 days’ use by her brother  1 day s’ use by her friend for a total of 26 counted days. Mary’s apportionment calculation is therefore: 33 income-earning days 33 income-earning days + 26 counted days = 33 59 = 56% So Mary can deduct 56% of her mixed-use asset expenditure. Expenditure quarantining rules Sections DG 15, DG 19 and DG 20 Background The fundamental problem that the mixed-use asset rules address is the difficult boundary between expenditure incurred to earn income, which should be deductible against income, and expenditure incurred for private purposes, which should not be. The apportionment method set out above is the key mechanism by which this is done. However, a tax loss can still arise, notwithstanding the apportionment rule. This is more likely to occur when income-earning use is low, as in the following example: 10 Income earning use – 15 days at $200 = $3,000 gross income Private use – 30 days Expenditure subject to apportionment – $20,000 Deductible expenditure – 15/45 x $20,000 = $6,667 Net loss – $3,667. A loss in a single year is unexceptional, and many conventional businesses will suffer occasional losses, perhaps as a result of one-off external events. Examples of these kinds of events which might affect a holiday home would be a poor ski season which reduced the demand for ski-field accommodation, or perhaps flood damage to a property which meant it could not be rented out. However, a loss which recurs from year to year indicates that the apportionment formula has failed to correctly distinguish between expenditure incurred to earn income, and expenditure incurred for private purposes. This is because income would be expected to generally exceed the expenditure incurred to earn that income – with occasional exceptions, such the examples noted above. For these reasons, the new rules include a deduction quarantining, or loss ring-fencing rule. Under this rule, a person who is in an occasional loss position will not be able to offset their loss against other income in the current year, but will be able to use it against their future profits from the mixed-use asset. However, a person who is in perpetual loss because the apportionment rule has failed to properly capture all private expenditure will never have future profits to offset the loss against, and the rule amounts to a permanent loss denial. Detailed rules The deduction quarantining rules only apply where the income which a person earns from their mixed-used asset is less than 2% of the value of the asset. If the asset is land-based, the 2% is measured against its value for local rating purposes, but if the asset has been acquired from a non- associated person since that rating value was set, it will be measured against the price it was acquired for. Exempt income (which is income earned from associates or which is less than 80% of market value) does not count towards the 2% test. For other assets, the 2% is measured against the asset’s value for tax depreciation purposes. 3 Where the deduction quarantining rules apply and the person’s expenditure after apportionment exceeds their income, the amount of the expenditure which exceeds the income is not deductible in that income year. Example David has a city apartment with a rateable value of $300,000. He rents out the apartment and also uses it privately. He receives a market rate rental of $4,000 from non-associates, and $6,000 from associates. David’s total allowable expenditure, following the application of the apportionment rules 3 Consideration is being given to amending the legislation to set a hurdle rate which is higher than 2% for boats and aircraft from 1 April 2014, which is when these assets become subject to these rules. 11 is $15,000. Since David’s income from non-associates is less than 2% of the apartment’s rateable value, the excess expenditure of $11,000 is denied as a deduction. The quarantined expenditure can be offset against profits in subsequent income years. Example In the following income year, David derives $10,000 from renting his city apartment at market rates to non-associates. David's total allowable expenditure following the application of the apportionment rules is $8,000. As calculated above he also has expenditure of $11,000 quarantined from the previous income year. David is able to deduct $2,000 of that quarantined expenditure to bring his profit down to zero. The remaining $9,000 continues to be quarantined and may be allowed as a deduction for a later income year. There are a number of restrictions around the use of the quarantined deductions in later years:  The profit must arise from the use of the same asset  The profit must arise when that asset is used as a mixed-use asset. There is one exception to the “same asset” rule – if the asset for which the loss arose is damaged, destroyed, or lost and is no longer held by the person, and the replacement asset is identical or substantially the same as the original mixed-use asset, the loss from the first asset can be offset against subsequent profits from the second asset. Example Graeme has a $5,000 quarantined deduction arising from renting out his family bach. Unfortunately it burns down. The insurance company pays out the replacement cost of the bach, which is $350,000. Graeme has a new bach built on the same site at a cost of $350,000. The new bach is of a similar size to the old bach, but has a different layout which allows an extra bedroom and is made of different materials than the old bach, which was built in the 1960s. Despite the new layout, the extra bedroom, and the use of different materials, the new bach is substantially identical to the old bach, and Graeme can offset the $5,000 quarantined deduction against future profits from renting out the new bach. There are some situations when it is impractical to apply the deduction quarantining rules. These situations arise when it is too hard to measure whether the income earned from the asset is equal to 2% or more of its value. This can arise when the income-earning use of the mixed-use asset is in a wider business, rather than it being rented out. However, a small amount of use as part of a business will not exclude the deduction quarantining rule from applying, if the asset is also rented out. So, where the rental use of the mixed-use asset is at least 80% of the income-earning use of the asset, then the deduction quarantining rules will still apply, with the 2% being assessed against the rental income. 12 Example Paul uses a helicopter on his farm to check stock for 50 hours in an income year, rents it out for 50 hours, and also uses it privately. While the income from the rental is clear, the income Paul derives in relation to the use of the helicopter in farming operations is not. Paul derives farming income from selling sheep, and it is not possible to attribute any of that income directly to his use of the helicopter in the farming operations. While the helicopter is also rented out, and that income can be clearly identified, the use of the helicopter to earn rental income is only 50% of the total income-earning use of the helicopter. This is less than the 80% threshold. Any loss attributable to the helicopter is therefore not quarantined. “Opting out” rules Section DG 21 The new rules entitle some holders of mixed-use assets to treat the asset as being outside the tax system. “Opting out” has the following consequences:  Income from the asset is not subject to tax  No deductions can be claimed for expenditure which relates to the asset. There are two circumstances in which a person can opt out:  The gross income from the mixed-use asset (not including income from associated persons or income which is less than 80% of market value) is less than $4,000; or  The person would otherwise have quarantined deductions. The decision to opt out is made in each year, and can change from year to year. There are no specific reporting requirements, but as with all other aspects of taxation, the person will need to maintain sufficient records to be able to provide evidence that they were entitled to opt out. Example The only income Mike has from the rental of his bach is $3,000 from a person who is not an associated person. Mike can opt out of the rules in this subpart, which would mean that he would not be liable to tax on the amount, but would also not be entitled to claim any deductions in relation to the bach. A company which holds a mixed-use asset cannot use these opt-out provisions. MODIFICATIONS TO GENERAL RULES WHEN ASSETS ARE HELD IN COMPANIES Additional rules concerning interest deductibility are required when the mixed-use asset is held in a company, and when shareholders incur interest in relation to their investments in companies. This is because of: 13  The rule that most companies can deduct all interest expenditure  The rule that shareholders in companies can deduct interest they incur on debt to buy shares. Without additional rules to apportion interest expenditure it could be more tax advantageous to hold mixed-use assets in corporate structures. Ideally the tax system should not influence a person’s decision to hold assets in a particular structure. The following information sets out variations to the core rules described above which apply when mixed-use assets are held by close companies. Treatment of interest when an asset is held in a corporate structure Sections DG 10, DG 11, DG 12, DG 13 and DG 14 This group of provisions sets out specific rules to address the deductibility of interest when the mixed- use asset is held by a company. As well as applying to the company which holds the asset, these rules potentially also apply to shareholders of the company which has the asset (both corporate and individual) and other companies in the same group as the company which has the asset. The apportionment calculation discussed above remains at the core of the interest rules for companies. The purpose of the rules discussed here is to identify the interest expenditure to which that apportionment calculation ought to apply. The apportionment ratio calculated above applies to all relevant company and shareholder interests. Interest deduction for the company which has the mixed-use asset Section DG 11 This rule applies only to the company that directly holds the mixed-use asset and determines the amount of interest expenditure that is required to be apportioned. In order to do this the company which holds the mixed-use asset needs to determine two amounts:  The value of the mixed-use asset (“asset value”). For land, this is the most recent rating value, or the acquisition cost of the land if more recent and the land was acquired from a non- associated person. For assets other than land, the relevant value is the tax value for depreciation purposes.  The value of the company’s debt (“debt value”), which is the average of its debt at the beginning of the year and the end of the year. All of the company’s interest-bearing debt is relevant, not just debt which has some connection with the mixed-use asset. The asset value is then compared with the debt value. If the asset value is equal to or more than the debt value, all of the company’s interest is subject to apportionment. The amount of asset value that exceeds the debt value (also known as the net asset balance) will need to be considered further under the provisions which consider group companies and shareholders. 14 Example Holiday Home Ltd holds a holiday home which is subject to the mixed-use asset rules and which has a rateable value of $200,000. The company has debt of $40,000, with associated interest expenditure of $4,000. Since the debt value is less than the asset value, all of the $4,000 interest expenditure must be apportioned using the same apportionment formula that applies to the other expenditure relating to the holiday home. If the asset value is less than the debt value, then apportionment will only apply to a part of the company’s interest expenditure. That part is calculated using the following equation: interest expenditure X asset value debt value Example Boat Ltd has a charter boat which has a depreciated tax value of $60,000. The company has debt of $100,000, with associated interest expenditure of $10,000. Since the debt value is more than the asset value, the company must calculate how much of its interest expenditure is subject to apportionment. The amount of interest expenditure subject to apportionment is $10,000 × ($60,000/$100,000) = $6,000. Therefore, $6,000 of interest expenditure must be apportioned using the same apportionment formula that applies to the other expenditure relating to the charter boat. Interest deductions for group companies Sections DG 10 and DG 12 The rules only need to be considered when the asset value exceeds the debt value in the company which has the mixed-use assets under the provisions discussed above. The rules apply to companies which are in the same group of companies as the company which has the mixed-use asset. The normal tax concept of a group company is used to determine how these rules apply, with two important exceptions:  a group of companies is treated as a wholly owned group of companies;  a company which would not ordinarily be part of a wholly owned group of companies, but is treated as part of a wholly owned group of companies under the provision above, is not included in the wholly owned group of companies if no private use of the asset has been made by a ny shareholder of that company (or a person associated with that any shareholder) where the shareholder does not also have interest in the company that owns the mixed-use asset. 15 Example Holding Ltd owns 100% of Boating Holidays Ltd, which owns a boat which is a mixed-use asset, and 100% of Plumbing Ltd. Holding Ltd also owns 70% of Drainlaying Ltd, with the other 30% of Drainlaying Ltd being held by a Mr Jones. Plumbing Ltd is part of the group for the purposes of apportionment of interest. Mr Jones does not use the boat, so Drainlaying Ltd is not part of the group for the purposes of apportionment of interest. The Group Once the relevant group of companies has been identified, the net asset balance from the company which owns the asset (the excess of the value of the asset over debt in that company) is attributed out to group members one at a time. The rules apportion group company interest expenditure in the same way as the company who holds the asset, however, group companies compare their debt value to the net asset balance (instead of the asset value). For example, if the net asset balance is equal to or more than the debt value, all of the group company’s interest must be apportioned under the standard apportionment formula. The excess of the net asset balance over debt in that company is the new net asset balance, in which case another group company (if there are any other group companies) then uses the new net asset balance (unless it is nil). This net asset balance is reset every time a company calculation is done by reducing its value by the amount of the particular company’s debt value. If the debt value exceeds the net asset balance the relevant portion of the group company’s debt will be subject to apportionment and no further group or shareholder interest apportionment calculations will have to be performed. The legislation does not prescribe the order in which that attribution takes place – that is a decision to be made by the group. Holding Ltd Boating Holidays Ltd Plumbing Ltd Drainlaying Ltd Mr Jones 100% 100% 70% 30% 16 Example Holiday Home Ltd has a net asset balance of $160,000 ($200,000 less $40,000) and is wholly owned by Parent Ltd. Parent has debt of $30,000, with associated interest expenditure of $3,000. Since Parent's debt value is less than the net asset balance, all of Parent's interest expenditure must be apportioned. Note that “apportioned debt” is debt in which related interest expenditure must be apportioned. Parent Ltd Holiday Home Ltd Total debt $ 30,000 Net asset balance $ 160,000 Apportioned debt $ 30,000 Bach $ 200,000 Total debt $ 40,000 Apportioned debt $ 40,000 Net asset balance $ 160,000 17 Example Boating Holidays Ltd’s boat has a tax depreciation value of $250,000 and the company has debt of $50,000. Boating Holidays Ltd therefore has a net asset balance of $200,000 to be attributed out to group members. Plumbing Ltd has average debt of $100,000 and Parent Ltd has average debt of $250,000. The group tax accountant decides to apply apportionment to Parent Ltd’s debt. The interest in Parent Ltd which is subject to apportionment is: $200,000 $250,000 x interest expenditure None of Plumbing Ltd’s debt is subject to apportionment. Holding Ltd Boating Holidays Ltd Average debt $250,000 Apportioned debt $200,000 Boat $ 250,000 Total debt $ 50,000 Apportioned debt $ 50,000 Net asset balance $ 200,000 Plumbing Ltd Average debt $ 100,000 Apportioned debt $ 0 18 Interest deductions for corporate shareholders Sections DG 10 and DG 13 This section applies when a net asset balance (excess of asset value over debt value) remains after identification of debt in the company which owns the asset, and any group companies under the provisions described above. It applies to identify debt in corporate shareholders for the purposes of applying apportionment to their interest deductions. Again, the same process is followed to identify interest expenditure that is required to be apportioned by comparing the shareholders debt value and the remaining net asset balance. However, the net asset balance applied to shareholders is calculated by reference to their voting interest (calculated as if they were the ultimate shareholder) in the company in which they hold shares (or if this is a group company, the net asset value left after all the group company calculations have been done). The provision contains an ordering rule. Debt is identified in the following order:  companies which are shareholders in the company which has the mixed-use asset or in a company which is in the same group as the company which has the mixed-use asset, and which have a voting interest in the company which has the asset; then  companies which have a voting interest in one of the companies referred to in the previous paragraph. The provisions do not apply to a company:  which has a direct or indirect interest of less than 50% in the company which has the mixed- use asset; and  of which no associated person who does not otherwise have a voting interest in the company that owns the mixed-use asset has had private use of the asset. 19 Example In an earlier example, Holiday Home Ltd had a net asset balance of $160,000 which it passed on to Parent Ltd. Parent Ltd apportioned interest on debt of $30,000, leaving a net asset balance of $130,000. Parent Ltd has two equal corporate shareholders, Company Y, which has debt of $20,000 with associated interest expenditure of $2,000, and Company Z, which has debt of $70,000 with associated interest expenditure of $7,000. Each company’s share of the net asset balance is $65,000 ($130,000 × 50%). Since Company Y's debt value is less than its share of the net asset balance, all of its interest expenditure must be apportioned. Company Z's debt value is greater than its share of the net asset balance, so the interest it must apportion is calculated as $7,000 × ($65,000/$70,000) = $6,500. Interest deductions for non-corporate shareholders Sections DG 10 and DG 14 These provisions apply when a net asset balance remains after the identification of debt in the company which owns the asset, any group companies, and any corporate shareholders. They apply to debt held by non-corporate shareholders, and trustees who are companies. Non-corporate, interest on debt which is subject to apportionment is only debt which was incurred to acquire the shares in a company which:  has the asset;  is a shareholder in the company which has the asset;  has a voting interest in the company which has the asset;  is a shareholder in a company which is in the same group as the company which has the asset, and has a voting interest in it. However, the rules will not apply when the person has a direct or indirect interest of less than 50% in the company, and did not have any private use of the asset. Company Z Parent Ltd Average debt $70,000 Share of balance $65,000 Apportioned debt $65,000 Net asset balance 0 Balance $130,000 Company Y Average debt $20,000 Share of balance $65,000 Apportioned debt $20,000 Net asset balance $45,000 50 % 50 % 20 The person’s share of the net asset balance is calculated by reference to their voting interest in the company in which they own shares, which in turn must have a direct or indirect interest in the mixed- use asset owning company. Example In an earlier example, Company Y’s share of Parent Ltd’s asset balance was $65,000 and it had debt of $20,000. Company Y therefore has an asset balance of $45,000 to be distributed amongst its shareholders. Company Y has two shareholders: Thomas, who has borrowed $200,000 to acquire a 50% interest in the company, and Brent, who has borrowed $10,000 to buy his 50% interest. Each has a share of the remaining net asset balance of $22,500. The formula is ($65,000 − $20,000) × 50% = $22,500. Since Thomas's debt value is greater than his share of the net asset balance, Thomas must apportion 11.25% of his total interest expenditure. The formula is 22,500/200,000. Since Brent's debt value of $10,000 is less than his share of the net asset balance of $22,500, all Brent's interest expenditure must be apportioned. Obviously apportionment stops at the level at which the shareholder is not a company. Deduction quarantining rules when an asset is held in a corporate structure Sections DG 15 – DG 19 Additional rules are provided to deal with deduction quarantining when the mixed-use asset is held in a company. Interest deductions identified in a group company or shareholder under the provisions discussed above may be subject to quarantining. The rules need to be considered when the gross income from the asset is less than 2% of its value as discussed above. For reasons set out below, whether income exceeds apportioned expenditure in the company holding the asset is not relevant. The first step is to calculate the difference between the income earned from the asset and the apportioned expenditure in the company which has the asset. If expenses in that company exceed its income – that is, it is itself in loss and subject to deduction quarantining – then the apportioned Company Y Debt Share of balance Apportioned debt $ 10,000 $22,000 $10,000 Net asset balance $ 45,000 Debt $200,000 Share of balance $ 22 ,500 Apportioned debt $ 22 ,500 50 % 50 % Thomas Brent 21 interest expenditure identified in all group companies and shareholders will also be subject to quarantining. If the income in the company which has the asset exceeds its expenses – that is, it is in “profit”, described in the legislation as “outstanding profit balance” – then to the extent possible, that profit will be notionally allocated to those group companies and shareholders which had apportioned interest, in amounts equal to their apportioned interest amounts (and in the same order in which those various persons had debt apportioned). To the extent an apportioned interest amount can be matched with “profit”, then it will be deductible against other income in the company (or if none, available to be carried forward as an ordinary, unrestricted loss). There is no obligation to offset the interest amount against income from the company which holds the mixed-use asset. However, once all of the “profit” has been exhausted and none remains to be allocated against an interest amount, then that interest amount will be quarantined and not able to be deducted in the current year. Quarantined amounts will be carried forward to future years, and will be deductible where they can be notionally matched with an amount of “profit” from future years from the company which has the mixed-use asset. Example Apartment Ltd owns an apartment to which the rules in this subpart apply and the income derived from the asset in the current year is less than 2% of the cost of the apartment. The company has calculated an outstanding profit balance of $12,000 as a result of deducting its apportioned expenses from its income from the apartment. Apartment Ltd is 100% owned by Parent Ltd, which has interest expenditure, after apportionment, of $5,000. Parent Ltd has 2 equal shareholders, Alisa who has apportioned interest expenditure of $8,000, and Hamish who has apportioned interest expenditure of $1,000. Parent Ltd is the first entity subject to the deduction quarantining rules. Its apportioned interest expenditure of $5,000 is less than the outstanding profit balance of $12,000, so it is not required to quarantine any of its interest expenditure. However, the outstanding profit balance is reduced to $7,000 ($12,000 – $5,000). Because Alisa and Hamish are equal shareholders their share of the $7,000 outstanding profit balance is $3,500 each ($7,500 x 50%). Alisa can therefore deduct $3,500 of her $8,000 apportioned expenditure, but must quarantine the remaining $4,500 ($8,000 – $3,500). Hamish has the same entitlement to deduct $3,500 of his apportioned expenditure but only has $1,000 of apportioned expenditure anyway, so is able to deduct all of it. The $2,500 remaining after Hamish has done that is not used. 22 In terms of allocating Alisa’s quarantined expenditure, she is able to deduct that quarantined expenditure in a future income year to the extent there is an outstanding profit balance in that future year. For example, in the following income year, Apartment Ltd has calculated an outstanding profit balance of $16,000 after deducting apportioned expenditure from the income from the apartment. In that same year, Parent Ltd has apportioned interest expenditure of $4,000 and Alisa has apportioned interest expenditure of $5,000. Therefore, Parent Ltd can claim all of its apportioned interest expenditure and an outstanding profit balance of $12,000 remains ($16,000–$4,000). Alisa’s share of the outstanding profit balance is $6,000 ($12,000 × 50%) and therefore she can claim her current year apportioned interest expenditure of $5,000, and can claim $1,000 of her previously quarantined expenditure. Alisa’s remaining $3,500 of quarantined expenditure remains quarantined. Parent Ltd Share of profit balance $ 3 ,500 Interest $ 1,000 Deductible interest $ 1,000 Quarantined interest $ 0 Outstanding profit balance $ 12,000 Interest $ 5,000 Outstanding profit balance $ 7,000 Share of profit balance $ 3 ,500 Interest $ 8,000 Deductible interest $3,500 Quarantined interest $ 4 ,500 50 % 50 % Hamish Outstanding profit balance $ 12,000 Apartment Ltd Alisa Parent Ltd Apartment Ltd Outstanding profit balance $ 16,000 50 % Alisa Share of profit balance $6,000 Interest $5,000 Previously quarantined expenditure $4,500 Remaining quarantined expenditure $3,500 Outstanding profit balance $16,000 Interest $4,000 Outstanding profit balance $12,000 23 Transitional rule to allow companies to transfer assets to shareholders Section DZ 21 The purpose of this rule is to facilitate the restructuring of arrangements under which mixed-use assets are held in companies. This rule allows the mixed-use asset to be transferred out to shareholders without triggering any depreciation recovery. A company can choose to apply this rule when:  on 31 March 2013 it has a mixed-use asset  it transfers the asset to its shareholders (or to the shareholders of its shareholders) in proportion to their shareholding. The transfer must be made before the end of the company’s 2013–14 income year. T he transfer of the asset is treated as if it were a disposal and acquisition of the asset for an amount equal to the adjusted tax value of the asset on the date of the transfer. This means that no depreciation recovery will be triggered by the transfer. The policy intention was that the shareholder would step into the shoes of the company and so be liable for any depreciation recovery on eventual disposal of the asset as if they had claimed all of the depreciation which the company had claimed. If the asset is transferred to a shareholder for less than market value, a dividend may arise. Example BoatCo Ltd has a boat on 31 March 2013 which meets the various requirements set out in subpart DG. All the shares in BoatCo Ltd are owned by Michelle. The boat has a market value of $75,000, and an adjusted tax value of $55,000. BoatCo Ltd transfers the boat to Michelle without payment (which is treated as a dividend of $75,000). For depreciation purposes, BoatCo Ltd is treated as disposing of the boat for $55,000, and Michelle is treated as acquiring it for $55,000. After the amendment Michelle will be treated as acquiring the boat for $75,000 gross, and having accumulated depreciation of $20,000 as at the date of acquisition. SUNDRY TECHNICAL RULES Summary of key provisions for assets owned by partnerships and look-through companies Boats and aircraft are only subject to the rules if they cost more than $50,000. For the purposes of this test, if an asset is held by a partnership or a look-through company (LTC), the value of all the interests of the partners in the partnership or the shareholders of the LTC are aggregated (see section DG 3(5)). Summary of key provisions for assets owned by qualifying companies The general rule for companies that states that interest on all debt is deductible, regardless of the use of that debt, does not apply to qualifying companies. Qualifying companies are instead required to 24 identify the use of their debt to determine whether interest on it is deductible or not – a tracing rule. The mixed-use asset rules recognise this approach by excluding qualifying companies from the interest apportionment rules which apply to companies, and instead apply apportionment only to interest on debt which relates to the mixed-use asset (see section DG 5(2)). However, as with ordinary companies, it may also be necessary to consider debt incurred at a group company or shareholder level. A qualifying company is therefore required to calculate a net asset balance in the same way as an ordinary company, and the same rules for attributing that to group companies and shareholders also apply. Relationship between the mixed-use assets rule and other provisions Section DG 2 The mixed-use asset rules override various provisions in subpart DG which deal with the deductibility of interest and financing expenditure. This override is necessary because the mixed-use asset rules limit deductions for interest and financing expenditure that would otherwise be able to be claimed. The rules in subpart DD which limit deductions for entertainment expenditure do not apply to expenditure incurred in relation to the private use of an asset under the mixed-use asset rules. Where the use of an asset is private use under the mixed-use asset rules, no liability to fringe benefit tax will arise. The choice which is normally available to treat a benefit provided to a shareholder/employee as either a fringe benefit or a dividend is specifically disabled, and the use is required to be treated as a dividend. The use of an asset by a shareholder may constitute both private use under the mixed-use asset rules and a deemed dividend (if, for example, less than market value is paid for the use of the asset). This is consistent with the position under ordinary law – which is well-understood for cash dividends – that no deduction is available for the amount outlaid to pay a dividend. In a dividend context, the mixed- use asset rules are merely the mechanism by which the cost of providing the non-cash dividend is calculated. Where an asset is acquired or disposed of during the income year Section DG 22 Various rules are provided to deal with assets being acquired or disposed of during the course of the income year. These rules:  pro-rate the 62-day test used to determine whether an asset is a mixed-use asset;  set appropriate days to measure the debt value of companies;  pro-rate interest expenditure which companies are required to apportion; and  pro-rate the 2% threshold to determine whether losses are subject to ring-fencing. NOTE: Some examples used in the legislation do not always reflect the correct amounts. These will be corrected in the next available tax bill.

It is intended to aid the understanding and readability of the report. The SME tax compliance costs research has been designed to produce a vast array of compliance cost-related information; including an overall combined tax compliance cost for all SMEs, which includes both their internal and external costs of compliance, as well as the internal costs relating to individual tax types. Structure of report The executive summary introduces readers to the overall combined tax compliance cost for all SMEs, and then highlights the key results for those SMEs who file/pay particular tax types. Chapters 2 and 3 are intended to provide the reader with more detailed information regarding the background, objectives and methodology used for this survey. Chapter 4 provides a profile of the responding businesses that participated in the survey. Chapters 5 through 12 examine the internal time spent by those SMEs who file/pay particular tax types, followed by the external costs associated with those taxes. Chapter 13 details the overall combined tax compliance costs across all SMEs, regardless of whether they file/pay particular tax types. Chapter 14 looks at the psychological costs associated with meeting tax compliance obligations, and Chapter 15 details SMEs’ current and preferred methods for filing and paying different tax types. SME tax compliance costs 2013 6 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Technical decisions 1. All means presented in this report have been trimmed, unless otherwise specified. This is consistent with the approach taken in the 2004 baseline survey, as well as the 2009 evaluation. Systematic trimming of means “smoothes” distortions in the data that can arise from a few extremely high values, and better allows for detecting changes over time than would be possible with non-trimmed means. The removal of extremely high values using a systematic approach is justified, based on the premise that the policy focus on combined compliance costs should exclude rare events which affect relatively few firms’ individual compliance costs. 2. Reported cell means are not additive by design; that is, the means reported in the “All SMEs” columns in tables have not been calculated as the sum of trimmed means for individual cells in that table. Therefore, ‘total’ means as reported should be relied upon rather than the summing of individual means in a particular table. 3. Most percentages in this report do not add to 100 percent. This is mainly due to rounding or the fact that multiple responses were possible for some questions. 4. Values in tables based upon fewer than 20 enterprises have been suppressed, to avoid conclusions being drawn based on small cell sizes. 5. All values reported in the tables are weighted; however, the associated sample base sizes are reported unweighted. This has been done so that the reader can understand exactly how many respondents a particular result is based on. 6. As was the case in 2004 and 2009, Fringe Benefit Tax (FBT) nil businesses have been excluded from the analysis of FBT costs, as such businesses skew the average compliance costs for those businesses that are affected by FBT. 7. As was the case in 2009, the costs associated with the administration of KiwiSaver by businesses have been included in this study as a separate “tax” type from PAYE, through which the scheme is administered. Glossary Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) Generally SMEs are active businesses with fewer than 50 staff and/or with an annual turnover of less than $13.5 million. Note that the report uses SME, businesses and enterprises interchangeable throughout the report – all meaning SMEs included in the survey population (see Sample design, page 16). “All SMEs” Distinction is made between cost figures for all SMEs and cost figures for businesses that deal with specific taxes, each of which is reported in a different section of the report. “All SMEs” refers to every business in the sample, even though they may not file/pay all taxes (and therefore would have no costs associated with those taxes). This allows for providing the reader a New Zealand-wide view of SME tax compliance costs. Overall tax compliance costs A simplified version of the definition of compliance costs, as used in this report, is as follows:  Combined compliance cost = hours spent dealing with tax-related activities (converted to internal compliance costs) + external compliance cost + stress (as a measure of psychological cost). Psychological costs Self-reported stress, as measured in terms of a 7-point stress level scale (See Appendix H: Multi-tax questionnaire Q21-Q26). SME tax compliance costs 2013 7 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Section 1. Executive summary Evaluation purpose This report details the results of the SME tax compliance survey 2013. It records the annualised tax compliance costs for New Zealand small and medium enterprises in 2013. 1 Policy context Simplification of tax administration and making it easier for SMEs to meet their tax obligations has been a key focus of Inland Revenue for a number of years, and is in line with Government’s Result 9 2 target: Cut the cost of dealing with government by 25% by reducing effort required to work with agencies by 2017. Evaluations and studies, such as that reported on here, are required to assist Inland Revenue and the Government to monitor the impact of past and present legislative initiatives aimed at reducing business compliance costs. They also feed into the consideration of the impact of any proposed initiatives to reduce tax compliance costs. Evaluation objectives The overarching objective of this survey is to provide evidence-based information on the tax compliance costs of small and medium-sized businesses in 2013, and how those costs have changed since the 2004 and 2009 surveys. As with the two previous surveys, the 2013 survey quantifies SMEs’ compliance costs in terms of hours and dollars spent. The specific information objectives of the survey and evaluation are to:  Measure SMEs’ tax compliance costs in 2013.  Measure the change in SMEs’ tax compliance costs since 2004 and 2009. More specifically: o By how much and in what direction have tax compliance costs changed? o Which elements of tax compliance costs have changed? o Which particular groups of taxpayers are affected? o What impact have the tax compliance cost changes had in the SME population overall? o To what extent can the changes be attributed to specific interventions?  Evaluate the effectiveness of the GST and provisional tax alignment on making tax compliance easier for businesses. This report specifically addresses the first bullet point above, and provides a starting point for considering the others. Supplementary to this report, a second report (Changes in SME tax compliance costs 2004 to 2013) addresses the second bullet point. 1 Note the definition of SMEs used in this report may differ from others. Please refer to the glossary at the beginning of this report, and to the section on sampling design in Chapter 3. 2 New Zealand businesses have a one-stop online shop for all government advice and support they need to run and grow their business. SME tax compliance costs 2013 8 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Evaluation methodology To ensure comparability between the 2004 and 2009 surveys and the 2013 survey, the same fundamental methodology has been used. The population of interest is New Zealand SMEs (defined as small and medium businesses, based on their number of employees and annual turnover) and sole traders. A disproportionate stratified random sample of 7,900 SMEs, reflecting different levels of turnover, employee numbers and tax type was drawn by Inland Revenue. A mail-out survey of SMEs was conducted in November 2013 as well as a booster mail-out in January 2014. Responding businesses were also provided with the option of completing the survey online. A total of 1,206 completed questionnaires were used in the analysis. This data was linked to key Inland Revenue-extracted data about respondents, which was used for weighting purposes so that the results may be extrapolated to the entire population of interest. Tax compliance cost definition Both mean (trimmed) and median costs are included in the main results for the following:  hours spent internally on each of the main tax types (GST, income tax, PAYE, KiwiSaver and FBT);  hours converted into internal compliance costs in dollars;  external tax advisor costs in dollars; and  “combined compliance costs” which is the sum of internal compliance costs and external tax advisor costs. Information is also presented in relation to who within the business spent time on tax compliance activities (owner/partner/trustee/director, paid employee, unpaid family member or friend), as well as the level of stress involved in completing these activities. Value of time analysis The following dollar amounts have been used to convert time spent into tax compliance costs, based on who in the business completed the tax activity:  $61.13 (owners/partners/directors/trustees)  $28.03 (paid employees)  $38.69 (unpaid family members or friends). Key findings Overall combined tax compliance costs  The mean combined (internal + external tax advisor) tax compliance cost for all SMEs, regardless of size, is $5,861 per year. This compares with a median cost for all SMEs of $3,834.  Mean combined compliance costs increase as the size of the business increases (as determined by the number of employees) – ranging from $4,534 for businesses with nil employees through to $12,512 for businesses with 20 or more employees (Figure 1.1).  Mean internal costs are $3,778 and mean external costs are $1,842; 64 percent and 31 percent of the mean combined cost respectively. The comparative medians are $2,201 and $1,150.  As is the case with combined compliance costs, mean internal costs increase with business size (as determined by number of employees), from $2,868 for businesses with nil employees through to $6,512 for those with six to 19 employees. There is a levelling effect, however, evidenced by the mean internal cost of $6,579 for businesses with 20 or more employees. This general pattern holds true for most individual tax types, with the exception of income tax, for which internal costs continue to increase for businesses with 20 or more employees.  Mean external costs also increase with business size, from $1,413 for those with nil employees through to $4,956 for those with 20 or more employees. There is no levelling effect for external costs. SME tax compliance costs 2013 9 Prepared by: Research New Zealand  There is an inverse relationship between annual business turnover and overall compliance costs as a percentage of that turnover. The compliance cost percentage declines from 11.6 percent for businesses with a turnover of less than $40,000 to less than one percent for those with a turnover of $1.3 million and over (Figure 1.2). Figure 1.1 Internal and external compliance costs by business size, regardless of tax types filed/paid Figure 1.2 Overall tax compliance costs as a percentage of annual business turnover SME tax compliance costs 2013 10 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Internal compliance costs Across all SMEs, regardless of the size or the type of taxes they pay/file:  The mean number of internal hours spent on tax compliance is 74.9 hours, which equates to $3,778 per year. The respective median cost is $2,201.  The amount of time spent relates strongly to business size, ranging from 55.1 hours for SMEs with nil employees to 172.9 hours for SMEs with 20 or more employees.  GST requires the greatest time commitment (31.9 hours on average for all SMEs), followed by income tax (19.5 hours), PAYE (9.9 hours), KiwiSaver (3 hours) and FBT (0.9 hours).  Across all tax types, ‘recording information’ is the activity which requires the greatest number of hours on average. Time spent on tax activities by different personnel These hours are drawn only from those SMEs which file/pay a particular tax type:  Owners, partners, directors and/or trustees spend on average 52.5 hours a year on tax compliance, considerably higher than the average for paid employees (16.5 hours) and unpaid family and friends (2.3 hours).  Larger business are more reliant on paid employees: in businesses with 20 or more employees paid employees spend an average of 167.5 hours per year on tax activities, while in micro businesses (1-5 employees), 28.5 hours are spent by paid employees on average. External tax advisor costs  Across all businesses, regardless of size or whether or not they pay for an external advisor, the mean annual cost for external advisors is $1,842. This compares with a median cost of $1,150.  Overall, 80 percent of SMEs pay for external tax services across all tax types.  Income tax accounts for the largest portion of these external compliance costs (79 percent). The mean annual cost is $1,041 for income tax, $377 for GST, $13 for PAYE, $3 for FBT and $1 for KiwiSaver. Note that only 15 percent of all businesses that deal with KiwiSaver pay for external advice on that subject.  Amongst those who pay external costs for a particular tax type, the mean annual tax-related cost is $1,856.  The figures for SMEs which paid external costs for the tax in question are $1,469 for income tax, $437 for GST, $29 for PAYE, $19 for FBT and $2 for KiwiSaver. Tax-specific compliance costs Figure 1.3 compares the combined tax compliance costs for each of the tax types by business size. It is indicative only of overall combined tax compliance costs by business size. This is because it shows the sum of the individual tax types rather than the mean overall cost. These costs are for all SMEs, regardless of whether a particular tax type is filed or not. Combined tax compliance costs are highest for income tax and GST. SME tax compliance costs 2013 11 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Figure 1.3 Combined mean tax compliance costs (internal plus external) by size of business for individual tax types The following sub-sections summarise key findings from the survey as they pertain to each individual tax type. For each tax type, data are provided both for all SMEs (regardless of whether they file that particular type of tax) and for those SMEs who file that particular tax type. These findings are described in detail in the relevant sections of the report (Sections 5 – 14). Income Tax (including provisional tax) Across all SMEs, regardless of whether they pay income tax or not (i.e. including those SMEs that have no costs associated with income tax):  Combined (internal + external) compliance costs are $2,743; the highest of all tax types.  External costs account for $1,401 of this total (51 percent), compared with $1,064 for internal costs. In comparison, external costs account for only 22 percent of GST costs and three percent of PAYE costs.  19.5 hours of internal time are spent annually on income tax.  Tax compliance costs relating to income tax increase with business size, from $2,445 (nil employees) to $5,474 (20+ employees). SMEs paying/filing income tax:  20.5 hours are spent annually on tax activities, equating to $1,116 of internal tax compliance costs.  Eighty percent of all hours spent on income tax are undertaken by owners, partners, directors and/or trustees (equating to 89 percent of all internal cost in dollars).  Only in medium-sized businesses (20+ employees) do paid employees undertake more of the income tax compliance burden than the owners, partners, directors and/or trustees.  Seventy-nine percent employ external tax advisors to deal with income tax, compared with 47 percent for GST (among GST-filing businesses). Those who use external tax advisors spend $1,469, on average, on income tax- related advice. SME tax compliance costs 2013 12 Prepared by: Research New Zealand GST Across all SMEs, regardless of size and tax types filed:  Combined (internal + external) tax compliance costs for GST are $2,194.  External costs form $377 of this total (22 percent), compared with $1,746 for internal costs.  31.9 hours of internal time are spent annually on GST.  Tax compliance costs for GST increase with business size, from $1,788 (nil employees) to $3,403 (20+ employees). SMEs filing GST:  37.1 hours are spent annually on tax activities, equating to $2,027 of internal tax compliance costs.  21.5 hours of this time is spent on ‘recording information’ (55 percent) - the greatest amount spent on this activity of any tax type.  Seventy-five percent of time (hours) spent on income tax is undertaken by owners, partners, directors and/or trustees (84 percent of internal costs in dollars).  Forty-seven percent employ external tax advisors to deal with GST. Those who use external advisors spend an average of $437 annually on GST-related advice. PAYE Across all SMEs, regardless of size and tax types filed:  Combined tax compliance costs for PAYE are $519.  External costs form $13 of this total (three percent), compared with $478 of internal costs.  The mean internal time spent annually on PAYE is 9.9 hours.  The combined costs associated with PAYE increase between micro businesses (one to five employees) and small businesses (six to 19 employees), from $1,240 to $1,933 respectively. The cost for medium businesses (20+ employees) is $1,939, which demonstrates a levelling effect for this tax type. SMEs filing PAYE:  The mean internal time spent annually is 25.8 hours across all activities, equating to $1,099.  An average of 11.0 hours is spent on ‘recording information’ (38 percent), and 7.1 hours are spent on ‘calculating tax, completing and filing returns, paying tax’ (25 percent).  As might be expected, internal costs associated with PAYE are strongly related to business size (i.e. number of employees).  Those who use external advisors spend $29, on average, for advice on PAYE. KiwiSaver Across all SMEs, regardless of size and tax types filed:  Combined compliance costs for KiwiSaver are $134.  Internal costs account for the large majority of this total ($132).  An average of 3.0 internal hours is spent annually on KiwiSaver. SMEs dealing with KiwiSaver:  The mean internal time spent annually is 14.9 hours across all activities, equating to $459.  As business size increases, paid employees deal with more of the KiwiSaver burden than owners, partners, directors and/or trustees. Time spent by paid employees as a proportion of total internal hours on KiwiSaver increases from 21 percent among micro businesses, to 37 percent among small businesses and 78 percent among medium businesses. SME tax compliance costs 2013 13 Prepared by: Research New Zealand  An average of just $2 is spent on advice relating to KiwiSaver, among those who use external advisors. FBT Across all SMEs, regardless of size and tax types filed:  Overall combined tax compliance costs for FBT are $39.  As is the case with KiwiSaver, the large majority of these costs are internal ($35).  Annually, a mean of 0.9 hours is spent on FBT. SMEs filing FBT:  On average, 11.4 hours are spent annually on FBT-related tax activities, equating to an internal cost of $197.  This time is spent on a range of activities, with 3.7 hours spent on ‘recording information’.  Those who use external advisors spend $19, on average, for advice on FBT. Psychological costs  Sixty-three percent of all SMEs find meeting Inland Revenue requirements (ignoring finding the money) less than moderately stressful, 21 percent find it moderately stressful and 16 percent find tax requirements more than moderately stressful.  On balance, businesses with no employees and business with 20 or more employees report higher stress levels than those with one to 19 employees.  Seventy-nine percent of SMEs dealing with KiwiSaver indicated it was less than moderately stressful to do so (including finding the money).  Overall, FBT was found to be the least stressful tax type (including finding the money), as indicated by those filing or paying each tax type. Reported stress levels for all other tax types were relatively similar. SME tax compliance costs 2013 14 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Section 2. Background and objectives This report records the annual tax compliance costs for New Zealand small and medium size businesses (SMEs) in 2013. It follows similar surveys conducted in 2004 and 2009. Background In 2004, Inland Revenue measured the tax compliance costs of nearly 2000 SMEs and 275 tax agents. These results provided a baseline before the introduction of several initiatives aimed at making tax easier for small businesses (e.g., GST and provisional tax alignment, subsidised payroll intermediaries, a discount for early payment of provisional tax in the first year of business). In 2009, Inland Revenue conducted a second measure of SMEs’ tax compliance costs, using methods comparable to those used in 2004, to identify and assess trends in tax compliance costs during the preceding five years, as well as to gauge the impact of major initiatives on tax compliance costs such as the introduction of KiwiSaver. Repeating the survey in late 2013 and early 2014 will enable Inland Revenue to again assess the on-going trends in tax compliance costs for small businesses is in line with Government’s Result 9 3 target: Cut the cost of dealing with government by 25% by reducing effort required to work with agencies by 2017. Evaluation objectives The overarching objective of this survey is to provide evidence-based information on the tax compliance costs of small and medium-sized businesses in 2013, and how those costs have changed since the 2004 and 2009 surveys. As with the two previous surveys, the 2013 survey quantifies SMEs’ tax compliance costs in terms of hours and dollars spent. The specific information objectives of the survey and evaluation are:  Measure SMEs’ tax compliance costs in 2013.  Measure the change in SMEs’ tax compliance costs since 2004 and 2009. More specifically: o By how much and in what direction have tax compliance costs changed? o Which elements of tax compliance costs have changed? o Which particular groups of taxpayers are affected? o What impact have the tax compliance cost changes had in the SME population overall? o To what extent can the changes be attributed to specific interventions?  Evaluate the effectiveness of the GST and provisional tax alignment on making tax compliance easier for businesses. This report specifically addresses the first bullet point above, and provides a starting point for considering the others. Supplementary to this report, a second report (Changes in SME tax compliance costs 2004 to 2013) addresses the second bullet point. 3 New Zealand businesses have a one-stop online shop for all government advice and support they need to run and grow their business. SME tax compliance costs 2013 15 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Defining tax compliance costs The survey data presented in this report contribute to the measurement of tax compliance costs as defined below. Both internal time (as annual hours and converted to a dollar cost) and external tax advisor costs (dollar value) are presented. Data on psychological costs have also been collected, and presented in this report, although these costs have not been converted into dollars. In defining overall combined tax compliance costs, the same definition used in the 2004 and 2009 surveys has been used: Compliance costs = (internal time plus external advisor costs) plus psychological costs minus (cash flow benefits plus tax deductibility) The following apply in relation to the above definition:  Audit costs, computing and other internal non-labour costs.  External payroll provider costs are excluded.  Internal time = imputed costs of time spent by owners, staff, families and friends.  Cash flow benefits = financial benefits arising from the mismatch in timing between when taxes are collected and when they are remitted to the tax authority. Note reducing cash flow management problems is an integral element of implementing some past tax initiatives.  Tax deductibility = for example, costs associated with using a tax advisor.  Psychological costs = the level of stress associated with tax activities, including finding the money; however, measures are not converted to dollars.  Some of the less frequent compliances costs (e.g. audit costs) that may generate unusually higher costs than those where the tax component is not easily isolated have been acknowledged and quantified to varying degrees, but not included in the main calculations.  Calculated compliance costs are based on trimmed means. SME tax compliance costs 2013 16 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Section 3. Methodology This chapter outlines the methodology used to conduct the 2013 SME tax compliance costs survey. To enable comparability with the results of the 2004 and 2009 surveys, the methodology and design used in 2013 was fundamentally the same as for those two previous surveys. The main exception to this was that, in 2013, respondents were given the option of completing the survey online. Changes in the tax environment which occurred between 2009 and the completion of the 2013 survey were also incorporated into the survey design, where appropriate. These tax environment changes are detailed in the companion report SME Tax Compliance Costs 2013 Comparative Report (Chapter 3). Scoping and design Sample design To allow for direct comparisons to be made, the sample design for the 2013 survey was consistent with the design for the 2004 and 2009 surveys. The population of interest was small and medium businesses in New Zealand, along with relevant self-employed people. The sample was selected on the basis of the following factors:  business nature, indicated by legal, or business structure (Inland Revenue’s entity type);  types of tax paid; and  business size, as indicated by number of employees and annual turnover.  SMEs, with and without employees, participating in KiwiSaver or other pre-existing employee superannuation schemes. As was done in 2009, the total population of 433,734 SMEs was further segmented into three sub-populations: 4  multiple tax type businesses (i.e. paying GST and/or employing staff, in addition to being subject to income tax) (n=384,956);  sole traders completing IR3 income tax returns (n=10,948); and  companies, trusts and partnerships completing IR 4, IR6 or IR7 forms (n=37,830). The definition of an eligible sole trader for sampling purposes was restricted to relevant SMEs with self-employment income recorded by Inland Revenue of $16,095 or more. 5 A disproportionate stratified random sample of n=7,900 SMEs was drawn for the survey reflecting different strata of turnover and employee numbers. In general terms, SMEs were included if they:  were registered for either GST or PAYE as companies, partnerships, trusts or individuals – self-employed or employing taxpaying entities; or  earned sufficient “business income” and were registered as “income tax only” (IR3, IR4, IR6 and IR7 tax return filers). 4 This was not done in the 2004 benchmark survey, which only used two sub-populations. 5 An income of $16,095 reflects the threshold at which the individual has to pay provisional tax (RIT>$2,500). SME tax compliance costs 2013 17 Prepared by: Research New Zealand They were excluded if they:  employed 50 staff or more and had an annual turnover of $13.5 million or greater; 6  were not actively trading; and  were inactive or very small (annual PAYE deductions of less than $4,500 7 and turnover of less than $30,000 8 for those with GST or PAYE obligations. For those income only entities, residual income of less than $2,500 9 ). Questionnaire redevelopment Given the desire to measure changes in SMEs’ tax compliance costs since the 2004 and 2009 surveys, minimal changes were made to the survey questionnaires in preparation for the 2013 compliance cost survey. As outlined above, these changes were made to take into account changes in the tax environment since the 2009 survey. To assist with this, a steering group comprised of Martina Battisti (Massey University); Stephen Summers (Business NZ); Stephen Rutherford (NZICA); Katie Wellington (MBIE); and Marie Pallot, Geoff Leggett, David Udy and Linda Oliver (all from Inland Revenue). Linda Oliver (IR)) was appointed to.  The inclusion of ESCT (employer superannuation contribution tax) when calculating internal time spent dealing with KiwiSaver deductions and contributions, and external tax-related costs paid to SMEs’ main tax advisor.  A set of new questions was added to capture the number of times businesses had filed different tax returns (PAYE, RWT, FBT, income tax, including provisional tax, and GST) in the last 12 months; how many of those returns were filed electronically; and SMEs’ preferred ways of filing those returns (e.g. electronically, by post or through a tax advisor).  A set of new questions was also added to capture the number of times businesses had paid different taxes (PAYE, RWT, FBT, income tax, including provisional tax, and GST) in the last 12 months; how many of those taxes were paid electronically; and SMEs’ preferred ways of paying those taxes (e.g. electronically, by post or through a tax advisor).  The deletion of a number of questions from the 2009 survey which were intended to capture recent changes in the tax environment at that time: o SMEs’ awareness of the ratio option as an alternative option for calculating provisional tax. o Hours spent internally calculating provisional tax. o The time savings, or dollars savings, impact of the 1 April 2009 change in the PAYE payment threshold, which gave SMEs the option of paying PAYE only once per month, rather than twice. o The impact of the GST/provisional tax alignment on the amount of effort, time and dollars spent dealing this those two taxes. Where relevant, a small number of changes were made in the IR 3, IR 4/6/7 and Tax Advisors questionnaires to reflect the above changes to the multi-tax questionnaire. Cognitive pre-testing The questionnaires for the 2013 SME Tax Compliance Cost Survey were pre-tested between 23 and 31 October 2013. Twelve test surveys were completed in total by sole traders, business owners and finance managers from Wellington- based businesses, along with two tax agents. As a result of this pre-testing, a number of minor question wording and formatting changes to some question instructions were made. 6 Increased from $10 million in 2004 and $12.5 million in 2009 to adjust for inflation. 7 Less than one full-time employee receiving the minimum wage. 8 Based on one half of the GST registration threshold of $60,000. 9 The provisional tax liability threshold, based on a residual income tax of less than $2,500. SME tax compliance costs 2013 18 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Fieldwork Self-completion questionnaires, along with a reply-paid envelope, were sent to 5,500 businesses on 8 November 2013. Initially, 5,000 long questionnaires and 500 short questionnaires were despatched. In addition, booster mail-outs were sent to an additional 1,000 and 1,200 businesses on 26 November 2013 and 27 January 2014, respectively. 10 Survey packs, including using Inland Revenue branded envelopes were sent with a covering letter from Inland Revenue explaining the purpose of the research and Research New Zealand’s involvement as an independent Market Research company contracted to administer and process the survey on Inland Revenue’s behalf. To help maximise the response rate to the survey, the following activities were also undertake:  Reminder letters with replacement questionnaires.  Telephone reminders. Table 3.1 Respondent sample numbers as proportion of overall population Survey respondent group Sample population (n=) Survey population (N=) Percentage Sole traders (IR3) income tax only Companies, trusts and partnerships (IR 4, IR 6 or IR 7) Income tax only respondents (short questionnaires) 125 375 500 22 50 72 1.8% 4.1% 6.0% SMEs contributing towards KiwiSaver All other SMEs paying multiple taxes Multiple tax respondents (long questionnaires) 793 6,407 7,200 179 955 1,134 14.8% 7.9% 94.0% All SMEs 7,700 1,206 100.0% Response rate SMEs survey Questionnaires were despatched to 7,700 businesses and 1,206 were returned, representing a response rate of 15.7 percent. We compared the demographic profiles of those SMEs responding to the survey with non-responders and found no significant differences by the main sampling variables (i.e. number of employees, turnover and tax type). Table 3.2 Response rate analysis Survey respondent group Long questionnaires Short questionnaires Overall Questionnaires dispatched (not including replacement questionnaires) 7,200 500 7,700 Completed questionnaires returned 1,134 72 1,206 Response rate 15.8% 14.4% 15.7% 10 Note that although 7,900 SMEs were sampled for the survey, only 7,700 were invited to participate. This was due to the availability of printed questionnaires, and therefore 6,800 out of the 7,000 potential multiple tax respondents sampled were randomly selected to receive invitations. SME tax compliance costs 2013 19 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Tax Advisor sub-survey A tax advisor sub-survey was conducted to gather information in order to apportion external Tax Advisor tax compliance costs to different tax types. The information was collected from Tax Advisors in regard to long questionnaire clients, who had participated in the survey and who had given their consent for their Tax Advisor to be contacted for information about the tax compliance costs they had paid in relation to different tax types. In total, 317 questionnaires were sent to Tax Advisors and their response rate is detailed below. Table 3.3 Response rate analysis – Tax Advisors Businesses in long questionnaires sample that use an external Tax Advisor Tax advisor questionnaires Questionnaires dispatched (A) Completed questionnaires returned (B) Unusable returned questionnaires (C) Usable returned questionnaires (D) 317 175 17 158 Number of businesses in achieved long questionnaire sample that have Tax Advisors (E) 925 Response rate A – percentage of Tax Advisors sent a questionnaire who returned a usable completed questionnaire (D/A) Response rate B – percentage of long questionnaire businesses who use an external Tax Advisor and whose advisor returned a completed usable questionnaire (D/E) 49.8% 17.1% Weighting An appropriate weighting scheme for the remaining records, to adjust for any sampling and non-response biases was developed in consultation with IR. This scheme is based upon businesses’ responses to the size and turnover questions, as well as IR administrative data regarding each SME’s tax type (i.e. multi-tax, IR3, etc.). The data were weighted so the survey results could be used to make generalisations to the entire survey population. Weighted values have been used in all analysis for the reporting. A weight for each responding SME was calculated as (N(i)/n(i)), where:  N(i) is population count of each stratum; and  n(i) is the achieved sample in each stratum. Data integrity and data processing During the data entry stage, all returned paper questionnaires were reviewed, edited and double-entered 100 percent. A number of steps were taken to ensure data integrity, including:  Having a documented series of comprehensive editing checks and database checks to test for the internal validity of the survey data. This included checking for distinctions between ‘true zero’ values and missing values (i.e. answers not provided by respondents).  A review of the consistency of multi-tax respondents’ answers to Q13a and Q13b was undertaken. Where records with significant discrepancies were identified, these were flagged for the researchers’ review.  Where there were discrepancies between the totals listed in Q13a and Q13b, the totals from Q13a took precedence for the purposes of analysis and reporting. Total internal time hours Total hours spent by businesses were recalculated, based upon the sum row values, rather than placing a reliance on what respondents listed as the total of those hours on their questionnaires. SME tax compliance costs 2013 20 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Business size and sector Missing values for business size (turnover and number of employees) and sector in the SMEs’ survey data were addressed using administrative information from Inland Revenue’s database. External tax compliance costs The calculation of external tax compliance costs by tax type was undertaken using both data from the Tax Advisor supplementary survey and the SME surveys, as well as data imputation. To this end, external tax compliance costs have been calculated using the following approach:  Tax Advisor-supplied data was used for respondents who completed the multi-tax survey questionnaire and supplied tax dollar data (regardless of whether it matched the total dollar amount reported by the business in question and regardless of whether the business reported using their Tax Advisor for one or more tax types).  The dollar value provided in Q9a by respondents who completed the multi-tax survey questionnaire, but ticked only one tax type at Q9b, was used (providing the business had confirmed that the amount in Q9a only included tax-related costs).  The response to Q3 was used for respondents who completed the IR 3 and IR 4/6/7 questionnaires on the basis that it reflected the amount they paid for external tax-related services for income tax purposes (providing the business had confirmed that the amount recorded at Q3 only related to tax-related costs). There were also cases of missing dollar information for respondents who completed the multi-tax survey questionnaire indicating they had paid multiple tax types, but for whom no information was available from their Tax Advisor. Imputed data was used to address these situations, using a combination of the result they provided in Q9b and imputing or apportioning the result based on the ‘industry average’ results for Q9d (as derived from the Tax Advisors survey). External costs for multi-tax respondents were considered as missing, and therefore not imputed, if the respondent did not indicate in Q9a that the amount listed was for only tax-related purposes and no data was available from their Tax Advisor. Calculation of means and medians To ensure comparability with the 2004 and 2009 survey data, trimmed means 11 have been used extensively in the analysis and reporting of the amount of time businesses spend on tax compliance and associated tax compliance costs. This involves excluding any values where the log falls outside of the median (log10(x)) + 2.24 MAD(Log10(x)), where MAD is the median absolute deviation normalised to approximate the standard deviation for normally distributed data. The constant 2.24 was originally selected by Inland Revenue for the 2004 benchmark survey so that only the most extreme values would be trimmed. Note that by taking the logs, zero values are excluded from the trimming process, but retained for subsequent mean and median calculations. Outliers have not been removed in calculating medians, as the inclusion of outliers has very little effect when calculating median values. 11 The term “trimmed mean” generally refers to a mean calculated after first removing a fixed percentage of values from the top and bottom ranges of the distribution (e.g. a 5% trimmed mean is the average after 5% of the smallest and 5% of the largest values have been removed from the data). In line with the 2004 and 2009 surveys, a flexible trimming approach has been taken for the 2013 surveys in which the percentage of values trimmed from each array of data has varied depending upon the extent to which a particular question elicited extreme values, or outlines. Using a flexible trimming approach only removes such outliers before averaging, but retains other valid records at the top and bottom of the distribution which are not outliers. SME tax compliance costs 2013 21 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Treatment of missing information Where missing values were identified for:  Total hours and costs in Q13a, they have been replaced with the total hours and costs values provided in Q13b, where available, and vice versa.  Business size and turnover, and sector, they were imputed from Inland Revenue data provided with the original sample. Value of time analysis For comparative purposes, converting the internal time spent on tax compliance activities into a monetary value was undertaken on the same basis as for the 2004 and 2009 surveys. This process relied on the following assumptions:  There is no difference in the monetary value of time between respondents completing the short income tax survey questionnaire and those completing the long multi-tax survey questionnaire – i.e. that they are “equivalent” small and medium businesses. This enables a focus on differences in business size and the role of the person involved.  Little significant value can be gained by introducing the complexity of value of time across sector type.  Trimmed means are a more useful measurement to use for respondent-provided data than are medians, which are lower values. Therefore, trimmed means have been used. Owners/partners/directors/trustees While calculating the value of time, based on reported hourly wage rates, is a relatively straightforward process for paid employees, the same cannot be necessarily said of owners, partners, directors and trustees. Selecting a value to apply to owners’ time is less objective, because owners may be dealing with the business’s tax compliance work outside of ‘working hours’, in what would otherwise be their leisure time. That said, given the fact that the variation in reported values across business size is relatively small, one figure has been used to assign a value to the time of owners, partners, directors and/or trustees, based upon respondent data (see table below). This has been done to ensure consistency with the approach taken in both 2004 and 2009. The value of time figures used for owners/partners/directors/trustees was $61.13 per hour. Table 3.4 Value of time data relating to owners Survey Data (Mean $/hr) Nil employees Micro (1-5) Small (6-19) Medium (20+) $62.55 $55.09 $60.93 $75.93 Total $61.13 Paid employees In line with the approach taken in both the 2004 and 2009 surveys, the value of time used for the 2013 survey relies on external data; that is, the Quarterly Employee Survey September 2013. Again, given the small variation across business sizes, and to maintain comparability with the previous tax compliance surveys, only one figure for all business size groupings has been used. The value of time figure used for paid employees was $28.03 per hour. SME tax compliance costs 2013 22 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Unpaid friends or relatives It is more difficult to place a monetary value on the time of unpaid friends or relatives who are dealing with businesses’ tax compliance activities, as it is not clear whose time in the business they are “replacing” or if they are replacing the services of an external tax advisor. For this reason, and to maintain consistency with the approach taken in both 2004 and 2009, we decided to use respondent-provided data, as averaged across all business sizes. The value of time figure used for unpaid friends or relatives was $38.69 per hour. Table 3.5: Value of time data relating to unpaid friends/relatives Survey Data (Mean $/hr) Nil employees Micro (1-5) Small (6-19) Medium (20+) $42.50 $41.82 $25.00 $16.00 Total $38.69 SME tax compliance costs 2013 23 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Section 4.

SME tax compliance costs 2013 28 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Section 5. Internal time compliance costs: All tax activities This section examines the internal time that businesses spend on tax compliance activities, followed by an analysis of the value of that time and estimates of internal tax compliance costs. The costs incurred by businesses through the purchase of external tax advice/services are covered in Chapter 11. Both means and medians are reported in this section. In some instances these are markedly different, reflecting the skewed nature of the data. This is due to the large number of SMEs reporting annual hours at the lower end of the overall distribution. This remains the case even though the means have been trimmed. Internal time spent on specific tax activities Annualised time spent by businesses on specific taxes and tax activities Respondents were asked to estimate the average number of hours per month the business had spent on tax activities during the preceding 12 months. For each tax type, they were asked to record this information by tax activity. Although monthly data were collected for analysis and reporting purposes, these data have been converted to annual figures. Table 5.1 (mean) and Table 5.2 (medians) detail the amount of time in annual hours spent on specific tax activities for each tax type. Figures 5.1 and 5.2 summarise the total hours spent on tax activities, and by business size in graphical format, and demonstrate that the number of hours varies significantly when viewed by tax type, and by business size. The mean number of hours businesses reported spending across all tax types annually was x ̄ =83.8 hours. The highest mean number of hours was reported for GST (x ̄ =39.3 hours). The single most commonly reported activity was recording information (x ̄ =36.4 hours across all tax types), followed by calculating tax/completing and filing returns/paying tax (x ̄ =16.4 hours). Of note, across all tax types, the mean annual hours of internal time spent tends to increase with business size, with the exception of mean hours spent on FBT by “small” and “medium businesses”. While the variances between the median hours spent on all tax activities also increase by size of business between “nil” and “micro” (increase of 40 hours) and “micro” and “small” (increase of 40 hours), the observed increase in median hours spent between “small” and “medium” businesses (increase of 8.0 hours), is not statistically significant (see Table 5.4). The survey also shows that there is a strong relationship between business size and the number of hours spent on most individual tax activities per year (i.e. recording information, etc.), between “nil” and “micro” businesses and “micro” and “small” businesses, particularly in relation to recording information, and calculating tax/completing and filing returns/paying tax. Figure 5.4 provides a graphical representation of the number of hours spent internally per annum by SMEs dealing with a range of different tax-compliance related activities, broken down by business size, while Table 5.5 provides an annualised break down of hours spent on all tax activities by tax type, rather than by the specific tax activities as described above.

SME tax compliance costs 2013 34 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Internal time spent on specific tax activities by specific types of personnel Internal time on tax activities by different personnel groups For each tax type, respondents were asked to estimate how many hours per month, on average, was spent by three different categories of personnel on business-related tax activities during the preceding 12 months period. These data have been converted into annualised hour figures and are detailed in Table 5.6 (means) and Table 5.7 (medians). A graphical representation of the trimmed means data is presented in Figure 5.4 One of the main findings is that the number of hours spent on tax increases as business size increases, and this increase is most marked for owners/partners/directors/trustees in “nil” and “micro” businesses, while the increase among paid employees is most marked between “small” and “medium” businesses. Owners/partners/directors/trustees were the personnel group spending the most combined internal time on tax activities for all tax types (x ̄ =52.5 hours), and contributing the most significantly to hours spent by “all personnel” total of (x ̄ =74.9 hours). Paid employees were the personnel group which spent the second greatest amount of time across all tax activities (x ̄ =16.5 hours), while the number of hours expended by unpaid friends or relatives was relatively negligible (x ̄ =2.3 hours). When viewed by median hours, owners/partners/ directors/trustees spent x ̄ =30 hours, while the median hours spent by both paid employees and unpaid friends and family were both below zero. Table 5.8 (means) and Table 5.9 (medians) detail the amount of time that different types of personnel spent on all tax activities by size of business (as defined in terms of number of employees). Figure 5.4 provides a graphical representation of the mean hours reported for each personal group by size of business. What these data show is that the number of hours by owners/partners/directors/trustees increases significantly between “nil” and “micro” businesses (an increase of 19.4 hours), increases moderately between “micro” and “small” businesses (an increase of 6.5 hours), but decreases between “small” and “medium” businesses (a decrease of 28.6 hours). In contrast, the hours spent by paid employees increases significantly between “small” and “medium” businesses (an increase of 99.3 hours). The median values, as presented in Table 5.9, further emphasise the difference in personnel spending time on tax activities between “small” and “medium” businesses, with the median hours of owners/partners/directors/trustees being 34 hours for “small” businesses and seven hours for “medium” businesses, while the median hours spent by employees was 16 and 82 hours respectively.

Internal tax compliance costs: Income tax This section describes the internal tax compliance costs associated with income tax. Internal tax compliance costs associated with income tax by personnel group Table 6.1 provides a summary of the internal tax compliance costs for income tax. The first column details the internal time spent by various personnel groups (trimmed means), the second the estimated monetary compliance cost (time spent multiplied by the dollar value for that time) and the third column shows the percentage of overall tax compliance cost associated with the particular category of personnel. On average, businesses report spending x ̄ =20.5 hours on tax activities associated with income tax. This equates to $1,116 per annum as a compliance cost. The majority of this cost is generated by owners, partners, directors and/or trustees x ̄ =16.3 hours ($995, 89 percent). This is in contrast to the comparable figures for paid employees, at x ̄ =2.9 hours ($80, seven percent). Table 6.1: Summary of internal income tax compliance costs Personnel Mean (trimmed) hours Compliance cost ($) % of overall compliance cost Owners/partners/directors/trustees 16.3 (1,121) $995 (1,122) 89% Paid employees 2.9 (1,124) $80 (1,124) 7% Unpaid friends and relatives 0.8 (1,144) $30 (1,144) 3% All personnel 20.5 (1,071) $1,116 (1,104) Base: All respondents who filed/paid the particular tax type in question (excluding missing information and outliers).

Internal time spent by different personnel groups by business size Table 6.2 overleaf shows the internal time (mean trimmed annual hours) spent on income tax broken down by business size (number of employees) and by the different categories of personnel. The annualised number of hours spent by owners/partners/directors/trustees for businesses with “nil” employees is x ̄ =17.1 hours, x ̄ =14.2 hours for “micro” businesses, and x ̄ =18.1 for “small” businesses, while paid employees’ hours do not contribute significantly to the total hours spent by businesses of those sizes. In contrast, paid employees are the main contributor to the total of internal hours spent by “medium” businesses dealing with their income tax obligations (x ̄ =30.7 hours, compared with 11.9 hours by owners/partners).

Annualised internal compliance costs in dollars for income tax related activities As shown in Table 6.3, when converted to dollars, the mean annual internal compliance cost for income tax for “nil” and “micro” businesses are similar ($1,089 and $1,079, respectfully), but income tax costs increase incrementally for “small” ($1,374) and “medium” businesses ($1,529). Reflecting the respective hours contributed by each personnel group, the annualised costs are greatest for owners/partners/ directors/trustees, with the exception of “medium” businesses. Figure 6.1 shows the markedly different pattern of internal costs by personnel group for medium sized businesses, particularly compared to businesses other sized businesses. However, as noted above, for all owners, compliance costs comprise the largest dollar amounts for ”nil”, “micro” and “small” businesses.

SME tax compliance costs 2013 39 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Figure 6.1 Annual internal tax compliance costs ($) for income tax by business size and personnel group Table 6.4 shows the internal costs of income tax analysed by whether or not the business uses a Tax Advisor for income tax purposes by personnel group. When comparing businesses that use a Tax Advisor, the internal compliance costs for income tax associated with owners/partners/directors/trustees are lower than for those who do not use a Tax Advisor. Table 6.5 provides a breakdown by business size for businesses that use a Tax Advisor and those that do not, while Figure 6.2 provides a graphical representation of these data. Notably the differences between total internal costs associated with income tax are greatest between “nil” and “micro” businesses, with such businesses reporting spending the equivalent of x ̄ =$194 and x ̄ =$233 less internal time, respectively, if they use a Tax Advisor. Similarly, “small” businesses that use a Tax Advisor reported spending the equivalent of x ̄ =$144 less. While the survey results suggest that “medium” businesses that use a Tax Advisor reported spending the equivalent of x ̄ =$146 more than those that do not, the observed difference is not statistically significant due to the small sub-sample of “medium” businesses that said they did not use a Tax Advisor.

Figure 6.2 Annual internal tax compliance costs ($) for income tax by business size and use of a tax advisor SME tax compliance costs 2013 41 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Table 6.6 summarises the mean (trimmed) internal tax compliance costs in relation to income tax by business size, as determined by annual turnover. Actual costs range from $796 for businesses with annual turnovers of less than $40,000 to $1,575 for businesses with annual turnovers between $500,000 and $1,299,999. The table shows that mean tax compliance costs as a percentage of turnover decreases markedly as turnover increases. For example, total internal tax compliance costs for businesses in 2013 represent the equivalent of 2.3 percent of the 2012 mean turnover of businesses earning less than $40,000 per year. The equivalent figure for businesses with annual turnovers of between $40,000 and $99,999 is 1.7 percent.

SME tax compliance costs 2013 42 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Stress associated with provisional tax compliance Respondents were asked to indicate on a seven-point scale, where 1=Not at all stressful and 7=Extremely stressful, how stressful meeting their tax obligations for provisional tax during the last 12 months (including finding the money). Table 6.7 provides details of the percentage of respondents reporting each level of stress by business size and overall. Table 6.8 details the mean reported levels by business size and age of business respectively. Overall, 22 percent of respondents reported that there was no stress related with provisional tax compliance, while at the other extreme, seven percent reported that provisional tax compliance had been extremely stressful. Between these two extremes, 57 percent of respondents reported that provisional tax compliance had been less than moderately stressful (i.e. a rating of 1, 2 or 3); while a further 18 percent reported it as moderately stressful (a rating of 4). Figure 6.3 displays combined percentages across three bands:  Less than moderately stressful (rating of 1, 2 or 3)  Moderately stressful (rating of 4)  More than moderately stressful (rating of 5, 6 or 7). The combined percentage reporting more than moderately stressful is lowest for those SMEs with 20 plus employees (17 percent) and those with no employees (21 percent). Relatedly and as detailed in the figure, the combined percentage of respondents reporting that compliance is less than moderately stressful is highest among businesses with 20 plus employees while being lowest for those with 1-5 employees. Mean stress cores by business size and age of the business are detailed in Table 6.8, allowing one to test the hypothesis that relatively younger SMEs may find provisional tax compliance (including finding the money) more stressful than do more established SMEs. While the results suggest this may be the case for businesses that have been trading for 1-2 years, the observed differences is not statistically significant.

Internal tax compliance costs associated with GST by personnel group Table 7.1 provides a summary of the internal tax compliance costs for income tax. The first column details the internal time spent by various personnel groups (trimmed means), the second the estimated monetary compliance cost (time spent multiplied by the dollar value for that time) and the third column shows the percentage of overall tax compliance cost associated with the particular category of personnel. On average, businesses report spending 37.1 hours on tax activities associated with GST. This equates to $2,027 per annum as a compliance cost. As was the case for income tax, the majority of this cost is spent by owners/ partners/ directors/trustees x ̄ =28.0 hours ($1,711, 84 percent). This is in contrast to the comparable figures for paid employees x ̄ =6.7 hours ($187, nine percent). Table 7.1: Summary of GST tax compliance costs Personnel Mean (trimmed) hours Compliance cost ($) % of overall compliance cost Owners/partners/directors/trustees 28.0 (1,076) $1,711 (1,076) 84% Paid employees 6.7 (1,079) $187 (1,079) 9% Unpaid friends and relatives 1.2 (1,112) $46 (1,112) 2% All personnel 37.1 (1,053) $2,027 (1,067) Base: All respondents who filed/paid the particular tax type in question (excluding missing information and outliers).

Internal time spent by different personnel groups by business size Table 7.2 shows the internal time (mean trimmed annual hours) spent on GST broken down by business size (number of employees) and by the different categories of personnel. The annualised number of hours spent by owners/partners, etc. for “nil”, “micro” and “small” businesses are quite similar (between x ̄ =26.6 and x ̄ =28.5), while the hours reported by “medium” businesses for owners/partners etc. are significantly lower x ̄ =13.3 hours. In contrast, “medium” businesses reported the highest number of internal hours by paid employees x ̄ =42.4, compared with x ̄ =26.5 hours for “small” businesses and x ̄ =9.9 hours for “micro” businesses.

Annualised internal tax compliance costs in dollars for GST tax related activities As shown in Table 7.3, when converted to dollars, the mean annual internal tax compliance cost for GST generally increases as business size increases, with the largest incremental change in total costs being between businesses with nil employees and those having 1-5 employees (an increase of $423 dollars on average). When viewed by personnel group, the annualised costs resulting from paid employee time is greater the larger the business. For example, “micro” businesses reported internal GST-related costs of $278 for paid employees, compared with $743 for “small” and $1,189 for “medium” businesses. In contrast, the costs associated with owners’ time dealing with GST among “medium” businesses ($813), was roughly half that spent by smaller businesses.

Figure 7.1 overleaf shows the markedly different pattern of internal costs by personnel group for medium sized businesses, particularly compared to businesses with 1-5 employees. However, as noted above, for all owners, tax compliance costs comprise the largest dollar amounts for “nil”, “micro” and “small” businesses. SME tax compliance costs 2013 46 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Figure 7.1 Annual internal tax compliance costs ($) for GST by business size and personnel group Table 7.4 shows the internal tax compliance costs of GST analysed by whether or not the business uses a Tax Advisor for income tax purposes by personnel group. Table 7.5 provides a breakdown by business size for businesses that use a Tax Advisor and those that do not, while Figure 7.2 provides a graphical representation of these data. Notably, there are no significant differences in internal tax compliance costs, between businesses that do and do not use a Tax Advisor, at either an “all” personal level, or when viewed by personnel type. When viewed by business size, the results suggest that “nil” and “micro” businesses that use Tax Advisors have slightly lower internal costs, but the observed difference is not statistically significant, due to the relatively small sub-samples of “nil” and “micro” businesses that do not use Tax Advisors. The results also suggest that “small” and “medium” businesses that use Tax Advisors have higher costs on average, but again the observed differences are indicative only, and should be treated with some caution due to the relatively small number of such businesses reporting they do not use a Tax Advisor.

Figure 7.2 Annual internal tax compliance costs ($) for GST by business size and use of a Tax Advisor Table 7.6 summarises the mean (trimmed) internal compliance costs in relation to GST by business size, as determined by annual turnover. Actual costs range from $1,536 for businesses with annual turnovers of less than $40,000 to $2,592 for businesses with annual turnovers of $1.3 – less than $5 million. While internal tax compliance costs generally trend upward the greater a business’s turnover, mean tax compliance costs as a percentage of mean turnover decrease markedly as turnover increases. For example, the internal costs associated with GST for businesses with turnovers of less than $40,000 represent 4.5 percent of such businesses total annual turnover on average, while this decreases to 2.7 percent for businesses with annual turnovers between $40,000 and $99,999 and 1.3 percent for businesses with annual turnovers between $100,000 and $249,999.

Stress associated with GST tax compliance Respondents were asked to indicate on a seven-point scale, where 1=Not at all stressful and 7=Extremely stressful, how stressful it was during the last 12 months meeting their tax obligations for GST (including finding the money). Table 7.7 provides details of the percentage of respondents reporting each level of stress by business size and overall. Table 7.8 details the mean reported levels by business size and age of business respectively. Overall, 19 percent of respondents reported that there was no stress related with GST compliance, while at the other extreme, just five percent reported that GST compliance had been extremely stressful. Between these two extremes, 56 percent of respondents reported that GST compliance had been less than moderately stressful (i.e. a rating of 1, 2 or 3); while a further 21 percent reported it as being moderately stressful (a rating of 4). Figure 7.3 displays combined percentages across three bands:  Less than moderately stressful (rating of 1, 2 or 3)  Moderately stressful (rating of 4)  More than moderately stressful (rating of 5, 6 or 7). As detailed in the figure, the combined percentage of respondents reporting that compliance is more than moderately stressful is highest among businesses with 6-9 employees (37 percent) and those with 1-5 plus employees (32 percent). At 46 percent, businesses with 1-5 employees are also less likely to report it as being less than moderately stressful. Mean stress cores by business size and age of the business are provided in Table 7.8. As detailed in the table, small businesses reported higher stress levels overall (a rating of x ̄ =3.7) than did all GST-liable SMEs. However, when viewed by age of businesses, there were no significant differences in mean stress levels.

SME tax compliance costs 2013 51 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Section 8. Internal compliance costs: PAYE This section describes the internal tax compliance costs associated with PAYE. Internal tax compliance costs associated with PAYE by personnel group Table 8.1 provides a summary of the internal tax compliance costs for PAYE. The first column details the internal time spent by various personnel groups (trimmed means), the second the estimated monetary compliance cost (time spent multiplied by the dollar value for that time) and the third column shows the percentage of overall tax compliance cost associated with the particular category of personnel. On average, businesses report spending 25.8 hours on tax activities associated with PAYE. This equates to $1,099 per annum as a compliance cost. The majority of this cost is spent by owners/partners/directors/trustees x ̄ = 14.8 hours ($802, 73 percent). This is in contrast to the comparable figures for paid employees x ̄ =9.8 hours ($243, 22 percent). Table 8.1: Summary of PAYE tax compliance costs Personnel Mean (trimmed) hours Compliance cost ($) % of overall compliance cost Owners/partners/directors/trustees 14.8 (830) $802 (861) 73% Paid employees 9.8 (825) $243 (855) 22% Unpaid friends and relatives 1.4 (837) $47 (867) 4% All personnel 25.8 (805) $1,099 (843) Base: All respondents who filed/paid the particular tax type in question (excluding missing information and outliers).

Internal time spent by different personnel groups by business size Table 8.2 shows the internal time (mean trimmed annual hours) spent on PAYE broken down by business size (number of employees) and by the different categories of personal. The annualised number of hours spent by owners/partners etc., for businesses with 1-5 employees is x ̄ =16.4 hours, while owners/partners etc., in businesses with 6-19 employees reported spending x ̄ =20.2 hours on PAYE. In contrast, owners/partners etc., of “medium” businesses reported spending significantly fewer hours (x ̄ =7.2) with most of the internal hours on PAYE being spent by employees (x ̄ =37.5).

Annualised internal tax compliance costs in dollars for PAYE tax related activities As shown in Table 8.3, when converted to dollars, the mean annual internal tax compliance cost for PAYE increases for “small” and “medium” businesses ($1,798 and $1,731) are much greater than PAYE internal costs for “micro” businesses ($1,241). When viewed by personnel group, the annualised costs are greatest among owners/partners/ directors/trustees of “micro” ($985) and “small” ($1,237) businesses. In contrast, the annualised costs for owners/partners, etc. of “medium” businesses are significantly lower ($438 on average). The survey findings also indicate that the annualised internal tax compliance costs for PAYE, associated with paid employee time, increase significantly the larger the business.

Figure 8.1 overleaf shows the markedly different pattern of internal costs by personnel group for medium sized businesses, particularly compared to businesses with 1-5 employees. However, as noted above, owners’ compliance costs comprise the largest dollar amounts for SMEs as a whole. SME tax compliance costs 2013 53 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Figure 8.1 Annual internal tax compliance costs ($) for PAYE by business size and personnel group Table 8.4 shows the internal costs of PAYE analysed by whether or not the business uses a Tax Advisor for PAYE purposes by personnel group. Table 8.5 provides a breakdown by business size for businesses that use a Tax Advisor and those that do not, while Figure 8.2 provides a graphical representation of these data. Notably the internal compliance costs for businesses that do not use a Tax Advisor are higher than for those that do, when viewed by personnel type, as well as business size.

Figure 8.2 Annual internal tax compliance costs ($) for PAYE by business size and use of a Tax Advisor Table 8.6 summarises the mean (trimmed) internal tax compliance costs in relation to PAYE by business size, as determined by annual turnover. Actual costs range from $579 for businesses with annual turnovers of between $40,000 and $99,999 to $1,892 for businesses with annual turnovers of between $1.3 million and $5 million. As is the case with previous tax specific sections on income tax and GST, mean tax compliance costs as a percentage of annual turnover decrease as turnover increases. However, as it comprises a smaller proportion of all respondents’ mean annual turnover, the decrease is not as marked as that seen for income tax and GST.

Source: long survey questionnaire Q4, Q13b and Q19. Stress associated with PAYE tax compliance Respondents were asked to indicate on a seven-point scale, where 1=Not at all stressful and 7=Extremely stressful, how stressful it was meeting their tax obligations for PAYE during the last 12 months (including finding the money). Table 8.7 provides details of the percentage of respondents reporting each level of stress by business size and overall. Table 8.8 details the mean reported levels by business size and age of business respectively. Overall, 20 percent of respondents reported that there was no stress related with PAYE compliance, while at the other extreme, three percent reported that PAYE compliance had been extremely stressful. Between these two extremes, 62 percent of respondents reported that PAYE compliance had been less than moderately stressful (i.e. a rating of 1, 2 or 3); while a further 18 percent reported it as moderately stressful (a rating of 4). Figure 8.3 displays combined percentages across three bands:  Less than moderately stressful (rating of 1, 2 or 3)  Moderately stressful (rating of 4)  More than moderately stressful (rating of 5, 6 or 7). The combined percentage reporting more than moderately stressful is lowest for those businesses with 20 plus employees (12 percent), while it is highest for those with 6-19 employees (27 percent). SMEs with 20 plus employees were also more likely to report that it was less than moderately stressful (73 percent). Because of the large number of suppressed cells, when viewed by business size and age, mean stress cores broken down by those variables have not been provided based on business age in Table 8.8 . As detailed in the table, the mean stress score for PAYE, for all businesses, is x ̄ =3.1, with small businesses reporting a higher than average score of x ̄ =3.3, while the mean stress rating for medium businesses is x ̄ =2.7.

Internal tax compliance costs associated with KiwiSaver by personnel group Table 9.1 provides a summary of the internal tax compliance costs for KiwiSaver. The first column details the internal time spent by various personnel groups (trimmed means), the second the estimated monetary compliance cost (time spent multiplied by the dollar value for that time) and the third column shows the percentage of overall tax compliance cost associated with the particular category of personnel. On average, businesses report spending x ̄ =14.9 hours on tax activities associated with KiwiSaver. This equates to $459 per annum as a compliance cost. Unlike the other tax types discussed in this report, the average number of hours spent by owners/partners/directors/trustees x ̄ =7.7 is similar to that spent by paid employees x ̄ =6.7. However, because owners/partners, etc. place a higher value on an hour of their time, their annualised costs when converted to dollars are much higher ($338, 74 percent), when compared with those for paid employees ($134, 29 percent). Table 9.1: Summary of KiwiSaver tax compliance costs Personnel Mean (trimmed) hours Compliance cost ($) % of overall compliance cost Owners/partners/directors/trustees 7.7 (573) $338 (645) 74% Paid employees 6.7 (568) $134 (640) 29% Unpaid friends and relatives 0 (569) $0 (641) 0% All personnel 14.9 (553) $459 (633) Base: All respondents who filed/paid the particular tax type in question (excluding missing information and outliers).

Internal time spent by different personnel groups by business size Table 9.2 shows the internal time (mean trimmed annual hours) spent on KiwiSaver broken down by business size (number of employees) and by the different categories of personal. The annualised number of hours spent by owners/partners, etc. with 1-5 employees (x ̄ =8.8 hours) or 6-19 employees (x ̄ =7.1 hours) are significantly higher than that reported by “medium” businesses (x ̄ =2.2 hours). In contrast “medium” businesses reported significantly higher hours being spent on KiwiSaver by employees (x ̄ =17.6 hours), than did “small” (x ̄ =9.4 hours) or “micro” (x ̄ =4.7 hours) businesses on average.

Annualised internal tax compliance costs in dollars for KiwiSaver tax related activities As shown in Table 9.3, when converted to dollars, the mean annual internal tax compliance cost for KiwiSaver is relatively consistent, regardless of business size, with there being no statistically significant differences in the dollar amounts for “micro”, “small” or “medium” businesses. However, as shown in the table, the costs associated with owners/partners/directors/trustees are significantly lower for “medium” sized businesses ($134, compared with $458 for “micro” and $403 for “small” businesses). In contrast, the cost associated with paid employees’ time is significantly higher for “medium” businesses ($489, compared with $245 and $111 for “small” and “micro” businesses respectively).

Table 9.5 provides a breakdown by business size for businesses that use a Tax Advisor and those that do not, while Figure 9.2 provides a graphical representation of these data. Notably, the survey findings suggest that businesses that use Tax Advisors have higher owners/ partners/etc., internal compliance costs, as measured in dollars, than do businesses which do not use a Tax Advisor. However, due to the relatively smaller sub-sample of businesses that do not use a Tax Advisor, the observed difference should be viewed as indicative only. Similarly, while the results suggest that, at the all personnel level, businesses that do not use a Tax Advisor have lower KiwiSaver-related internal costs than do businesses which use Tax Advisors, the observed difference should be viewed as indicative only and treated with some caution. Due to the relatively small sub-samples involved, any variance in KiwiSaver-related internal costs for businesses that use a Tax Advisor are significantly different than for SMEs that do not use as Tax Advisor, when viewed by business size, should be treated with caution.

Actual costs are relatively equivalent when viewed by respondents’ respective annual turnovers, and while the results suggest that SMEs with annual turnover of between $100,000 and $249,000 have higher internal costs on average, the observed difference is not statistically significant. Due to the relatively low internal costs associated with KiwiSaver compliance, as a percent of turnover, costs range from just 0.4 percent for SMEs with annual turnovers of between $40,000 to $99,999, to being negligible for those with annual turnovers of $1.3 million or higher.

Source: long survey questionnaire Q4, Q13b and Q19. Stress associated with KiwiSaver tax compliance Respondents were asked to indicate on a seven-point scale, where 1=Not at all stressful and 7=Extremely stressful, how stressful it was meeting their tax obligations for KiwiSaver during the last 12 months (including finding the money). Table 9.7 provides details of the percentage of respondents reporting each level of stress by business size and overall. Table 9.8 details the mean reported levels by business size and age of business respectively. Overall, 16 percent of respondents reported that there was no stress related with KiwiSaver compliance, while at the other extreme, three percent reported that KiwiSaver compliance had been extremely stressful. Between these two extremes, 63 percent of respondents reported that KiwiSaver compliance had been less than moderately stressful (i.e. a rating of 1, 2 or 3); while a further 16 percent reported is as moderately stressful (a rating of 4). Figure 9.3 displays combined percentages across three bands:  Less than moderately stressful (rating of 1, 2 or 3)  Moderately stressful (rating of 4)  More than moderately stressful (rating of 5, 6 or 7). The combined percentage reporting more than moderately stressful is lowest for those SMEs with 20 plus employees (nine percent), while it is highest among those with 6-19 employees (24 percent). As detailed in the figure, the combined percentage of respondents reporting that compliance is less than moderately stressful is highest among businesses with 20 plus employees (80 percent), while similar for “micro” (62 percent) “small” SMEs (62 percent). SME tax compliance costs 2013 63 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Mean stress scores by business size are detailed in Table 9.9, and show that the mean stress score reported by all businesses was x ̄ =3.1, with “medium” businesses reporting the lowest average stress score (x ̄ =2.6) and “small” businesses reporting slight higher stress scores on average x ̄ = 3.2 Table 9.7: Percentage of respondents reporting levels of stress associated with KiwiSaver tax compliance by business size Level of reported stress Nil employees Micro (1-5) (n=186) Small (6-19) (n=199) Medium (20+) (n=159) All (n=544) 1 (not at all stressful) --- 13% 17% 32% 16% 2 --- 31% 29% 21% 29% 3 --- 18% 16% 27% 18% 4 (moderately stressful) --- 18% 13% 10% 16% 5 --- 11% 11% 3% 10% 6 --- 8% 8% 2% 7% 7 (highly stressful) --- 2% 5% 4% 3% Base: All respondents who filed/paid KiwiSaver excluding those who indicated ‘not applicable’).

Internal tax compliance costs associated with FBT by personnel group Table 10.1 provides a summary of the internal tax compliance costs for FBT. The first column details the internal time spent by various personnel groups (trimmed means), the second the estimated monetary compliance cost (time spent multiplied by the dollar value for that time) and the third column shows the percentage of overall tax compliance cost associated with the particular category of personnel. On average, businesses report spending x ̄ = 11.4 hours on tax activities associated with FBT. This equates to $197 per annum as a tax compliance cost. As was the case with KiwiSaver internal hours, the mean annualised hours spent by owners/partners, etc. (x ̄ =4.3 hours) are equivalent to that spent by paid employees (x ̄ = 4.2 hours). However, the majority of the dollar costs relate to time spent by owners/partners, etc. ($124, 63 percent) compared with the time spent by employees ($56, 28 percent), due to owners placing a higher dollar value on an hour of their time. Table 10.1: Summary of FBT compliance costs Personnel Mean (trimmed) hours Compliance cost ($) % of overall compliance cost Owners/partners/directors/trustees 4.3 (285) $124 63% Paid employees 4.2 (282) $56 28% Unpaid friends and relatives 0.1 (291) $1 1% All personnel 11.4 (268) $197 Base: All respondents who filed/paid the particular tax type in question (excluding missing information and outliers). Source: long survey questionnaire Q13b and Q13c. Note: percentages may not add to 100% due to rounding. Internal time spent by different personnel groups by business size Table 10.2 shows the internal time (mean trimmed annual hours) spent on FBT broken down by business size (number of employees) and by the different categories of personal. The annualised number of hours spent by all personnel tends to increase the larger the business. For example “micro” businesses reported spending x ̄ = 10.5 hours per annum dealing with FBT, compared with x ̄ = 16.3 and 15.8 hours by “small” and “medium” businesses respectively. The annualised number of hours spent by owners/partners, etc. ranged from x ̄ = 4.8 for “micro business” to x ̄ =2.9 for “medium” sized businesses; however, the observed difference is not statistically significant. In contrast, the hours spent by paid employees increases significantly when viewed by business size, with “medium” businesses reporting that paid employees spend x ̄ = 12.8 hours per annum dealing with FBT, compared with x ̄ = 2.4 hours by “micro” businesses.

Annualised internal tax compliance costs in dollars for FBT tax related activities As shown in Table 10.3, when converted to dollars, the mean annual internal tax compliance costs among “micro” businesses” are significantly lower ($204) than the dollars costs for “small” and “medium” businesses ($454 and $513 respectively). When viewed by personnel group, the annualised costs are greatest for paid employees among “medium” sized businesses ($337, compared with $38 dollars for “micro” business). “Medium” businesses also reported higher paid- employee related internal costs when compared with those reported by “small” businesses ($164); however, the observed difference should be viewed with some caution, as it is not statistically significant.

When comparing businesses that use a Tax Advisor and those which do not. Table 10.5 provides a breakdown by business size for businesses that use a Tax Advisor and those that do not. While the results suggest that businesses that do not use a Tax Advisor have higher FBT-related internal costs, as measured by dollars, than do business that use a Tax Advisor; however, the observed difference is not statistically significant and should be treated as indicative only. This is due to the small sub-sample of FBT-liable businesses that do not use a Tax Advisor. Due to the small sub-sample of FBT-liable businesses that do not use a Tax Advisor, comparisons by business size are not possible. As such, no graphical representation in relation to costs by business size and Tax Advisor use has been provided in this section.

SME tax compliance costs 2013 69 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Stress associated with FBT tax compliance Respondents were asked to indicate on a seven-point scale, where 1=Not at all stressful and 7=Extremely stressful, how stressful it was meeting their tax obligations for FBT during the last 12 months (including finding the money). Table 10.7 provides details of the percentage of respondents reporting each level of stress by business size and overall. Table 10.8 details the mean reported levels by business size and age of business respectively. Overall, 26 percent of respondents reported that there was no stress related with FBT compliance, while at the other extreme, two percent reported that FBT tax compliance was extremely stressful. Between these two extremes, 73 percent of respondents reported that FBT tax compliance had been less than moderately stressful (i.e. a rating of 1, 2 or 3); while a further nine percent reported is as moderately stressful (a rating of 4). Figure 10.3 displays combined percentages across three bands:  Less than moderately stressful (rating of 1, 2 or 3)  Moderately stressful (rating of 4)  More than moderately stressful (rating of 5, 6 or 7). The combined percentage reporting more than moderately stressful is lowest for those SMEs with no employees (three percent), while 21 percent of FBT-liable SMEs with 1-5 employees found compliance to be more than moderately stressful. Relatedly, as detailed in the figure, the combined percentage of respondents reporting that compliance is less than moderately stressful is highest among businesses with no employees and lowest for those with 1-5 employees. Due to the small sub-samples of FBT-liable businesses, the breakdown by age or business has been suppressed, as most cells had fewer than 20 respondents. The overall mean stress score reported by FBT-liable SMEs was 2.8.

External tax advisor costs This section reports on external tax compliance costs; that is, payments made for tax services from advisors such as external accountants, tax agents or lawyers. Use of, and payment for, external Tax Advisor services - business survey data Table 11.1 presents the proportion of businesses that paid for any tax advice in the last 12 months, from an advisor outside of their business, with a breakdown of tax types to which the payments related. The percentages are calculated on the basis of respondents who filed the particular tax type in question as indicated in brackets. Overall, 80 percent of respondents paid for external tax advice. This is relatively consistent by business size, but does vary by type of tax. External advice is used mostly for income tax (79 percent of respondents paying income tax), GST (47 percent of respondents paying GST) and FBT (42 percent of respondents paying FBT), and least for KiwiSaver (15 percent of respondents paying KiwiSaver).

Tax advisor sub-survey A Tax Advisor sub-survey was conducted to provide a breakdown of external tax compliance costs for SMEs who used Tax Advisors, but were unable to provide the necessary detail directly. In the following parts of this section, data from this sub-survey has been combined with data from the business survey to give an overall view of external tax compliance costs. A profile of the Tax Advisor sample is given overleaf in Table 11.2 with a comparison from the business survey. The business survey data is only based on businesses that used external tax advice services. Both samples are very similar in terms of entity type, taxes paid and business size.

External tax compliance costs by tax type Imputed data have been used for the data presented in Tables 11.3 and 11.4. 12 Table 11.3 presents external tax compliance costs by tax type and business size as determined by the number of employees. On average, SMEs pay $1,856 annually to external Tax Advisors. Overall, regardless of size, income tax accounts for a substantially large proportion of their external tax compliance costs. The average annual cost for income tax for all SMEs is $1,469, compared with $437 for GST. In contrast PAYE, at $29, FBT at $19 and KiwiSaver at just $2 account for relatively small proportions of the overall external tax compliance costs paid by SMEs. As business size increases, so do external tax compliance costs. On average, these costs range from $1,423 for businesses with no employees through to $4,960 for those with 20 or more employees. Across all tax types, the amount of external tax compliance costs paid by tax-specific liable businesses increases the larger the business, with this particularly being the case for income tax and GST. 12 See relevant section in chapter 3 for details of the data imputation process.

Figure 11.1 Mean (trimmed) external tax compliance costs by tax type Figure 11.1 above graphically illustrates the variance in external tax costs by tax type. Table 11.4 and Figure 11.2 overleaf breakdown external tax compliance costs by business size as determined by annual turnover. The general trend is for external tax compliance costs to increase as annual turnover increases. Table 11.5 presents these mean compliance costs as a percentage of annual turnover. External tax compliance costs, as a percentage of annual turnover, decrease markedly as annual turnover increases. For businesses with an annual turnover of less than $40,000, external tax compliance costs are 3.4 percent of turnover on average. At the other extreme end of the scale, external tax compliance costs are proportionally negligible for businesses with an annual turnover of $5 million and over.

SME tax compliance costs 2013 76 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Section 12. Payroll services This section examines payroll services. Table 12.1 shows the percentage of businesses that use external payroll services and the mean payment made by those businesses for those services. Just six percent of respondents reported utilising external payroll services. The mean amount paid for external payroll services ranges from $537 for “micro” businesses to $3,133 for “medium” SMEs, with the mean dollar amount for all SMEs that use external payroll services being $1,053. Due to the small numbers of respondents utilising an external payroll services, cost comparisons by business size should be viewed as indicative only. However, it does make sense that SMEs that employs a larger number of staff would have higher external payroll costs when they use such services.

Combined tax compliance costs across all SMEs This section is the culmination of the preceding analyses. It presents the overall tax compliance costs for all SMEs; that is, both internal and external costs combined. The average combined tax compliance costs for SMEs are $5,861 per year, made of $3,778 of internal time and $1,842 of external costs (see Table 13.4). It is important to note that the approach taken in this section to calculate the overall combined costs is different to that used in previous sections. Where a respondent did not file a particular tax type, they were given a value of zero, denoting them as having no tax compliance costs for that particular tax type. This has been done to provide an “all SMEs” compliance cost picture that is not based only on those SMEs that deal with a particular tax type. In earlier sections, tax compliance costs were calculated using the base of businesses that pay/file the particular tax type in question (i.e. the mean costs for all SMEs having that particular tax obligation). Before combining the internal and the external dollars to arrive at overall combined costs figures, the next part of this section details the mean hours spent internally on tax activities. The hours are then converted into dollars in the following part of the section, “Overall combined compliance costs”. Internal time Tables 13.1 and 13.2 summarise the internal time spent on tax activities on an annual basis using mean (trimmed) values. For all tax types, the mean number of hours of internal time increases as business size increases, ranging from x ̄ =55.1 hours for businesses with no employees through to x ̄ =172.9 hours for those with 20 or more employees. Except for GST, in relation to which “small” and “medium” respondents reported spending similar amount of time, the general increase in number of hours spent internally on each tax type also increases as business size increases. Figure 13.1 graphically compares the data for the three main tax types (GST, income tax and PAYE) in terms of total hours spent by size of business (as measured by number of employees). Table 13.1: Summary of mean (trimmed) annual hours of internal time spent on all tax activities by tax type and business size (number of employees) Business size (number of employees) GST Income tax PAYE KiwiSaver FBT All tax types Nil employees 24.8 (356) 18 (348) NA NA 0.1 (368) 55.1 (357) Micro (1-5) 42.4 (368) 20.5 (359) 23 (368) 6.4 (367) 1.4 (372) 99.2 (378) Small (6-19) 51.8 (246) 24.7 (248) 38.5 (258) 12.7 (256) 3.6 (257) 134.8 (250) Medium (20+) 54.7 (173) 34.6 (177) 41.7 (181) 17.2 (186) 8.2 (185) 172.9 (176) All SMES 31.9 (1,144) 19.5 (1,132) 9.9 (1,174) 3 (1,179) 0.9 (1,183) 74.9 (1,162) Base: All respondents (excluding those who indicated ‘don’t know or ‘not applicable’) regardless of whether they pay/file a particular tax type.

While there are the odd exceptions, the overall trend is for an increase in the average annual hours as annual turnover increases (as graphically represented for the three main taxes in Figure 13.2). The exception to this is in relation to GST, with businesses having annual turnovers of between $250,000 and $499,999 reporting similar hours as those with annual turnovers of between $500,000 and $1,299,999.

SME tax compliance costs 2013 79 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Figure 13.2: Mean annual hours of internal time for main tax types by business size (turnover) The following graphs and tables summarise both mean and median tax compliance costs. As with the previous tables in this report, the base size is shown in the brackets in the tables. Where means are reported, estimated sampling errors are shown below the base sizes. Estimations of mean standard errors were done by Taylor series linearisation and take into account the design effect of weighting and sampling design. As shown in Table 13.4, the mean combined tax compliance cost across all tax types and for all SMEs is $5,861. This compares with a median cost of $3,834 (Table 13.5). Overall, mean combined tax compliance costs increase as business size increases, ranging from $4,534 for those SMEs with no employees through to $12,512 for those with 20 or more employees. This also holds for individual tax types. Figure 13.3 overleaf directly compares the main tax compliance costs for each tax type by business size. GST and income tax costs are the greatest contributors to the overall mean tax compliance costs, followed by PAYE.

SME tax compliance costs 2013 82 Prepared by: Research New Zealand As presented in Table 13.5, the overall median tax compliance cost for all SMEs is $3,834 with median values ranging from $2,995 for those SMEs with no employees to $10,440 for ‘small’ businesses (6-19 employees). Generally, the median combined internal and external tax compliance costs for individual tax types increase with business size. GST and Income tax are the only tax types where the median value for external costs is always greater than internal. Also of note are the median external costs for both KiwiSaver and FBT, which are always below zero, regardless of business size.

Source: long survey questionnaire Q4, Q9a, Q13b and Q13c; short survey questionnaire Q3, Q5b, Q5c SME tax compliance costs 2013 83 Prepared by: Research New Zealand As Figure 13.7 indicates, combined mean tax compliance costs as a percentage of turnover decreases as annual turnover increases. While compliance costs account for 11.6 percent of annual turnover for businesses with an annual turnover of less than $40,000, they represent less than one tenth of one percent of annual turnover for businesses with an annual turnover of more than $5 million. Table 13.6 overleaf summarises mean internal, external and combined costs for each tax type by business size as determined by annual turnover. The table also includes ± dollar ranges for each mean cost, based upon each cost’s margin of error. As detailed in the table, there is a clear relationship between annual turnover and combined tax compliance costs for the three main taxes paid by most SMEs (i.e. GST, Income Tax and PAYE). This is also the case for KiwiSaver and FBT, though the incremental increases by annual turnover are much less marked than can be observed in the three main taxes. Table 13.7 indicates median tax compliance costs by annual turnover. As might be expected given the relationship between size of business (as measured by annual turnover) and mean tax compliance costs, the untrimmed median tax compliance cost increases the greater the annual turnover. Overall, median tax compliance costs for businesses with an annual turnover of less $40,000 were $2,445, while the median tax compliance costs for businesses with an annual turnover of greater than $5 million were $9,193. Notably, the median compliance costs in 2013 for all SMEs for PAYE, KiwiSaver and FBT were below zero dollars.

This section also draws together the reported stress levels associated with meeting requirements for each of the individual tax types (as reported in earlier sections of this report). However, it should be noted that the stress question relating to each of the individual tax types also included any stress involved in finding the money. Therefore, the data pertaining to individual tax types are not purely psychological compliance costs as they are usually defined. Table 14.1 summaries the percentage of respondents filing a particular tax type and reporting each level of stress on a seven-point scale, where 1=not at all stressful and 7=extremely stressful. Figure 14.1 presents the same data, in relation to as Table 14.1, but grouped into three bands:  Less than moderately stressful (rating of 1-4)  Moderately stressful (rating of 4)  More than moderately stressful (rating of 5-7). The majority of respondents reported that meeting their overall tax obligations in the last 12 months (excluding the issue of finding the money) was less than moderately stressful (62 percent), while at the other extreme, three percent reported that doing so was extremely stressful (rating of “7”). Within each tax type, at least 55 percent reported that meeting their tax obligations for that particular tax was less than moderately stressful, with such responses by tax type ranging from 55 percent for KiwiSaver to 79 percent for FBT.

Table 14.2 summarises the levels of overall reported stress (scale of 1 to 7) by business size as a measure of overall psychological costs. These data are grouped into three bands in Figure 14.2. Overall, SMEs with 1-5 employees were less likely to report that meeting their tax obligations overall was less than moderately stressful (53 percent). Generally, the reported stress levels of SMEs with no employees and those with 20 plus employees were similar, and both groups were also more likely to report that meeting their tax obligations overall was less than moderately stressful. In contrast, while the percentages of SMEs with 1-5 or 6 to 19 employees in each of the different stress bands were similar, they were more likely to report that meeting their tax obligations was more than moderately stressful, when compared with SMEs with no or 20 plus employees.

Current methods and preferred ways of filing and paying taxes This section of the report summarises the results to questions which measured the frequencies with which SMEs file and pay different types of tax; the methods they used to file or pay these taxes; and their preferred methods of doing so. Frequency of filing and paying different tax types Table 15.1 details the mean (trimmed) number of times respondents filed different types of tax returns by business size in the last 12 months, and Table 15.2 describes the mean (trimmed) number of times SMEs paid these taxes. As noted in Table 15.1, The most frequently filed tax type reported by SMEs was PAYE, filed x ̄ =13.0 times on average per annum for all PAYE-liable SMEs. Similarly, the most frequently paid tax by SMEs is PAYE.

SME tax compliance costs 2013 92 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Frequency of filing and paying different tax types electronically As follow-up questions, respondents were asked how many of their filings and payments were done electronically. Table 15.3 details what percentage of SMEs, who filed different types of tax returns in the last 12 months, did so electronically, and Table 15.4 details the percentage of tax payments that were done electronically as well. As detailed in Table 15.3, respondents most frequently filed GST electronically (98 percent), followed by PAYE (96 percent) and FBT (88 percent). In comparison, fewer SMEs reported filing their RWT returns electronically (32 percent), although at 78 percent, “medium” businesses are significantly more likely to report having done so. Table 15.4 shows that the percentages of tax filing/paying SMEs who reported paying their taxes electronically are similar to the proportions filing electronically.

SME tax compliance costs 2013 93 Prepared by: Research New Zealand Preferred methods for filing and paying different tax types Respondents were asked their preferred method(s) for filing and paying different tax types. Table 15.5 details their preferences for filings different types of tax returns, while Table 15.6 details their preferences for making different types of tax payments As detailed in Table 15.5, while the majority of SMEs reported filing their GST electronically (98 percent), smaller proportions reported that this was their preferred filing method (50 percent), with 36 percent preferring to file by post. Similarly, while the majority of SMEs reported paying their GST electronically (96 percent), smaller proportions reported that this was their preferred paying method (60 percent), with 32 percent preferring to pay by post. This pattern is reflected in the current methods and preferences for filing and paying all other tax types as well.

Concluding comments This report reflects the self-reported tax compliance costs of small and medium businesses in New Zealand as defined in the Glossary at the beginning of the report. It draws together survey data from New Zealand’s small and medium businesses and their tax agents, alongside information from Inland Revenue’s administrative records, to create a detailed picture of how much it costs SMEs to meet their tax requirements. An accompanying publication provides comparisons between 2009 and 2004 SME tax compliance costs. These two reports collectively address the research objectives of measuring SME tax compliance costs in 2013 and measuring the change in SME tax compliance costs since 2004.

Internal time – excludes those who spent zero hours Table C.1 give the number of yours spent on specific tax activities for each tax type. The number of hours in each cell has been calculated using mean (trimmed) unweighted data, using a base that excludes respondents that indicated they spent zero hours (for that tax activity in relation to that tax type) but they do file/pay that tax. It is useful in understanding this is the time actually spent on each activity.

External costs based on tax obligations Table D.1 presents external compliance costs by tax type and business size. The amounts under each tax type relate to the mean (trimmed) payment made for external advice in regard to that tax type among business that file that tax type, regardless of whether or not they pay for external advice. Those who do not pay for external tax services relating to that tax type, but file/pay that tax type, have been given a value of zero and included in these calculations. The final “All” column is based on all businesses and gives the average payment made for tax services relating to any tax type according to business size. Again businesses that do not pay for external tax services have been allocated a zero value and included in these calculations.

Payment for external tax services – comparison of tax advisor and business survey data Of the 174 tax advisors who completed questionnaires, there were 109 responses where both the advisor and the SME had reported a dollar value of external costs. The comparison below in Figure E.1 uses those 109 instances. In the other 65 cases a comparison cannot be made because either the advisor or the SME did not provide a dollar value. Comparing the 109 instances where both the SME and the advisor reported external costs, 23 percent are within $100 of each other. In 53 percent of comparisons, SMEs reported higher costs than did their advisors. Figure E.1: All SMEs (n=109, r=0.51) SME tax compliance costs 2013 106 Prepared by: Research New Zealand F.

Speech

14 March 2014

### Address to IFA annual conference

Thank you for inviting me to be here today — the most prestigious tax policy conference in New Zealand.  
  
This is my first time addressing you and I imagine I am but the latest in a long line of Revenue Ministers you’ve seen. I’m told that IFA was founded in 1938. It was a very different world then.  
  
For instance, today we all use terms like ‘apps’, ‘software’, ‘googling’ and ‘Facebook’, which I am not planning to close down by the way.  
  
My counterpart from 1938 would think we speak a different language.  
  
The point is that these linguistic changes are indicators of positive changes that New Zealand and the rest of the world are going through: the effects of electronic communication and globalisation.  
  
It is also worth reminding ourselves of the sheer volume of work Inland Revenue deals with these days. During the last financial year IRD had nearly 7.5 million registered customers; it collected $53.8 billion worth of revenue, received 4.6 million phone calls to its call centre, and had 18.4 million hits on its website.  
  
On anybody’s scale these are big numbers, which makes it even more important to ensure that revenue gathering is as efficient and customer-orientated as possible.  
  
In this context let me briefly touch on the economy, although I am aware the Minister of Finance will be speaking to you in more detail about this later today.

### Economy

The Government’s economic programme is delivering positive results.  
  
On average, wages are increasing faster than inflation, business confidence is at its highest level in 20 years and the terms of trade remain high. There are over 66,000 more people employed now than a year ago, and the unemployment rate, currently at 6 per cent, continues to drop.  
  
The New Zealand economy continues to expand, growing at 3 ½ per cent in the year to September 2013. This was among the higher annual growth rates in the developed world.  
  
However, while the economic recovery is gathering momentum, the global environment still remains uncertain.  
  
It is important, therefore, to maintain clear and credible economic and fiscal settings, as this is the best way to encourage growth, create new jobs, raise incomes, and help families get ahead.  
  
The Government is on track to deliver a modest surplus in 2014/15.  
  
However, that is not a reason to throw the baby out with the bathwater.  
  
Unlike our opponents the National-led Government remains committed to responsible long-term fiscal management, we will not be sucked into an election year lolly-scramble as Labour and the Greens will be.  
  
Budget 2014 will continue the Government’s priorities of:

*   Responsibly managing its own finances and returning to surplus.
*   Pushing ahead with wide-ranging microeconomic reforms to create a more productive and competitive economy.
*   Driving better results and better value for money from public services.
*   And supporting the rebuilding of Christchurch.

Providing we continue to responsibly manage the recovery, New Zealand is well-placed to take advantage of the many economic opportunities available to us over the next few years.  
  
Looking into the future, New Zealand faces the need to fund the rising expenditures associated with an ageing population.  
  
With our broad tax base, there are not many candidates for further revenue-raising by broadening tax bases.  
  
Therefore it is critical to maintain the revenue raising capacity of our existing tax system.  
  
A misguided attempt to direct economic activity by reintroducing cost-ineffective tax incentives into the tax code could severely impair our ability to fund critical government expenditures in the future.  
  
So we need to consider how we gather revenue.  
  
Two areas are important in this regard: tax policy and the administration of the tax system.  
  
First, let me talk about tax policy.

### Tax policy

While we embrace globalisation, it comes with its own challenges.  
  
In taxation we see globalisation changing the way we view national tax policies. On the one hand, the ability of a government to tax its citizens and the income generated in its country according to rules it determines is fundamental to national sovereignty.  
  
On the other, tax policy must increasingly consider global contexts.  
  
We in New Zealand, as in many other countries, remember only a few decades ago that trade flows were significantly hampered by import barriers, and international capital flows strictly controlled by the central bank.  
  
And in the early 80s we also saw tax bases reduced by a plethora of special deductions and exemptions, leading to complexity for tax administrations and taxpayers, uncertainty of tax revenues for government and distortions of economic activity.  
  
A series of avoidance schemes caused unanticipated shortfalls in government revenues. In turn, the need for frequent amendments to the law to plug the loopholes increased business uncertainty and the sense of complexity.  
  
That has now dramatically changed, to the great benefit of our economy and our standard of living.  
  
Our broad base, low rate framework for tax policy acts to promote revenue integrity. It keeps administrative and compliance costs as low as possible. And by avoiding complex rules and frequent change of the system, it promotes business certainty.  
  
Businesses can plan their affairs without worrying about the future tax consequences of their decisions.  
  
Our focus has been on ensuring that the burden is fairly and efficiently shared, in fact, as well as theory. That is, everyone pays the tax that they should. Otherwise taxes on other taxpayers must rise which discourages productive activity.  
  
Our tax system relies on voluntary compliance which works as long as most people see that the tax system is fair.

### BEPS

One area that is critical to having a fair distribution of taxes is combatting tax avoidance. The area where this issue is most in the news is Base Erosion and Profit Shifting or “BEPS”.  
  
BEPS is a problem where companies can arrange their affairs so that profits earned in a taxable jurisdiction are either allocated to a low-tax jurisdiction, or are subject to arrangements that result in no taxable profits being declared anywhere.  
  
New Zealand has not been sitting on its hands.  
  
In domestic rules applying to such income, we have already made considerable progress. The international tax review, which exempted active income of companies that was earned abroad from New Zealand tax, contained a number of provisions that were designed to protect New Zealand from the base erosion strategies that have been identified as part of the BEPS project.  
  
These rules included the thin capitalisation rules, taxation of passive income of controlled foreign companies and a series of anti-arbitrage rules. Such rules limit the ability of companies to shelter income from any tax by exploiting differences in the tax rules of different countries.  
  
Work continues to refine our domestic rules. I think it’s fair to say that New Zealand’s rules in this area are as good as any, and better than most.  
  
Further progress on the BEPS issue will require collective action by the international community led by the OECD, the principle standard setting body in the area of international taxation.  
  
Decisions by the OECD can have an impact on the interpretation of tax treaties and can affect the allocation of taxes among countries. It is important that New Zealand participates in the development of these standards to ensure that they apply properly in the New Zealand context. At the same time, work at the OECD may help New Zealand in its on-going process of ensuring that its domestic rules in this area are best practice.  
  
Proposals have been identified and the OECD sub-committees are scheduled to report from as early as September this year. Compared to the typical rate of progress in international bodies, this is rapid response.  
  
At the same time it must be recognised that the eventual success of the exercise will depend upon other jurisdictions updating their domestic tax laws to international best practice.  
  
I am greatly encouraged to see the BEPS proposals announced last week by President Obama. This signals that this anti-BEPS work is real. It’s happening. Governments are taking it seriously and it’s moving out of the realm of working parties and into solid proposals.  
  
And I want to emphasise that being anti-BEPS is not anti-business. This is not a tax grab.  
  
The goal is to make company taxes more transparent and even in their application across companies and countries. Companies should pay tax somewhere; ideally in the right place.  
  
It is not in the interest of New Zealand businesses and individual taxpayers, if multinational companies can avoid paying their fair level of taxes in New Zealand or elsewhere.  
  
Countering BEPS helps to level the playing field. Moreover, if New Zealand suffers base-erosion due to BEPS, other taxes must increase to make up the difference, which can reduce the efficiency and competitiveness of the New Zealand economy.

### Digital economy

Linked to BEPS is the question of taxing high profile companies which operate online.  
  
The challenge of taxing the digital economy has attracted a lot of press coverage and comments. This is a complicated area. There are three main issues that arise with the digital economy, and it is important not to confuse them.  
  
Some firms in the digital economy are able to arrange their affairs so that they do not pay tax anywhere, i.e. the BEPS problem.  
  
Some aspects of the current taxing framework may not be well adapted to how business is conducted in the digital economy.  
  
Firms can derive income from advertising and using data from users in a country, without paying tax in that country.

#### The digital economy and BEPS

Non-taxation of income from digital firms through allocation of income to tax havens or through financing, use of hybrids and transfer pricing of IP is neither new to, nor confined to, digital industries.  
  
There may be some extra pressure due to the high level of profits attributable to IP in the digital economy. But the policy issues are essentially the same as with more traditional sectors.  
  
Anti-BEPS rules, such as CFC rules, anti-tax haven rules, and addressing shifting profits through moving IP, are equally applicable to digital and non-digital industries.

Much commentary has arisen from the fact that some companies do not pay tax in countries where the consumers of their services reside. The company does not need to establish a physical presence within the country of residence of the consumer.  
  
Revenue arises from the sale of advertising and marketing data, arising from that use, to third parties who may reside in other countries altogether. Moreover, in many cases, there is no purchase of goods and services by the consumer.  
  
This is similar to the situation where a foreign business exports widgets to New Zealand.  
  
Under standard international rules, this does not give New Zealand a taxing right on the income of the firm. New Zealand only obtains that right if the business has a physical presence established in New Zealand.  
  
It has been suggested by some in the OECD that taxation of profits should move more towards where consumption of products and services occur. But this would be a sea change.  
  
It would mean that New Zealand exporters would be taxed on their income when they export goods or services to other countries. This sort of change could impede international trade and is not likely to happen in the near future, if ever.

### Adapting current rules to the digital economy

There are a number of important questions to consider.  
  
Does the digital economy allow business structures that do not fit well within current OECD taxing frameworks? Can digital businesses carry on substantial activity in a jurisdiction, but remain below the radar of taxation? Should the threshold for taxation be modified as a consequence?  
  
These are being addressed at the OECD. We are there, at the table. They are not areas where New Zealand can go it alone.

### Common Reporting Standards

Another concern on the fair sharing of the tax burden arises where domestic taxpayers are able to hide assets abroad and so escape domestic taxation.  
But in order to tax this income it must be reported.  
  
The OECD project on Common Reporting Standards, to implement automatic exchange of information, is intended to help countries find income earned by its residents from offshore sources.  
  
Under this initiative, companies where the funds are held would have an obligation to determine the country of residence of investor/depositors, and report the information to their home taxing jurisdiction.  
  
It is about ensuring that taxes are broadly and fairly applied, consistent with BBLR and we are working with the OECD to develop approaches to a common reporting standard that facilitates compliance across jurisdictions.  
  
I am aware that an area of considerable interest to New Zealand business in this area would be the compliance burden it can impose.  
  
On the other hand, an automatic exchange of information is in our national interest, since measures to improve compliance by the few, non-compliant taxpayers allow lower taxes for the vast majority of taxpayers who voluntarily comply with their tax obligations.  
  
New Zealand will therefore participate in this work and a key focus for us will be on minimising the compliance burden.

### Active income exemption for offshore branches

All of these BEPS issues are large and complex. And for the sake of our economy and tax system and indeed our global reputation, I want my officials to devote their time and energy to them.  
  
Active income exemption for branches is associated with BEPS and we will address this, but at present, I want our main policy focus to be directed towards the big ticket items, so I have decided to defer this reform for the time being.  
  
But big or small, these issues represent a new phase for tax policy in a more globalised, connected world. For policy proposals to work, we will need to ensure that the voice of all interested parties — business and academics — are heard.

### Consultation

A particular strength of New Zealand’s tax system is its reliance on consultation and the willingness of the tax community to engage.  
  
For instance, the amount of effort by private sector individuals who volunteered their time, and the professionalism of their input in a number of reviews of the tax system over the last few years, is, I believe, unprecedented across countries internationally.  
  
I would like to personally thank these individuals, many of whom are in this room, for their contribution to making the New Zealand tax system, a very good tax system indeed.  
  
Our ability to work together across government, business, tax professionals and academia is one of New Zealand’s greatest strengths.  
  
We’ll be looking for your input again.  
  
IRD is organising a workshop on April 1 with Business New Zealand that will provide more detail on the areas that are being examined by the OECD. This will offer an opportunity for dialogue. And certainly, if changes to domestic law arise from the process, they will be subject to the generic tax policy process.  
  
My officials will be working together with representatives from the business community on these issues to make sure we get the best result for New Zealand and New Zealand businesses.  
  
However, much of the action will happen at the OECD level. The OECD has established mechanisms for business to comment on developments there.

### Business transformation

Let me now turn briefly to tax administration.  
  
The second crucial area in making our tax system fair and efficient is its administration.  
  
The best tax rules in the world are to no avail if failures of tax administration mean that they are not applied appropriately.  
  
In fact, New Zealand stands up well in comparisons to tax administrations across the world. But we want to turn better into best.  
  
Accordingly, the IRD has set in motion a process to modernise its administrative systems.  
  
It’s not just about new computer systems for the IRD. It is a chance to review all of the internal and external processes to ensure that they are consistent with these objectives.  
  
This is a once in a generation opportunity to establish the basis of the future administration of the tax system. So we should aim high.  
  
The objectives are:

*   To ensure better public services by making sure our tax administration collects the correct amount and distribution of tax in as cost-effective manner as possible;
*   To ensure that the tax administration process and systems are flexible enough to implement government priorities; and,
*   To reduce compliance costs to taxpayers as much as possible.

There is a session at this conference on Saturday morning that will outline what is under way at the IRD and put it within its strategic framework.  
  
Your input will be an extremely valuable part of this process.  
  
To that end, I am pleased to announce that there will be a public conference in June on Tax Administration in New Zealand. Its purpose is to seek outside input into the future development of tax administration.  
  
I’ll be announcing details of this conference in the coming weeks.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the New Zealands tax system is up there with the best, but it will need to evolve and adapt to meet the needs of the 21st century and an increasingly globalised and interconnected world.  
  
Tax policies will need to adapt to fit these challenges and so will our tax administration.  
  
The OECD is leading the charge at an international level, but at home, to make it work for us, we need the public to engage.  
  
I hope you have an enjoyable conference.  
  
Thank you

Hon Todd McClay  
Minister of Revenue

Speech

12 June 2014

### Address to 21st Century Tax Administration Conference

Thank you for inviting me to be with you today.  
  
Firstly, I’d like to welcome Professor Chris Evans, Professor of Taxation at the Australian School of Business, James Alm, Chair of the Department of Economics at Tulane University and Michael Keen, Deputy Director at the Fiscal Affairs Department, at the IMF.  
  
The strength of the New Zealand tax system is its highly cooperative nature so it’s great to have such world leading speakers here with us. I'm sure tax policy and IRD's Business Transformation programme can only benefit from your expertise.  
  
Michael Keen, I should mention, is also the current visiting lecturer brought out under the Robin Oliver Tax Policy Scholarships which aims to promote the development of tax policy expertise in New Zealand.  
  
As we embark upon one of the NZ Tax System's largest reform programmes we face both opportunity and challenge.  
  
Business Transformation is about simplifying and modernising the tax system for New Zealand taxpayers. At its heart is tax policy, which must go hand in hand with a modern - fit for purpose tax administration.  
  
I’m intentionally focusing on the policy aspect because Inland Revenue’s transformation is more than simply replacing an ageing computer. It's about challenging what we currently do against the need to do more for New Zealand businesses.  
  
BT is about designing and building a tax system for a modern New Zealand. .New Zealand is well-served by its tax system, Business Transformation is a means to ensure that we continue to be well served into the future.  
  
We know that tax administration needs to continually adapt and evolve. The Government wants a system which is efficient, provides value for money, and services which are valued by the public.  
  
And it’s particularly important that we bring the public and business community with us on this journey. One of the true tests of the transformation programme will be how it makes paying tax easier and fairer.  
  
Reducing the time and cost related to compliance is an ongoing process however and not something that we're sitting back and waiting for BT to achieve.  
  
Inland Revenue is already putting a lot of effort into making tax compliance easier, examples include:

*   One million people now using Voice ID – a secure digital identification service that allows customers to verify their identity and access automated tax self-services; this saves a staggering 8500 hours of telephone time each year.
*   More than 1.7 million people have been registered for myIR – a secure online service that allows people to check their tax details, child support, Working for Families and KiwiSaver accounts, and submit GST returns online; and
*   Parents no longer have to be verified in person to get an IRD number for their new-born. Instead they can apply for an IRD number when they register the birth with the Department of Internal Affairs.

These and many other initiatives are already making dealing with IRD faster and easier for New Zealanders.  
  
Some of you will also be aware that I recently announced the Taxpayers Simplification Panel to provide taxpayers a forum through which they can let us know the ongoing compliance issues that frustrate them.  
  
However, more on that later.  
  
I would like to take a moment to put some context around all of this and reflect on the significant progress we've made since the Global Financial Crisis.  
  
Around the world today, nations are facing some big fiscal and economic challenges that have in some cases demanded fairly drastic responses. The recent Budget in Australia is a case in point.  
  
Our response to the Global Financial Crisis was deliberately measured, with a clear and definite plan, and without a sense of panic.  
  
We are now starting to experience the benefits of the government's discipline and economic plan.  
  
The New Zealand economy continues to expand - faster than almost every other developed nation. It grew by 3.1 per cent in 2013 – the fifth-highest among the world’s developed economies. Growth is forecast to reach 4 per cent next year.  
  
An extra 84,000 jobs were created in the year to March and Treasury forecasts the unemployment rate, currently at 6 per cent, to fall to 4.4 per cent by mid-2018.  
  
Business confidence is at its highest level in 20 years, terms of trade remain high and average wages increased by $3000 dollars in the past two years.  
  
The Budget forecasts average wages to grow by another $7600 dollars to $62,300 by 2018.  
  
So New Zealand is well placed compared to most countries.  
  
At the height of the GFC tax revenue fell from $56 billion in 2008 to $50 billion by 2010. It has subsequently largely recovered, and is forecast to grow to $77 billion by 2018.  
  
However, while the recovery is gathering momentum, the global economic environment still remains uncertain.  
  
It is therefore important to maintain clear and credible economic and fiscal settings as the best means to encourage growth, create new jobs, raise incomes, and help kiwi families get ahead.  
  
Government debt is expected to fall to 20 per cent of GDP by 2020 – well below the 60 per cent Treasury projected when we took Government in 2008.  
  
The Government is on track to a modest $372 million Budget surplus next year, with increasing surpluses in the coming years, out to $3.5 billion in 2017/18.  
  
This provides us with choices about repaying debt and investing in important public services such as health, education and rebuilding Christchurch.  
  
At the heart of this return to surplus and an improving economic outlook is our tax system and specifically our broad-based, low-rate tax settings (BBLR).  
  
It’s clear that BBLR is the unsung hero of New Zealand’s fiscal recovery. By focusing on making small changes to ensure everyone pays their fair share of tax, the Government’s revenue remains solid without imposing extra taxes that would slow economic growth.  
  
However, our tax administration is dated and for the taxpayer still largely paper based. It reflects its history, shows the scars of a series of changes and additions as it evolved from purely tax to one which also oversees various non-tax initiatives such as KiwiSaver and Child Support.  
  
It has served us well, and continues to do so, but the world and the economy are changing quickly and our tax administration needs to catch up.  
  
Back in the 1980s when mobile phones were first conceived, no one dreamed they would have consequences for the tax system.  
  
Today even the most technologically illiterate amongst us use mobile apps each and every day.  
  
Widespread use of PCs and mobile devices mean people expect to do more of their transactions online – including their tax affairs.  
  
For most people, using paper channels is no longer the most cost effective or convenient method for any of their transactions, including the tax department.  
  
Our fax machines have been replaced by scanners, which too are increasingly becoming redundant as everything is done online.  
  
These factors put pressure on tax systems.  
  
BBLR means tax administration benefits from a regime based on voluntary compliance. It’s an efficient way to run a tax system as long as compliance remains high. This works well for us in New Zealand.  
  
However failing to keep up with customer expectations can see levels of compliance drop.  
  
After all, if people can conduct all their other business and personal activities easily, grocery shopping, buying a home or getting approval for a mortgage or planning an overseas trip for instance, using new and increasing changing technology, by clinging to a paper-based model we risk becoming out-of-step with a modern economy, instead making it more difficult not less for taxpayers to meet their obligation.  
  
In future the tax system with need to rely upon BBLR-C. Broad based, low rate, and convenient.  
  
The Government has therefore taken a step back to critically consider the wider implications for tax administration of a growing public appetite for greater customer service and convenience.  
  
When consumers can download the next movie, or book or song instantly from their own homes, when the entire Encyclopaedia Britannia and more is but a google search away, it's no wonder that our taxpayers expect more from us and quickly.  
  
Let me be clear, BT is not merely about new computer systems. It’s about examining all of our business processes and functions and making them fit for the 21st Century. In this everything is in the table.  
  
So what are the first steps?  
  
After a significant period of planning, Inland Revenue is now ready to consider design proposals for what can be done to improve tax administration.  
  
The objectives are:

*   To ensure better public services by making sure we collect and disburse the correct amount of tax in a cost-effective manner;
*   To enable taxpayers wherever possible, to manage their own tax affairs with speed and certainty
*   To ensure that the tax administration process and systems are flexible enough to implement government priorities in a cost effective and timely manner; and,
*   Most importantly to reduce compliance costs for businesses and individuals.

Taxpayers can expect a focus on making the system easier for them, to provide greater certainty in their dealings with the tax department.  
  
In expecting taxpayers to comply with tax rules where possible we will work to make these rules simpler, and in so doing reduce administrative and compliance costs to help them meet their obligations more easily.  
  
Our tax policy process relies heavily on public consultation more than any country in the world. In fact it is all the better for it.  
  
One of the aims of this conference is to help develop a policy vision that maps out key areas for consideration in support of a modern tax system. Your consideration will help inform concrete policy proposals for full public consultation.  
  
I expect that many of the most important suggestions might well come from taxpayers, their advisors, and intermediaries.  
  
IRD is making a genuine offer to work together to improve tax administration in New Zealand, for New Zealand.  
  
This brings me back to the Taxpayer’s Simplification Panel.  
  
The Panel is designed to listen to the public’s opinions on Inland Revenue’s processes, to tell us about the things that frustrate people, and submit ideas about what can be done to make paying tax easier.  
  
We have already developed robust means to engage with the business, tax and legal professions in respect of Transformation.  
  
I am particularly keen for the Panel to engage with small-to-medium business owners, as well as individuals, about how we can reduce the amount of time they spend on compliance – because at the end of the day, every hour spent on paying tax is another hour they can’t spend growing their businesses and creating jobs.  
  
The Panel is part of the IR4U programme of better engaging with the public, it will consist of representatives of individual taxpayers, small business, and also the tax advisory community.  
  
It will be managed by Inland Revenue and will report to both the Commissioner and I on a regular basis with recommendations it gains from ongoing public consultation.  
  
The membership and formation of the Panel will be announced within the coming weeks.  
  
I wish the Panel every success and I look forward to receiving its first set of recommendations.  
  
So in conclusion, as I’ve already said, we have much to be proud of with our tax system.  
  
It is a significant national asset and one that needs to be carefully maintained.  
  
Our broad-based, low rate framework provides us with a fair tax system while helping to pay the bills.  
  
Revenue is relatively stable and is helping the Government reach our fiscal goals.  
  
But the world keeps turning and the best tax rules are ineffective without a sound tax administration to implement them efficiently.  
  
Business Transformation is an exciting opportunity. It's a journey towards a stronger economy and a fairer and easier tax system. I invite all of you to join us on this journey.  
  
Thank you.

Address to BDO national tax conference
======================================

The Minister of Revenue Todd McClay’s speech to the BDO National Tax Conference today covered two major challenges facing the New Zealand tax system: the rise of base erosion and profit shifting and the changing expectations for customer service. In discussing these, he also spoke about features of New Zealand’s tax policy development which help to provide certainty for taxpayers.

Hon Todd McClay  
Minister of Revenue

Speech

24 July 2014

### Address to the BDO Tax Conference

Thank you for inviting me here today. I’m especially pleased that you’ve asked me to talk about the challenges for the NZ tax system and creating certainty.

These are very topical issues and two things I am deeply interested in.

Taxation is a necessary part of society as long as government is required to provide services such as health, education, police, social welfare and rebuilding Christchurch.

Yet today, it seems to me that our tax system and in fact tax systems around the world, are at a cross roads.

The design of tax systems is crucial if adequate revenue is to be raised in challenging economic circumstances.

Following the Global Financial Crisis, many tax jurisdictions around the world who do not share our broad-based, low rate tax framework face the pressing issue of sustainable revenue raising.

For New Zealand, this is not a top concern. I’m not suggesting that we are awash in tax dollars, but revenue is sustainable and relatively predictable.

At the height of the GFC tax revenue fell from $56 billion in 2008 to $50 billion by 2010. It has subsequently largely recovered, and is forecast to grow to $77 billion by 2018.

This Government’s response to the Global Financial Crisis was deliberately measured, with a clear and definite plan, and without a sense of panic.

We are now starting to experience the benefits of the government's discipline and economic plan.

The New Zealand economy continues to expand - faster than almost every other developed nation. It grew by 3.1 per cent in 2013 – the fifth-highest among the world’s developed economies. Growth is forecast to reach 4 per cent next year.

The Budget forecasts average wages to grow by another $7600 to $62,300 by 2018.

So New Zealand is well placed compared to most countries.

Crucially, we are on track to restoring the Government’s books to surplus. From a modest forecast next year to increasing surpluses in the coming years – out to $3.5 billion in 2017/18.

### Certainty

Our broad-based, low rate tax system has played a very important role in this return to surplus. It means that the Government can fund more of its operations not by imposing extra or higher taxes on the current generation or on future generations by raising debt, but simply by ensuring that the existing tax bases are applied fairly and correctly.

In fact, if you’re looking for certainty from the tax system, then there are two features of our tax system that I believe deliver this: a broad-base, low-rate framework for tax policy and good public consultation.

Our broad base, low rate framework acts to promote revenue integrity. It keeps administrative and compliance costs as low as possible and by avoiding complex rules and frequent changes it promotes business certainty.

In fact I might describe our system as boringly predictable, and that’s no bad thing at all!

Businesses can plan their affairs without worrying about the future tax consequences of their decisions.

This Government is focussed on ensuring that the tax burden is fairly and efficiently shared, in practice, as well as in theory. That is, that everyone pays the tax that they are obligated to. For if they don’t taxes on other taxpayers must rise to compensate, which discourages productive activity.

Our tax system relies on voluntary compliance which works as long as most people see that the tax system is fair.

### Consultation

A key means to ensure that we get the system as fair as possible is through public and industry consultation.

A particular strength of New Zealand’s tax system is its reliance on consultation and the willingness of the tax community to engage. I think it is the main reason that tax reform in this country is generally well targeted and has a high degree of buy-in from the public.

Consultation helps to ensure that proposals are fair and will not impose undue compliance costs. Crucially it gives taxpayers certainty.

For instance, the amount of effort by private sector individuals who volunteered their time and professionalism in a number of reviews of the tax system over the last thirty years is, I believe, unprecedented internationally and I thank you and your professional colleagues for it.

Our ability to work together across government, business, tax professionals and academia is one of New Zealand’s greatest strengths.

We’ll be looking for your input again particularly as we face some interesting challenges ahead.

### System design

The challenges I want to talk about are due to the changing world we live in. Many of you will be familiar with them: base erosion and profit shifting, and customer service expectation changes.

Our tax system needs to evolve to meet these challenges.

But how do you design a good tax system to do this?

Many here will be familiar with Jean Baptiste Colbert’s comment about tax system design: “the art of taxation consists in so plucking the goose as to obtain the largest possible amount of feathers with the smallest amount of hissing.”

That may have worked for Colbert in 17th century France but not today. The goose gets nothing in return, yet we all know that taxes pay for all our government services. I actually think that as New Zealanders we get a pretty good deal for our taxes.

Our tax system works well and is complied with by the vast majority of taxpayers because they feel that what is asked of them is fair and reasonable.

This Government has an ongoing focus on reducing compliance costs and minimising or eliminating obstacles that can make life difficult for taxpayers.

The simpler we make paying tax, the easier it is for people to comply, and the better we use the tax we collect, the easier it is to justify collecting it.

Which is part of the reason why two years ago the Prime Minister set ten Better Public Service targets. The latest update, released earlier this week, shows we are making good overall progress on these.

We have now met the targets for reducing total crime and youth crime.

There has also been good progress in reducing long-term welfare dependency, increasing Level 2 NCEA pass rates and those with New Zealand Qualifications Framework Level four.

In other result areas, more work is being done to reduce rheumatic fever, reduce assaults on children, and improve online business transactions.

What has all this got to do with tax?

Well, this Government believes that New Zealand taxpayers deserve this level of accountability. If our taxes are spent on these government programmes, then we all have a right to know what we are getting for that investment.

### BEPS

In the past year or so issues of corporate taxation have increasingly been on the agendas of not only Finance and Revenue Ministers, but also Heads of Government.

And the particular issue that is most in the news is Base Erosion and Profit Shifting or “BEPS”.

BEPS is a problem where companies can legally arrange their affairs so that profits earned in a taxable jurisdiction are either artificially allocated to a low-tax jurisdiction, or are subject to arrangements that result in no taxable profits being declared anywhere.

The OECD, the principle international taxation standard setting body, has been leading the charge on this and New Zealand has been a very active participant in this work.

It is not in the interest of New Zealand businesses and individual taxpayers if multinational companies avoid paying their fair share of tax in New Zealand or anywhere else for that matter.

Countering BEPS helps to level the playing field. Moreover, if New Zealand suffers base-erosion, other taxes must increase to make up the difference, which reduces the efficiency and competitiveness of the New Zealand economy.

We’re well placed to make a strong contribution. I think it’s fair to say that New Zealand’s rules in this area are as good as any, and better than most. In domestic rules applying to such income, we have already made considerable progress.

Our thin capitalisation rules, transfer pricing and taxation of passive income of controlled foreign companies were designed to protect New Zealand from base erosion strategies.

Work continues to refine these domestic rules.

New Zealand cannot solve this issue alone, international cooperation is necessary.

Further progress on the BEPS issue requires collective action led by the OECD. 15 Proposals have been identified and the OECD sub-committees are scheduled to report on some of them from as early as September this year.

Already the first of these proposals is being readied for delivery.

### Business Transformation

BEPS is principally a policy issue; however there are two parts to a successful tax system: sound tax policy and a good tax administration. Our tax administration system is good, but the time has come to modernise and adapt to meet customer’s 21st century expectations.

After all, if people can conduct all their other business and personal activities using new online technologies – grocery shopping, buying a home, getting approval for a mortgage, or planning an overseas holiday – then by clinging to a paper-based model we risk becoming out-of-step with the modern economy, making it increasingly difficult for taxpayers to meet their obligations.

IRD has therefore launched a business transformation programme with the following objectives:

*   Provide better public services by making sure our tax administration collects the right amount of tax from the right people, in the most cost-effective manner possible;
*   Reduce compliance costs to taxpayers as much as possible;
*   And finally, to ensure that the tax administration process and systems are flexible enough to implement government priorities and deal with future policy changes.

When the current FIRST system was designed it only needed to deal with 9 different tax products, since then it has been asked to handle an additional 30 tax and social policy functions.

It is no exaggeration when I say that the FIRST bucket is full!

However, Business Transformation is not just about new computer systems for the IRD. It is a chance to review all of the internal and external processes, policies and legislation to ensure that they are consistent with the objectives I have just outlined.

Your input will be an extremely valuable part of this process.

In conclusion, New Zealand’s tax system is up there with the best, but it will need to evolve and adapt to meet the needs of the 21st century and an increasingly globalised and interconnected world.

Tax policies will need to adapt to fit these challenges and so will our tax administration. But I am confident of success given the strong foundations of our broad-base, low-rate tax system and the focus on public consultation which will work to produce practical, fair tax reforms while providing certainty to businesses.

Thank you. I wish you a successful and enjoyable conference.

Hon Todd McClay  
Minister of Revenue

Speech

31 October 2014

### Speech to Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand tax conference

Good morning.

I’m pleased to be here today as this is my first speech since the election and I have, to my great satisfaction, retained the Revenue portfolio and therefore the privilege as the Minister of Revenue of opening this conference.

I’m happy to say that New Zealand is in an enviable position with a good tax and social policy system. We are served well by our broad-base, low-rate (BBLR) tax settings.

This is consistent with the advice I have received from Inland Revenue in its recent Briefing to the Incoming Minister.

I don’t see fundamental problems requiring an urgent and radical shift in these settings. But a big challenge and also a huge opportunity is IRD’s Business Transformation.

Taxes are critically important, but taxes impose costs in addition to the actual tax. This includes costs to taxpayers and their advisers in complying with the tax system as well as costs to Inland Revenue itself in administering the tax system.

It also includes distortionary costs because taxes can encourage people to do things that would not be sensible in the absence of tax.

They can encourage firms to invest or individuals to save in unproductive ways. They can discourage entrepreneurs from taking on risk or individuals from joining the workforce, undertaking training or taking on more demanding jobs.

So it is beholden on us to minimise those costs and collect revenue in as efficient a manner as possible without high and very distorting tax rates.

Our broad tax bases keep distortions to a minimum and this is reinforced by keeping tax rates as low as possible.

New Zealand’s relatively consistent broad base, low rate (BBLR) framework is well regarded. Deloitte’s 2014 Asia Pacific Tax Complexity Survey Report found that most survey respondents rated New Zealand’s tax policies as straightforward, consistent and predictable compared with other countries in the region.

And most recently, an international study by the Tax Foundation based in Washington DC ranked New Zealand as having the second most competitive tax system in the OECD. This study took account of the neutrality of tax settings as well as tax rates.

Despite the fact that NZ is not a “low tax” OECD country (NZ tax collected as a percentage of GDP is around the OECD average), we still achieved this high ranking in the study, which I find remarkable and a tribute to our BBLR settings.

So I don’t see any “burning platform” requiring an urgent and radical shift in tax policy settings. But at the same time there are huge opportunities with Business Transformation to improve the way that taxes are administered.

The Government remains focused on returning to surplus and its long-term fiscal objective remains to reduce net core Crown debt to 20 per cent of GDP by 2020.

The Government has 10 priority goals and targets in the areas of long-term welfare dependency, supporting vulnerable children, boosting skills and employment, reducing crime and improving interaction with government.

The key way the tax system can help with this is in providing revenue to improve the fiscal position and spend on priority areas.

Taxes also have an important role in allowing New Zealand to create a genuinely inclusive society where everyone has a reasonable chance to get ahead. We want a society where everyone pays a fair share of tax.

Fairness is not a matter of kneecapping entrepreneurs who make a success of building businesses from New Zealand. We want innovative ideas to flourish and businesses to thrive in New Zealand.

But we want a tax system which is fair where everyone does their bit to finance government spending and look after those who are genuinely disadvantaged.

Business transformation is not simply about replacing an old computer system. It’s about bringing the tax administration into the 21st century to reflect changes in technology and to meet customer expectations.

A big part of this is changing the tax administration rules to make things easier for individuals and businesses and reduce costs across the economy as a whole. To achieve this we will look at all the rules for when people pay tax, how they pay it and what happens if they don’t pay.

And it’s not just straight payment of tax. Inland Revenue aims to be an intelligence-led organisation. Therefore a key part of the exercise is ensuring that Inland Revenue collects relevant and useful information in a form it can use.

As I mentioned before, taxes result in costs: administration, compliance costs and distortionary costs. An efficient tax system keeps these to a minimum.

Apart from anything else, we need the tax system to be fair and seen to be fair.

Our tax system rests on voluntary compliance. It should be as easy as possible for those who want to do the right thing to comply. Equally it should be difficult for taxpayers not to comply.

This will become more and more important as we look to the future. An ageing New Zealand population creates extra fiscal pressures and well before we rush to bringing in higher tax rates or new taxes we should do everything we can to make sure that the current tax system works as well as possible.

This means that IRD’s transformation cannot have a single focus. It must balance minimising the costs of raising taxes with fairness concerns and ensuring the tax system promotes high levels of compliance. And this will inevitably involve making trade-offs between competing priorities.

The Government is not going to write a blank cheque for this transformation. We’re operating in a constrained fiscal environment and the Government is demanding value for money.

But business transformation is not about shifting costs from the Government to taxpayers. The reforms will not be successful if administration costs are cut but we see compliance costs rise and total costs for NZ as a whole increase.

Nor will transformation be successful if compliance costs fall but these are replaced by greater distortionary costs.

We want to avoid simplistic solutions such as lowering tax rates, denying deductions for expenses and taxing turnover. If someone can employ someone for $90 and make $100 in revenue, we want this to happen. This requires us to allow deductions for valid business expenses.

We are dealing with major issues.

Chris Evans who spoke at the 21st Century Tax Admin Conference argued that compliance costs per SME were likely to be very low in New Zealand. But at the same time we have very high numbers of SMEs.

IRD’s 2009 compliance cost study suggested compliance costs of a bit over $5,500 per SME. But there were almost 450,000 SMEs. This would suggest an aggregate compliance cost for SMEs of $2.5 billion which is more than 1% of NZ’s GDP. This is for SMEs alone.

In the US, academic research has suggested compliance costs could be of the order of 10% of tax revenues.

Thus, compliance costs are likely to be big and important. The distortionary costs of taxes are likely to be larger still. This is despite New Zealand’s relatively attractive BBLR tax policy settings.

Cutting compliance costs, especially for SMEs, is a priority. Using Business Transformation to simplify things for SMEs is one of the Government’s top 10 priorities under its Business Growth Agenda. But it is important to understand what this involves.

Cutting compliance costs for SMEs is not about cutting taxes for them. If smaller businesses face lower tax rates on their income than larger businesses, this reduces productivity by biasing business activity towards smaller firms.

Simplification is about realising that close enough may be good enough for SMEs. If it is possible to make things simpler for SMEs without putting a major hole in the tax base, this is worth considering.

At the same time there are reasons to be wary of creating too much choice. Compliance costs tend to rise in countries that give SMEs too many options for paying tax. Wading through options increases the amount of time and effort you’re spending on your tax obligations.

Also as much as possible we don’t want to have rules that create difficult boundaries for successful firms increasing in size.

There are important trade-offs.

We will be exploring whether we can come out with simpler (but not generally concessionary) rules for SMEs in certain circumstances. We will also be exploring more general simplifications by replacing the EMS with information which is more directly linked to payroll systems.

There are pressure points associated with the payment of provisional tax.

As much as possible we want firms to be paying tax during the year as income is earned. This is consistent with the way in which other taxpayers are taxed.

But at the same time we want to make this as painless and easy to comply with as possible. We will be exploring whether there are ways of making improvements in this area.

It should come as no surprise that international studies have found very high levels of compliance for certain forms of tax such as PAYE and considerably lower rates of compliance for others such as self-declared income.

An important question will be whether there are good ways of making it easier for those who want to comply and harder for those who don’t.

A practical difficulty is in getting rates of withholding as good as possible and minimising the costs of square ups when tax has been withheld at rates that subsequently turn out to be wrong.

Modern technology may help by making square ups less costly.

We will be exploring whether we can provide more extensive prepopulated information on tax returns available to individual taxpayers.

For those with simple affairs and without business, rental, or foreign income, filing a tax return might be no more complex than saying whether the sources of income that Inland Revenue identifies are the only sources of income.

We will also be exploring whether we can simplify square ups with automatic bank transfers to those who have paid too much and higher rates of future withholding on those who have paid too little.

Automatic square ups could also reduce pressure points around “secondary tax”.

Improvements may also be possible in the rates at which secondary tax is withheld. Many of those using the secondary tax code have low levels of disposable income and can least afford to wait for things to come right in the end. More timely employment interaction may allow Inland Revenue to interact with employers to get better rates of withholding.

It should be acknowledged that there will be trade-offs in all of this. Even though the overall direction will be to reduce compliance costs, there will inevitably be instances where compliance costs increase for some. All of this will need to be worked through and this will be with the full consultation that GTPP provides.

It should be noted that all this is more than an Inland Revenue issue. The transformation programme is aimed at providing wider benefits to the government. An early challenge will be getting better salary and wage information from employers in real time. This will have a spin-off for MSD in increasing numbers receiving the correct levels of benefits.

Business transformation will clearly be an important part of the 2015/16 Tax Policy Work Programme.

But the new Work Programme will obviously be much broader than business transformation.

It will work through issues such as international tax and the BEPS work. We need to work with the OECD and ensure that our international tax rules provide a robust way of taxing multinational enterprises. At the same time we want to ensure that New Zealand remains a good place to base an exporting business.

The new Work Programme will also include important measures which are aimed at maintaining and enhancing tax and social policy within our current BBLR tax settings. One example is work on debt remission income which responds to concerns that the current rules may involve overreach and be getting in the way of sensible debt capitalisation. We are also working through the issue of GST and bodies corporate. Here it is important to balance purity, fairness and compliance costs. We have listened to submissions and are working through solutions. A priority is keeping compliance costs low.

More generally, we need to keep reinvesting in our current tax framework to make the law clearer and more predictable. This includes an active programme of remedials.

Tax policy officials are in the process of starting to consult with key stakeholders in identifying priorities for the Work Programme. This should be released reasonably early in the new year.

New Zealand is starting from a great place with a good tax system. In large part this is helped by the very good consultation that takes place under GTPP and the willingness of tax professionals such as yourselves to be generous with your time and energy. Your approach to tax policy supports the greater good of New Zealand and is very much appreciated.

Business transformation creates a once-in-a-generation opportunity to make a transformational change in the way the taxes are administered. It will involve a number of difficult trade-offs. To make it work well, your contribution is essential.

Thank you.

### KiwiSaver tax credits’ Bill has first reading

Building and Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith and Revenue Minister Todd McClay today welcomed the next important step in the Government’s HomeStart package for first home buyers with the first reading of the Taxation (KiwiSaver HomeStart and Remedial Matters) Bill.

“These changes to KiwiSaver will complement the new HomeStart scheme and enable tens of thousands more young New Zealand families to pull together a deposit to own their own home. The major change is allowing KiwiSavers to withdraw the annual member tax credit paid by the Government alongside the contributions they make and those made by their employers,” Dr Smith says.

“This change will increase the maximum withdrawal amount by $521 each year for every year a member has been contributing to KiwiSaver and allows members to withdraw all of their KiwiSaver savings with the exception of the $1000 kickstart,” Mr McClay says.

The Taxation (KiwiSaver HomeStart and Remedial Matters) Bill implements one part of the Government’s new support package for first home buyers which was announced by Dr Smith in August. The HomeStart package also includes:

*   A doubling of the support for first home buyers where they are purchasing a new home;
*   Increasing the house price caps to the more realistic levels of $550,000, $450,000 and $350,000; and
*   Expanding eligibility for Welcome Home Loans by aligning the house price caps with the new KiwiSaver HomeStart Grant.

“This total package will help about 90,000 lower and middle income first home buyers over the next five years. We are roughly doubling the number of people receiving a Government grant to buy a first home from 10,000 per year to 20,000 per year. We are also doubling the Government grant buyers are eligible for if they are buying a newly-built home, with the focus of the package to increase the supply of new housing and to encourage housing companies to build homes in a price range affordable for first home buyers,” Dr Smith says.

“These changes double the Government’s support for first home buyers from $217 million to $435 million over the next five years,” Dr Smith says.

“The first reading of this Bill today is great news for first home buyers. Every dollar helps when you’re trying to get on the property ladder. Higher income earners will also benefit by being able to withdraw more of their savings for their first home, but they will not be eligible for the HomeStart grant,” Mr McClay says.

“HomeStart is the most significant Government support for first home buyers in more than a generation and comes into effect on 1 April 2015. It stands alongside the Government’s other housing initiatives, including opening up new residential land, reducing tariffs on building materials, investing more in building skills and reducing compliance costs,” Dr Smith says.

The Taxation (KiwiSaver HomeStart and Remedial Matters) Bill also corrects errors made in amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the KiwiSaver Act 2006 in the Veterans’ Support Act 2014.

May 2014 Page 1 Fact sheet – Black hole R&D expenditure Introduction Generally, businesses are allowed a deduction for business expenditure against their assessable income. Certain business expenditure, however, does not result in a tax deduction, either immediately or over time. This expenditure is commonly referred to as “black hole” expenditure. The Government is proposing some changes to the income tax treatment of some types of business expenditure. Main proposed changes R&D that results in a depreciable intangible asset  Capitalised development expenditure (incurred on or after 7 November 2013) that relates to a patent, patent application or plant variety rights will be allowed to be included as part of the depreciable costs of the relevant depreciable intangible asset, for taxpayers that have carried out research and development (R&D) that has led to them acquiring one of these depreciable intangible assets. R&D that does not result in a depreciable intangible asset  A one-off tax deduction will be allowed for capitalised development expenditure (incurred on or after 7 November 2013) upon the intangible asset to which it relates being written off for accounting purposes, for taxpayers that have developed intangible assets that are not depreciable for tax purposes. This will apply irrespective of whether the asset was useful for a period or the R&D was unsuccessful. Integrity measures  In the event that an intangible asset that has been written off for accounting purposes becomes useful, any capitalised development expenditure previously allowed as a tax deduction will be clawed back as income, with the clawed-back amount able to be depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset if the asset is depreciable.  In the event that an intangible asset that has been written off for accounting purposes is sold, any capitalised development expenditure previously allowed as a tax deduction (or the sale proceeds, if this amount is lower) will be clawed back as income. Under current tax law, taxpayers are allowed immediate tax deductions for R&D expenditure incurred up until the point that an intangible asset is recognised under the accounting rules. Any further development expenditure incurred must be capitalised and is potentially never able to be deducted for tax purposes. This may discourage businesses from undertaking R&D that they would have undertaken in the absence of taxation. The proposed changes will reduce distortions against investment in R&D caused by the current tax rules, by allowing capitalised development expenditure to either be deducted over time as depreciation (where the R&D results in a depreciable intangible asset) or deducted upon the intangible asset being written off for accounting purposes (where the R&D does not result in a depreciable intangible asset). Page 2 Other proposed changes Registered designs  Registered designs (and applications for the registration of a design) will be made depreciable (over 15 years), by adding them to schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007.  Capitalised expenditure (incurred on or after 7 November 2013) in creating the design will be able to be included as part of the depreciable costs of a registered design (and associated application), for taxpayers that have created a design that they have applied to have registered, as well as legal and administrative fees incurred in the design registration process.  An immediate tax deduction will be allowed for expenditure incurred for the purpose of applying for registration of a design if registration is not obtained because the application is not lodged or is withdrawn, or because registration is refused. A taxpayer will receive the deduction in the income year in which they decide not to lodge the application, withdraw the application, or are refused registration. A registered design has a legal life of 15 years (assuming all rights of renewal are exercised). Therefore, registered designs are being made depreciable because they are an item of intangible property that has a finite useful life that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty on the date of its acquisition, so meet the criteria for inclusion in schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007. As the 15 year legal life of a registered design generally commences on the date on which the first application is made (as opposed to the date on which registration is granted), applications for the registration of a design are also being made depreciable, by adding them to schedule 14. The proposed immediate tax deduction for expenditure incurred for the purpose of applying for registration of a design if registration is not obtained will parallel the tax treatment of expenditure incurred for the purpose of applying for a patent where a patent is not obtained. Copyright that has been applied industrially  Copyright in an artistic work that has been applied industrially (as defined in section 75(4) of the Copyright Act 1994) will be made depreciable, by adding it to schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007.  Depreciation will be over: - 16 years, in the case of product designs and casting moulds; or - 25 years, in the case of works of craftsmanship.  Capitalised expenditure (incurred on or after 7 November 2013) in creating the artistic work will comprise the depreciable costs of the copyright, for taxpayers who have created an original artistic work that they (or their licensee) have applied industrially. Page 3 Section 75 of the Copyright Act 1994 contains a special exception from copyright protection in the case of an artistic work that has been applied industrially. The effect of this exception is that, once an owner of copyright in an artistic work (or a licensee) has applied the artistic work industrially (as defined in the section), within New Zealand or overseas, their copyright protection will only last for a further 16 years (in the case of product designs and casting moulds) or 25 years (in the case of works of craftsmanship). This time limit makes the copyright in an artistic work that has been applied industrially appropriate for inclusion in schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Successful software development  The Income Tax Act 2007 will be amended to clarify that capitalised expenditure incurred by a person in the successful development of software for use in their own business is depreciable. This proposed amendment will clarify the law to be in line with the policy intent and Inland Revenue’s understanding of current taxpayer practice. Legislation These proposed changes will be included in the next omnibus taxation bill and will take effect from:  the statutory time-bar, for the proposed clarification in relation to successful software development; or  the 2015/16 income year, for all the other proposed changes.
Taxation (KiwiSaver HomeStart and Remedial Matters) Bill Commentary on the Bill Hon Todd McClay Minister of Revenue First published in December 2014 by Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue, PO Box 2198, Wellington 6140. Taxation (KiwiSaver HomeStart and Remedial Matters) Bill; Commentary on the Bill. ISBN 978-0-478-42403-4 CONTENTS KiwiSaver HomeStart 1 Overview 3 HomeStart – withdrawing member tax credits 4 Veteran income replacement payments 5 Overview 7 Tax treatment of income replacement payments 8 PAYE and KiwiSaver treatment of income replacement payments 10 Criteria for earnings-related Working for Families tax credits – incapacity 12 KiwiSaver HomeStart 1 2 OVERVIEW As part of the “HomeStart” package announced by the Government in August 2014, the bill proposes to extend the current KiwiSaver withdrawal rules for first-ho me buyers from 1 April 2015. Under the current rules, KiwiSaver members who are purchasing their first home are able to withdraw the contributions they and their employer have made, to supplement a deposit on a first home. The proposals in this bill will allow them to also withdraw their member tax credits. 3 HOMESTART – WITHDRAWING MEMBER TAX CREDITS (Clause 6) Summary of proposed amendments The bill amends the KiwiSaver Act 2006 to allow KiwiSaver members to withdraw their member tax credits when purchasing their first home. Currently the rules exclude “Crown contributions” which include both member tax credits and the $1,000 kick-start contribution. From 1 April 2015 only the kick-start contribution will be excluded. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2015. Key features The bill amends schedule 1, clause 8(4)(a) to change the components of the member’s funds that cannot be withdrawn for their first home. Background KiwiSaver members are currently able to withdraw the contributions they and their employers have made to their KiwiSaver funds to supplement a deposit on a first ho me after three years. They are not able to withdraw the $1,000 kick-start or member tax credits paid by the Government. The proposed new rules will allow them to withdraw the member tax credits, but not the $1,000 kick-start. The change is part of the Government’s “HomeStart” package of proposals to provide greater assistance to New Zealanders saving to buy their first home. 4 Veteran income replacement payments 5 6 OVERVIEW Several remedial amendments are proposed to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the KiwiSaver Act 2006 that relate to the tax, social policy and KiwiSaver treatment of income replacement payments paid under the Veterans’ Support Act 2014. The policy intention is for the payments to be treated the same as ACC earnings-related compensation payments. These payments are treated as taxable and are included in social policy calculations. In addition, KiwiSaver and PAYE deductions can be made fro m the payments, but they are not subject to the KiwiSaver auto-enrolment and compulsory employer contributions rules. 7 TAX TREATMENT OF INCOME REPLACEMENT PAYMENTS (Clauses 2, 7, 8 and 9) Summary of proposed amendments Amendments to two sections of the Income Tax Act 2007 are proposed to ensure veteran income replacement payments are treated as taxable income. Payments that are taxable income are also included in social policy calculations. The proposed amendments to section CF 1(1) will ensure a veteran’s weekly compensation, weekly income compensation, retirement lump sum payment, and weekly compensation to a deceased veteran’s spouse, partner, child and dependant are treated as taxable income. The proposed amendments to section CW 28(1)(a) will ensure a veteran’s weekly income compensation, retirement lump sum payment, and weekly compensation to a deceased veteran’s spouse, partner, child and dependant are not treated as tax exempt income. Application date The amendments that relate to weekly compensation, weekly income compensat io n for veterans, and weekly compensation to deceased veterans’ spouses, partners, children and dependants will apply from the date of the bill’s enactment. The amendments that relate to retirement lump sum payments for veterans will apply fro m 7 December 2014, which is the commencement date of the Veterans’ Support Act 2014. Key features The proposed amendments to section CF 1(1) will add weekly compensation, weekly income compensation, and retirement lump sums for veterans, and weekly compensation to veterans’ spouses, partners, children and dependants as compensation payments to the list of benefits, pensions, compensation payments and government grants that are treated as income. This will ensure these payments are taxed and also included in social policy calculations. Thus, the payment amounts will increase affected veterans’ and deceased veterans’ spouses, partners, children and dependants student loan and child support obligations, and reduce their Working for Families entitlements. 8 The proposed amendments to section CW 28(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007 will add weekly income compensation and retirement lump sums for veterans, and weekly compensation to deceased veterans’ spouses, partners, children and dependants to the list of payments that are excluded from exempt income under this section. This will ensure these payments are treated as taxable income and are included in social policy calculations. Other payments under the Veterans’ Support Act 2014 will remain tax- exempt income. Background The policy intention is for income replacement payments created in the Veterans’ Support Act 2014 to be treated as compensation income which is taxable and included in social policy calculations. 9 PAYE AND KIWISAVER TREATMENT OF INCOME REPLACEMENT PAYMENTS (Clauses 2, 3, 4, 5 and 11) Summary of proposed amendments An amendment is proposed to section RD 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to ensure PAYE and KiwiSaver deductions can be made from veteran income replacement payments. Amendments are also proposed to sections 4 and 14 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 to ensure the KiwiSaver auto-enrolment and compulsory employer contributions rules do not apply to veteran income replacement payments. Application date The amendments that relate to weekly compensation and weekly income compensat ion for veterans, and weekly co mpensation to deceased veterans’ spouses, partners, children and dependants will apply from the date of the bill’s enactment. The amendments that relate to retirement lump sum payments for veterans will apply from 7 December 2014. Key features Proposed amendments to section RD 5(6) of the Income Tax Act 2007 will add weekly compensation, weekly income compensation, and retirement lump sums for veterans, and weekly compensation to deceased veterans’ spouses, partners, children and dependants to the list of benefits or grants treated as salary and wages. This will ensure that PAYE deductions can be made from these payments and KiwiSaver deductions can be made from these payments when the veteran joins KiwiSaver on their own behalf. Proposed amendments to section 4 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 will add weekly compensation, weekly income compensation, and retirement lump sums for veterans, and weekly compensation to deceased veterans’ spouses, partners, children and dependants to the list of payments treated as salary and wages that (for the purposes of subpart 3A of the KiwiSaver Act 2006) are excluded from the compulsory employer contribution rules. This will ensure that there is no requirement for compulsory employer contributions to be paid on KiwiSaver deductions made from these payments. 10 Proposed amendments to section 14 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 will add weekly compensat ion and weekly income compensation for veterans, and weekly compensat ion to deceased veterans’ spouses, partners, children and dependants to the list of salary or wage income types that are not subject to the KiwiSaver automatic enrolment rules. This will mean there will be no legal requirement to automatically enrol people receiving veteran income replacement payments in the KiwiSaver scheme. Background The policy intention is that KiwiSaver and PAYE deductions can be made from veteran income replacement payments, but they are not subject to the KiwiSaver auto- enrolment and compulsory employer contributions rules. 11 CRITERIA FOR EARNINGS-RELATED WORKING FOR FAMILIES TAX CREDITS – INCAPACITY (Clauses 2 and 10) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment is proposed to section MA 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to ensure the surviving spouse or partner of a deceased veteran can continue to claim the deceased veteran’s full-time earner-related Working for Families tax credits. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of the bill’s enactment. Key features The proposed amendment will expand section MA 7(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 to include weekly compensation payments to deceased veterans’ spouses or partners. Section MA 7(2)(d) of the Income Tax Act 2007 modifies the Working for Families full-time earner rule for earnings-related payments made by ACC or Veterans Affairs New Zealand to surviving spouses or partners of people who had been incapacitated. The spouse or partner is treated as being employed for the number of hours their deceased partner or spouse would have been employed for if they had not been incapacitated. The deceased person’s assumed hours are added to the number of hours the spouse or partner has worked. Incapacity referred to in section MA 7(2)(d) is defined as being an injury for which an ACC or veteran support payment listed in section MA 7(3) has, is or will be paid. Background People need to meet certain criteria to qualify to receive Working for Families tax credits. Recipients of the in-work tax credit (IWTC) and the minimum family tax credit (MFTC) are required to be full-time earners (work 20 hours if single, 30 hours as a couple). However, if a person is receiving an ACC earnings-related payment due to an incapacity, the hours the person worked before being injured count towards their hours of work for Working for Families purposes. When these people die, their spouses and partners can continue to receive the deceased person’s payments and full- time earner-related tax credits (the IWTC and MFTC). 12 The policy intention is for weekly income compensation and weekly compensation for veterans and weekly compensation to deceased veterans’ spouses or partners to be treated the same as ACC earnings-related payments for Working for Families purposes. An amendment made to section MA 7(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 in the Veterans’ Support Act 2014 will ensure that weekly compensation and weekly income compensat ion for veterans are treated as relating to an incapacity and therefore the work hours test is modified for Working for Families purposes. However, currently, section MA 7(3) does not include weekly compensation payments to deceased veterans’ spouses or partners. Therefore, these payments will not be treated as relating to an incapacity for section MA 7(2)(d). Hence, surviving spouses or partners will not qualify to receive a deceased veteran’s full-time earner- related Working for Families tax credits (IWTC or MFTC) without the proposed amendment in this bill. 13
GST treatment of bodies corporate A government discussion document Hon Todd McClay Minister of Revenue First published in June 2014 by Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue, PO Box 2198, Wellington, 6140. GST treatment of bodies corporate – a government discussion document. ISBN 978-0-478-42402-7 CONTENTS CHAPTER 1 Background 1 How to make a submission 2 CHAPTER 2 Proposed new rules 4 GST exemption for goods and services that a body corporate provides to its unit owners under the Unit Titles Act 2010 4 Proposed application date 5 Savings provision for bodies corporate currently registered for GST 5 Date of registration for bodies corporate covered by the savings provision 6 Look-through rule to allow the underlying owners to claim input tax deductions if they are GST-registered 6 APPENDIX 1 Suggested draft legislation 8 APPENDIX 2 Current law 10 1 CHAPTER 1 Background 1.1 New Zealand’s Goods and Services Tax (GST) rules require businesses, clubs and other entities to register for GST if they supply goods or services worth more than $60,000 a year. GST-registered persons are required to file GST returns and pay GST on the goods and services they provide (their supplies). The amount of GST they pay is based on the value of these supplies less the GST cost of any inputs that they purchase from other GST- registered persons. In this respect the GST system only taxes the ―value added‖ by each business in a supply chain. 1.2 A body corporate is a legal entity created under the Unit Titles Act 2010 when multiple owners have unit title properties in an apartment building or similar complex. 1 The body corporate comprises all the property owners and provides a way for the owners to act together in relation to their common and shared interests. This includes organising building maintenance, insurance, administration and financial management. 1.3 Currently, most bodies corporate are not registered for GST and Inland Revenue’s historical position has been not to allow bodies corporate to register for GST. A High Court decision, Taupo Ika Nui Body Corporate v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,147, appeared to support this position by suggesting that most residential bodies corporate would not be required to register for GST. 1.4 In recent years Inland Revenue has been asked to consider whether bodies corporate should be able to register for GST – in particular, by a small number of bodies corporate who consider they could be entitled to GST refunds (as their expenses have exceeded their fees). 1.5 To answer this question, Inland Revenue undertook a legal analysis and came to a view that, under the current law, a body corporate could be considered to carry on a taxable activity and make supplies to their owners in relation to a number of services required by the Unit Titles Act 2010. 1.6 A consequence of this view is that, if a body corporate makes supplies that exceed the $60,000 threshold, it would be required to register for GST. Similarly, a body corporate that makes supplies below the threshold would be able to voluntarily register for GST. 1.7 The new interpretative view was consulted on in an issues paper, IRRUIP7: Bodies corporate – GST registration released in May 2013. 1 In this document references to a ―body corporate‖ refer to a body corporate of a unit title development created under section 75 of the Unit Titles Act 2010. 2 1.8 Many submissions on this issues paper raised policy arguments on why bodies corporate should not be required to register for GST. Concerns were raised that the outcome appeared inconsistent with the fact that other types of residential property owners (such as owners of stand-alone homes) are outside the GST system and cannot register for GST. 2 Other submissions pointed out that requiring bodies corporate to register for GST would impose compliance costs but, in most cases, would collect little additional tax revenue. 1.9 In response to these submissions, and concerns about the potential compliance costs that could arise under the new interpretation, the Government has decided to change the law so that it aligns the GST treatment with past operational practice and the GST treatment of other private homeowners. 1.10 For most bodies corporate, who have not registered for GST, the proposed changes would ensure that they would not have to take any action. 1.11 As part of the proposed changes, a ―savings‖ provision will be provided for bodies corporate that are currently registered for GST. The savings provision will mean that these bodies corporate would apply the new rules from 6 June 2014 (the date the proposed changes were announced) and would apply the existing law for earlier periods. 1.12 Chapter 2 describes the technical details of the Government’s proposals and the intended policy outcomes of these proposals. To further clarify how the proposed rules might work, some suggested draft legislation has been prepared and presented in Appendix 1. How to make a submission 1.13 The Government invites submissions on whether the proposed new rules and draft legislation would achieve the intended policy outcomes. Following analysis of these submissions, the Government intends to introduce amendments in the next available taxation bill. 1.14 Submissions should be addressed to: GST treatment of bodies corporate C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 Or email policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with ―GST treatment of bodies corporate‖ in the subject line. Electronic submissions are encouraged. The closing date for submissions is Friday, 18 July 2014. 2 In the case of an owner-occupier, GST does not apply as there is no supply for consideration when the homeowner provides accommodation to themselves. The GST Act exempts the supply of residential accommodation from GST to ensure that renters are not disadvantaged relative to owner occupiers. 3 1.15 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their release. The withholding of particular submissions, or parts thereof, on the grounds of privacy, or commercial sensitivity, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. Those making a submission who consider that there is any part of it that should properly be withheld under the Act should clearly indicate this. QUESTIONS FOR SUBMITTERS 1. A GST exemption is proposed to remove bodies corporate from the GST system from 6 June 2014 (the date the proposed changes were announced) and to ensure that those bodies corporate which have never registered for GST can never register. Would the proposed exemption achieve this result? 2. To preserve tax positions taken by bodies corporate that have been registered for GST before 6 June 2014 a ―savings‖ provision has been developed. Would the savings provision be effective? 3. An optional rule is proposed to allow bodies corporate that have been registered for GST before 6 June 2014 to elect to be treated as being registered from GST from a certain date (1 April 2010). Would this rule work as intended? 4. Some bodies corporate would be de-registered for GST as a result of the proposed exemption and may be required to pay GST on any assets that they own. Is a transitional rule required to deal with this problem? 5. A look-through rule is proposed to eliminate the tax cascades that could otherwise arise when the underlying property owner is GST-registered. Would the proposed rule prevent tax cascades? 4 CHAPTER 2 Proposed new rules 2.1 This chapter describes the new rules that the Government is proposing to introduce. These include:  a GST exemption to remove bodies corporate from the GST system;  a ―look-through‖ rule to allow GST-registered unit owners to claim back GST on supplies provided to the body corporate by third parties (such as insurance) to the extent to which these relate to the unit owners’ taxable activity; and  a ―savings‖ provision and date-of-registration rule that apply to bodies corporate that registered for GST before 6 June 2014 (the date the proposed changes were announced). 2.2 To further clarify how the proposed rules might work, suggested draft legislation has been prepared and presented in Appendix 1. GST exemption for goods and services that a body corporate provides to its unit owners under the Unit Titles Act 2010 (Clause 1 / proposed new section 14(1)(f)) 2.3 It is proposed that a supply provided by a body corporate to its unit owners will be an exempt supply for GST purposes. 3 2.4 To be exempt, the supply must relate to a power or duty of the body corporate as listed in section 84 of the Unit Titles Act 2010. This requirement ensures that the new exemption does not create incentives for unit owners to arrange for their body corporate to provide them with a broader range of goods or services. For example, if the body corporate supplied meals, education or medical care, it would not be appropriate for these to be exempt supplies. 2.5 The proposed exemption should generally prevent bodies corporate from registering for GST. This is because they will not carry on a taxable activity in relation to their exempt supplies to unit owners and so will not be able to register for GST in relation to these activities. 3 In this document, references to a ―body corporate‖ refer to a body corporate of a unit title development created under section 75 of the Unit Titles Act 2010. 5 2.6 The proposed exemption is designed to provide certainty and to eliminate the compliance costs that would otherwise arise if bodies corporate were required to register for GST. These compliance costs would have affected a large number of property owners. For example, if we assume a typical annual body corporate fee is around $3,000, a body corporate comprising 20 or more units could have been required to register. Information from Land Information New Zealand suggests there are about 1,300 bodies corporate with 20 or more units, comprising around 72,000 unit owners who would potentially be affected. Inland Revenue has estimated that it costs small businesses about $2,000 a year to comply with GST. This suggests that the potential total compliance cost savings could be around $2.6 million a year. 2.7 It is likely that some bodies corporate are currently registered for GST. These bodies corporate will become de-registered as a result of the proposed exemption. In some cases this could lead to adverse consequences. For example, a body corporate may be required to pay GST on any assets they own. If problems do arise in practice, it is proposed that transitional rules could be developed to provide relief. 2.8 Some bodies corporate may carry on a separate taxable activity (such as a business venture) that is unconnected to providing goods and services to its unit owners under the Unit Titles Act. Under these circumstances, a body corporate could still register for GST, but the exempt supplies that they provide to their owners under the Unit Titles Act would not be included in their taxable activity. As a consequence, the body corporate would not be able to claim any input tax credits for any inputs used in making these exempt supplies. Proposed application date (Clause 1(2)) 2.9 For a body corporate that has not actually been registered for GST before 6 June 2014, the exemption would apply from 1 October 1986. This would mean these bodies corporate would not be required to register for GST and, in fact, would not be able to register for GST at any point in time. Savings provision for bodies corporate currently registered for GST (Clause 1(2)) 2.10 A ―savings‖ provision will be provided for bodies corporate that are currently registered for GST. These bodies corporate would apply the new exemption from 6 June 2014 and apply the existing law for earlier periods. 2.11 The savings provision would apply to bodies corporate that have actually been registered for GST (so they have a GST number) before 6 June 2014. 2.12 The savings provision means the proposed exemption would not apply to tax positions that have been filed in GST returns before 6 June 2014. 6 2.13 The existing law provides the Commissioner of Inland Revenue with a discretion to determine the date that a person becomes registered for GST. (See section 51(4) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985.) 2.14 However, this discretion is unlikely to provide sufficient certainty for those bodies corporate that have registered for GST before 6 June 2014. This uncertainty is partly a result of the fact that the definition of a ―registered person‖ includes a person who is liable to be registered for GST. 2.15 To provide certainty, an optional rule is proposed for bodies corporate that have registered for GST that will allow them to elect to be treated as being registered for GST from a certain date (usually 1 April 2010). Date of registration for bodies corporate covered by the savings provision (Clause 2 / proposed new sections 51(4B) and (4C)) 2.16 The ―date of registration‖ rule would apply to bodies corporate that registered for GST on a date between 1 April 2010 and 6 June 2014, and who would also be covered by the savings provision. 2.17 It would allow these bodies corporate to elect to be treated as being registered for GST from the later of: a) the date of their first taxable period beginning after 1 April 2010; or b) the date that they first became liable to be registered for GST under section 51(1) of the GST Act 1985. 2.18 So, for example, if a body corporate became liable to register for GST in April 2012 they could only register from April 2012. If they became liable to register in 1998 they could only register from 1 April 2010. 2.19 Allowing these taxpayers to backdate their GST registration to April 2010 is broadly consistent with the four-year time-bar for amending a GST assessment in section 108A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Look-through rule to allow the underlying owners to claim input tax deductions if they are GST-registered (Clause 3 / proposed new section 60C) 2.20 A potential concern with GST exemptions is that they can create ―tax cascades‖ (where the total tax cost would increase with each additional step in the supply chain). 2.21 The GST system eliminates these tax cascades by allowing businesses to claim back the GST cost of their inputs. 7 2.22 For example, if a homeowner runs a GST-registered business from their home, such as workshop or home office, and they purchase house insurance they may be able to claim a GST input credit to the extent to which the insurance relates to the portion of the house that they use for their business. 2.23 In the case of a unit title property, the Unit Titles Act requires the body corporate to arrange insurance. In this scenario, a business may insure its business premises indirectly as part of its body corporate fees. Because there is no GST charged on the body corporate fee, the business may find itself unable to claim back the GST cost of the insurance. 2.24 To remove these tax cascades a ―look-through‖ rule has been developed. The look-through rule would treat any supplies that are received by the body corporate (such as insurance or maintenance), to be provided directly to the underlying owners in proportion to each unit owners’ ownership interest in the body corporate. 2.25 The look-through rule would apply to supplies made after 6 June 2014. 8 APPENDIX 1 Suggested draft legislation Submissions are sought on whether the suggested drafting presented below would achieve the intended policy outcomes described in chapter 2. Following analysis of submissions, the Government intends to introduce amendments in the next available taxation bill. 1 Section 14 amended (Exempt supplies) (1) After section 14(1)(e), insert: ―(f) the supply of goods or services by a body corporate, as that term is defined in section 5 of the Unit Titles Act 2010, to the extent to which the goods or services are supplied under a power or duty of the body corporate as set out in section 84 of that Act.‖ (2) Subsection (1) applies for supplies made on or after 1 October 1986. However, subsection (1) does not apply— (a) to a body corporate that is registered for GST before (date of announcement) as a result of an application under section 51(2) or 51(3); and (b) for the period that starts on 1 October 1986 and ends on (date of announcement); and (c) in relation to the tax treatment under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 of supplies made by the body corporate during the period. 2 Section 51 amended (Persons making supplies in course of taxable activity to be registered) (1) After section 51(4), insert: ―(4B) Subsection (4C) applies to a body corporate that is registered for GST between 1 April 2010 and (date of announcement) as a result of an application under section 51(2) or 51(3). ―(4C) Despite subsection (4), the body corporate may choose to be a registered person for the purposes of this Act with effect from the date that is the later of— ―(a) the first day of their first taxable period that occurs after 1 April 2010; or ―(b) the first day on which they are liable to be registered under subsection (1).‖ (2) Subsection (1) comes into force on (date of announcement). 9 3 New section 60C inserted (Bodies corporate) (1) After section 60B, insert: ―60C Bodies corporate ―(1) To the extent to which a supply of goods or services made to a body corporate is used in the course of making an exempt supply under section 14(1)(f), the supply is treated as made— ―(a) to the persons who are owners of the units and common property administered by the body corporate; and ―(b) in proportion to each unit owner’s ownership interest in the body corporate. ―(2) For the purposes of this section, body corporate, common property, owner, ownership interest, and unit have the meanings given in section 5 of the Unit Titles Act 2010.‖ (2) Subsection (1) applies for supplies made on or after (date of announcement). (3) Subsections (1) and (2) come into force on (date of announcement) 10 APPENDIX 2 Current law There are currently no specific rules for bodies corporate in the GST Act. The main rules for applying GST are set out below. Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Section 2(1) of the GST Act defines ―consideration‖ as: consideration, in relation to the supply of goods and services to any person, includes any payment made or any act or forbearance, whether or not voluntary, in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of, the supply of any goods and services, whether by that person or by any other person; but does not include any payment made by any person as an unconditional gift to any non-profit body: Section 6(1) of the GST Act defines ―taxable activity‖ as: 6. Meaning of term “taxable activity” (1) For the purposes of this Act, the term taxable activity means— (a) any activity which is carried on continuously or regularly by any person, whether or not for a pecuniary profit, and involves or is intended to involve, in whole or in part, the supply of goods and services to any other person for a consideration; and includes any such activity carried on in the form of a business, trade, manufacture, profession, vocation, association, or club: (b) without limiting the generality of paragraph (a), the activities of any public authority or any local authority. ... Section 8(1) of the GST Act collects GST from registered persons on their supplies of goods and services: 8 Imposition of goods and services tax on supply (1) Subject to this Act, a tax, to be known as goods and services tax, shall be charged in accordance with the provisions of this Act at the rate of 15% on the supply (but not including an exempt supply) in New Zealand of goods and services, on or after 1 October 1986, by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person, by reference to the value of that supply. 11 Section 51 of the GST Act contains the rules for registering people for GST: 51 Persons making supplies in course of taxable activity to be registered (1) Subject to this Act, every person who, on or after 1 October 1986, carries on any taxable activity and is not registered, becomes liable to be registered— (a) at the end of any month where the total value of supplies made in New Zealand in that month and the 11 months immediately preceding that month in the course of carrying on all taxable activities has exceeded $60,000 (or such larger amount as the Governor-General may, from time to time, by Order in Council declare): provided that a person does not become liable to be registered by virtue of this paragraph where the Commissioner is satisfied that the value of those supplies in the period of 12 months beginning on the day after the last day of the period referred to in the said paragraph will not exceed that amount: (b) at the commencement of any month where there are reasonable grounds for believing that the total value of the supplies to be made in New Zealand in that month and the 11 months immediately following that month will exceed the amount specified in paragraph (a): provided that any such person shall not become liable where the Commissioner is satisfied that that value will exceed that amount in that period solely as a consequence of— (c) any ending of, including a premature ending of, or any substantial and permanent reduction in the size or scale of, any taxable activity carried on by that person; or (d) the replacement of any plant or other capital asset used in any taxable activity carried on by that person; or (e) the supply, to persons who are non-residents but are physically present in New Zealand, of telecommunications services that are treated as being supplied in New Zealand under sections 8(6) and 8A. (2) Every person who, by virtue of subsection (1), becomes liable to be registered shall apply to the Commissioner in the prescribed form for registration under this Act, within 21 days of becoming so liable, and provide the Commissioner with such further particulars as the Commissioner may require for the purpose of registering that person. (3) Notwithstanding subsections (1) and (2), every person who satisfies the Commissioner that, on or after 1 October 1986,— (a) that person is carrying on any taxable activity; or (b) that person intends to carry on any taxable activity from a specified date,— may apply to the Commissioner in the prescribed form for registration under this Act, and provide the Commissioner with such further particulars as the Commissioner may require for the purpose of registering that person. 12 (4) Where any person has— (a) made application for registration pursuant to subsection (2), (3), or section 54B, and the Commissioner is satisfied that that person is eligible to be registered under this Act, that person shall be a registered person for the purposes of this Act with effect from such date as the Commissioner may determine; or (b) not made application for registration pursuant to subsection (2), and the Commissioner is satisfied that that person is liable to be registered under this Act, that person shall be a registered person for the purposes of this Act with effect from the date on which that person first became liable to be registered under this Act: provided that the Commissioner may, having regard to the circumstances of the case, determine that person to be a registered person from such later date as the Commissioner considers equitable Unit Titles Act 2010 Section 5 of the Unit Titles Act 2010 defines a body corporate: body corporate means a body corporate of a unit title development created under section 75 on the deposit of a unit plan Section 75 of the Unit Titles Act 2010 creates a body corporate as a legal entity separate from the unit owners: 75 Creation of body corporate (1) When a unit plan is deposited under section 17 (and in the case of a staged development, when the first stage unit plan is deposited under section 24), a body corporate is created and is the body corporate for the unit title development created by the deposit of that unit plan. (2) When a unit plan is deposited under section 21 (and in the case of a staged development, when the first stage unit plan is deposited under section 24), a subsidiary body corporate is created and is the body corporate for the subsidiary unit title development created by the deposit of that unit plan. Section 84(1) of the Unit Titles Act 2010 sets out the powers and duties of the body corporate: 84 Powers and duties of body corporate (1) The body corporate has the powers and duties set out in— (a) sections 38 to 42 (which relate to the fixing and reassessment of the ownership interest and the utility interest): (b) section 81 (which permits the body corporate to act as an agent for the unit owners who lease or licence their principal unit and are absent for the purpose of enforcing the body corporate operational rules): (c) section 85 (which requires the body corporate to keep and maintain a register of all the owners of principal units and accessory units on the plan): 13 (d) section 86 (which relates to the body corporate's power to sign documents on behalf of the owner): (e) section 87 (which requires the payment of ground rental to a lessor): (f) section 90 (which relates to the calling of general meetings): (g) section 105(3) (which requires the body corporate to comply with the body corporate operational rules): (h) section 108 (which is the general power of delegation): (i) sections 115 and 117 to 120 (which relate to the establishment and maintenance of the funds): (j) section 116 (which requires the body corporate to establish and maintain a long-term maintenance plan): (k) section 121 (which relates to the raising of amounts for each fund and the imposition of levies on the unit owners to establish and maintain each fund): (l) sections 130 and 131 (which relate to the spending, borrowing, and investing of money and the distribution of surplus money and property): (m) section 132 (which relates to the keeping of accounting records and submission of its yearly financial statements to an independent auditor): (n) section 135 (which relates to insurance of the buildings and other improvements on the land): (o) section 136(4) (which relates to the application of insurance moneys in or towards reinstatement of the development): (p) section 138 (which relates to repair and maintenance of the common property, assets designed for use in connection with the common property, infrastructure, and building elements and access for those purposes): (q) section 206 (which relates to the provision of records and documents on request from a unit owner): (r) any other provisions of this Act, any other Act, or the regulations that confer powers or duties on the body corporate and subject to any limitations to those powers and duties in this Act, any other Act, or the regulations. Section 121 of the Unit Titles Act 2010 gives a body corporate the power to impose levies on owners. Subsections (1) and (2) provide: 121 Contributions to be levied on unit owners (1) A body corporate may determine from time to time the amounts to be raised for each fund and impose levies on the owners of principal units to establish and maintain each fund. (2) The levies must be calculated as follows: (a) in the case of the operating account, long-term maintenance fund, and any contingency fund, in proportion to each unit owner’s utility interest; and 14 (b) in the case of any capital improvement fund, in proportion to each unit owner’s ownership interest. The Unit Titles Act 1972 applied up until 1 October 2012 when it was repealed and replaced by the Unit Titles Act 2010. In particular, clause 219 of the Unit Titles Act 2010 means the 2010 Act now applies to pre-2010 Unit titles. 219 Existing unit title developments (1) In this subpart, an existing unit title development means the stratum estates to which a particular unit plan within the meaning of the Unit Titles Act 1972 relates where the unit plan— (a) was deposited before the commencement of this Act; and (b) has not been cancelled. (2) An existing unit title development is a unit title development under this Act and the body corporate for the unit plan that relates to that unit title development is, for the purposes of this Act and for all other purposes, the body corporate for that unit title development.

Like most countries, New Zealand taxes its residents on income-earning assets that they hold in New Zealand and overseas. This includes interests in foreign superannuation schemes. A foreign superannuation scheme is a scheme created outside New Zealand to provide people with retirement benefits. The current rules for taxing foreign superannuation can be complex and difficult to comply with, particularly when people transfer their foreign superannuation as a lump sum into a New Zealand superannuation scheme. In some cases people must pay tax on receipt under complex rules, while many others are required to pay tax on an annual basis on their foreign superannuation scheme under the “foreign investment fund” (FIF) rules, even when they have not received any money. If someone pays tax under the FIF rules, they do not pay tax on any payments they receive from the scheme. The New Zealand Government has proposed changes to the rules for taxing foreign superannuation interests held by New Zealand tax residents to make them fairer and simpler. The proposed rules contain a special provision to help taxpayers who haven’t complied in the past to come up to speed with their tax obligations. See “I have heard about something called the „15% option‟. Can you tell me more about it?” for further information about this. 3 Who do the new rules apply to? The new rules will apply to New Zealand residents who have an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme that was acquired while they were non-resident. This would include new migrants and returning New Zealanders who have been overseas to work. The new rules will not apply to interests held by New Zealand residents in Australian superannuation schemes. The new rules will not change the longstanding existing tax rules for pensions that are paid periodically from an overseas source, which are generally taxed in full on receipt. I was already resident in New Zealand when I got my interest in my foreign superannuation scheme. Do the new rules apply to me? No. The new rules only apply if you first acquired your interest in your foreign superannuation scheme while non-resident. If you were already resident in New Zealand when you first acquired your interest in your foreign superannuation scheme, you will generally need to account for tax under the FIF rules. If the FIF rules apply to you, then you need to pay tax on your interest on an annual basis even if you do not receive any payments from your scheme. However, you will not need to pay any New Zealand tax when you do receive payments. I have an interest in an Australian superannuation scheme. How is this taxed? Under existing law, lump-sum payments from Australian superannuation schemes are exempt from New Zealand tax. Pensions from Australian superannuation schemes received by New Zealand residents are exempt from tax in New Zealand, if they would be exempt from tax in Australia if the person was resident in Australia. You do not generally need to return income under the FIF rules in relation to your Australian superannuation scheme. I currently receive a pension and return it in my tax return. What do I do now? No changes are being made to the tax treatment of pensions. Pensions are generally periodic payments. Lump sums tend to be one-off payments. Under the current law, pensions are generally taxed in full at the person’s marginal tax rate. This means that you should continue to return your pension in your income tax return. 4 What are the proposed rules? If enacted, from 1 April 2014, people who acquired their interest in a foreign superannuation scheme while non-resident will be taxed on that interest only when they actually receive a payment from the scheme or when they transfer their interest to a New Zealand or Australian superannuation scheme. The FIF rules will not apply to their interest. This means that people will not need to do anything until the time that they transfer their scheme, or receive a pension or a lump-sum amount from their foreign superannuation scheme. The proposed rules will be a simpler and more consistent way of taxing amounts that are received as lump sums from foreign superannuation schemes. In addition, the proposed rules provide a four-year window during which new migrants and returning New Zealanders may receive lump-sum withdrawals and transfers with no New Zealand tax to pay. This is in line with the existing four-year exemption available to certain new migrants in relation to their foreign income. A “lump sum” in the context of the proposed rules includes:  a one-off withdrawal in cash;  a transfer into a New Zealand superannuation scheme, including KiwiSaver;  a transfer into an Australian superannuation scheme; and  depending on the circumstances, a transfer of your interest into someone else’s name. For lump sums received on or after 1 April 2014, the proposed rules aim to tax the gains that have accrued to a person’s foreign superannuation scheme while they have been living in New Zealand. From a New Zealand tax perspective, the new rules have been designed so as not to provide a tax incentive to either transfer their funds to a New Zealand scheme when they first arrive, or leave it with the foreign scheme provider. The new rules also provide that transfers from one foreign scheme to another foreign non-Australian scheme will be exempt from tax (although transfers to an Australian scheme are taxed). If a New Zealand resident transfers from one foreign scheme to another, then eventually to a New Zealand superannuation scheme, they won’t be taxed until the time of transfer into the New Zealand scheme, but the amount of tax will take into account the gains made by both foreign schemes while they were New Zealand- resident. There are two methods proposed from 1 April 2014 that allow a person to calculate the tax payable on their lump sum, both of which aim to put the person in a similar tax position to the one they would be in, had they transferred their foreign superannuation scheme to New Zealand when they first migrated:  The schedule method: In most cases, the tax will be based on a graduated, percentage-based scale depending on how long a person has been living in New Zealand.  The formula method: An alternative method is available for people who have a defined contribution scheme and have sufficient information to calculate the actual gains that have accrued to their scheme while they have been living in New Zealand. 5 There is a special provision that will help taxpayers get up to date with their tax obligations if they have not complied in the past. This option is available when a person has received a lump sum or transferred their foreign superannuation scheme to another scheme (or has applied to their foreign scheme provider to do so before 1 April 2014), and has not complied with the tax rules that apply to their scheme. They have the option of including 15% of the lump sum in their 2013–14 or 2014–15 income tax return and paying tax on that amount. Will the proposed rules tax the entire capital amount of my foreign superannuation? The proposed rules will not generally tax the entire capital amount of the lump sum that is received. Rather, the rules will tax only a portion of the lump sum that is received or transferred. The portion that will be taxed represents tax that should have been paid on the income earned while living in New Zealand. It will not tax amounts that have accrued while you were not a New Zealand resident. Do I have to transfer my funds to a New Zealand scheme? No, there is no requirement to withdraw or transfer your foreign superannuation to New Zealand. 6 Transfers or withdrawals before 1 April 2014 I have heard about something called the “15% option”. Can you tell me more about it? The 15% option was proposed to help people who withdrew a lump sum or made a transfer from their foreign superannuation scheme and did not comply with the rules that applied at the time. Under the proposed new rules, the 15% option will be available if you have received a lump sum from your foreign superannuation scheme or transferred your foreign superannuation scheme to another superannuation scheme (or applied to your foreign scheme provider to do so) between 1 January 2000 and 31 March 2014, and did not comply with the tax rules that applied at the time. You will need to include 15% of your lump sum in your 2013–14 or 2014–15 income tax return. You will pay tax on that amount at your marginal tax rate. For example, if your marginal tax rate is 33%, you will effectively pay tax of just under 5% on the value of the transfer. There will generally be no use-of-money interest or late payment penalties charged if you use the 15% option. The 15% option is not compulsory. If you do not want to use it, you must calculate your tax liability under the law that existed at the time of withdrawal or transfer, but keep in mind that you might be subject to penalties and interest in relation to any overdue tax. If you correctly complied with your tax obligations at the time (including if you correctly calculated a zero tax liability), you do not need to do anything. I arrived in New Zealand in 2004 and transferred my foreign superannuation in 2007. I didn’t think I had any tax to pay, but now I’m not sure. What do I do now? You have two options under the proposed rules. You can use the “15% option” provided for in the new rules. (See “I have heard about something called the „15% option‟. Can you tell me more about it?”) Alternatively, you can calculate and pay tax under the tax rules that applied at the time. If you correctly calculate that you actually had no tax to pay under the rules that applied at the time, then you have no further tax to pay. If you were required to pay tax under the rules that applied at the time, you will need to pay this tax. You may also be subject to penalties and interest in relation to the overdue tax. 7 I arrived in New Zealand in 2007 and transferred my foreign superannuation in 2009. My accountant advised that I had no tax to pay on the transfer because I was a “transitional resident”. Do I suddenly have to pay tax on this now? No – the new rules do not impose any further tax on past withdrawals. You do not have to pay any tax if you correctly calculated and paid your tax at the time. This includes if you had no tax to pay because of rules that existed at the time, such as the “transitional resident rules” which provides a 4-year exemption for foreign income of people who arrived after 1 April 2006 and meet certain criteria. I want to make a withdrawal from my foreign superannuation fund and use the “15% option”, but I don’t know if my fund can finalise the withdrawal before 1 April 2014. It is proposed that if you have applied to your foreign superannuation scheme for the release or transfer of funds by 31 March 2014 you can still use the 15% option, even if the foreign scheme has not transferred it by then. Keep proof of your application to the foreign scheme in case it is needed. 8 I haven’t transferred or received a payment yet I migrated to New Zealand in 1995 with an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme. I haven’t yet received any payments from it. Now I’ve been told that I was supposed to have paid yearly tax on it under the “foreign investment fund” rules. Is this true? Do I have to pay back-tax for these years? Under the current tax rules, an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme is subject to tax under the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules in many cases. If the FIF rules apply, you are required to account for tax on your interest annually (even if you don’t receive any payments from the scheme). Some people were not aware of this. Under the proposed rules, if your foreign superannuation interest was subject to the FIF rules but you did not comply and you have not received any payments from the scheme, you will not have to pay back-tax in relation to your interest. This means that you won’t need to do anything at the moment. You will only have to pay tax when you actually receive a pension or lump-sum payment from the foreign superannuation scheme or when it is transferred to a New Zealand or Australian scheme. I currently pay tax on my interest in a foreign superannuation fund under the FIF rules. What should I do from 1 April 2014? If you have filed an income tax return with FIF income or loss attributed to your foreign superannuation scheme before 20 May 2013, you can choose to continue to use the FIF rules. If you choose to continue with the FIF rules, you will need to file an income tax return including your FIF income or loss every year until you receive your final distribution. You do not need to return tax on distributions from the scheme. If you have not filed a return of income including FIF income or loss before 20 May 2013, you will not be able to use the FIF rules after 1 April 2014. Instead you will have to calculate tax under the new rules when you receive a pension or a lump sum. Alternatively, you will have the option to pay tax upon receipt under the proposed rules. You will not be able to get a credit for the tax that you have already paid under the FIF rules. 9 Transfers or withdrawals on or after 1 April 2014 What should I do when I receive a payment from my foreign superannuation scheme or make a transfer on or after 1 April 2014? If the payment is a pension, you will generally need to include the gross amount in your tax return. If the payment is a lump sum (or a transfer to a New Zealand or Australian superannuation scheme), you will generally need to calculate the amount of tax payable using either the schedule method or the formula method. These two methods are discussed further in “What are the proposed rules?” I want to transfer my fund from my foreign superannuation scheme to another foreign superannuation scheme. Do I need to pay tax on the transfer? Under the proposed rules you will generally not need to pay tax on the transfer, unless the transfer is to a scheme in New Zealand or Australia. 10 I’ve received a payment which has had foreign tax withheld on it. Do I still have to pay New Zealand tax on it? Under existing law, you generally need to include the gross (pre-foreign tax) payment in your New Zealand income tax return. (If you will be returning a lump sum under the schedule method or the 15% option, then you multiply the gross payment by the percentage given under the schedule method, or by 15% if you are using the 15% option). Whether you are entitled to any relief in New Zealand for amounts paid overseas depends on whether there is a “double tax agreement” (DTA) between New Zealand and the country from which the payment is made. DTAs are treaties between two countries that establish which country has taxing rights over certain types of income. They provide a mechanism for ensuring that income is not taxed twice. Under almost all of New Zealand’s DTAs, most pensions and other payments made in respect of retirement (such as lump sums paid from superannuation schemes) are only taxable by the country in which the person receiving the payment is resident. In most cases, the country from where the payment is made is not allowed to tax the payment. This is the way in which most DTAs provide relief from double taxation in respect of pensions. This means that most pensions and lump sums paid from a foreign superannuation scheme to a New Zealand resident should only be taxed by New Zealand. If this is the case and foreign tax has been withheld on the pension or lump-sum payment, you would generally be entitled to claim tax relief (for example, by seeking a tax refund) from the foreign tax authority. You should generally not claim the foreign tax as a credit in your New Zealand income tax return. It is important to check the provisions of the DTA of the country from which the payment is made, as the provisions of each DTA can differ. In particular, the rules for pensions paid by foreign Governments can sometimes be different. All of New Zealand’s DTAs can be found on Inland Revenue’s tax policy website. Where there is no DTA with the other country, and if the foreign tax is of substantially the same nature as New Zealand income tax, then you can generally claim a foreign tax credit in your tax return. The tax credit claimed must not be more than the amount of New Zealand tax relating to that pension or lump sum. 11 Where can I find more information about the proposed changes? Information about the proposed changes in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Bill can be found here: http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/news/2013-05-20-foreign-super-tax-bill-introduced.

Inland Revenue will also provide information about the new rules on its website and in pamphlets when the new rules are enacted.
Page | 1 February 2014 Proposed foreign superannuation tax rules – transitional measures fact sheet The information in this factsheet is for people who:  withdraw their foreign superannuation as a lump sum or transfer their foreign superannuation to a New Zealand or overseas superannuation scheme between 1 January 2000 and 31 March 2014 and did not comply with the rules that applied at the time they made the withdrawal or transfer; or  have filed an income tax return declaring foreign investment fund (FIF) income or loss for their interest in a foreign superannuation scheme before 20 May 2013. Taxpayers who have not withdrawn or transferred their foreign superannuation do not have to do anything until they do so. Taxpayers who have made a withdrawal or received a pension and have correctly complied with the rules as they applied at the time do not need to do anything. Introduction The current rules for taxing people who move to New Zealand on their foreign superannuation can be complex and difficult to understand, and do not always result in a fair outcome. Some people who have interests in foreign superannuation schemes, or who have withdrawn or transferred their foreign superannuation interests in recent years, have not complied with their New Zealand tax obligations. To address these issues, new rules for taxing foreign superannuation are proposed in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Bill. The proposed new rules are intended to be simpler and easier to comply with than the current rules. Proposed changes  For people who have made a lump-sum withdrawal or transfer and have not met their tax obligations, a transitional provision is proposed to allow people to meet their past tax obligations by paying tax on 15% of the amount transferred or withdrawn.  For people who have previously complied with the FIF rules in relation to a foreign superannuation interest, “grandparenting” provisions are proposed which will allow those rules to continue to be available under certain conditions. Page | 2 15% option for lump-sum withdrawals from 1 January 2000 to 31 March 2014 A withdrawal from a superannuation fund is generally a taxable event (unless the foreign superannuation interest is an interest in a FIF). Withdrawals include transfers to another superannuation scheme in New Zealand or overseas. The proposed legislation contains a transitional provision to help people who have not met their tax obligations in the past to comply with those obligations, that is, paying the required tax on the withdrawal or transfer. The proposed transitional provision will allow people to meet their past tax obligations by paying tax on 15% of the amount transferred or withdrawn. The remaining 85% of that sum will not attract income tax. This option will be available for lump-sum transfers and withdrawals made from 1 January 2000 to 31 March 2014. If the person can show that they have applied to the overseas scheme by 31 March 2014 for release of their funds, they can still use the 15% option even if the overseas scheme does not finalise the transfer until after 31 March 2014. Taxpayers can choose to calculate their tax liability under the 15% rate option or under the existing law. Under the 15% option, the income must be included in the person’s tax return for either of the 2013–14 or 2014–15 income years. The due date for tax will be the due date for payment for the corresponding 2013–14 or 2014–15 income year tax return in which the lump sum is included. Paying the tax on this 15% amount will satisfy their income tax liability for that transfer or withdrawal. Penalties and interest will not apply from the income year in which the income should have been included in their tax return. Taxpayers who choose to use the 15% option in subsequent income years would need to have their tax return for the 2014–15 income year reassessed in order to apply that concessionary tax rate. People who have complied with the existing law and paid the associated tax will not be able to reassess their position using the 15% option. If a person does not want to use the 15% option to get up to date with their tax obligations in relation to their foreign superannuation withdrawal or transfer, they must apply the law as it applied at the time that they made the withdrawal. For example, a person could choose to apply the available subscribed capital rules (if allowed under the law at the time) if they think that it will result in a lower tax liability than tax under the 15% option – perhaps because all or the majority of the transfer will be a return of capital rather than a dividend. The original due date would still apply if there is a positive amount of income under reassessment. This means that any relevant penalties and use-of-money interest will apply from the income year in which the transfer or withdrawal occurred. Further information about the process for disclosing past withdrawals will be available on Inland Revenue’s website following enactment. Page | 3 15% option – example 1: Jenny transferred $150,000 from her foreign superannuation scheme to a New Zealand scheme in February 2004. She did not include this income in her IR3 return for the 2003–04 income year, and did not pay tax on the interest under the FIF rules. She decides to use the 15% option for her lump-sum transfer. She declares $22,500 (being 15% of $150,000) as income in her IR 3 return for the 2014–15 income year. Jenny will be liable for any penalties or use-of-money interest in relation to her 2014–15 tax return, not her 2004–05 tax return. 15% option – example 2: Catherine transferred $150,000 from her foreign superannuation scheme to a New Zealand scheme in February 2004. She did not include this income in her IR3 return for the 2003–04 income year. She decides to use the law as it applied at the time that she made the withdrawal to calculate the tax on her lump-sum transfer. In her situation, her interest was not an interest in a FIF, and the majority of her $150,000 was a return of capital, and only $2,000 of the amount is income. She has her 2003–04 IR 3 return amended to include the $2,000. Catherine will be liable for penalties and use-of-money interest from the 2003–2004 income year. Application of the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules after 1 April 2014 Generally, the bill proposes that the FIF rules will no longer apply to interests in foreign superannuation schemes. However, the FIF rules will continue to apply where an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme was acquired while the person was resident in New Zealand. Optional “grandparenting” provisions will also apply to certain taxpayers who have previously complied with the FIF rules in relation to a foreign superannuation interest. “Grandparenting” means that the FIF rules will continue to be available after 1 April 2014 if a number of conditions are met. A taxpayer must have filed an income tax return including FIF income or loss for an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme before 20 May 2013 (the introduction of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Bill). Grandparenting will be available on an interest-by-interest basis. If a taxpayer has interests in more than one foreign superannuation scheme but has only returned FIF income in respect of one of the interests, the taxpayer will only be grandparented in relation to that interest. Page | 4 To elect to be grandparented in relation to a foreign superannuation interest, a taxpayer must continue to include FIF income or loss for that interest in their income tax return for all income years ending after 1 April 2014. If a taxpayer fails to do so for any income year, they will no longer be grandparented. They will then be required to account for income tax on any lump sums received from the scheme under the proposed new rules. Once a taxpayer has lost their grandparented status in relation to an interest, they cannot regain it. Legislation These proposed changes are included in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Bill introduced on 20 May 2013 and will apply from 1 April 2014.
