This Interpretation Statement provides guidance to people who make money from creating online content. It covers a variety of activities, including:  posting videos, images or text on social media platforms such as YouTube, Instagram and Facebook;  blogging;  influencing;  competing in online gaming competitions; and  streaming game play on platforms such as Twitch, Facebook gaming and YouTube gaming. 2. In this Interpretation Statement, people who make money from online content- creation activities are referred to as content creators. 3. A content creator may have a wide variety of income sources, including:  payments from platforms based on the number of times content is viewed;  payments from platforms when viewers subscribe to channels created by the content creator;  payments for promoting products or brands in the content creator’s online content;  payments for advertisements embedded in the online content;  commissions earned from affiliate marketing and links;  sales of merchandise or other products or services through platforms such as Shopify or Gumroad;  donations or gifts; and  prize money (eg, from e-sports competitions). 4. Content creators and their tax agents have asked for guidance to help understand and comply with their tax obligations. 5. This Interpretation Statement expands on an earlier Question We’ve Been Asked, QB 17/05: Income Tax – whether YouTube receipts are taxable (Inland Revenue, 2017). 6. The following guidance addresses difficulties that can arise for content creators when attempting to comply with their tax obligations. IS 21/08 | 28 September 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 46 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 7. Two topics may be relevant for younger people and people earning very low amounts, so content creators may wish to consider them first:  Income derived by young people who are still at school, which may be exempt from tax (see from \[66\]) .  The $200 threshold for income other than reportable income (see from \[72\]. 8. The general topics covered in this statement include:  important factors in working out whether amounts are income (see from \[9\]) ;  “gifts” or “donations” can be income (see from \[31\]) ;  non-monetary items (or contra) can be income (see from \[43\]);  deductions for expenses and depreciation losses (see from \[80\]) ;  income earned by a New Zealand resident overseas (see from \[113\]) ;  tax withheld by a payer (see from \[121\]) ;  GST (see from \[126\]); and  keeping good records (see from \[130\]) . Guidance Important factors in working out whether amounts are income 9. In working out whether an amount received by a person is income, key factors to consider are the: 1  regularity of receipts;  relationship between the recipient and the payer; and  reason for the payment of the amount. 10. Clear relationships exist between content creators (recipients) and payers. Generally, content creators receive amounts from people who view the creator’s content, online platforms that facilitate the posting and streaming of content, businesses that want exposure for their products, or competition organisers. 1 Reid v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,176 (CA). IS 21/08 | 28 September 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 4 of 46 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 11. Further, the recipient’s content-creation activity will generally be the reason for the payment; the payments being made to support or reward the content creator. 12. The relationships between the recipient and the payer and the reasons for the payment are factors that will generally point to the amounts received by content creators being income. 13. However, in many cases, whether an amount received by a content creator is income will depend on the regularity with which a content creator receives such amounts (see from \[14\]). Regularity of receipts 14. In many cases, regularity is the main reason why amounts are income. Amounts that are received regularly by a person may become part of the receipts upon which the person depends for their living expenses. 15. In some cases, an amount can be income even if it is not a regular receipt (even a single receipt can be income in some cases). However, generally, if regularity is not present, an amount is less likely to be income. See Example 1. 16. To be regular, an amount does not need to be received every fortnight or every month like a salary or wage. For example, if a content creator receives payments from YouTube or Twitch in some months but not in others (because they do not always reach the payment thresholds), the payments will nevertheless be regarded as regular. 17. Some content creators may derive amounts from multiple sources. These amounts should be considered together when determining whether the amounts are received regularly. Example 1 – Amounts not received regularly Jack administers and creates content for a community Facebook page. Jack attends a community event and receives $50 cash from a member of the page in appreciation of Jack’s efforts. Jack does not normally receive payments of this kind, and he does not derive any other type of income for the work he does on the page. It is relevant to consider the relationship between the payer and the recipient. Jack, the recipient, receives a payment from a member of the Facebook page. The reason for the payment is Jack’s work on the page. This relationship and the reason for the IS 21/08 | 28 September 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 5 of 46 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] payment points to the cash gift being income in Jack’s hands. Essentially, Jack is being rewarded for his efforts by a person who has benefitted from those efforts. However, Jack does not receive amounts regularly as a result of the work he does on the Facebook page. The cash gift received is not the type of receipt on which Jack can rely to meet his living expenses. Therefore, the cash gift is not income. Note the fact the amount was a voluntary payment would not prevent the amount from being income (see the discussion from \[31\]). Costs of the activity are greater than the revenue 18. There are different tests to identify income. In broad terms, income is generally something on which a person can rely to help pay for their living expenses. If the revenue from a content-creation activity does not normally cover the cost of the activity, this would indicate the activity is not a business and suggests the amount will not be income. 19. This doesn’t mean an activity must always make a profit for the revenue to be income. If a person has a business that involves having an intention of making a profit, then amounts derived by the business can be income even if the business sometimes makes a loss or has only made losses to date. 20. The word “hobby” might be used to describe an activity that does not normally make a profit or where the person does not have an intention of making a profit. However, the Act does not use the word “hobby”, and whether an amount is income does not depend on the ordinary meaning of the word “hobby”. I n case law, the courts’ focus is on whether an intention to make a profit exists (which is relevant to whether there is income from a business). 2 See Example 2. Example 2 – Costs of activity greater than revenue Emma enjoys posting the occasional photo on Facebook and Instagram. Her social media accounts include a link where people can make a monetary contribution to support her activity. Emma doesn’t expect to receive much, but it was easy to set up, so she thought why not. Emma receives five one-off payments during the income year totalling $25. The only other income Emma derives in the income year is employment income. 2 Grieve v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,682 (CA). IS 21/08 | 28 September 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 6 of 46 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] It is likely Emma has expenses associated with taking her photos (for example, travel costs and depreciation loss on her camera) that are greater than the income she derives. Therefore, Emma is not likely to be making, or be intending to make, a profit that could help her to meet her living expenses, so the $25 is unlikely to be income for Emma. Even if the $25 were income, because Emma receives less than $200 of “income other than reportable income”, she would not need to include the $25 in her tax return (see the discussion from \[72\]). Reinvesting profits into an income-earning activity 21. A person’s profit (or net income as it is called in the Act) is calculated as a person’s total assessable income for the year less total allowable deductions. Allowable deductions are discussed further from \[79\], but capital expenditure (that is, money spent on an asset) is not an allowable deduction. This means the calculation of a person’s profit or net income does not include any deduction for assets they purchase during the year. Therefore, a person could have a profit even if they reinvest in their income-earning activity by purchasing new assets. See Example 3. Example 3 – Profit reinvested into the business Kenya is working hard to build up her online content-creation business. She and her helpers create short comedy skits based on role-playing games they play, which they post on YouTube. During the income year, Kenya purchased a van, so she could transport equipment and her helpers to filming locations. Kenya cannot claim a deduction for the full cost of the van in the income year because it is capital expenditure. However, Kenya could cl aim a deduction for depreciation loss on the van in the current income year and, if her business continues, she can continue to claim depreciation on the van in future income years. (Note that an adjustment might be needed for any private use of the van.) During the income year, the business made a profit for the first time of $1,500 (including the deduction for depreciation on the van). Kenya doesn’t consider she has made a profit because all the income she derived was reinvested back into her business (that is, through the purchase of the van). However, the $1,500 is profit. The full cost of the van is not included in the calculation of profit. IS 21/08 | 28 September 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 7 of 46 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Side activity 22. An amount derived by a person from a secondary or side activity (sometimes called “side hustles”) can be taxable even if they have a job or other business from which they derive most of their income (assuming the amount has the characteristics of income and is not exempt, as discussed above). See Example 4. Example 4 – Side activities Liam is employed full time as a high school music teacher. He also has a couple of side activities:  Liam fills in for a local band a few times a year when they need a guitarist.  Liam creates content for a YouTube music channel in which he interviews musicians over drinks. The YouTube channel has been doing well, and Liam has recently become a YouTube partner. Liam has a collection of 20 10-minute videos in his channel that he has created over the last two years. He intends to add to this content by adding a new video every couple of months. Liam receives a YouTube payment of approximately $130 every 3 to 4 months. His total income from the channel for the income year just ended is $480. Although Liam has only earned income of $480, the amounts are received on a regular basis. The payments are also a product of the effort that Liam puts into creating his videos. Therefore, the payments are income under ordinary concepts. It does not matter that Liam also has a full-time job and that this is a secondary form of income or side-activity. Liam also calculates that he is allowed deductions for expenditure totalling $300, including entertainment expenditure (at the rate of 50%), which was sometimes needed to get his interviewees talking, and depreciation losses on a laptop and camera. Liam must include the $480 of income received from his YouTube channel and the $600 he derived from his gigs with the band during the year, in his income tax return. Liam can claim the deductible expenditure at the same time. Passive receipts 23. Passive receipts may arise in the context of content creation because some content can continue to generate income after it is posted with little or no additional activity from the content creator. For example, once posted, imbedded product affiliate links in blogs, or content on platforms such as Skillshare or Patreon may continue to generate IS 21/08 | 28 September 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 8 of 46 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] income. The derivation of passive income from content creation may be less common than it once was. For example, the YouTube Partner Program now states that YouTube may disable monetisation on channels that haven’t uploaded a video or posted to the community tab for six months or more: 3 Stay active to keep making money As the YouTube Partner Program continues to grow, it's important to maintain a healthy, active ecosystem of channels. In order to focus our support for creators who are active and engaged with the community, we may disable monetization on channels that haven’t uploaded a video or posted to the Community tab for 6 months or more. 24. However, situations may exist where YouTube or other online platforms decide not to disable monetisation. 25. Even for someone who is no longer creating content, these passive receipts are likely to be income (under ordinary concepts) if they are received regularly. Passive receipts from historical content is also analogous to interest, dividends, royalties, rents and other returns from property. 26. Note that if a person stops making new content, this will likely prevent them from continuing to claim deductions (for example, for home office expenses or depreciation losses). A person may have a deduction for an expense or a loss only if the expense or loss is incurred in deriving income. If a person has stopped creating new content, their expenses and losses will not be incurred in deriving income, even if they continue to derive passive income from past efforts. See Example 5, and see from \[79\] about deductions for expenses and depreciation losses. Example 5 – Passive income Aart has a YouTube channel with a large collection of home renovation and building tutorials. Aart used to have more time to create content, but he is currently busy with building work, so has stopped creating content. Aart’s videos have an enduring appeal and they continue to generate income. Because of the nature of the content, and despite not posting any fresh content, YouTube allows Aart to continue being a YouTube partner and monetise the content. Income Although his income drops, Aart continues to derive regular payments from YouTube for his historical content, and these payments continue to be income for Aart. 3 YouTube Partner Program Overview & Eligibility (webpage, YouTube, updated November 2020). IS 21/08 | 28 September 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 9 of 46 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Deductions Aart is no longer trying to create new videos, and he does not need to do anything to continue deriving passive income from his existing videos. Aart has computer equipment and camera gear, which he was using to make his videos. This equipment was not fully deducted before Aart ceased his activity. He was also claiming deductions for home office and internet expenses. Aart is no longer incurring depreciation losses or home office or internet expenses to derive income. He does not need to do anything to continue deriving income. Therefore, Aart cannot continue to claim deductions. Sources of income 27. It will be common for online content creators to have multiple sources of income (see \[3\]) . Receipts that individually might not be regarded as income might be so regarded when the activity is considered as a whole. 4 Therefore, content creators need to consider their activity as a whole. See Example 20 (after \[99\]). People’s circumstances can affect whether an amount is income 28. An amount that is income when received by one person may not be income if received by someone else. Whether or not an amount received by a person is income depends on the character of the amount in that person’s hands. 29. For example, prize winnings from an e-sports competition may be income for a person who is able to make a living from competing in such competitions and associated activities. However, for an amateur player, prize winnings might not be income. This could be because they do not receive amounts from their gaming on a regular basis. 30. Therefore, a content creator needs to consider their own circumstances in working out whether amounts they receive are income. See Example 6. Example 6 – Content creators need to consider their own circumstances Joshua, a professional online gamer and streamer, decides to enter an open competition. He notices a statement on the competition information page that the prize money is not taxable. This does not seem right to Joshua. 4 FCT v Stone \[2005\] HCA 1, (2005) 222 CLR 289. IS 21/08 | 28 September 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 10 of 46 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Whether an amount is taxable depends on the character of the amount in the hands of the recipient. This could be different for different people. For some more amateur competitors, the prize money might not be taxable, but because Joshua has a business of competing and streaming his gameplay, the prize money he wins will be taxable. “Gifts” or “donations” can be income 31. It is common for content creators to receive payments from people through online payment or donation platforms. These payments might be described as “gifts” or “donations” but the label given to a payment does not determine its character nor whether it is income to the content creator. 32. Payments of these kinds may be income if they are a product of the content creator’s income earning activity. 5 33. In most cases, a payment a viewer makes to a content creator will be a product of the content creator’s activity. These payments will normally arise because the content creator has included a link to a payment platform in the description of their post and the payer has viewed the content and used the link to make a payment. 34. A viewer may state (for example, they may post a comment around the same time as the payment) that they are making the payment because of their respect and admiration for the content creator. They may also state that the payment is not a reward for the content. These statements, even though they may be genuine, are unlikely to affect whether the payment is income of the content creator. 35. In most cases, a content creator and a payer will have no relationship other than that of content creator and viewer. In these situations, the facts strongly suggest that the payments from the viewers are products of the content-creation activity. This conclusion will be even stronger if the payment entitles the payer to access additional content or other benefits. 36. Even if a content creator and a payer are friends, if the payer is consuming the content created by the content creator, a payment to the content creator is likely to be a product of the income-earning activity, so income. 37. In some cases, a content creator may be able to establish that a payment received is not a product of their content-creation activity. For example, they might receive a payment from a friend or family member who has no interest in the online content and 5 Hayes v FCT (1956) 11 ATD 68 (HCA), Louisson v Commissioner of Taxes \[1943\] NZLR 1 (CA). IS 21/08 | 28 September 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 11 of 46 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] simply wants to support the content creator. However, the burden of proving this is on the content creator. See Example 7. Example 7 – Donation income Bella is an online woodworker who carries on an online content-creation business posting videos of her woodworking projects. Bella includes a link to her Patreon account in the description of her videos and on her website. People who make payments of over $10 a month are entitled to early access to Bella’s latest videos. During the income year she receives $3,600 from people who paid over $10 a week and $1,040 from smaller payments. Bella’s grandmother wants to support Bella and makes a one-off payment of $200 directly to Bella. Bella’s grandmother does not have an interest in woodworking, but she watched some of the videos as she was interested in what her granddaughter was up to. Bella is unsure whether all the payments she receives through her Patreon account and from her grandmother are income. All the payments, except the payment from Bella’s grandmother, are income. The payment from Bella’s grandmother is not income because it was made due to a private family relationship and not as a product of Bella’s business. The other payments are received because of her online woodworking video business. This is supported by the link included in her videos to her Patreon account. Also, the payments are made by people whose only connection to Bella is that they have watched her videos. The fact that some viewers received something in exchange for their payment makes for a stronger conclusion that those payments are income, but the payments under $10 a month are also income as they are also a product of her business. Donation tax credits 38. Payments made to a content creator are unlikely to qualify for a donations tax credit for the payer. 39. A content creator may be engaged in an activity that is charitable in nature, but this does not mean a payment to the content creator will qualify for a donations tax credit for the payer. 40. For a person to be entitled to a donations tax credit, the payment the person makes must be made to an approved donee organisation. See Example 8. IS 21/08 | 28 September 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 12 of 46 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 41. If a content creator passes a donation on to an approved donee organisation, then the content creator could be entitled to a donations tax credit. 42. For more information on when a donation tax credit can be claimed, see:  Ngā Whiwhinga Tāke mō ngā Takoha: Tax Credits for Donations (webpage, Inland Revenue); and  s LD 3. Example 8 – Eligibility for a donations tax credit Aruf watches a YouTube channel created by Naeem. Naeem’s videos feature interviews with community leaders from different cultural, ethnic and religious groups. Naeem tries to educate his viewers in the hope of creating a more tolerant and inclusive society. Aruf loves what Naeem is doing and wants to financially support Naeem’s work. Naeem has included a link in his videos to a Patreon account so people can support him. Naeem has also included a link to the website of a community association that is an approved donee organisation listed by Inland Revenue. Aruf pays $50 to Naeem’s Patreon account and $50 to the community association. Naeem also donates the $50 he received from Aruf to the community association. Aruf is eligible for a donation tax credit for the payment he makes directly to the community association, which is an approved donee organisation. However, Aruf is not eligible for a donation tax credit for the payment he makes to Naeem’s Patreon account. To be eligible for a donations tax credit, a donation must be made to an approved donee organisation. Naeem is also eligible for a donation tax credit for the $50 he donates to the community organisation. Non-monetary receipts (or contra) can be income 43. Non-monetary receipts given to content creators are sometimes referred to as “contra”. Non-monetary receipts received by a content creator can be income. This applies where non-monetary items are supplied in addition to or instead of monetary payment. For example, if a content creator is paid and sent products by a cosmetics company, then both the money and the products could be income for the content cr eator. IS 21/08 | 28 September 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 13 of 46 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 44. Not every non-monetary item will be taxable. The first thing to consider is whether the non-monetary item is income (that is, the factors discussed from \[9\]). The following discussion assumes the item is received as a result of an income-earning activity the content creator carries on. In some cases, a content creator may be able to establish that a non-monetary item is not received as a result of their content-creation activity. If this is the case, then that receipt will not be income. 45. The following discussion also assumes the content creator accepts the item. A person can refuse to accept a payment or item. The content creator can refuse the receipt of a non-monetary item by sending the item back to the payer or refusing to take possession. Convertibility – whether the receipt (contra) can be sold 46. To be income, a non-monetary receipt must also be able to be converted into money. Whether a receipt can be turned into money will be determined by the nature of the thing received and the rights and obligations between the provider of the thing and the content creator. Note that a non-monetary receipt could be converted into money in different ways. In this context, the most common method of conversion to money would be by selling. The general rule is that if a thing received as a product of a content creator’s income-earning activity can be sold, the content creator will have income. 6 47. Whether a product is convertible depends on the circumstances. For example, where a content creator who promotes cosmetics is provided with a lipstick to use in a promotional video, then the lipstick is unlikely to be sold once it has been opened and used. However, products such as clothes and shoes will usually be able to be sold. 48. Where a content creator is provided with services or experiences that are personal to them, these are less likely to be income because they cannot be sold or converted into money. Where vouchers for services or experiences can be sold, then they will be income when received. Taxation event is the receipt of the item 49. The event that results in income is the receipt of the item. Because income arises at the time of receipt, the person will have an initial amount of income regardless of the subsequent use of the item. For instance, accepting a non-monetary item and then donating it to charity does not stop the item being income and taxable. The same principle applies if a person is paid in cash and donates an amount to charity. The 6 Tennant v Smith (1892) 3 TC 158 (HL). IS 21/08 | 28 September 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 14 of 46 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] person is still taxed on the initial receipt. If content creators do not want to be taxed on receipt of a non-monetary item, they should not accept the item. 50. Although the initial receipt is taxable, the subsequent use (for example, a sale or use in the content-creation activity) may also have tax consequences. Subsequent use – selling items and other non-monetary items 51. As noted above, the first event that gives rise to income is the receipt of the item. Income arises on receipt even if the person does not sell the item. If the person does sell the item, this is a separate taxation event. 52. If the item is sold, the amount received can also be income. That is, income can arise twice: once on receipt of the item and again on the sale of the item. 53. However, if the amount received on sale is income, the person will be allowed a deduction for the “cost” of the item. 7 Although the person did not spend any money to acquire the item, a cost will be given to the item. This cost will be equal to the income derived on receipt. This means the person will not be taxed twice (although if they sell the item for more than its value on receipt, they could be taxed on the difference). See Examples 9–13. 54. A deduction may also be possible where the non-monetary item is used in the content-creation activity. Subsequent use – non-monetary items used in the content-creation activity 55. Paragraph \[79\] onwards explains when a content creator may be able to claim a deduction for expenditure and depreciation losses. Similar principles apply in this context because “expenditure” can include something in money’s worth provided it passes from the person and has the effect of diminishing their assets. Whether deductions are allowed depends on the tests discussed further below, but crucially a relationship must exist between the expenditure and the business or income-earning activity. 8 56. Where a content creator’s ability to generate income depends on their number of followers and their reach on social media, then rewards provided to followers (for 7 This is considered consistent with comments in Tasman Forestry Ltd v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,147 (CA), Sharkey v Wernher \[1956\] AC 58 (HL); Halliwell v CIR (1991) 13 NZTC 8,197; and Rangatira Ltd v CIR (1996) 17 NZTC 12,727. 8 Section DA 1 is the general permission which allows a deduction – this is subject to limitations which prevent a deduction in certain circumstances such as where the expenditure is private or capital in nature. IS 21/08 | 28 September 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 15 of 46 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] example, for likes, comments and shares of a social media posts) may have a sufficient relationship with earning income. See Example 14. On the other hand, where a non- monetary item is given to family, friends or a charity it will not be deductible as it will not have a link with earning income. Valuation of non-monetary items – contra or barter transactions 57. Contra or barter transactions involve the exchange of goods or services rather than cash. For instance, an influencer may receive clothes in exchange for their promise to promote the clothes or the brand in a series of social media posts. 58. The amount of income the content creator derives on the receipt of an item is equal to the realisable sale value of the item at the time they receive it (see Flowchart 1). This will usually be the amount the content creator would receive if they sold the item (but, as noted above, the content creator will have income even if they do not sell the item). The resale value might be lower than the recommended retail value or the amount the content creator would have needed to pay if they bought the item. 59. The content creator will have income even if the resale value is low. However, in some cases, the items might not have any resale value. For example, a market may not exist for some second-hand personal items. 60. A content creator will need to estimate the resale value of an item they receive. Precision is not required; a reasonable estimate is acceptable. Different approaches to estimating resale value could be taken. For example, the content creator could:  check the resale value of the product on an online marketplace;  obtain an estimate from a second-hand store;  use, if information is not available for an identical item, the resale value of a comparable item; or  calculate, if the content creator receives a large quantity of low-value items, an average value based on a representative sample period. Flowchart 1: Process for determining whether a non-monetary item received in exchange for services is income Non-monetary item received via a barter transaction (ie, in exchange for services) yes Is the item income? See \[9\] in the statement Is the item convertible to money (ie, can item be sold)? See \[43\] in the statement Income is valued at item's realisable value IS 21/08 | 28 September 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 16 of 46 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Valuation of non-monetary items – “gifts” 61. Sometimes content creators will receive non-monetary items free from any reciprocal obligations, in other words, a gift with no strings attached. Even though there is no reciprocity such gifts can be income if they are a product of the content-creating activity (discussed from \[43\]) and convertible into money. 62. Whether a gift is taxable on receipt will depend on the specific circumstances, but occasional unsolicited gifts are unlikely to be taxable. Whereas gifts that are received regularly, are a product of an income-earning activity and can be resold are likely to be taxable. 63. Special rules deem transactions involving gifts to happen at market value. 9 In other words, the value of the item for income tax purposes is deemed to be what it is usually sold for in the ordinary course of business. Flowchart 2: Process for determining whether a non-monetary gift is income Cryptoassets 64. Cryptoassets (including cryptocurrencies) are forms of property that can be converted into money. If a person receives cryptoassets as a product of their income-earning activity, they will have income equal to the value of the cryptoassets. There may also be tax consequences when the cryptoassets are subsequently disposed of. 65. For more information about the taxation of cryptoassets, see Cryptoassets (Inland Revenue webpage). There is also guidance addressing specific cryptoasset scenarios in: • QB 21/06: Income tax – tax treatment of cryptoassets received from an airdrop (Inland Revenue, 2021); and • QB 21/07: Income tax - tax treatment of cryptoassets received from a hard fork (Inland Revenue, 2021). 9 Sections FC 1 and FC 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007 deem certain transactions involving gifts to occur at market value and s GC 1 applies where companies give away trading stock. Non-monetary item received as a gift (ie, not in exchange for services) yes Is the item income? See \[9\] in the statement yes Is the item convertible to money (ie, can item be sold)? See \[43\] in the statement yes Section FC 2 or section GC 1 values income at deemed market value IS 21/08 | 28 September 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 17 of 46 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 9 – If the item can be sold Tom creates digital content showing home renovation ideas, DIY projects and tool demonstrations. A power tool company agrees to provide Tom with a drill and a circular saw in exchange for him demonstrating these products in a video. Tom decides to keep them after using them in the video. Based on similar products (second-hand and barely used) for sale on an online marketplace, Tom could sell the drill for $175 and the circular saw for $300. The online marketplace would charge Tom listing and success fees of $5 each. The receipt of the power tools is income because it is from a contra or barter transaction and is a product of Tom’s content-creation activity. This type of receipt is not uncommon for content creators. It is income because it is something Tom could sell for money, even though he has chosen not to. Tom has income equal to the amount he could receive if he sold the power tools. An amount of $465, being the $475 for which Tom could sell the power tools less fees of $10, would be a reasonable estimate of the income Tom has derived from the receipt of the power tools. Example 10 – Selling an item that was income when received Tom, from Example 9, often sells the tools and products he receives from businesses in the building trade through an online marketplace. He changes his mind and rather than keep the power tools he sells them online for a combined price of $450. Tom pays a marketplace fee to sell the items of $10. Tom has income of $450. However, Tom can also claim a deduction for $465 (this is a cost given to the power tools to prevent double taxation). This effectively cancels out the income derived on receipt and means Tom is ultimately taxed as if he derived income of only $450 less the $10 fee (ie, $440). IS 21/08 | 28 September 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 18 of 46 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 11 – Non-monetary items that must be used or consumed by the recipient Joshua, a professional gamer and streamer, receives branded items as part of his latest sponsorship deal. The sponsorship deal requires that he promotes an energy drink brand while competing and streaming. Joshua is given a drinks fridge stocked with 24 energy drinks. He is required to feature the fridge in a studio tour video and drink the energy drinks when streaming. The receipt of the drinks fridge is income. Joshua can convert the fridge into money after the studio tour video is completed. The income will be equal to the value of a lightly used drinks fridge. Joshua can estimate this value by comparing the fridge with similar items on an online marketplace. (If he decides to sell the fridge then the treatment will be the same as for Example 10.) Joshua is required to be seen consuming the drinks whilst gaming and streaming, so these drinks cannot be sold and are not income. Example 12 – Experience not convertible into money Ashley, a fashion commentator and online content creator, is invited to attend a show (her name is put on a list on the door). Tickets for the show are available to be purchased by members of the public. Although a value could be given to the invite, Ashley cannot sell the invite because it is her name on the door. This means the invite is not income. Example 13 – Voucher can be converted into money Chris, a travel writer, is reviewing a new vineyard restaurant in Havelock North for their travel channel. The restaurant owner gives Chris a voucher for a local spa treatment business. The voucher entitles the holder to receive treatments up to the value of $150. Chris uses the voucher while in Havelock North. Chris was not under any obligation to redeem the voucher and could have sold the voucher. This means the voucher was convertible into money, so was income to Chris when it was received. Chris finds out that they could have made $130 after fees by selling the voucher on an online marketplace. This is an acceptable estimate of the realisable value of the voucher and the income derived by Chris. IS 21/08 | 28 September 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 19 of 46 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 14 – unsolicited gifts used in the content–creation activity Helen is an online content creator who promotes beauty and fashion products. She has clients who pay her for promoting their brand or products. She usually does not accept unsolicited gifts because she does not want to promote businesses that do not pay her and she is aware she might have to pay tax on gifts capable of being resold. From time to time, Helen accepts unsolicited gifts and provides them to her followers for engaging with her social media posts. For instance, she receives an unsolicited gift of handmade jewellery from a business seeking publicity. Helen likes the jewellery and thinks she will be able to use it in her business so accepts the gift. She has income equal to the market value of the jewellery, which usually sells for $100. Helen uses the jewellery as part of a “giveaway” on social media and sends the jewellery to a follower as a reward for re-posting one of Helen’s videos. A relationship exists with earning income, because Helen’s ability to generate income depends on her number of followers, how engaged those followers are and Helen’s social media presence. Helen can claim a deduction for the jewellery. The value of the deduction is the market value of $100. If both transactions occur in the same tax year, they cancel each other out as there is income of $100 and a deduction of $100. If they happen in different tax years, the same result occurs but happens over that period (that is, income is returned in one year, and a deduction is taken in a later year when the jewellery is “given” away). Income derived by young people who are still at school may be exempt from tax 66. Some young people who are still at school may not need to pay tax on income derived from their content-creation activities. This is because s CW 55BB provides a limited exemption for certain types of income derived by young people. 67. For the exemption to apply for a tax year, the person must attend school during the tax year. The exemption generally applies to people who are aged under 18 years as well as 18-year-olds provided they did not turn 18 before 1 January in the previous tax year. Further, 18-year-olds must have attended school in the current and previous tax years. 68. The exemption applies for a tax year, which suggests it will apply for a person for the entire tax year if they attend school during the tax year and meet the age requirements. IS 21/08 | 28 September 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 20 of 46 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 69. The exemption applies only to certain types of income. The exemption does not apply to, for example, income from employment, interest or dividends (that is, typically income from which the payer deducts tax). 70. Further, the exemption will not apply if in the income year the young person derives income (of the type that would qualify for the exemption) of $2,340 or more. Note that if this threshold of $2,340 is reached, none of the income will be exempt under this provision. In other words, the exemption will not apply to the first $2,340 earned if the threshold is reached. See Example 15. 71. For more detailed information on the exemption, see:  Tamaiti, Rangatahi Rānei: Child or Young Person (webpage, Inland Revenue);  Individual Income Tax Return Guide (IR3G, Inland Revenue, 2020); and  s CW 55BB. IS 21/08 | 28 September 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 21 of 46 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 15 – Young person’s income exemption Olivia and Hannah are both still at school during the 2022 calendar year. Olivia is 16 years old and Hannah is 18 years old (she turned 18 in February). Olivia and Hannah both post videos to TikTok. Olivia posts videos about football training tips and tricks. Hannah posts videos of herself singing and dancing. Both are very popular and make money from their posts. Olivia stops posting to TikTok halfway through the year to concentrate on football. Hannah posts all year. In the 2023 tax year (which begins on 1 April 2022 and ends on 31 March 2023), Olivia received a sponsorship payment relating to her TikTok posts totalling $500. Hannah received donations from fans during the tax year totalling $2,450. Other than income from employment and interest on their savings, which Inland Revenue already knows about, the $500 received by Olivia and the $2,450 received by Hannah are the only income that Olivia and Hannah receive during the tax year. The young person’s income exemption applies to the $500 derived by Olivia. However, the exemption does not apply to any of the $2,450 derived by Hannah, because the income she derived during the tax year exceeded the threshold of $2,340. Hannah should include the $2,450 in her tax return. Threshold of $200 for income other than reportable income 72. Generally, at the end of the tax year, a content creator needs to inform Inland Revenue of any income they earn from their content-creation activities. 73. The types of income that online content creators earn are different from, for example, employment income. Inland Revenue will generally already know about any employment income a person has because their employer has an obligation to report this income to Inland Revenue and withhold PAYE. 74. Often (but not always – see \[121\] about tax withheld by payer), income that content creators make will be income other than “reportable income”, which is defined in s 22D(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. “Reportable income” includes things such as employment income and interest. 75. If a person has, in total, $200 or less of income other than reportable income in an income year, then they do not need to inform Inland Revenue of this income. 10 This means it won’t be taxed. 10 Section 22K of the Tax Administration Act 1994. IS 21/08 | 28 September 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 22 of 46 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 76. This $200 income threshold applies to anyone; it is not limited to young people. See Example 16. 77. Note that this is an income threshold, not a profit (that is, income less expenses) threshold. 78. For more information, see:  “Simplifying tax administration: I ndividuals income tax” , Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31, No 4 (May 2019): 7; and  ss 22D(3) and 22K of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Example 16 – $200 threshold Manaaki is a keen gardener, and in his spare time he posts gardening videos on YouTube. Manaaki also has a part-time job working for a garden centre. During the tax year, Manaaki earns $172 from views and subscriptions to his YouTube channel and $8,000 from his part-time job. Manaaki does not need to inform Inland Revenue of the $172 that he earned from YouTube because the $200 income other than reporting income threshold applies. Deductions for expenses and depreciation losses 79. If a content creator has an income-earning activity, they may be able to claim deductions for expenses and depreciation losses. These deductions will reduce their taxable income. Whether deductions are allowed depends on the tests discussed further below. However, before discussing these tests, some of the expenses that content creators might have are listed to give content creators an idea of what might be deductible. Types of expense 80. The following are expenses that some content creators might have. Whether these expenses are deductible depends on the tests discussed further below:  home office expenses;  phone and internet expenses;  depreciation losses on equipment and other assets;  vehicle or travel expenses, if the content creation involves travel; however, home to work travel (for example, if the creator has a studio or workspace that is not at home) is not deductible; IS 21/08 | 28 September 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 23 of 46 \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  professional fees (for example, accounting or tax agent fees related to the content-creation activity) and fees for creative services (for example, fees for editing, design or promotional work);  subscriptions for online content or apps that content creators use for their activity;  the cost of buying games and expansion packs (that is, for professional gamers or content creators who feature the games in their content);  music licensing fees;  in-game micro-transactions for professional gamers or content creators, if these transactions are necessary to be competitive in deriving income from gaming or streaming; and  the costs of materials (for example, materials used in instructional videos). Relationship with income-earning activity 81. As noted above, if a content creator has an income-earning activity, they may be able to claim deductions for expenses and depreciation losses. 82. To be deductible, expenses or losses must be incurred in deriving income. This means a relationship must exist between the expense and the business or income-earning activity. 11 83. In the case of a business, expenses can be deductible even if the business is not making a profit. However, there must be an intention of making a profit. Content creator must incur the expenditure 84. A content creator can claim a deduction for an expense only if they are the person who has incurred the expense. For example, a content creator living at home with their parents cannot claim a deduction for internet costs if their parents pay the internet bill. Business must have started and be continuing 85. A person cannot claim deductions for expenses if a business or income-earning activity has not yet started. 86. Generally, an income earning activity starts when the activity can generate amounts that are income of the person. In some cases, there may be certain activities that need 11 Section DA 1. IS 21/08 | 28 September 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 24 of 46 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] to occur before any amounts can be derived, eg a person may need to establish a certain number of viewers or subscriptions before they can make money from their co ntent. In some cases, an income earning activity will not have started because the amounts received are not yet received regularly enough to constitute income. 87. Similarly, a person cannot claim deductions for expenses if a business or income- earning activity has stopped, even if the person continues to derive passive income from their old content. See also from \[23\] about passive receipts. Example 17 – Income-earning activity has not started Li wants to be a professional online gamer and streamer like his friend Joshua. Li is an excellent gamer, but he does not derive amounts regularly from his gaming and streaming activities. There are a few things he will need to do (for example, climbing the in-game ladder, competing in open tournaments and building his viewership) before he can start deriving regular amounts from competing or streaming. However, Li is committed to giving it a go. Li purchases equipment he thinks he will need to be competitive and wants to know whether he can have a deduction. Li cannot have a deduction. Although it is not necessary for an activity to make a profit for expenditure to be deductible, the income-earning activity must have started. Li might have an intention to make a profit one day like Joshua, but his income- earning activity has not started. Li is not yet making income because he is not deriving regular amounts from competing or streaming nor is he in a position to do so. He has a number of things to do before this will be possible. Expenses that are not deductible 88. Some expenses will not be deductible because they are private or domestic in nature (for example, most clothing expenses.) 89. Private and domestic expenses are essentially living costs and costs associated with the home or family. 90. Some expenses may be related to an income earning activity but also have a private component (eg, household costs where a person has a home office). In these cases, an apportionment is required to calculate the allowable deduction. IS 21/08 | 28 September 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 25 of 46 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 91. Expenses on capital assets (for example, a car) are also not deductible. 12 However, a person may be allowed deductions for depreciation losses on some capital assets, if the assets are used in the person’s business or income-earning activity. Related activities 92. An online content creator may be making content that is related to something else they are doing. 93. In these cases, care should be taken to separately identify the expenses incurred when creating content and expenses associated with the other activity. For example, the expenses on the other activity may be of a private and domestic nature, so not deductible. See Examples 18 and 19. Example 18 – Expenditure on related activity not deductible David and Karen are semi-retired and decide to convert their quarter-acre section into a food forest so they can grow most of their own food. They document the process in videos posted online with the intention of making some money to help cover the cost of the food forest conversion. David and Karen spend a large amount of money on plants and mulch. They also buy a small tripod for $100 to help film their videos. David and Karen would like to claim deductions for expenses incurred in the food forest conversion. They argue that the expenses are incurred in deriving income from the videos. David and Karen’s videos are popular and they derive $2,000 from the videos. They determine that the amounts received are income from a profit-making scheme or undertaking (often a short-term activity which is carried out with a dominant purpose of making a profit, see s CB 3). David and Karen may be able to claim a deduction for expenses related to the filming, for example, the $100 cost of the tripod (a low-value asset that can be deducted in full in the year of purchase – see \[100\] about depreciation losses below). However, the cost of the plants and mulch is not deductible as this expense is of a private or domestic nature. The expenditure on the food forest conversion is largely for David and Karen’s private benefit (that is, to provide them with food) rather than being incurred in deriving money from posting videos of the process. 12 Section DA 2. IS 21/08 | 28 September 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 26 of 46 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 19 – Profit-making scheme and expenses while travelling Aesha is a photographer. One of the ways that Aesha earns a living is by posting photos on Instagram. She regularly receives payments from viewers through a donation website and from selling high resolution copies of her photos. Aesha sets out on a three-month overseas holiday. She plans to do some sightseeing and have a relaxing break. However, while travelling, she takes some great photos and continues to post to Instagram and offer photos for sale. Aesha has continued her content creation income earning activity while on her three- month holiday. The amounts she derives from the donation website and her photo sales are income. Aesha has kept receipts and good records of her revenue and expenses, so she is able to claim deductions for expenses incurred in deriving her income. Generally, Aesha cannot claim deductions for her personal holiday expenses as these are private and domestic in nature. However, once a week, Aesha needs to spend a day in her hotel room editing photos and doing administration connected with her Instagram account and photo sales. It would be reasonable for Aesha to claim a deduction for part of her accommodation costs on the one day a week that she needs to do her editing and administration work. Aesha considers her situation carefully and estimates an appropriate proportion and keeps a record of how she arrived at this estimate. Specific types of expense 94. Four specific types of expense that may be of interest to content creators are discussed further below:  home office expenses (see from \[95\]);  internet expenses (see \[99\]);  depreciation losses (see from \[100\]); and  clothing expenses (see from \[110\]). Home office expenses 95. If a content creator has a business or income-earning activity that they carry on in an area of their home, they may be able to claim a deduction for home office expenses. IS 21/08 | 28 September 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 27 of 46 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 96. The allowable deduction will be based on the proportion of household costs that relate to the area used. Apportionment is needed because costs related to the home also have a private or domestic nature. 97. A person does not need to own their own home to claim home office expenses. A person could be renting or flatting. However, a person will not have home office expenses if they are living rent free and do not have to pay for a share of expenses such as for electricity, gas or water. See Example 20 (after \[99\]). 98. For more information on claiming home office expenditure see:  Te Whakamahi i tō Kāinga mō tō Pakihi: Using Your Home for Your Business (webpage, Inland Revenue);  Operational Statement OS 19/03: Square metre rate for the dual use of premises (Inland Revenue, 2019); and  s DB 18AA. Internet expenses 99. Content creators are likely to use their home internet plans for both their content- creation activity and for their private or domestic use. Therefore, content creators may be allowed a deduction for a portion of their internet bill. Content creators need to estimate the portion based on their own situation. The estimate must give a fair and reasonable result. See Example 20. Example 20 – Income and expenses of a professional gamer Joshua is a professional gamer and streamer. He spends 10 hours a day practising game skills, playing and streaming his games, chatting to viewers, planning travel and other gaming activities, and doing general administrative tasks such as budgeting and recording income and expenses. Joshua has made his way up the in-game ladder, has been successful in open tournaments and now plays in major overseas tournaments with prize pools of over $1 million. He travels to Asia to compete in person at large tournaments and incurs expenditure on travel and accommodation. In the income year just ended, Joshua won $10,000 in prize money. However, Joshua received prize money of $15,000, $30,000 and $50,000 from three competitions in the previous income year. He is also doing well in regular game play and could win more prize money in future competitions. IS 21/08 | 28 September 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 28 of 46 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Joshua receives payments of $350 a month on average from Twitch for his streaming. He also spends time chatting with his viewers and analysing his viewership. He then makes changes to his settings and streaming habits to improve his viewership. Joshua also provides exclusive content and one-on-one coaching to premium members of his Patreon account. He receives $100 a month on average from Patreon payments. While practising and competing in the game, Joshua earns various in-game items. The game allows the trading of these items for real world currency (at the player’s own risk). During the income year, Joshua lists some of the more valuable items and earns $200. Joshua wouldn’t set out to earn money this way as he values his time too much. However, since he has earned the items through his practice and competitive game time, he takes the opportunity to make some money. Joshua pays a talent agent a commission to find and manage sponsorship deals. He receives $3,000 a year in sponsorship payments from a drinks manufacturer for featuring its energy drinks and wearing branded clothing while competing and streaming. He pays $450 of this to his talent agent. Joshua is flatting and uses a portion of his room for his gaming and streaming activities (for 10 hours a day). Although a standard fibre internet connection is sufficient for most internet gaming, he pays extra for a faster internet connection to ensure he does not have any lag when competing. Income All the amounts Joshua receives are income derived from a business. The prize money may be sporadic, but the facts show he has an intention of making a profit from his online activity. He also takes a business-like approach, committing significant time (10 hours a day) and money (on overseas travel, premium internet and a talent agent) on his activity. Joshua’s total income from his business is $18,600 (prize money of $10,000, Twitch payments of $4,200, $1,200 through Patreon, $3,000 of sponsorship, and $200 from the sale of in-game items). Expenses Joshua can claim deductions for expenditure that he incurs in carrying on his business. His deductible expenses for the tax year include the following:  “Home office” expenses of $1,254.50. The calculation of which is discussed further below. IS 21/08 | 28 September 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 29 of 46 \[UNCLASSIFIED\]  Travel expenses (business proportion only) incurred while competing in major tournaments overseas. These included $2,200 on flights and $2,700 on accommodation.  Gaming and streaming-related expenses of $350, including game purchases, extension packs, in-game purchases, subscriptions to apps used for streaming and analytics.  Depreciation loss of $631.99. Joshua purchased a new game console during the income year. Because the cost of the console was under the low-value asset threshold ($1,000 from 17 March 2021), Joshua was able to claim the entire purchase price as a depreciation loss in the year of purchase (rather than claiming deductions over multiple years).  Talent agency commission fees of $450.  Internet expenses of $528. The calculation of this is discussed further below. Joshua’s expenses total $8,114.49. This means Joshua made a profit of $10,285.51 from the gaming and streaming business in the income year. Home office expenses calculation To make the home office expenses calculation a bit easier, Joshua chooses to use the square metre rate option. This option is available to Joshua as he uses a separately identifiable area in his room mainly for his business. The square metre rate option saves Joshua from having to record and calculate his share of utilities bills (that is, power, gas and water) and from having to estimate the exact proportion of time that he uses the area in his room for his business. To use the square metre rate option, Joshua needs to calculate the:  “total premises cost”, which will be Joshua’s share of the rent, which over the income year totalled $12,500;  “business square metres”, which is the area (in square metres) in Joshua’s room that he uses for his gaming and streaming activities (8 square metres);  total area (in square metres) of the flat (Joshua’s room, his flatmates’ rooms and common areas), which Joshua finds out from his property manager that this is 110 square metres; and  “business proportion”; which is the business square metres (the area Joshua uses for his gaming and streaming) divided by the total area of the flat, which is 8 divided by 110 = 7.3%. IS 21/08 | 28 September 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 30 of 46 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Under the square metre rate option, the first part of the calculation involves multiplying the total premises cost by the business proportion. For Joshua, this is $12,500 x 7.3% = $912.50. The second part of the calculation involves multiplying the business square metres by the square metre rate published by Inland Revenue (for this example we use the square metre rate for the 2020 tax year, which was $42.75). For Joshua, this is 8 x $42.75 = $342. Joshua’s allowable deduction for home office expenses is then given by adding the products of the two calculations described above: $912.50 + $342 = $1,254.50. Internet Joshua pays $60 a month as his share of the flat internet bill. This includes the additional $20 cost of having a higher speed internet connection, which Joshua agrees to pay for himself. Joshua can claim a portion of the $60 amount that he pays, based on the proportion of business use. Joshua decides that the additional cost of having a higher speed internet connection is 100% attributable to his business and that he uses the internet for his business 60% of the time. As a result, he calculates his allowable deduction as being $44 a month ((100% x $20) + (60% x $40)). This equates to $528 over the course of the income year. Depreciation losses 100. Content creators may be able to claim deductions for depreciation losses on assets that they use to make content. Examples of these assets might be:  computers or game consoles;  cameras, lighting or microphones; or  vehicles, if the content creator’s activity involves the use of a vehicle, eg a travel writer where, and to the extent that, they use the vehicle when creating their travel related content. 101. Deductions for depreciation loss would be limited to the business proportion, if the assets are also used privately. In other words, the depreciation losses must be apportioned between business and private use. 102. Depreciation loss is normally claimed over multiple years, depending on the estimated useful life of an asset. However, for some low-value assets, depreciation loss can be claimed in full in the income year the asset is purchased. The low-value threshold is $1,000. IS 21/08 | 28 September 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 31 of 46 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 103. For assets over the low-value threshold, taxpayers need to identify the annual depreciation rate applying to the item of depreciable property. 104. For more information on claiming deductions for depreciation loss and identifying the correct depreciation rate and the useful life of an asset, see:  Te Hekenga Wāriu: Depreciation (webpage, Inland Revenue) ;  Depreciation: A guide for businesses (IR260, Inland Revenue, 2020); and  General Depreciation Rates (IR265, Inland Revenue, 2020). 105. IR265 provides a step-by-step process to find the right depreciation rate: How to find the right rate Follow this step-by-step process to find the right depreciation rate. 1. See the "Industry" category list in the contents pages. If there is an appropriate industry category for your industry and your asset is listed there, use that depreciation rate (either DV or SL), otherwise go to step 2. 2. See the "Asset" category list in the contents pages. If there is an appropriate asset category and your asset is listed, use that depreciation rate (either DV or SL), otherwise go to step 3. 3. If the asset is listed under an industry category (step 1) which isn't your main industry, and you use the asset in a similar way to the industry shown, use that depreciation rate (either DV or SL), otherwise go to step 4. 4. If none of the first three steps apply, use the default class from the appropriate asset category if the description of the default class is applicable to your asset. 5. If none of the first four steps apply, use the default class rate from the appropriate industry category if the description of the default class is applicable to your asset. 6. Where there is no appropriate listing for your asset under an industry or asset category, you can apply for a provisional depreciation rate. You can search for a specific asset across all industry and asset categories using our depreciation rate finder at ird.govt.nz 106. When following the process in IR265 to find the correct depreciation rate, a content creator will need to identify relevant industry groups and asset categories. 107. The relevant industry groups could be:  audio and video recording studios and professional photography; and  leisure. 108. The audio and video recording studios and professional photography industry might be a good fit for content creators based at home. The leisure industry group may be a good fit for content creators whose activity involves entertainment or travel. IS 21/08 | 28 September 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 32 of 46 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 109. The relevant asset categories could include:  computer equipment;  laptop computers;  personal computers;  tablet computers and electronic media storage devices (including smartphones);  chairs;  desks;  office equipment;  office furniture; and  screens (for offices). Clothing expenses 110. Generally, expenditure on clothing and its maintenance is not deductible. 13 Generally, clothing is of a private or domestic nature as it is required for personal reasons such as warmth and modesty. Private or domestic expenditure is not deductible. 111. A content creator may need to dress in a certain way to add impact or authority to their content. Further, the content creator may wear or use the clothing only for the online content. However, these factors will not make expenses on clothing or its maintenance deductible as the private element is still paramount. 112. There would need to be special circumstances for expenditure on clothing to be deductible. Examples might include expenses on protective clothing or costumes. See Examples 21 and 22. Example 21 – Clothing generally Ashley, a fashion commentator, is attending a fashion show. She buys a new designer jacket to wear to the show, because being well dressed is essential to the success of her content. The cost of the jacket is not deductible. Generally, the cost of clothing is private or domestic in nature, so is not deductible. This is so even if a high standard of dress is required for an activity. 13 Mansfield v FCT (1996) 96 ATC 4,001 (FCA). IS 21/08 | 28 September 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 33 of 46 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 22 – Clothing special circumstances Kenya has a content-creation business that involves creating short comedy skits based on role-playing games that she and her friends play. Kenya spends $50 buying materials to make a new medieval shopkeeper costume for a comedy skit that she is planning. The cost of the materials is deductible. Although the costume will consist of clothing, in these circumstances the cost is clearly incurred in deriving income and the private benefit of the costume while worn is incidental. Overseas income earned by a New Zealand resident 113. A content creator may be required to work overseas as part of their income-earning activity. For example, an online gamer who is a member of an overseas-based team may spend half of the year working overseas with their team. Working digitally also allows content creators based in New Zealand to earn money overseas. 114. A person who is tax resident in New Zealand is taxable on income even if they earn the income overseas (or if the income has an overseas source). 14 115. A person’s tax residency is different from their immigration status. 116. Content creators need to work carefully through the guidance material referred to below to determine their tax residency. However, briefly, if a person has been a New Zealand tax resident, they will become a non-resident taxpayer if they:  do not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand; and  are away from New Zealand for more than 325 days in any 12-month period. 117. If a content creator is a New Zealand tax resident and income earned overseas is taxed overseas, tax relief will generally be available to prevent the income from being taxed twice. In some cases, a double tax agreement between New Zealand and the overseas country will give only one country the right to tax. In other cases, the income will be taxed in both countries, but a tax credit will be provided for the tax paid overseas (however, depending on the particular circumstances the tax credit may be limited). 14 Section BD 1. IS 21/08 | 28 September 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 34 of 46 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 118. For more information on residency and international tax, see:  International Tax for Individuals (webpage, Inland Revenue).  Double tax agreements (DTAs) (webpage, Inland Revenue).  New Zealand Tax Residence: Who is a New Zealand resident for tax purposes? (IR292, Inland Revenue, 2019); and  “Interpretation Statement IS 16/03: Tax residence”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 28, No 10 (October 2016): 2. 119. IS 16/03 contains several examples detailing when a person will be resident in New Zealand for tax purposes. 120. For a very simple scenario and only one of the relevant tests, see Example 23. Example 23 – Tax residency Hyo Jin, originally from Tāmaki Makaurau, is a very popular musician and performer on TikTok. Recently, she has been collaborating and performing with a band in South Korea and posting to TikTok along the way. In the last 12 months, she spent six months overseas and the rest of her time in New Zealand. Hyo Jin was absent from New Zealand for only 183 days during the last 12 months. This is not long enough for Hyo Jin to lose her New Zealand tax residency. Because Hyo Jin is a New Zealand resident she is taxed in New Zealand on all the income she receives (whether from New Zealand or overseas). As a New Zealand tax resident, Hyo Jin would need to be absent for more than 325 days and not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand to lose her New Zealand tax residency. Tax withheld by payer 121. Where a content creator receives an amount that is a “schedular payment” then it should be subject to withholding tax, that is, tax is removed from the payment by the payer and paid to Inland Revenue on the content creators’ behalf before the balance of the payment is received by the content creator. 122. Withholding tax helps to ensure tax is paid as income is received, rather than at the end of the income year. The amount deducted is based on a tax code declaration the recipient gives to the payer. In most cases, the tax code used only estimates the tax on the income. Ultimately, the recipient’s income tax liability is determined in their annual income tax assessment. IS 21/08 | 28 September 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 35 of 46 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 123. Schedular payments are certain types of listed payments (in schedule 4 of the Act). They include:  a payment made in connection with: o a performance at a sporting event or competition; o making speeches or giving lectures or talks for any purpose; and o acting, singing, playing music, dancing or entertaining generally; and o one of the above performances that includes a payment for a content creator to advertise a product as part of their content-creation activity (f or example, a company pays an e-sports participant to wear the company’s products at an esports competition);  modelling fees;  media production fees (for example, if a content creator is creating a video for an advertiser, rather than advertising or endorsing a product in their own content); and  promotional appearance fees (for example, if a content creator physically appears at an event and uses their fame to promote a product or service). 124. Content creators will often be undertaking one of these activities. In these cases, a payer must withhold tax from the payment. A content creator will also need to give the payer a tax rate notification form: Tax Rate Notification for Contractors (IR330C, Inland Revenue, 2019). This will tell the payer what tax rate to use for the withholding. 125. For more information, see Withholding Taxes (webpage, Inland Revenue). GST 126. GST is a tax that is charged on the supply of goods and services. 127. Content creators make supplies of goods or services, so may be required to return GST on those supplies. For example, a content creator may supply a service to an online platform when they post a video on the platform. A content creator may also supply a service to a company when the content creator promotes a product of the company. 128. However, GST is charged on a supply only if the supply is made by a registered person. Generally, a person is required to register for GST only if the total value of their supplies in a 12-month period exceeds or is expected to exceed $60,000 (if the supplies are below this amount then registration is voluntary). 129. For more information on GST obligations, see GST (Goods and Services Tax) (webpage, Inland Revenue). IS 21/08 | 28 September 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 36 of 46 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 24 Mai is a self-styled “mummy-blogger” who creates social media content about her young children. Much of her content focuses on natural remedies and products for babies and young children. She makes a modest amount from her social media activity ($5,000 a year) but also has an income from her own merchandise which she promotes to her followers. Her merchandise sales are $10,000 a year – driven by the popularity of her “Mummy Mai” branded natural baby massage oil. Mai wants to know whether she needs to register for GST. Because Mai’s supplies do not exceed $60,000 in any 12-month period (and are not likely to) she is not required to registered for GST. She can voluntarily register for GST but Mai decides that registering for GST is not right for her. She does not want to charge GST on sales and does not want to deal with the ongoing requirements around recordkeeping and filing returns. Keeping good records 130. It is important for online content creators to keep good records. Failing to keep good records is risky. In some cases, failing to keep good records can result in Inland Revenue:  treating a person as having more income than they actually do (for example, if their income needs to be determined based solely on deposits in their bank account or assets they have acquired);  disallowing deductions for expenses a person could have claimed if they had kept a record of their expenses; or  imposing penalties and use of money interest for underpayment of tax. See Example 25. 131. For more information of record keeping, see Te Tiaki Pūkete: Record Keeping (webpage, Inland Revenue). Example 25 – Keeping good records Two years pass for Li, the aspiring gamer from Example 17. He has been so busy practising and competing that time seems to have flown by. He has done exceptionally well but he hasn’t thought about tax for a while. A friend suggests to Li that he might want to get on top of his tax situation. Li makes some time to go through his online donation account, Twitch history, bank statements, IS 21/08 | 28 September 2021 UNCLASSIFIED Page 37 of 46 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] emails and other records. He is glad that he did, because he realises he has been earning regular income. Li informs Inland Revenue of his additional income and it is included in his income tax assessment for the income year just ended. This spares Li from being subject to penalties and interest. Li was able to find some receipts and other evidence for expenditure he incurred during the income year just ended. However, he wishes he had kept better records because, if he had, he could have supported greater deductions against his income. Li starts keeping better records for the current income year.

They set out the Commissioner’s views and guidance on how New Zealand’s tax laws apply. They may address specific situations we have been asked to provide guidance on, or they may be about how legislative provisions apply more generally. While they set out the Commissioner’s considered views, Interpretation Statements are not binding on the Commissioner. However, taxpayers can generally rely on them in determining their tax affairs. See further Status of Commissioner’s advice (December 2012). It is important to note that a general similarity between a taxpayer’s circumstances and an example in an Interpretation Statement will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case must be considered on its own facts.
UNCLASSIFIED \[UNCLASSIFIED\] FACT SHEET Claiming depreciation on buildings Issued: 20 July 2022 IS 22/04 FS This fact sheet accompanies Interpretation Statement IS 22/04. IS 22/04 provides guidance to building owners on when they can claim depreciation on buildings. It considers the meaning of “building” for depreciation purposes and the distinction between residential and non-residential buildings. IS 22/04 sets out that deductions for depreciation loss are available for non-residential buildings and for some building fit-out. It explains that depreciation deductions are not available for residential buildings. IS 22/04 also sets out:  how to find the right depreciation rate for a building  when fit-out attached to the building is depreciable  how to treat an improvement to a building  what happens when a building is disposed of or its use changes. RELATED DOCUMENT Interpretation Statement IS 22/04: Claiming depreciation on buildings IS 22/04 FS | 20 July 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 6 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Introduction 1. In 2011 changes to the depreciation rules meant that the depreciation rate for most long-life buildings (buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more) was reduced to 0%. That change took effect from the 2011-12 income year. 2. In 2020, depreciation deductions were reintroduced for non-residential buildings used, or available for use, for deriving income or carrying on a business for that purpose. For these buildings, depreciation can be claimed for the 2020-21 and later income years. The depreciation rate for residential buildings remains at 0%. 3. To work out if you can claim depreciation on your building, you need to consider:  Do you have a non-residential building?  What if you make improvements to the building?  Can you depreciate the fit-out in your building?  What is the right depreciation rate for your building?  What if you sell your building or change its use? Do you have a non-residential building? 4. You can claim depreciation deductions on non-residential buildings you own. You cannot claim depreciation deductions for any residential buildings you own. This means that it is important you understand whether a building is a non-residential building or a residential building. The meanings of building, residential building and non-residential building are summarised in Figure 1 below. IS 22/04 FS | 20 July 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 6 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Figure 1: Meaning of building 5. Whether a building is a non-residential building or a residential building is determined based on the building’s predominant use. A building owner cannot apportion a mixed-use building for depreciation purposes. Because the test is based on the building’s predominant use, it is effectively an all-or-nothing test. What if you make improvements to the building? 6. If you improve your building, you must treat the improvement as a separate item of depreciable property in the first year. This is so you can claim the part-year depreciation loss for the improvement. In the following year you can either continue to treat the improvement as a separate item of depreciable property or add it to the building (either to the adjusted tax value of the building (ATV) if using the diminishing value method (DV) or to the cost if using the straight-line method (SL)). In either case, the appropriate rate of depreciation for the improvement is the building rate. IS 22/04 FS | 20 July 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 4 of 6 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Can you depreciate the fit-out in your building? 7. Some fit-out of a building is separately depreciable. It depends on the nature of the building and the nature of the fit-out. Any fit-out that is structural to the building or used for weatherproofing the building is treated as part of the building and not fit-out. Whether that is depreciable will depend on whether the building is depreciable as above. 8. You c an depreciate the fit-out if it is in a wholly non-residential building. Fit-out is also sometimes depreciable in a mixed-use building:  In a predominantly non-residential building, the fit-out must not be used in a dwelling within the building but it can be used in relation to the dwelling, such as fit-out of the common areas of the building.  In a predominantly residential building, the fit-out must be in a wholly non- residential area of the building. Items of shared fit-out such as in the common areas of the predominantly residential building are not depreciable. 9. The tax treatment of fit-out is summarised in Figure 2. Figure 2: Claiming depreciation on building fit-out Can depreciation be claimed? Item Commercial fit-out Shared fit-out Wholly non-residential building Yes N/A Predominantly non-residential building Yes Yes Predominantly residential building Yes No What is the right depreciation rate for your building? 10. The depreciation rates for most non-residential buildings are 2% DV and 1.5% SL. The depreciation rate for residential buildings is 0%. However, other depreciation rates can apply to some non-residential buildings. For example, a different rate is available if the building has a shorter economic useful life (such as a barn, a portable building or a IS 22/04 FS | 20 July 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 5 of 6 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] hothouse). Additionally, a special rate may be available if the item is used in an unusual way. 11. Owners of non-residential buildings can find the right depreciation rate for their building using the guides on the website as summarised in Figure 3 . Figure 3: Depreciation rates Find the rate – based on when the building was acquired Date Pre 1 April 1993 Between 1 April 1993 and 19 May 2005 After 19 May 2005 Rate source IR267 Historical rates IR267 Historical rates IR265 Schedule or Online calculator Further details Part 1 applies If building used in specific industry, then Part 2 Industry categories apply If not industry specific, then Part 3 Asset categories apply Use specific rate appropriate for your building if one applies If no specific rate applies, the non-residential building rate of 2% DV or 1.5% SL applies What if you sell your building or change its use? 12. If you sell your building, you may have depreciation recovery income or additional depreciation loss. Depreciation recovery income or additional depreciation loss can also arise if you change the building’s use, including situations when:  You change how you use a building, like changing a non-residential building to residential use (this is treated as if the building was sold for market value), or  Your building suffered damage so that it could no longer be used to derive income and it was demolished or abandoned for future demolition. 13. Depreciation recovery income arises if the amount received for the sale of the building (or treated as received when the use changes) is greater than the ATV of the building or fit-out. However, the amount of depreciation recovery income cannot be more than the total amount of depreciation loss that was available for the person for the building or fit-out. 14. Additional depreciation loss may be available if the amount received on disposal is less than the ATV of the building or fit-out. However, for buildings, additional depreciation IS 22/04 FS | 20 July 2022 UNCLASSIFIED Page 6 of 6 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] loss can only be claimed where the building is rendered useless and demolished or abandoned for demolition. In addition, the cause of the damage to the building needs to have been a natural event (such as a flood or earthquake) and beyond the control of the building owner (or their agent or a person associated with them).

Tax avoidance and the interpretation of the general anti-avoidance provisions sections BG 1 and GA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007
===============================================================================================================================

The statement explains the Commissioner’s view of the law on tax avoidance in Aotearoa New Zealand.  It is based on and reflects the view of the Supreme Court as set out in _Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2008\] NZSC 115, and applied in _Penny v CIR_ \[2011\] NZSC 95 and _Frucor Suntory New Zealand Ltd v CIR_ \[2022\] NZSC 113. 

The statement sets out the Commissioner’s approach to applying section BG 1\. The statement also explains how the Commissioner, under section GA 1, may counteract any tax advantage that a person obtains from or under a tax avoidance arrangement. 

The statement is also relevant to the general anti-avoidance provision in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (section 76).

This item replaces [IS 13/01](/interpretation-statements/is-1301-tax-avoidance-and-the-interpretation-of-sections-bg-1-and-ga-1-of-the-income-tax-act-2007)

Income tax – Application of the s CZ 39 5 year bright-line test to certain family and close relationship transactions
=====================================================================================================================

This interpretation statement considers the requirements of the 5 year bright-line test for residential land in s CZ 39 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and how it applies to certain family and close relationship transactions. Those family and close relationship transactions are when the ownership of residential land (that is not a main home) changes from:

*   parents to their child to assist the child with buying their first home;
*   one partner to themselves and their new partner; and
*   all the beneficiaries who inherit the land under a will or rules of intestacy to some of the beneficiaries.

The bright-line test under s CZ 39 applies if a person first acquired an estate or interest in residential land on or after 29 March 2018 but before 27 March 2021.

Public consultation on an earlier draft of this interpretation statement closed in October 2022.  The release of the finalised statement has been timed to match the passage of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2022-23, Platform Economy, and Remedial Matters) Act 2023 on 31 March 2023.

A separate interpretation statement on the application of the 10 year or 5 year (for new builds) bright-line test in s CB 6A of the Income Tax Act 2007 (which generally applies to residential land acquired on or after 27 March 2021) to the family and close relationship transactions considered in IS 23/02 is intended to be released in 2023.  However, the conclusions reached in IS 23/02 are likely to apply to s CB 6A.

FACT SHEET | PUKA MEKA Income tax – Charities – Business income exemption Issued | Tukuna: 16 September 2024 IS 24/08 FS 1 This fact sheet accompanies interpretation statement ‘IS 24/08: Charities – Business income exemption’. IS 24/08 provides guidance on when business income a registered charity derives is exempt from tax under s CW 42 of the Income Tax Act 2007. It explains that:  business income is exempt to the extent that it can be apportioned, on a reasonable basis, to a registered charity’s charitable purposes in New Zealand; and  all business income is taxable if a person with some control over the business is able to direct or divert business income away from charity. A registered charity is an entity registered as a charitable entity under the Charities Act 2005. Introduction | Whakataki 1. Generally, non-business income a registered charity derives is exempt (non-taxable) (s CW 41 of the Income Tax Act 2007). Business income is subject to different rules that can result in some, or all, of a registered charity’s business income being taxable (s CW 42 of the Income Tax Act 2007). 2. In determining whether a registered charity’s business income is exempt, two main questions need to be answered: IS 24/08 FS 1 | 16 September 2024 Page 2 of 5  What, if any, income derived by a registered charity is income from a business?  If a registered charity derives business income to what extent is that income attributable to its charitable purposes outside of New Z ealand? 3. How these factors apply is illustrated in Figure | Hoahoa 1. Figure | Hoahoa 1: How s CW 42 of the Income Tax Act 2007 applies \* All business income is taxable if a person with some control over the business is able to direct or divert business income away from charity. What constitutes business income 4. Before s CW 42 applies there must first be a person who is carrying on a business. Whether a person is carrying on a business is a factual question. For further explanation, read \[2 4\] to \[32\] in IS 24/08. IS 24/08 FS 1 | 16 September 2024 Page 3 of 5 5. A registered charity conducting a business might derive different types of income. It may earn income from its trade or business activities and other income such as interest, dividends, rent, donations, gifts and koha, as illustrated in Figure | Hoahoa 2. Figure | Hoahoa 2: Types of income 6. Whether these other amounts are “business income” depends on the nature of the registered charity’s business and its relationship with these amounts. It is a question of fact and depends on whether the income arises from the business activity. Not all income derived by a registered charity that conducts a business is business income, see Example | Tauira 1. Example | Tauira 1 Cooks for Good Ltd is a registered charity. Its charitable purpose is to advance religious education. To raise funds for its charitable purpose, it runs a café that sells food and drink. Cooks for Good Ltd has an interest-bearing business on-call account that it uses to deposit the takings from the café and pay for the café’s expenses. It receives a donation from a member of the public who has heard about and wants to support its work in advancing religious education. The income from running the café (that is, selling food and drink) and the interest income on the business on-call account are both income from the business. This outcome arises because the interest income is closely connected to Cooks for Good Ltd’s business (and not as a result of the name or nature of the bank account, ie, a “business on-call account”). The ordinary day-to-day transactions IS 24/08 FS 1 | 16 September 2024 Page 4 of 5 of the business give rise to or produce the interest income. The interest income is effectively paid on the takings from the café when they exceed the café’s expenses. The donation is not Cooks for Good Ltd’s business income because it is unrelated to its business. Further, any interest income earned on the donation is not income from the business. No part of the business activity gives rise to or produces the interest income. Whether charitable purposes are limited to New Zealand Charitable purposes are limited to New Zealand 7. For a registered charity’s charitable purposes to be limited to New Zealand it is not enough that its rules limit its charitable purposes to New Zealand. Its charitable purposes must in fact be limited to New Zealand. 8. Sometimes a registered charity that previously carried out charitable purposes only in New Zealand will make a donation in response to an unexpected event overseas, eg a natural disaster. A registered charity that donates to charitable purposes outside New Zealand is itself carrying out charitable purposes overseas. This means its charitable purposes are no longer limited to New Zealand. Charitable purposes are not limited to New Zealand 9. Business income is exempt only to the extent it can be apportioned, on a reasonable basis, to a registered charity’s charitable purposes in New Zealand. 10. A registered charity’s split of business income between its charitable purposes in and outside New Zealand does not need to be exact to the last dollar but must be reasonable. For a discussion of possible approaches to splitting business income, read ‘IS 24/08: Charities – business income exemption’. 11. Generally, once a registered charity determines an approach to splitting its business income it can use the same approach in the following years. 12. There may be situations where it is reasonable to allocate all of a registered charity’s business income to charitable purposes in New Zealand despite the registered charity IS 24/08 FS 1 | 16 September 2024 Page 5 of 5 carrying on charitable purposes in and outside New Zealand, see Example | Tauira 2 for one such situation. Example | Tauira 2 The Onward Trust is a registered charity. It provides religious services and pastoral care to its local community in New Zealand. Its trust deed does not limit its charitable purposes to New Zealand. The Onward Trust derives business income. Its trust deed does not provide for its business income to be ring-fenced for its charitable purposes in New Zealand. The Onward Trust carries out its charitable purposes in New Zealand. Occasionally it donates overseas in response to natural disasters that occur outside New Zealand. It does not carry out other overseas charitable purposes. The funds for the donation come from the local community who donate to the Onward Trust in response to the particular natural disaster. The Onward Trust keeps records of the donation amounts received from the community and donates this amount to the overseas charitable purposes. In this case it is reasonable for the Onward Trust to treat any business income it derives as exempt on the basis that all its business income is for charitable purposes in New Zealand. 13. How much tax a registered charity needs to pay on its taxable business income depends on what proportion of its deductible business expenses relate to that taxable business income. No deduction can be claimed for business expenses that relate to exempt business income. A registered charity can split its deductible business expenses (between its taxable and exempt business income) on the same basis it split its business income.

\[Interpretation statement IS0018 issued by Adjudication & Rulings in August 1998\] AMATEUR SPORTS PROMOTER EXEMPTION—APPLICATION TO NON-RESIDENTS Summary This interpretation statement sets out the Commissioner’s interpretation of whether a non-resident can qualify for the amateur sports promoter exemption from income tax provided by section CB 4(1)(h) of the Income Tax Act 1994. The item concludes that a non-resident is not excluded from qualifying for the exemption solely by reason of being non-resident. This item does not comment on the particular requirements in section CB 4(1)(h) for qualification for the exemption available to sports promoters. Only the question of whether a society or association which otherwise meets the requirements of being an amateur sports promoter is prevented from qualifying for the exemption because it is non-resident, is addressed. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. Legislation Section CB 4 provides an exemption from income tax for the income of certain non- profit bodies and charities. Section CB 4(1)(h) applies to income derived by amateur sports promoters and states that, to the extent that in the absence of the section the following amounts would be gross income, they are exempt income. It states: Any amount derived by any society or association, whether incorporated or not, which is, in the opinion of the Commissioner, established substantially or primarily for the purpose of promoting any amateur game or sport if that game or sport is conducted for the recreation or entertainment of the general public, and if no part of the funds of the society or association is used or available to be used for the private pecuniary profit of any proprietor, member, or shareholder of that society or association: Application of the Legislation Nothing in the strict wording of the provision itself, or in other sections of the Act, specifically limits the availability of the exemption in section CB 4(1)(h) to resident taxpayers. However, it is also necessary to ascertain whether such a limitation is to be inferred from statutory construction and/or the relevant case law. These two aspects are discussed below. Statutory construction Under section AA 2, a person who is resident in New Zealand or who has income from New Zealand is subject to the Income Tax Act. Accordingly, a non-resident deriving income from New Zealand is subject to New Zealand income tax unless otherwise exempted. Furthermore, a non-resident deriving New Zealand sourced income is also subject to the general application of provisions of the Income Tax Act unless the Act provides otherwise. 1 Examples of provisions which apply to specifically exempt certain New Zealand sourced income derived by non-residents include: • Section CB 2(1)(a) - income derived by non-resident entertainers. • Section CB 2(1)(b) - interest on certain government borrowings from a non- resident. • Section CB 2(1)(c) - personal services income derived by non-residents visiting New Zealand for not more than 92 days. • Section CB 2(1)(d) - income of visiting experts or students in New Zealand under government assistance arrangements. On the other hand, the Act contains other exempt income provisions providing exemptions for certain interest income (sections CB 1(1)(a) and (c)), but which specifically exclude absentees from their application. An “absentee” for the purpose of these provisions is a person who is non-resident throughout the income year. It is possible to infer from this that if it were not for these specific exclusions provided in the legislation (in sections CB 1(1)(a) and (c)), a non-resident in receipt of such New Zealand sourced interest income would be entitled to claim these interest exemptions. Section CB 4(1)(h) requires that the game or sport being promoted “is conducted for the recreation or entertainment of the general public”. This condition does not impose any requirement that the promoter itself must be resident in New Zealand, but applies whether the promoter seeking to obtain the benefit of the exemption is resident or not. The Australian Tax Office has issued a taxation ruling (TR 97/22) on the application of the income tax exemption available to sporting organisations under paragraph (c) of item 9.1 of the table in section 50-45 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (formerly contained in subparagraph 23(g)(iii) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936). However, that ruling does not address the issue considered in this interpretation statement. Summary: The statutory construction of the Act does not establish clearly whether the exemption provisions of section CB 4(1)(h) apply to non-residents. However, to the extent that the section’s application can be inferred from the above analysis, statutory construction points to non-residents not being prevented from obtaining the exemption. It indicates that if a non-resident derives New Zealand sourced income which otherwise meets the criteria laid down for an exemption, the non-resident will not be excluded from the application of the exemption by reason only of being a non- resident, unless a specific exclusion for non-residents exists. 2 Case law There are no reported cases on section CB 4(1)(h) and the question of its application to non-residents, or on similar residence questions relating to the application of other subsections of section CB 4(1) which exempt the income of specific societies or institutions (section CB 4(1)(b), (f), (g), (j), and (k)). However, the issue was considered directly by the High Court of Australia in University of Birmingham v Commissioner of Taxation and Epsom College v Commissioner of Taxation (1938) 1 AITR 383, a case concerning section 23(e) of Australia’s Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. Section 23(e) was a provision exempting the income of charitable institutions and was similar to section CB 4(1)(c) of New Zealand’s Income Tax Act 1994. The facts were that the university and the college were both institutions established in Britain and carrying on no activities in Australia. However, they both derived income in Australia. Section 23(e) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 provided: The following income shall be exempt from income tax - ... (e) the income of a religious, scientific, charitable or public educational institution The Court found that there was no reason to restrict the availability of the exemption to institutions based in Australia. Dixon J stated 1 : By section 17\[section BB 1\] income tax is imposed upon the taxable income of any person whether a resident or a non-resident. Taxable income means the amount remaining after deducting from the assessable income all allowable deductions (s.6). Section 25(1) \[section BB 3\] provides that the assessable income of a taxpayer shall include:- (a) where the taxpayer is a resident - the gross income derived directly or indirectly from all resources whether in or out of Australia: and (b) where the taxpayer is a non-resident - gross income derived directly or indirectly from all sources in Australia which is not exempt income. The territorial basis of taxation is clearly shown by these provisions, ... The liability is in respect of all income, in the case of a resident, which is not exempt income and, in the case of a non-resident, of all Australian income which is not exempt income. ... The scope of the exemptions might well be expected to be commensurate with the application of the provisions imposing liability. ... An examination of the various paragraphs of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, which deal with many exemptions, shows that in some an express limitation is included based on territorial grounds. In section 78(1)(a) \[section KC 5\], which allows a deduction \[rebate\] to taxpayers in respect of gifts made to institutions of a specified charitable nature, there is an express qualification confining it to institutions in Australia. In view of these matters I think that to imply in section 23(e) \[section CB 4(1)(c)\] a restriction which has not been expressed would be to amend and not to interpret the language of the enactment. Although the decision in University of Birmingham and Epsom College is not from the New Zealand jurisdiction, and the statutory provision to which it relates (section 23(e) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Australia)) is different from section CB 4(1)(h), the decision can be treated as relevant and authoritative because: • Section 23(e) is, like section CB 4(1)(h), a provision establishing a category of exempt income. 1 Note: Where a provision in Australia’s Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 is referred to, any equivalent provision in the New Zealand Income Tax Act 1994 is interpolated in square brackets. 3 • Section 23(e) is, like section CB 4(1)(h), a provision relating to institutions, and those institutions are capable of being either residents or non-residents. • The same statutory scheme which influenced the Court in reaching its decision is present in the New Zealand statute, i.e. a scheme which imposes liability on income derived within the relevant jurisdiction by non-residents. • Other sections and subsections in subpart CB of the Income Tax Act 1994, like other paragraphs in section 23 of the Australian statute, impose territorial limitations on aspects of other exemptions, for example: • CB 2(1)(c) - Income from personal services by visiting non-residents; • CB 2(1)(d) - Income from expert advice, etc., by visiting non-resident; • CB 4(1)(e) - Charitable purposes limited to those within New Zealand; • CB 4(1)(f) - Promotion of veterinary services within New Zealand only; • CB 4(1)(g) - Promotion of the standard of dairy cattle within New Zealand only; • CB 8(1)(b) - “Niue dividends” derived by a non-resident; • CB 9(f) - Life policies entered into within or outside New Zealand treated differently. • Section KC 5(1) of the New Zealand statute, like the then section 78(1)(a) of the Australian statute, limits relief for “charitable donations” to donations to institutions within the jurisdiction. Further case law in support of the view that non-residents are not excluded from the exemption in section CB 4(1)(h), is the decision of the New Zealand Court of Appeal in CIR v Alcan New Zealand Limited \[1994\] 3 NZLR 439. In that case the Commissioner had contended that the taxpayer and Alcan Australia Ltd were not within a group of companies for the purposes of section 191(3) of the Income Tax Act 1976. His grounds were that Alcan Australia was not a New Zealand taxpayer in the sense that it had assessable income or losses in New Zealand or been engaged in a business activity which produced assessable income or losses in New Zealand. The Court held that it was not implicit in section 191(3) that each of the companies in the group was to be a New Zealand taxpayer. The following comments from the judgment of the Court delivered by McKay J, are relevant: None of the arguments advanced provide sufficient basis for departing from the plain meaning of the words of the section. It is not necessary to read into those words some implied limitation. To do so would require speculation as to the legislative intent, as is illustrated by the changing stance adopted by the Commissioner as to the qualification for which he has contended. ... In our view there is no justification for reading any of these qualifications into the definition. The words are plain, and should be given their plain meaning. 4 5 A UK charity case that provides additional support for this position is Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation Inc. v IR Commrs \[1954\] 2 All ER 466. In one of the judgments in this case, Jenkins LJ commented (at page 483): I agree that the general principle deducible from (for example) Colquhoun v Heddon (1890), 25 QBD 129; 2 Tax Cas. 621, cannot of itself provide any sufficient ground for limiting the exemption afforded by s.37 in the way contended for by the Crown. Where an Act of the United Kingdom Parliament imposes a tax on income arising in the United Kingdom, makes the tax equally exigible whether the person entitled to the income is British or foreign, resident or non-resident, and affords an exemption from the tax to persons fulfilling specified conditions which do not expressly include citizenship of or residence in the United Kingdom, there can, in my view, be no justification for the implied exclusion from the benefit of the exemption of a foreign non-resident who has suffered, or apart from the exemption would suffer, the tax, and who satisfies all the express requirements of the exempting provision, merely on the grounds that he is a non-resident foreigner. \[Emphasis added\] Summary: The decision in the University of Birmingham and Epsom College case and comments in the Alcan and Dreyfus Foundation cases support the view that, unless specifically excluded, the income exemption provisions in subpart CB will apply to non-residents. Conclusion Non-residents are not excluded from the application of the amateur sports promoter income exemption in section CB 4(1)(h) by virtue of their status as non-residents. Accordingly, provided a non-resident satisfies the other particular requirements in section CB 4(1)(h), that person will qualify for the exemption. Inland Revenue plans to issue a draft interpretation statement on the general application of the section CB 4(1)(h) amateur sports promoter exemption in the New Zealand context at a future date.
\[Interpretation statement IS0025 issued by Adjudication & Rulings in February 2000\] DAIRY FARMING – DEDUCTIBILITY OF CERTAIN EXPENDITURE SUMMARY This interpretation statement sets out the Commissioner’s view on the deductibility of certain expenditure relating to operating a dairy farm. It involves considering capital/revenue principles as they apply to various repairs and maintenance/capital improvement situations that may arise in the context of a dairy shed complex. In regard to the key issues in this context, the Commissioner considers: • Milking plant (as defined further below) is one single, identifiable asset. Generally, the cost of replacing a single component part of the plant (e.g. a pump or the pulsator units) is deductible. Depending on the scale and nature of the changes, in situations where a number of parts are replaced at, or about the same time, the cost is usually on capital account. • In a rotary milking operation, the rotary platform system is considered to be a separate asset distinct from the surrounding dairy shed. The cost of replacing the entire platform, or drive mechanism is on capital account. The cost of replacing the electric motor is on revenue account. If individual subsidiary parts of each of those items are replaced or repaired, the cost is deductible. • The piping used in the dairy shed complex is not a fence for the purposes of sections DO 3 or DO 4. The piping surrounds are part of the dairy shed complex comprising the shed and adjoining yard. Accordingly, the cost of the piping forms part of the total cost of the dairy shed which is a separate depreciable asset. • The cost of undergrounding an existing overhead line system which supplies power to a dairy shed is capital. A number of other conclusions regarding the deductibility of specific items of expenditure are addressed below. To the extent that any issues considered in this statement have been the subject of earlier statements by the Commissioner (e.g. fencing and dairy shed complexes), this statement reflects the Commissioner’s current view. This statement does not address depreciation issues. Depreciation rates for identified assets will be set in due course. BACKGROUND A number of issues have arisen regarding the correct treatment of various items of expenditure relating to the operation of a dairy farm. In particular, difficulties and inconsistencies regarding the treatment of costs involved in acquiring and maintaining the dairy shed complex and various items of equipment situated in the dairy shed. 1 2 The expenditure breaks down into four general categories, i.e. expenditure on or relating to the following: • The milking plant and related plant and machinery • Rotary dairy shed milking platforms and machinery • The dairy shed, yard and surrounds • Undergrounding of electricity reticulation systems to dairy sheds. Milking plant and related plant and machinery Comprising: (i) the milking plant: consisting of a number of individual items, e.g. rubberware; pulsators; milk line comprising stainless steel and pvc piping; milk filters; the milk cooler; the milk receiver/air intercepter; pumps/electric motors (ii) the cleansing plant: consisting of jetter washers; mixing bath; water pipes (stainless steel, ordinary steel or pvc); water pumps (iii) the wash down unit: consisting of a water pump and piping (pvc and steel) (iv) water heaters, including insulation wraps (v) milk storage vats and associated plant. A dairy shed may also contain: (i) a refrigeration unit (ii) a drenching system (iii) a plant wash down unit (iv) a yard wash down unit (v) a vat washing unit. Rotary dairy shed milking platforms and machinery Comprising: (i) the rotary platform, including embedded pipe work (ii) the drive machinery: consisting of an electric motor and a drive mechanism. Dairy shed, yard and surrounds Comprising: (i) the shed structure (ii) the dairy shed yard: consisting of the concrete base, pipe railings, and other barriers (iii) the pasture resting yards surrounding or adjacent to the dairy shed (iv) the inlet and exit (outlet) race (v) the stock races leading to the dairy shed. Undergrounding electricity reticulation to dairy sheds 3 Relating to the electricity reticulation system running from the edge of a farmer’s property to the dairy shed. LEGISLATION All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994, unless otherwise stated. Section BD 2(1) specifies the deductions allowable to a taxpayer, while section BD 2(2) provides for certain expenditure or losses to be excluded from allowable deductions: BD 2(1) An amount is an allowable deduction of a taxpayer (a) if it is an allowance for depreciation that the taxpayer is entitled to under Part E (Timing of Income and Deduction), or (b) to the extent that it is an expenditure or loss (i) incurred by the taxpayer in deriving the taxpayer’s gross income, or (ii) necessarily incurred by the taxpayer in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving the taxpayer’s gross income, or (iii) allowed as a deduction to the taxpayer under Part C (Income Further Defined), D (Deductions Further Defined), E (Timing of Income and Deductions), F (Apportionment and Recharacterised Transactions), G (Avoidance and Non Market Transactions), H (Treatment of Net Income of Certain Entities), I (Treatment of Net Losses), L (Credits) or M (Tax Payments). BD 2(2) An amount of expenditure or loss is not an allowable deduction of a taxpayer to the extent that it is ... (e) of a capital nature, unless allowed as a deduction under Part D (Deductions Further Defined) or E (Timing of Income and Deductions). Section DO 3 provides for certain expenditure on farm or agricultural land; the relevant part being: Any taxpayer who in any income year is engaged in any farming or agricultural business on any land in New Zealand shall be allowed a deduction of the amount of any expenditure incurred by the taxpayer in that year, being expenditure that is not deductible otherwise than under this section or under section DO 4, in – ... (g) The construction on the land of fences for agricultural purposes, including the purchase of wire or wire netting for the purpose of making new or existing fences rabbit proof. Section DO 4(1) allows a deduction on an annual depreciated basis for expenditure incurred on certain land improvements specified in Part A of Schedule 7: Any taxpayer who carries on any farming or agricultural business on any land owned by that taxpayer in New Zealand shall in any income year other than the income year in which that taxpayer sells or otherwise disposes of that land, be allowed a deduction in respect of any expenditure of any of the kinds specified in Part A of Schedule 7 incurred by the taxpayer or by any other taxpayer in preparing or otherwise developing that land, and being expenditure which is of benefit to the business in that income year. 4 Part A of Schedule 7 includes the following items: 6. The construction of access roads or tracks to or on the land. ... 13. The construction on the land of fences, including the purchase of wire or wire netting for the purpose of making new or existing fences rabbit proof. 14. The erection on the land of electric-power lines or telephone lines. 15. The construction on the land of feeding platforms, feeding yards, plunge sheep dips, or self- feeding ensilage pits. ... 17. The construction on the land of structures for shelter purposes. APPLICATION OF THE LEGISLATION Introduction This statement considers: • A brief background to the current taxation treatment of expenditure on “repairs and maintenance” (“R&M”) • The key authorities and principles for distinguishing between capital and revenue expenditure • The significant cases dealing with R&M expenditure issues. After this general discussion, the established principles are then applied to: • Identify the particular dairy farm assets under consideration; and • Determine in relation to those assets whether various types of expenditure are on capital or revenue account. (In both of these sections the analysis is divided into a consideration of the four main categories of dairy farm expenditure identified above.) Background to current treatment of R&M expenditure Up until the 1993-94 income year, deductibility of R&M expenditure was governed by section 108 of the Income Tax Act 1976. Section 108 specifically provided for the deduction of amounts spent on repairs and alterations. An extensive body of case law exists relating to the deductibility (or otherwise) of R&M expenditure incurred under the old regime. To date, no cases have specifically considered the deductibility of expenditure under the new regime. Since the repeal of section 108, the question of the deductibility of expenditure on R&M has essentially involved an application of the capital/revenue distinction. In the context of the 1994 Act, this means a consideration of the general deductibility test in section BD 2(1), and the prohibition on deductions of capital expenditure in section 5 BD 2(2)(e). A significant body of general case law (non-R&M cases) exists on the capital/revenue distinction. However, this does not mean that the body of R&M case law that existed before the repeal of section 108 is no longer relevant. A number of these cases are relevant to identifying the particular asset under consideration. In addition, many R&M expenditure cases apply capital/revenue principles, and many are also helpful for the analogies they offer with the issues under consideration. In summary, both general capital/revenue cases and R&M cases are relevant in determining the deductibility of the dairy farm expenditure considered in this statement. The capital/revenue distinction A large number of capital/revenue cases exist. Many make the point that each case must be decided on its own facts. A landmark case which outlines the proper approach to the subject of determining whether any outgoing is of a capital nature is the decision of the Privy Council in BP Australia Ltd v FC of T \[1965\] All ER 209. A leading New Zealand case that confirms the approach taken in BP Australia is the decision in CIR v McKenzies New Zealand Limited (1988) 10 NZTC 5233. At page 5,236 the Court said: In deciding whether expenditure is capital or income the approach generally favoured by the courts in recent years is exemplified in the following observations of Lord Pearce in BP Australia Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia \[1966\] AC 244 at pp264-265: “The solution to the problem is not to be found by any rigid test or description. It has to be derived from many aspects of the whole set of circumstances some of which may point in one direction, some in the other. One consideration may point so clearly that it dominates other and vaguer indications in the contrary direction. It is a commonsense appreciation of all the guiding features which must provide the ultimate answer. Although the categories of capital and income expenditure are distinct and easily ascertainable in obvious cases that lie far from the boundary, the line of distinction is often hard to draw in borderline cases; and conflicting considerations may produce a situation where the answer turns on questions of emphasis and degree. That answer: ‘depends on what the expenditure is calculated to effect from a practical and a business point of view rather than upon the juristic classification of the legal rights, if any, secured employed or exhausted in the process’. per Dixon J in Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1946) 72 CLR 634, 648. As each new case comes to be argued felicitous phrases from earlier judgments are used in argument by one side and the other; but those phrases are not the deciding factor, nor are they of unlimited application. They merely crystallise particular factors which may incline the scale in the particular case after a balance of all the considerations has been taken.” Amongst the factors weighed by the judicial committee in BP Australia were: (a) the need or occasion which called for the expenditure; (b) whether the payments were made from fixed or circulating capital; (c) whether the payments were of a once and for all nature producing assets or advantages which were an enduring benefit; (d) how the payment would be treated on ordinary principles of commercial accounting; and (e) whether the payments were expended on the business structure of the taxpayer or whether they were part of the process by which income was earned. 6 The Court in McKenzies noted that the Privy Council decision in BP Australia was recognised by the New Zealand Court of Appeal in CIR v LD Nathan and Co Limited \[1972\] NZLR 209 and also in Buckley and Young Limited v CIR \[1978\] 2 NZLR 485. The principles from BP Australia, summarised by Richardson J in McKenzies, were adopted by Gallen J in Christchurch Press Company Limited v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,206. Deductions for repairs and maintenance – general principles In the last year there have been three significant New Zealand decisions on R&M expenditure – Hawkes Bay Power Distribution Ltd v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,685, Poverty Bay Electric Power Board v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,001 (CA) and Auckland Gas Co Ltd v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,011 (CA). Additionally, a number of other New Zealand and overseas authorities are recognised as being important decisions in this context, including: New Zealand cases • Auckland Trotting Club (Inc) v CIR \[1968\] NZLR 967 • Case L68 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,398 • Case L95 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,546 • Case N8 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,052 • Colonial Motors Co Limited v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,361 • Sherlaw v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,290 • Case T43 (1998) 18 NZTC 8,287. Overseas cases • Highland Railway Co v Balderstone (Surveyor of Taxes) (1889) 2 TC 485 • Lurcott v Wakely & Wheeler \[1911\] 1 KB 905 • O’Grady v Bullcroft Main Collieries Ltd (1932) 17 TC 93 • Rhodesia Railways Ltd v Collector of Income Tax, Bechuanaland Protectorate \[1933\] AC 368 • Margrett v Lowestoft Water & Gas Co. (1935) 19 TC 481 • Samuel Jones & Co (Devondale) Ltd v IR Commrs (1952) 32 TC 513 • Phillips v Whieldon Sanitary Potteries Ltd. (1952) 33 TC 213 • FCT v Western Suburbs Cinemas Ltd \[1952\] 86 CLR 102 • Lindsay v FCT (1961) 106 CLR 377 • Conn v Robins Bros Ltd \[1966\] 43 TC 266 • Brown (I of T) v Burnley Football and Athletic Co Ltd \[1980\] 3 All ER 244. Summary of the key principles taken from these cases From the above decisions it is possible to deduce a three-stage approach to the issue of whether or not certain expenditure is deductible: 1. Identify the relevant asset. If this is part of a larger asset, it must be a distinct physical unit capable of operating on its own, albeit that it forms part of the whole. 7 2. Ascertain the nature, extent, and cost of the work undertaken in relation to, or on, that asset. 3. Determine whether the work has remedied fair wear and tear (deductible repairs), or whether the asset has been improved, or altered, or so substantially changed that it amounts to a new, or substantially new, asset (capital). Identification of the asset The key points to note from the cases are: • The first step is to identify the subject matter of the work. That is, the totality or entirety of the physical asset that is the relevant subject matter under consideration. (Lindsay; Auckland Gas Co; Poverty Bay Electric Power, Hawkes Bay Power). • Put another way, it is necessary to identify “a physical thing which satisfies a particular notion” (Lindsay). The focus is on a “physical thing” – the consideration excludes the operational significance, or the economic value, of the subject matter. The fact that a particular physical thing realises its economic value only when used in conjunction with other “things” or business systems, does not mean it is not to be regarded as a separate asset whose replacement is on capital account (per Gault J in Auckland Gas Co). • However, a single asset may be made up of a number of interdependent parts (Auckland Gas Co). There is always a danger of distortion if too large, or too small, a subject matter is identified (Poverty Bay Electric Power). If a subsidiary part of an asset is regarded as the subject matter and that part has been replaced, there might be a tendency to classify what has occurred as a matter of capital, possibly leading to an absurd result. A replacement of a mere component, even a vital component (even if an improved or modified version of that component is substituted), may still be correctly classified as a repair. Conversely, if the subject matter is seen as being too broad, then every replacement of a single unit that forms part of the total subject matter would be seen as merely a repair to the whole. • Ascertaining whether a part of a wider asset is itself a separate physical thing or simply a component of a wider asset, includes considering: whether it is physically and functionally distinct from the wider setting, its relative size and value as regards the whole asset (is it “a principal capital item”? (Hawkes Bay Power)), its ability to be relocated elsewhere, and the process of the business in which the part is used (Auckland Trotting; Case N8; Burnley Football). Relevant also may be whether the part is itself a separate item of plant or equipment distinguishable from the surrounding premises (Auckland Trotting; O’Grady). • It will always be a question of fact, degree, and impression as to what is included or excluded in an entity or asset (Case N8). However, the focus is on finding a significant physical asset that will either function by itself, or is clearly divisible in 8 size or function from other assets that make up the taxpayer’s premises or business. Deductibility The key points to note from the cases concerning the availability of a deduction for expenditure incurred in relation to an asset are: • This will also always be a question of fact and degree in the particular circumstances (Auckland Gas Co; Case N8). The borderline between a repair and an improvement of a capital nature may sometimes be difficult to determine. The test is whether the act to be done is one that in substance is the renewal or replacement of defective parts, or the renewal or replacement of substantially the whole (Wakely & Wheeler). • Expenditure that does no more than restore an asset to an “as new” condition, rather than create a new asset, will be deductible whether this is completed in one income year or over a number of years (Auckland Gas Co). This applies even if the asset is “improved” in the sense of using more modern technology and/or being more efficient by being less susceptible to breakdown (Conn v Robins Bros, but c.f. Western Suburbs Cinemas). • Expenditure on renewal, replacement, or reconstruction of substantially the whole of an asset goes beyond repair and is non-deductible capital expenditure, even if what was spent may have been less than the cost of on-going maintenance (Wakely & Wheeler; Auckland Gas Co; Poverty Bay Electric Power). This will also still apply even if the asset gives no greater performance and/or has no greater life span than that of the replaced asset (Case L68). • The renewal of major components of the asset, rather than their on-going maintenance, can be indicative of the expenditure falling on capital account (Case N8). An assessment has to be made of whether the work is of sufficient substance to place the expenditure on capital account (Wakely & Wheeler). Any improvement to the asset will be relevant to that assessment (Auckland Gas Co; Poverty Bay Electric Power). • In determining whether certain work, possibly comprising repairs and or replacements of a large number of component parts, is capital or revenue in nature, it is important to ascertain the taxpayer’s overall intention, i.e. to repair or to totally improve or reconstruct (Colonial Motors; Sherlaw; Case N8). If the total work is substantial and is intended to produce a different and operationally superior asset, it must be regarded as a capital improvement (Poverty Bay Electric Power). • Work resulting in a significant increase in the value of the asset, a change in its character or kind, or involving an amount not regularly incurred, is more likely to be capital expenditure (Case N8; Auckland Gas Co; Highland Railways). Similarly, an amount incurred that is substantial in relation to the value of the asset prior to the work is likely to be capital in nature (Case N8). 9 • In the context of a total project it may be artificial to dissect the work into capital and revenue categories, or to further dissect a purported revenue category into capital and non-capital items. It is necessary to look at the entire asset and see what was there before and after (Case N8; Colonial Motors). • Some authority exists for the proposition that it is possible to carry out substantial repairs over time, provided they are not part of a wider reconstruction project (Sherlaw). • No deduction is available for notional repairs (Colonial Motors). Identification of the asset – specific dairy assets Milking and other associated plant It is possible to loosely group the various items of equipment and plant found inside a typical dairy shed into the following categories: • “Milking plant”: items of plant forming part of the milk extraction process; commencing with the cups placed on the cow and ending with the milk flowing from pipes into a storage vat for later collection. Included are items such as milking cups, clusters or claws (the items attached to the cow during milking), rubberware (including suction cups and hoses linking clusters to the milk lines or pipes), cup removers, stainless steel milk pipes or lines, other milk or air pipes, , vacuum pumps, pulsator units, the milk receiver/air intercepter, the milk pump, the milk filter, and the milk cooler. • “Cleansing plant”: items of plant for cleaning the milking plant by mixing water and detergents and pumping it through the plant. Included are items such as jetter washers, mixing bath, water pipes (stainless steel, ordinary steel or pvc), and the water pumps. • “Wash down unit”: items of plant for washing down the dairy shed surfaces and yards, including items such as a water pump, and pvc and steel piping. • “Water heaters”: one or more water heaters or cylinders for heating water for cleaning the milking plant, milk vat, etc. • “Milk storage vats and associated plant”: the vat into which the milk is pumped and stored until collected by the dairy company. This item is sometimes called a milk silo, milk storage tank or bulk milk tank. The vat has an attached refrigeration unit for keeping the milk cool and there may also be a vat washing unit. (In some, but not all cases, the vat is owned by the dairy company.) The question then arises as to whether the above categories can be accepted as being separate assets or “entireties” for the purposes of considering the deductibility of expenditure incurred for items within these categories. Milking plant 10 It is necessary to ask whether this satisfies the “entirety test” adopted in Lindsay and followed in New Zealand cases such as Auckland Trotting Club, Auckland Gas Co, Hawkes Bay Power and Poverty Bay Electric Power. That is, can it be said to be “a physical thing which satisfies a particular notion”, not being a subsidiary part of anything else? Alternatively, do individually listed items that make up the milking plant category constitute separate assets, or entireties in their own right? The “particular notion” in this case is the extraction of milk from the cows and its delivery to the storage vat to await collection. The plant satisfies this notion through its network of cups, pulsators, pumps, filter, milk cooler, and pipes. Although consisting of a number of items or component parts, these parts are linked physically as one combined unit to extract milk from the cows. If one of the parts is removed, the unit cannot operate; each part is dependent on the others to perform its function, e.g. the releaser milk pump cannot operate without the milking cups, pulsators, vacuum pump or other parts of the milking unit. A part of the milking unit once removed cannot be used for any useful purpose other than in another milking unit. The conclusion to be drawn from this is that the milking unit network operates as a physical thing or single unit rather than as a number of separate stand-alone assets. However, it is necessary to go a step further and consider if those items included in the milking plant constitute the “entirety” of the asset, or whether they are a component part of some larger asset. It might for example be argued that part of the milking process is the cleansing of the milking unit that is undertaken during each milking. In this connection, consideration has been given to whether the cleansing of the milking unit and the items of plant that carry it out (referred to above as “cleansing plant”) can be separated from the core “milk extraction” plant, i.e. are they two or more separate assets or one “entirety”? The cleansing of the milking unit is clearly a regular and integrated part of each milking. It is a fundamental hygiene requirement. As soon as milking of the dairy herd is completed, the milking unit is put through a cleansing cycle of flushing the milking unit with a succession of cold water, hot water and detergents and a final sanitising rinse. Many of the items that make up the two categories are either closely located or physically joined. For example, the water pipes through which the water and cleaning agents are pumped usually run alongside the milk pipes and other items of the milking unit in the milking area. They are suspended from or attached to the same framework or part of the shed structure. Usually, the jetter washers (items of the cleansing unit) are the outlet for the water and detergents, and during the wash cycle the milking cups are attached to them. The cleansing agents are then sucked through the milking unit in the same way as the milk, but diverted immediately before reaching the milk storage vat. It is accepted that some items of the cleansing unit, such as the mixing bath where hot and cold water and detergents are mixed for the wash cycle, and the water pumps that pump the water and detergents into the milking unit for the wash cycle, are not as closely linked physically to the milking unit. However, on balance: 11 • what is involved in each complete milking from a detailed process point of view; and • the way in which the milk extraction and milking unit cleansing items are linked physically; - the various items as a whole can be accepted as constituting “a physical thing which satisfies a particular notion”. In identifying the relevant asset or groups of assets within the dairy shed, it is necessary to also consider whether the milking plant can be said to be a “physical thing”, that is an “entirety by itself” and not a “subsidiary part” of anything else. To some extent this has already been addressed, as it has already been concluded that the items that make up the milk extraction unit should not on their own be regarded as a “single physical thing”. Rather they, along with the items making up the cleansing unit, are component parts that together form the physical asset: the milking plant. The milk extraction and cleansing units are subsidiary units of the milking plant and are linked both physically, and from the milking process point of view, to form an “entirety”. Having reached this view, it is necessary to consider whether this asset is a subsidiary part of anything else. In doing this we must consider the other items usually found in the dairy shed, i.e. the wash down unit; the water heaters; and the milk storage vats and associated plant. As seen above, ascertaining whether a part of a wider asset is itself a separate physical thing or simply a component of the wider asset, includes considering: whether it is physically and functionally distinct from the wider setting, its relative size and value to the whole (is it “a principal capital item?”), its ability to be relocated elsewhere, and the process of the business in which the part is used. It may also be relevant to establish whether the part is itself a separate item of plant or equipment distinguishable from the surrounding premises. The wash down unit is for washing down the dairy shed surfaces and yards and is not linked physically to the milking plant proper, although it is also situated in the dairy shed. The unit also performs an entirely different function from that of the milking plant, i.e. to clean the surrounding surfaces, rather than extract milk. It can also be relocated and used for other cleaning purposes. Given these factors, the wash down unit is a separate item of plant or equipment distinguishable from both the milking plant and the dairy shed setting. The one or more water heaters heat the water for cleaning not only the milking unit but also the milk vat, and other plant. They may often be situated adjacent to some of the cleansing unit, and typically pipes run from the heaters to parts of the cleansing unit. However, pipes can also lead from the water heaters to other items of plant, and the hot water may be used to clean other plant. The heaters are therefore not regarded as part of the cleansing unit: they are capable of being operated on their own and are stand-alone assets. They are not dependent on the milking plant for their operation and could be shifted and used in any operation requiring hot water. In addition, the milking plant could operate without the hot water heaters by only using a cold water 12 wash cycle, albeit less effectively. Therefore, the water heaters are separate items of plant distinguishable from both the milking plant and the dairy shed setting. The milk storage vats and associated plant simply store the milk arising from the milking process until its collection by tanker for delivery to the dairy factory. A vat is usually situated on an elevated platform or stand and located either in a “room” of the dairy shed separate from the rest of the dairy shed plant, or outside the dairy shed itself. Hygiene requirements may also dictate that the vat is sited separately from the milking plant. From a process or functional viewpoint the vat is a storage asset, whereas the milking plant is involved in the extraction of the milk from the cows. A pipe may run from the milking plant to the vat to deliver the milk, but that does not mean the two units together form “a physical thing which satisfies a particular notion”. The two pieces of plant have different roles to play, although they are interconnected. Compare with the various parts of the batching plant in Case N8 (per Bathgate J at page 3,070): I consider the supervisor’s office, the dispatch office and the control room, which were all housed in a separate and detached building from the ground bins, elevators and tower, to be a separate and distinct entity from the ground bins, elevators and tower plus its contents. The only connection between the two was the electrical wiring connections and the less tangible connections of electrical controls, administration and supervision from one to the other. Or, similarly, the various aspects of the “network” in Auckland Gas Co as discussed by Gault J (at page 15,026): The fact that a particular physical thing realises its economic value only when used in conjunction with other “things” or business systems does not mean it is not to be regarded as a separate asset the replacement of which is on capital account. ... Whether the network is of gas reticulation pipes, electricity wires, telephone lines or computer links it is in each case an assembly of physical things. That they all interlink does not mean that only the whole satisfies a particular notion any more than do all the elements of a production line in a factory. Additionally, the fact that the vat is often owned separately by the dairy company – and presumably could be removed or replaced by that company – gives an indication that the milk vat is a separate asset to the milking plant. These considerations indicate that the milk storage vat is a separate asset distinct from the milking plant and dairy shed setting. Conclusion The milking plant satisfies the “entirety test” adopted in Lindsay and followed in Auckland Trotting Club, Auckland Gas Co, Poverty Bay Electric Power and Hawkes Bay Power. “Milking plant” includes all items of plant commencing with the cups attached to the cow and ending with the pipe from which the milk flows into the storage vat, together with those items making up the milk extraction and cleansing units. The milking plant is capable of being considered an “entirety by itself” and not merely a “subsidiary part” of the entire collection of plant found in a dairy shed. These other items of plant, e.g. the wash down unit, water heaters, and the storage vats are separate plant performing distinct, albeit related, functions. 13 Rotary dairy shed milking platforms Two main types of milking plant systems are the herringbone (the more conventional and cheaper) and the rotary. The latter is less common and more expensive, at least in terms of the initial set-up costs, but more efficient in that a platform system can handle and milk a larger number of cows more quickly. Here we look at whether the “rotary platform” and its associated machinery, is a single, stand-alone asset or part of the wider dairy shed complex. Rotary platforms come in two types: • Floating platforms, where the circular platform takes up virtually the entire area of the milking enclosure inside the dairy shed and floats on water. The whole platform, on which the cows and the operator stand during the milking process, constantly revolves during the milking cycle. Cows walk on to the platform through an entrance off the holding yard, to take the place vacated by the last milked cow that has left the platform at the exit race. The platform usually consists of a reinforced concrete pad, into which the blue galvanised steel pipe work used to enclose and separate the cows is set. The platform is rotated by an electric motor powering a rubber wheel, that in turn is in contact with the platform. • Conventional rotary herringbone platforms, where the platform consists only of an area on which the cows stand, while the operator stands in a pit in the open centre. Here, the platform and cows rotate around the operator during the milking process with the cows walking on and off through entry and exit points. The platform, generally made of high quality specially treated plate steel, rests on a series of rollers, with the pipe work (to enclose and separate the cows) welded or bolted to it. The platform is rotated by an electric motor usually driving (through belts and drive chains) two large drive wheels, making contact with steel railings on the underside of the platform. In deciding whether the rotary platform and associated machinery are distinct from, or part of, the dairy shed complex, both types of rotary platform are considered to be essentially the same. It will always be a question of fact, degree, and impression as to what is included or excluded in an entity or asset. It may also be relevant to ascertain whether the part is itself a separate item of plant or equipment which is distinguishable from the surrounding premises. This issue arose when the Court in Auckland Trotting considered whether the track lighting system formed part of the track or was a separate asset in its own right. The Court there concluded that it was separate (at page 979): Alternatively, Mr Barker submitted that the entirety of the “premises” comprises not only the race track itself but also the running rail and the floodlight standards. I am quite prepared to treat the running rail as an integral part of the track. Its inclusion would not influence the ultimate decision of this case one way or the other. As to the floodlight standards, there is not a great deal of evidence. It does appear that these floodlight standards were originally installed in 1958 at a cost of between £40,000 and £50,000. They were moved to their present positions during the year ended June 1960 at a cost of 14 £5,000. This is virtually all the information available to the Court. I infer that the floodlight standards are of considerable size and are erected at intervals in positions adjacent to the track itself. In these circumstances I am not satisfied that the floodlight standards should be regarded as forming a component part of “premises” which also include the track. Their cost and probable size suggest to my mind that as a matter of fact and degree they should be treated as a distinct and separate capital asset in the nature of plant or equipment. The mere fact that their purpose is to render the track useable as a night trotting track is not in itself sufficient to justify their inclusion along with the track as one entirety, for the same argument could be advanced in relation to various other buildings (such as stables) whose purpose is also ancillary to the use of the track, but which nevertheless are separate and distinct physical entities. Moller J. has held, on the evidence before him, that the physical thing which satisfies the notion of “premises” is the race track itself and “not any larger thing or aggregation of things of which it may be suggested to form part”. I see no basis on which this Court should interfere with that finding... From this it would appear to be relevant, in trying to distinguish items from the general premises, to take account of: • their physical position • whether they are integral to, or form a component part of, the premises (e.g. in the sense of a track rail to a track) • their movability • their size • their relative value. Conversely, the fact that an item’s function may be necessary in the use of the wider premises, does not in itself mean the item forms part of those wider premises – it may still be a distinct capital asset in the nature of plant or equipment. This issue is analogous to one considered by the Australian courts, i.e. the distinction between premises and plant for depreciation purposes under sections 53 and 54 of the former Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, in dealing with deductibility of repairs and depreciation. \[Note: This Act has been replaced by the completely rewritten Income Tax Assessment Act 1997: refer sections 25-10 and 42-15 respectively.\] Under these provisions, only “plant or articles” were depreciable property. This wording resulted in a body of Australian case law discussing the difference between “plant or articles” and “premises” (premises not being referred to in section 54(1)), and drawing on earlier UK decisions, e.g. Waratah Gypsum Pty. Ltd. v FCT (1965) 9 ATR 570; Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd. v FCT (1968) 10 ATR 481; J. Lyons & Co. Ltd. v Attorney-General \[1944\] 1 All ER 477; Jarrold v John Good & Sons Ltd. (1963) 40 TC 681; Moreton Central Sugar Mill Company Limited v CT (1967) 116 CLR 151; Wangaratta Woollen Mills Ltd v FCT (1969) 119 CLR 1; and IRC v Barclay, Curle & Co Ltd \[1969\] 1 All ER 732. From these cases it is possible to see that plant is generally distinct from the surroundings in which it is used by virtue of being: • a fixture, implement, chattel, or piece of machinery or apparatus that is actually used in the taxpayer’s business in the sense of being part of some process • something that is not merely part of the general setting in which a part of those operations is carried on. 15 A building or structure might be part of a taxpayer’s plant, but only where it is more than simply providing shelter or housing working equipment – it must play a part in the manufacturing or other processes of the taxpayer. It must be more than simply a static and permanent feature of the place in which a business may be carried on, having no other function than to provide a convenient stand for the performing of work in the business. In general, to form part of a taxpayer’s plant a building or structure must have some active role in the business, although not necessarily active in terms of having moving parts. These principles are not dissimilar to those previously set out as regards the identification of entireties or assets in the context of R&M issues. Taking the above into account, and looking at a typical dairy shed complex, it seems clear that the dairy shed is the “setting” or “premises” where the milking operations are carried out, and is not itself bound up with the plant or equipment used inside the shed (c.f. the approach taken in Barclay, Curle & Co Ltd as regards the concrete sides of the dry dock). A dairy shed typically consists of walls on some or all sides of the milking area to protect the milking equipment, operator, and cows from the elements during the milking process. The dairy shed is the “passive setting” for the milking process to be conducted within, and merely performs a “shelter” function. The dairy shed structure does not play an active part in the manufacturing (milking) process (as, for example, the dyehouse did in Wangaratta), but instead provides a protective cover for the plant, operators, and cows. It could be compared to the building cladding in Wangaratta which the court described (at page 11) as doing nothing more than exclude the elements. On this basis, the dairy shed structure is not “plant” but merely the “setting” for the milking process. The next question is whether the rotary platform is also part of the “setting”, or whether it is a separate asset in its own right. Having regard to the part the rotary platform plays in the milking process, it satisfies the definition of “plant” used by the above cases, i.e. machinery or fixtures used in carrying on an industrial process. The platform performs a positive function in the taxpayer’s pursuits and is not merely a passive setting for those activities. The platform holds the cows in the position necessary for them to be milked, and is an integral part of the milking process: its rotation can be halted and the rate of rotation varied according to the needs of the process. If it were unable to rotate, the milking process could not operate. The situation is somewhat analogous to the dry dock in the Barclay decision which was treated as being plant and not merely a building or structure. The dry dock in that case was a land based dock adjacent to a waterway and was formed by excavating a large “basin”, lined with concrete. The dry dock was used to hold the ship in place while inspections and repairs were carried out (c.f. the finding in Moreton Central Sugar Co that a pit in the ground designed for servicing locomotives was not part of the taxpayer’s plant). Also, a rotary platform is a physical thing satisfying a particular notion (Lindsay). The “particular notion” is the holding and positioning of cows for milking during the milk extraction cycle. In addition, it is possible to remove a platform and relocate it, giving weight to the concept of the separateness of the platform from its surroundings. 16 As noted above, a rotary platform consists of both a platform and a drive mechanism and associated equipment. Given this, it might be suggested that the platform is a separate asset from the drive mechanism, etc. However, the more logical approach is to view them as one physical thing which satisfies a particular notion. This is because of the close proximity of the two items – they are physically linked by the drive wheels – and the fact that the platform cannot perform any function without the motor that drives it. The drive mechanism is an integral part of the rotary platform, as opposed to simply being another item used in conjunction with it – as is the milking plant. In this way, the rotary platform might be compared with assets such as a lift or escalator in a commercial building, a chair lift on a ski field, or a baggage handling conveyor at an airport. These other assets with their respective drive motors and mechanisms are each treated as one complete asset and not separated into lift compartment (or chair) and lift motor, escalator “steps” and drive mechanism, or conveyor and drive mechanism. The rotary platform does not form part of, and is distinct from, the milking plant and the other equipment within the dairy shed. Although, the platform has some physical links to certain parts of the milking plant, it does so only to provide structural support for those items of plant. Conclusion The rotary milking platform is a separate asset from the dairy shed complex, the “premises” or “setting” where the milking operation is conducted, and is distinct from other pieces of equipment used in the milking process, e.g. the milking plant. The drive machinery forms a subsidiary and integral part of the platform and is therefore part of the larger asset. The milking platform (including its drive mechanism, etc.) is a physical thing forming a particular notion, i.e. the rotation of cows to assist in their efficient milking. It is physically distinct from both the dairy shed in which it is housed and from the equipment used to actually milk the cows. This conclusion is supported by the fact that platforms may be removed and sold as a single asset. It is also a significant item when compared with the other equipment used in a rotary milking operation. Dairy shed, yard and surrounds It has been concluded that the milking plant (including the cleansing unit) is a separate, single asset. The same applies to a number of other items used in the milking process, i.e. the wash down unit, water heaters, milk storage vats. It has also been concluded that the rotary platform and associated drive mechanism together form a separate asset. As these assets comprise essentially all the equipment used in the dairy shed, it follows that the balance is the dairy shed itself. In line with the authorities which considered the distinction between premises and plant, the dairy shed may be viewed as being the “setting” in which the milking operation is conducted, rather than part of the process itself. The dairy shed provides shelter, and houses the milking plant and other equipment used in the milking process. It is acknowledged that for a herringbone system it might be argued that the dairy shed, in the sense of the barriers which are set in the concrete floor of the shed and formed in a herringbone shape to hold the cows ready for milking, has an “active” 17 role in the milking process. But even if this were correct, which might render the dairy shed “plant”, this does not change the conclusion that it is a separate asset from the milking plant and other equipment. The distinction between setting and plant is useful in terms of drawing a distinction between different aspects of a taxpayer’s business operation. However, it does not necessarily follow that where the setting is found to be plant it is indistinguishable from other items of plant. Having determined that the dairy shed is a separate asset, issues then arise in identifying exactly what makes up the dairy shed complex. In particular, as to whether the concrete base of the shed and surrounding yards, and the pipe work railings generally used to enclose the yard which adjoins the shed, form part of the “dairy shed” or are separate items in their own right. This is particularly important because it has been suggested that: • the concrete is “hardstanding”: listed as a depreciable land improvement in its own right by virtue of the definition of “depreciable property” and Schedule 16, and • the pipe work railing surrounds of the yard are fences, in terms of section DO 3, or section DO 4 (and Schedule 7). Is the dairy shed yard part of the dairy shed or a separate asset? Initially, it is necessary to look at the layout and construction of a typical dairy shed complex. The dairy shed yard (sometimes called the “milking” or “holding” yard) is the enclosed area attached to the dairy shed, and extends beyond the entrance and exit of the bails of the shed where the cows are held before and after milking. The base of the yard is usually a concrete pad. The yard is generally bounded by galvanised steel piping uprights which are embedded into the concrete at intervals with either piping rails, or a top piping rail and stranded heavy gauge wire at lower levels. The piping rails and stranded wire link the uprights to form the barrier to contain the cows within the yard. There is usually a gate where the cows enter the yard from the stock race to keep them in the yard. As well, or instead, there may be a moving or revolving gate that keeps the cows moving towards the front of the yard and entrance into the shed proper. The revolving gate (usually found in circular yards) can also be used to keep two herds sharing the same shed separate. The gates are usually made of piping similar to the yard surrounds. Water pressure or a small electric motor operates the moving gates. In some dairy sheds instead of a moving gate, an overhead set of wires that carry a small electric charge are lowered behind the last cows, moving them forward by an electric-powered pulley system. In the case of a herringbone shed, the concrete pad and piping barriers usually continue uninterrupted from the yard into and through the shed proper to form the base of the shed, the bails for holding the cows, and the outlet at the other end. With the rotary shed, the pad and piping while also usually continuing into the shed itself, generally have a natural break at the edge of the revolving platform. It has been concluded that the dairy shed forms the “setting” or “premises” for the milking operations. The dairy shed yard is similarly part of the setting for the milking 18 operations. However, although part of the setting, it does not automatically follow that the yard is part of the dairy shed premises, with the shed and yard together constituting one single asset. To be so regarded, the yard must be an integral part of the dairy shed “premises” or an “entirety” with it and not a separate asset. Based on the reasoning in Lindsay, the dairy shed yard and dairy shed must be together “a physical thing which satisfies a particular notion”. Generally, the dairy shed yard adjoins the dairy shed. As already outlined, usually the concrete pad forms both the surface of the yard and the floor of the shed. Even with rotary sheds the concrete pad also forms part of the base or support for the rotary platform. Similarly, the piping barriers usually continue from the yard, through the shed, to also form the bails for holding the cows, and the outlet at the other end. Their uprights are set into the concrete base of both the yard and shed, except for the rotary shed where the piping making up the bails is attached to the rotary platform. Many sheds, particularly of the herringbone type, have several open sides, giving rise to even less of a division between the shed and the yard. Therefore, the “particular notion” satisfied by the shed and yard is the provision of the setting for the milking operation. In other words the dairy shed complex, i.e. the shed and surrounding yards, is the premises where milking takes place, enclosing the cows and plant necessarily involved in that process. With the rotary shed, the integrated nature of the yard and shed proper is arguably less clear because the platform forms the base on which the cows stand for milking – rather than the floor of the shed. However, the floor of the shed also forms a support for the platform, again suggesting that the yard and shed form one asset. Further support for the conclusion that the yards form part of the dairy shed complex is found in the Dairy Industry Regulations 1990 that define a “farm dairy” as: (a) Means a dairy where milking animals are milked; and (b) Subject to paragraph (c) of this definition, includes - (i) Any stockyard, milking yard, stable, stall, or shed associated with a farm dairy; and (ii) Any dairy associated with a farm dairy where milk extracted in the farm dairy is collected, filtered, deposited, separated, cooled, or stored, or treated or stabilised to prepare for transport; but (c) Does not include a place (not being a dairy where milking animals are milked) where milk is processed, or treated, otherwise than by being collected, filtered, separated, stirred, or cooled, or treated or stabilised to prepare for transport: Stock races A further point is whether it is possible to distinguish the dairy shed and its yard from its surroundings; in particular the races leading to and from the complex. The stock race is the track or path along which the cows walk from the paddocks to the dairy shed (and vice versa), ending at the entrance to the dairy shed holding yard. This race may run for some considerable distance through the farm and/or along farm road 19 frontages. It is designed to confine the herd during its daily treks to and from the dairy shed, and prevent undue damage to pastures. The race may be constructed of a variety of materials. The surface is often shingle, although other materials such as compacted crushed limestone or pumice rock may be used. Part of the race near the dairy shed yard entrance or exit may occasionally have a concrete surface. The race is bordered on either side by a fence that is generally of post and wire construction. The point at which the race ends and the dairy shed yard begins is fairly easily to see. This division exists not only physically but also in terms of functionality. The race is a form of road or path used for the herd to walk to and from the dairy shed complex. On the other hand, the dairy shed complex including the yard is the actual setting for milking. The generally used construction materials and the purpose of the race distinguish it from the dairy shed complex. Although the race may be part of the general setting for dairy farming, this does not make it part of the actual milking operation. Its function can be compared with that of a forestry company road for transporting logs to the sawmill. Such a road is a separate asset from the sawmill and mill yard itself. It is adjacent to, rather than an integral part of, any other assets which together make up the wider premises. Similarly, this might be likened to the racing track that formed a separate asset within the wider racing complex in Auckland Trotting or the taxpayer’s premises in Case N8, of which the concrete-making batching plant formed only part. Is the yard or any part of it “hardstanding” in terms of Schedule 16? Under section EG 1(1), a taxpayer is allowed a deduction in an income year for any depreciable property owned by the taxpayer at any time during an income year. “Depreciable property” is defined in section OB 1 as: in relation to any taxpayer, - (a) Means any property of that taxpayer which might reasonably be expected in normal circumstances to decline in value while used or available for use by persons - (i) In deriving gross income; or (ii) In carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income; but (b) Does not include - ... (ii) Land (excluding buildings and other fixtures and such improvements as are listed in Schedule 16): ... (vi) Property the cost of which is allowed as a deduction under any of sections BD 2(1)(b)(i) and (ii), DJ 6, DJ 11, DL 6, DM 1, DO 3, DO 6, DO 7, DZ 1, DZ 3, EO 5, EZ 5, and EZ 6, or by virtue of an amortisation or other similar deduction allowed under any section of this Act such as sections DJ 9, DL 2, DO 4, DO 5, and EO 2, other than sections EG 1 to EG 15 and section EG 18: ... 20 (viii) Property the cost of which was or is allowed as a deduction in any income year to any other taxpayer under any of sections DO 3, DZ 2, DZ 3 and DZ 4 of this Act (or any of sections 127, 127A and 128 of the Income Tax Act 1976 or sections 119, 119D and 119G of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954): (Emphasis added) In this way depreciation is expressly not permitted for land (because land, as such, does not depreciate: see Case G11 (1985) 7 NZTC 1,035). However, certain land improvements listed in Schedule 16 are depreciable. In addition, certain land improvement/development expenditure incurred in respect of farming, agriculture, aquaculture or forestry is deductible under the various amortisation provisions, including section DO 4. Land improvements qualifying for depreciation listed in Schedule 16 include “hardstanding”. The schedule of economic depreciation rates set out in Determination 1: “Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 1” (see Appendix to Tax Information Bulletin Vol. Four, No. 9, April 1993, pp. 26–104) lists the basic economic depreciation rates for all depreciable property. Hardstanding is included in the “buildings and structures” section as having an estimated useful life of 50 years and DV rate of 4% or SL rate of 3%. No definition of “hardstanding” is provided in the Act. The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1993) includes the following definition: n. 1 hard standing an area of hard material for a vehicle to stand on when not in use. It is understood that the rationale behind the reference to hardstanding in Schedule 16 was to provide for areas described as hardstanding within certain industry groups – such areas essentially being concrete or bitumen based “pads” on the ground, e.g. wharf tarmac, car pads, etc. The focus was on non-farming industries, but the intention was not to exclude hardstanding where it arose in a farming context, provided that a deduction was not available elsewhere under the Act, e.g. section DO 4. (This approach is borne out to some extent by an example included in TIB Vol. Five, No. 12 (May 1994) regarding the distinction between the “amortisation provisions” for farming, agriculture, forestry, etc., (including the precursor to section DO 4) and the general depreciation regime.) Hardstanding is referred to in passing in Case N8 in the context of the various valuations of the premises (to determine if there had been an increase in capital value) undertaken by the parties: The Z plant including the batching controls had a replacement cost value of $1,142,500 and an indemnity value as at that date of $1,087,200. For insurance purposes Mr A valued the Z plant at 31 March 1988, at $1,000,000. In exhibit 3 he estimated the total replacement cost of the Z plant at $1,918,000. That excludes siteworks, drainage, hardstanding and building permit. Areas around a farm may generally be thought of as being hardstanding in the sense that they have been made firm (usually by concreting) to prevent animals or vehicles from creating a “bog”. Such areas might include parts or all of certain farm roads and tracks, areas adjacent to yards or farmhouses. However, these do not include the concrete base of a dairy shed yard. In the usual case there is no demarcation between the concrete base of the dairy shed and the 21 concrete base of the adjoining yard. In addition, the pipe work is embedded in the concrete base of the yard and typically continues seamlessly inside the shed. It is also reasonable to assume that the concrete for the entire complex was laid at the same time that the shed was erected. The better view is that the yard, including its concrete base, is part of the dairy shed complex. Two further supporting reasons for this view are: • the items listed in Schedule 16 are generally all “free-standing” assets, not usually situated immediately adjacent to, or as closely associated with, a building or buildings in the way the yard is in this case, e.g. bores and wells, bridges, culverts, dams, fences, reservoirs, retaining walls, roads, spillways, swimming pools, tanks, and tunnels. (Chimneys are perhaps the only item in the list more likely to be connected to a building. However, given that the Schedule is designed to include items which would otherwise be excluded from the regime as fixtures adhered to land, the better view is that the reference to chimneys is intended to cover free- standing, rather than integrated, chimneys such as those used in businesses involving the use of furnaces.) • feeding platforms and feeding yards are separately referred to in Part A of Schedule 7 that relates to section DO 4. These platforms and yards often comprise concrete bases. It is reasonable to assume that these bases would not be dealt with separately under the general depreciation regime, suggesting that the base is an integral part of the yard, to be dealt with along with the yard. By analogy, the same reasoning applies to the concrete base of a dairy shed yard. Are pipe railings part of the dairy shed yard? Typically, in a dairy shed complex the yard adjoins the dairy shed and the concrete pad forms both the surface of the yard and the floor of the shed. The piping barriers are usually continuous, and have their uprights set into the concrete base of both the yard and shed. Inside a rotary shed the piping is attached to the rotary platform. In Auckland Trotting, the Court of Appeal considered whether the rails forming the sides of the replaced track were an integral part of the track: concluding that they were. This was distinct from the lighting system that was merely adjacent to the track: a logical distinction as the track could not function as a running track without the rails to contain the horses. The lighting system, however, performed a wholly separate function – principally to provide for night racing. The sides of the yards are considered similar to the rails of the racing track – they form an integral part of the yarding system, whose function is to contain the cows before milking. A yard would not serve its purpose without that feature. Whether items associated with a building were part of the building setting, or a separate item such as plant, was considered in Case 101 (1964) 11 CTBR (N.S.) 587. In that case the Board, in relation to pipeline connections of a bakery building to a water supply, said (at page 603): Rather are such things commonly regarded as part of the “setting” of a building - being such things so much appurtenant or incident to a building simply as a building that they cannot appropriately be described as “plant”. ... They are, I think, fairly described as an integral part of a building as premises from which, without disintegration or disconnection (sic) they are inseparable. 22 In the case of the dairy shed it can be argued that the pipe work surrounds of the yard and the pipe work bails are so much “appurtenant” to the dairy shed building as to be an integral part of it. They are inseparable from the yard. To remove them would require breaking up the concrete securing them into the yard. This suggests that they are not a separate asset but part of the yard, i.e. the pipe railings are lodged into and form an integral part of the function of the yard. Similarly, in Barclay a majority of the House of Lords were satisfied that the sides of the dry dock, along with the associated machinery for winching etc., formed one asset. The majority were not satisfied that the two constituents of the dry dock facility could be separately treated. In addition, in some situations the pipe work railings may extend into the dairy shed, providing even stronger support for the conclusion that the railings are part of the cowshed complex. Are the pipe railings fences? It has been suggested that the pipe work railings surrounding the dairy shed yard are “fences”, for the purposes of sections DO 3 or DO 4. If the pipe work is accepted as being a fence for the purposes of section DO 3, all expenditure on fences is fully deductible and there is no need to consider the capital/revenue tests. If not a fence, those tests are still applicable. Section DO 3 states: Any taxpayer who in any income year is engaged in any farming or agricultural business on any land in New Zealand shall be allowed a deduction of the amount of any expenditure incurred by the taxpayer in that year, being expenditure that is not deductible otherwise than under this section or under section DO 4, in – ... (g) The construction on the land of fences for agricultural purposes, including the purchase of wire or wire netting for the purpose of making new or existing fences rabbit proof. Section DO 4 allows a deduction, on an annual depreciated basis, for expenditure incurred on certain land improvements specified in Part A of Schedule 7: (1) Any taxpayer who carries on any farming or agricultural business on any land owned by that taxpayer in New Zealand shall in any income year other than the income year in which that taxpayer sells or otherwise disposes of that land, be allowed a deduction in respect of any expenditure of any of the kinds specified in Part A of Schedule 7 incurred by the taxpayer or by any other taxpayer in preparing or otherwise developing that land, and being expenditure which is of benefit to the business in that income year. Item 13 of Part A of Schedule 7 states: 1. The construction on the land of fences, including the purchase of wire or wire netting for the purpose of making new or existing fences rabbit proof. Schedule 7 sets out the percentage of diminished value of expenditure allowed as a deduction: the percentage stipulated for item 13 is 10%. Schedule 7 also refers to: 23 15. The construction on the land of feeding platforms, feeding yards, plunge sheep dips, or self- feeding ensilage pits. No definition of the word “fence” is provided in the Act. The same phrase as appears in section DO 3, and Schedule 7, is used in section DZ 2 dealing with expenditure on land used for forestry purposes, and DZ 3 dealing with certain farming and agricultural expenditure for the 1990-1991 income year and earlier (it includes some items in section DO 3 and some additional items). “Fences” are also referred to in section DZ 4 which deals with expenditure incurred by persons engaged in aquaculture in the 1990-1991 income year or earlier. The Oxford English Dictionary (2nd ed., 1992) includes the following definition: Fence n...5. a. An enclosure or barrier (e.g. a hedge, wall, railing, palisade, etc.) along the boundary of a field, park, yard or any place which it is desired to defend from intruders. sunk fence: one placed along the bottom of a depression in the ground; sometimes applied to a ditch. Often preceded by a qualifying word, as: gun-, pale-, quick-, ring-, snake-, wire-, etc. fence, for which see those words. The Concise Oxford Dictionary (9th ed., 1995) states: Fence n. 1 a barrier or railing or other upright structure enclosing an area of ground, esp to prevent or control access. Black’s Law Dictionary (6th ed., 1990) states: Fence: A hedge, structure, or partition, erected for the purpose of enclosing a piece of land or to divide a piece of land into distinct portions, or to separate two contiguous estates. An enclosure about a field or other space, or about any object; especially an enclosing structure of wood, iron or other materials, intended to prevent intrusion from without or straying from within. Halsbury’s Laws of England states: Although fences are frequently used to mark the situation of boundaries, none the less they are primarily guards against intrusion, or barriers to prevent persons or animals straying out, and therefore in this sense the term includes not only hedges, banks, and walls but also ditches. The Fencing Act 1978 includes the following definitions: “Fence” means a fence, whether or not continuous or extending along the whole boundary separating the lands of adjoining occupiers; and includes all gates, culverts, and channels that are part of or are incidental to a fence; and also includes any natural or artificial watercourse or live fence, or any ditch or channel or raised ground that serves as a dividing fence: “Adequate fence” means a fence that, as to its nature, condition, and state of repair, is reasonably satisfactory for the purpose that it serves or is intended to serve: The Fencing of Swimming Pools Act 1987 states: “Fence” means a fence that complies with the requirements of the \[building code in force under the Building Act 1991 in respect of swimming pools subject to this Act;\] and includes any part of a building and any gates or doors forming part of the fence; and “fenced” has a corresponding meaning: 24 The Impounding Act 1955 states: “Fence” means an adequate fence within the meaning of the Fencing Act 1978; and “fenced land” means land enclosed within such a fence: The nature of “fences” has been considered by the courts. In the old case of Ellis v Arnison (1822) 1 B&C 70, 107 ER 27 the Court considered whether a ditch was a fence according to an Inclosure Act. The Court held that they could not “say that a ditch may not be in legal construction a fence”. In argument it was stated that the “strict definition of the term ‘fence’ means nothing more than a sufficient guard to fend or keep off, or shut out.” (pp. 27, 28). In Nussey v Provincial Bill Posting Company and Eddison \[1909\] 1 Ch 734, the Court held unanimously that the erection of a permanent advertising hoarding along the boundary of the plaintiff’s premises was a fence in breach of the relevant fencing covenant. In Urban Housing Co v Oxford City Council \[1940\] 1 Ch 70, the Court rejected (at page 81) the proposition that “the phrase ‘fence or other enclosure’” would not include a wall. However, in Lahey v Hartford Fire Insurance Co \[1968\] 1 OR 727 the opposite was found. That case involved a claim on a fire insurance policy for damage caused to a retaining wall after a fire in a nearby building. The insurance policy covered buildings that included fixtures, fences, and garden improvements. The Court held that the wall was not a fence as the parties when entering into the insurance policy had meant fence to mean “a structure which encloses wholly or partially some piece of property so as to impede ingress or egress. It may be composed of anything so long as it creates a line of obstacle serving this purpose.” (at page 728) The wall was not a fence according to this definition, but rather “a retaining wall to prevent the subsidence of 654 into 656.” (at page 729.) From the above it would appear that the ordinary meaning of “fence” is very broad and essentially involves: • Any enclosure, barrier, railing or other upright structure (including a hedge, wall, palisade, or ditch) situated along the boundary of a field, park, yard, or any place, especially designed to divide a piece of land or an area into distinct portions and/or to prevent or control access; that is, such a structure intended to prevent intrusion from without or straying from within. It appears that it may be made of any material, e.g. wood, iron, or other materials, as long as it creates a line of obstacle serving this purpose. As the pipe work railings surrounding a dairy shed yard could be described as a “barrier or railing situated along the boundary of a yard designed to prevent straying from within”, it is acknowledged that the pipe work railings are fences in the broad sense of that word. However, because “fence” has such an expansive ordinary meaning, it is necessary to consider the legislative background to the enactment of the precursors to sections DO 3 and DO 4 to determine whether it is reasonable to conclude that Parliament intended such a broad meaning to apply. 25 The background to sections DO 3 and DO 4 can be traced back to the 1950s and legislation designed to provide incentives to the farming industry. The provision for the deduction of certain development expenditure was first mentioned in the 1950 Budget. It was noted there: As an incentive to increased primary production and a direct encouragement to the development of farm land the Government proposes that certain developmental expenditure be allowed as a deduction for taxation purposes. Under this provision expenditure such as the cost of clearing scrub, weeds, and other growth detrimental to the land and also the cost of cultivating and seeding additional pastures may be claimed as a deduction. The Government will also make provision to enable farmers actively engaged in farming to claim as a deduction for taxation an amount not exceeding £200 in any income year for expenditure incurred in such items as draining, making fences rabbit-proof, access tracks, earthen dams, repairing flood or erosion damage, and constructing landing strips to facilitate aerial top dressing. (Emphasis added) These proposals were included in the Land and Income Tax Amendment (No. 2) Act 1950. Section 9 of that Act read: 9.(1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in section eighty of the principal Act, any taxpayer engaged in any farming or agricultural business on any land in New Zealand shall, in calculating the assessable income derived by him from that business in any income year be entitled to deduct - ... (b) Any expenditure incurred in that business during the income year, and not deductible otherwise than under this section, in- ... (vii) The construction on the land of fences, including the purchase of wire or wire netting for the purpose of making new or existing fences rabbit proof ... There were two parts to this section – the first part gave a complete deduction for certain expenditure, the second gave a deduction up to £200 – fences were included in the second part. The Hansard reports of the second reading to the bill state: Clause 9 gives effect to another proposal in the Budget with regard to the allowance to taxpayers who are primary producers, of certain developmental expenditure as a deduction for income- tax purposes...Some of that expenditure would be deductible in the ordinary course as a recurring expense, but when land is newly acquired or is being broken in for a farm the existing law would regard such expenditure as being of a capital nature and not deductible. The underlying idea of this clause is to give encouragement to the development of second-class land, with consequent increase in production. (Emphasis added) Prior to 1963, the upper limit of £200 for fencing and other developmental expenditure had been increased to £400. In the 1963 Budget it was noted: Our best prospect of expanding agricultural production in the immediate future is to increase expenditure on the development of existing farms....farm investment and other development expenditure have fallen...To reverse this trend and to lay the foundations for continued growth of output, expenditure which will raise the productive capacity of our farms must be stimulated. Tax Incentives for Farm Development 26 It has been decided therefore to treat all types of farm development expenditure that may be charged against income for tax purposes on a more liberal basis... The present limit of £400 in respect of expenditure on fencing, drainage, irrigation, and similar projects will be abolished for three years....The limit of £400, which was necessarily arbitrary, has tended to restrain development of the all-important marginal hill country which often requires large expenditure to bring it to full production. (Emphasis added) In this way the deduction limit of £400 was abolished, initially for three years but subsequently regularly extended. Nothing further happened in this area until 1986. In that year the precursor to section DO4 (section 128A) was first inserted into the Income Tax Act 1976 by the Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 4) 1986, and applied from 1 April 1987. The policy behind the introduction of this section is noted in Hansard: Taxation Reform Bill (No. 2), Introduction. Minister of Finance. Clauses 6, 12,13, and 15 deal with farm development expenditure and forestry taxation. The current deduction allowable for farming and forestry development expenditure is to be phased out and replaced with a new depreciation regime on land improvements. Taxation Reform Bill (No. 2), second reading. Minister of Finance. Part I of the Bill also deals with the phase-out of farm development expenditure. It will be replaced by a new depreciation scheme, thus providing the same treatment of farm assets that is allowed to assets in other sectors. The Bill introduces a neutral tax system that will enable farmers to get on with the business of farming and make investments for the real reasons, without being attracted by the subsidies and concessional tax provisions that distort the tax base and force up costs and land values. At the same time as section 128A was introduced, section 127 (now section DO3) was amended so as to phase out farm development expenditure deductions by April 1991. However, this action was reversed by the Tax Reform Bill (No. 3) 1990. \[Note: The Tax Reform (No. 3) Bill was introduced in December 1990 and taken through the House in 1991 during which time it appears to have been referred to as the Tax Reform Bill 1991.\] Although reversing the decision to completely phase out deductions for development expenditure, the Government was also keen to reduce the various incentives and deductions previously available to the primary production sector. In the context of the deduction for fencing, the intention seems to have been to reinstate a full deduction, but only when the fencing was for the purposes of subdividing land. The document “Introductory Copy: Tax Reform Bill 1991” included the following statements: Clause 21 amends section 127 \[now section DO 3\] of the Act to allow full deductibility of certain types of expenditure incurred on land used for farming and agricultural purposes, such as...the fencing of land for the purpose of dividing use of the land. The amending clause read: 21 Certain expenditure on land used for farming or agricultural purposes -.... (A1) Any taxpayer engaged in any farming or agricultural business on any land in New Zealand shall, in calculating the assessable income derived from that business in the income year 27 commencing on the 1 st day of April 1991 or in any subsequent year, be entitled to a deduction of the amount of any expenditure incurred by the taxpayer in that year, being expenditure that is not deductible otherwise than under this section or under section 128A of this Act, in- ... (f) The fencing of the land for the purpose of dividing the use of that land. In December 1990 the Minister of Revenue had said in his introductory speech: Clause 21 will provide immediate deductibility for expenditure incurred on...the fencing of land for subdivision. Under the present legislation, from 1 April 1991 those items of expenditure would have been required to be capitalised and written down by way of depreciation in accordance with the thirteenth schedule to the Act. (Emphasis added) The Report to Finance and Expenditure Select Committee on Submissions on the Taxation Reform Bill (No. 3) noted that the following submissions had been made in relation to clause 21: (n) As the manifesto proposal that the fencing of land for subdivision, or as in the legislation “the dividing the use of that land” is not clear so should just read fencing. (o) To provide that all fencing of land should be deductible, such as holding paddocks and boundary fencing as the phrase fencing for “dividing the use of the land” is unclear. The report commented that: (n) and (o): It is agreed that the fencing deduction provision is not clear. It is recommended that the provision be clarified by referring to the construction of a fence thus excluding temporary fencing such as electric fences. However the issue of subdividing the land cause most concern. It is not clear whether this includes boundary fences dividing land between farms, only new fences dividing existing paddocks, whether divided paddocks must be put to different uses, or whether replacing an existing fence with a new one will satisfy the provision. It is considered that the problem can best be addressed by amending paragraph (f) to- “(f) The construction on the land of fences”. (Emphasis added) The report went on to recommend: (b) that all construction on the land of fences should be deductible as the current proposal of only fences subdividing the use of land is unworkable During the Bill’s second reading, the Minister of Revenue discussed the issues raised by the submissions: The proposed amended section 127 in clause 13 implements a National Party policy commitment to allow immediate deductibility for certain development expenditure on farms....There is a problem in that it is hard to make a distinction between capital and revenue. When a farmer puts up a fence it could be a new fence, the replacement of an existing fence, or, it could be a considerable improvement on what was there before, in which case part of it could be regarded as capital. But that distinction is completely impractical to make in the real world and for that reason we have decided to allow it to be completely deductible. (Emphasis added) In the third reading the Minister of Revenue clarified that “genuinely capital” expenditure would continue to be treated as such: 28 Changes were made to the categories of development expenditure. In practice those are causing considerable problems, which result from the difficulty in so many cases of making a distinction between capital expense and revenue expense. That was not clear under the old rules, and this rule should clarify the matter once and for all. Items that are genuinely capital expenditure, such as sheep-yards and covers, frames for crops, and so on, will continue to be treated as they were under the old Act. (Emphasis added) Section 127 as enacted read: (A1) Any taxpayer engaged in any farming or agricultural business on any land in New Zealand shall, in calculating the assessable income derived from that business in the income year commencing on the 1st day of April 1991 or in any subsequent year, be entitled to a deduction of the amount of any expenditure incurred by the taxpayer in that year, being expenditure that is not deductible otherwise than under this section or under section 128A of this Act, in - ... (g) The construction on the land of fences for agricultural purposes, including the purchase of wire or wire netting for the purpose of making new or existing fences rabbit-proof. Notwithstanding these amendments to section 127, section 128A (now section DO 4) continued to provide depreciable rates for certain types of land improvements, including fencing. This was to ensure that taxpayers who had moved to treating certain land improvements under that provision, rather than under section 127, could continue to do so. It was also because section 127 was narrower than section 128A – the former only referring to fencing for agricultural purposes. The wording of section 127 as regards fencing was not altered with the enactment of the Income Tax Act 1994. From this background it is considered that the original intention behind the precursors to section DO 3 and DO 4 was to promote the development of unutilised and/or unproductive (“second-class”) farming land. The flavour of the Hansard and Budget statement comments from 1950 is that of opening up pastoral land, e.g. clearing scrub, weeds, cultivating and seeding, draining, access tracks, earthen dams, repairing flood or erosion damage, and constructing landing strips for top dressing aircraft, so as to develop newly acquired or unbroken land. This culminated in legislation that referred to “the construction on the land of fences, including the purchase of wire or wire netting for the purpose of making new or existing fences rabbit proof”. Arguably, the reference to “on the land” tends to confirm this focus on opening up and developing grazing land, rather than simply any development of farming land. The reference to rabbit-proofing new or existing fences also indicates a focus on fences used for dividing open land. Arguably, the 1963 Budget Statement comments also focus on “development” of land with references to breaking in marginal hill country. However, by 1991 it appears that the legislation had broadened to permit deductions for certain capital costs involved in farming, with the emphasis not necessarily being on the development of new or difficult land. The government of the day’s aim seems to have been on limiting deductions for fencing to those relating to subdividing land, but this proved to be too difficult a task and wording almost identical to that used in the past was enacted. However, it does not appear that the problem was seen as being a choice between giving deductions for a broad range of barriers that farmers had treated as being fences, and conventional fences, but rather the types of conventional fencing to include, i.e. only those which divided paddocks versus other fences such as boundary and 29 holding paddock fences. Again, although far from conclusive, the focus seems to have been on fences used to surround open land. Arguably, this is borne out to some degree by the comments made about “sheep yards”, apparently thought of as a distinct matter, and the fact that Schedule 13 at the time separately referred to “feeding platforms” and “feeding yards”. As discussed, “fences” is not defined and has a common meaning potentially wide enough to encompass the pipe work. However, on balance the better view is that it does not apply here for the following reasons: • The reference to “construction on the land” tends to suggest that Parliament had conventional fencing in mind, i.e. free-standing fences made of wood and wire used principally as paddock boundaries. This is supported by the legislative history of the provision, and particularly the early focus on open land development. It is also supported by the reference to rabbit-proofing – something which would be generally unnecessary in the context of a concrete based yard such as a milking shed yard – involving wire and wire netting. • This view is supported to some extent by exactly the same wording being used in section DZ 2 in the context of forestry, where it might be reasonable to expect that fencing would be of the conventional type, and not involve yards of any description. • That Parliament did not have yards as such in mind, i.e. that it did not view them in some way as being a collection of fences, is also apparent from the 1991 Hansard references to sheep yards, and the fact that Schedule 7 and its precursors all refer separately to feeding yards. • There is also the practical difficulty of isolating expenditure on the pipe work from the general costs of constructing a milking shed. It seems unreasonable to assume that Parliament meant for farmers to separate the cost of the pipe work from the total (depreciable) cost of the dairy shed complex, especially where, as seen, such pipe work may run inside the shed and/or form a part of the infra- structure by supporting the milking machinery. The yard will also comprise any gates (including the backing gate) forming part of the pipe work structure. The motorised drive unit for the backing gate is also part of the yard. The cost of replacing the motor unit with one of the same capacity will be on revenue account. This is because the motor unit is only a minor part of the total dairy shed complex. Conclusion The dairy shed complex (building and yard) is the asset. The concrete base of the yard and supporting pipe work including bails and rails and any gates, are part of and are integral to the overall complex. The cost of their construction should be capitalised to the cost of the shed. The dairy shed complex is distinct from the stock races. The race generally abuts the dairy shed yard, but serves a distinct function: to provide a hardened track along which the cows walk to and from the dairy shed. 30 It is not accepted that the concrete base of the dairy shed yard is hardstanding, and thereby separately depreciable. The better view is that the reference to hardstanding in Schedule 16 is to free-standing concreted or other hardened areas used for standing animals or vehicles. In this situation the concrete base of the yard forms an integral part of that yard: itself part of the dairy shed complex. This is consistent with the treatment of concrete-based feeding platforms and yards, which are classed as complete assets rather than in-part consisting of hardstanding. Separate expensing for the pipe work, bails and rails, in terms of section DO 3, is not available. Although it is accepted that the word “fence” has a wide ordinary meaning, it is necessary to take into account the context in which the word is used in the legislation, the nature of a dairy shed, views expressed in cases regarding the integrated nature or entirety of assets, and the legislative background. Given these considerations, on balance, the pipe work forms part of the dairy shed asset itself and is not a “fence” under section DO 3 or section DO 4. Undergrounding electricity reticulation to dairy sheds In the late 1980s as part of the electricity supply industry reforms, ownership of most electricity supply lines running from the pole on farmers’ and other landowners’ road boundaries to farm buildings, passed to the landowners at no cost. Since that time farmers have generally been responsible for all costs of: maintaining the lines on their property, installing any new lines or extending existing lines, and/or placing the lines underground. This category of expenditure therefore relates to the electricity reticulation system running from the edge of a farmer’s property to, among other buildings, the dairy shed. The issue is whether this system can be seen as being a separately identifiable asset or entirety in its own right, or if in this context it forms part of the dairy shed or other farm buildings. As discussed, in identifying an asset it is important to identify “a physical thing which satisfies a particular notion.” The focus is on a “physical thing”, rather than the operational significance or the economic value of the subject matter. The fact that a particular physical thing realises its economic value only when used in conjunction with other “things” or business systems, does not mean it is not to be regarded as a separate asset the replacement of which is on capital account. It will always be a question of fact, degree, and impression as to what is included or excluded in an entity or asset. The focus is, however, on finding a significant physical asset that will either function by itself or is clearly divisible in size or function from other assets that make up the premises or business of the taxpayer. An electricity reticulation system situated on a farmer’s land is a distinct physical thing satisfying a particular notion, i.e. the supply of electricity to the farm. Although the lines, whether underground or overground, will be joined to the dairy shed (and other buildings), they do not form an integral part of those buildings in the way that the yard or pipe work does. The lines are both physically distinct from the building and perform a distinct function, i.e. the supply of electricity. The authorities show that the fact that the reticulation system only realises its economic value when used in 31 conjunction with other assets, does not mean that it is not a separate asset in its own right. For example, Goddard J in Hawkes Bay Power rejected (at page 13,701) the taxpayer’s argument that its total reticulation system constituted the relevant asset, rather than just the urban residential distribution system, because none of the constituent components of those systems could function alone. Part A of Schedule 7 also tends to confirm this approach, in that it lists the cost of erecting electric power lines or telephone lines as a separate item. The fact that, until the electricity industry reforms, electricity lines from farm boundaries to farm buildings were the property of the local electrical supply authority is also indicative of the lines being a separate asset, not forming part of the dairy shed or any other building asset. In Case N8 the wiring between the batching plant and the administration sections of the premises were referred to: Bathgate J concluding that this “link” did not make the two assets one entirety. His Honour did not however comment on the status of the wiring itself, i.e. whether it stood alone or formed part of the two entities he had identified (at page 3,070): I consider the supervisor’s office, the dispatch office and the control room, which were all housed in a separate and detached building from the ground bins, elevators and tower, to be a separate and distinct entity from the ground bins, elevators and tower plus its contents. The only connection between the two were the electrical wiring connections and the less tangible connections of electrical controls, administration and supervision from one to the other. (Emphasis added) It is acknowledged that, depending on the particular configuration of a dairy farm’s power reticulation system, it could be argued that the supply running from the edge of the farmer’s property to the dairy shed is an asset distinguishable from the rest of the farm power supply system. This argument might be especially sustainable if in a particular case the supplies are independently metered or distinct in some other way, e.g. the land on which the dairy shed is situated is physically apart from land on which other buildings to which power is supplied are sited, or the needs of the dairy operation are so great as to demand a different system from that supplying the rest of the farm. However, usually the farm power reticulation system is one integrated “network”. Conclusion The entire dairy farm electricity reticulation system is the asset to which expenditure on repairs or alterations is measured. The asset may possibly be the power supply to the dairy shed alone if this is distinct from the supply to the rest of the farm. Summary of conclusions on identification of asset It is considered that: • The milk extraction and cleansing unit together form a single asset, i.e. the milking plant. • The milking plant is capable of being considered an “entirety by itself” and not merely a “subsidiary part” of the entire collection of plant found in a dairy shed. 32 Other items of plant typically located in the dairy shed, e.g. the water heaters, storage vats and wash down units, are separate plant performing distinct, albeit related, functions. • The rotary milking platform of a rotary milking system is a separate asset from the dairy shed building itself which is the “premises” or “setting” where the milking operation is conducted, and is also distinct from other pieces of equipment used in the milking process, e.g. the milking plant. The drive mechanism and motor form a subsidiary and integral part of the platform and should be treated as part of the entire asset, rather than as separate items. • The dairy shed yard and the dairy shed itself, together constitute a single asset making up the dairy shed complex. The dairy shed complex is the “premises” or “setting” where the dairy farmer’s milking operation is conducted, as distinct from the plant or equipment housed within it. • The concrete base of the dairy shed yard should not be treated as separately depreciable. It forms an integral part of the dairy shed complex, in terms of function and physical proximity, and is not hardstanding for the purposes of Schedule 16. • The pipe work railings surrounding the dairy shed yard (and any other barriers making up the dairy shed complex) are also an integral part of the dairy shed complex, i.e. the shed and/or the yard. They form the sides of the yard and/or the barriers within the shed for containing the cows while they are being milked. The pipe work, i.e. bails and rails, are not fences for the purposes of section DO 3. • The stock race leading to the dairy shed complex does not form part of this asset, but is a separate asset, both physically and also in terms of the function it performs. The race generally abuts the dairy shed yard, but serves a distinct function: to provide a hardened track along which the cows walk to and from the dairy shed. • A dairy farm electricity reticulation system is a separate asset as distinct from the milking shed or other farm buildings. The capital/revenue distinction – specific assets This part of the statement covers the treatment of expenditure on “repairs”, maintenance, and renewals (adopting the same categories of assets as used in the previous “identification of the asset” section). Having identified the relevant asset, the aim is to ascertain the nature, extent, and cost of the work undertaken in relation to a particular asset and then determine whether the work has remedied fair wear and tear (deductible repairs), or whether that asset has been improved, altered, or so substantially changed that it amounts to a new asset (capital). The assets so far identified usually consist of a number of individual items or parts, capable of experiencing differing levels of repairs and maintenance alone or in combination. Consequently, determining whether certain expenditure is deductible will always be a question of fact and degree, given the particular circumstances. The 33 borderline between a repair and an improvement of a capital nature may be difficult to determine. The test is essentially whether the act to be done is one that in substance is the renewal or replacement of defective parts, or the renewal or replacement of substantially the whole ( Wakely & Wheeler). Milking and other associated plant It was concluded above that the “milking plant” includes all those items of plant commencing with the cups attached to the cow and ending with the pipe from which the milk flows into the storage vat, including the cleansing unit. It is possible to identify numerous items of expenditure arising in relation to the operation of milking plant. The following is a typical selection, addressing whether those items are deductible. Minor items forming part of the milking plant The milking plant consists of many integrated parts. A number of those parts are relatively small when compared with the entire plant, and are used in the overall operation in such a way that their repair or replacement is fairly frequent when compared with the repair or replacement of larger items. These parts include all the rubberware, the pvc/plastic pipe work used in the plant, the wash or mixing bath, and the jetter washers. Also included are minor fittings forming part of some of the larger items, e.g. the replacement of “O” rings in a pulsator, gaskets and other fittings forming part of the milk filter unit. The replacement cost of these items will be on revenue account. The regular recurrence of the expenditure on such replacements, and the fact that it does not produce assets or advantages that are of an enduring benefit, point to the expenditure being revenue in nature. Pulsators These units operate a cyclical time delay in the vacuum fed to the milking cups that gives rise to the milking action. The cups are held in place on the cow’s teats by a constant vacuum, but the vacuum itself will not extract the milk and a “squeezing” or pulsating action is necessary. Each pulsator unit generally services two sets of cups. Pulsators are either analogue (old technology) or electronic (new technology) and are largely maintenance-free. The most common repair involves replacing “O” rings, i.e. small circular gaskets. The cost of replacing a full set of pulsators with a new set of the same type and capacity would be on revenue account and deductible. This is because a set, or all the sets of pulsators together, forms only a subsidiary part of the milking plant. The pulsators do not constitute a sufficiently significant part of the milking plant that their replacement could be regarded as a renewal, reconstruction, or replacement of the whole, or substantially the whole, of the plant. In that situation there has been no overall improvement to the milking plant or an increase in its capacity, i.e. no additional cows can be milked within a given time. The plant has simply been restored to its original function. The renewal of the pulsation unit by replacing the 34 pulsators with new ones has not necessarily extended the life of the milking plant as a whole. Although expenditure on replacing all the pulsators would presumably be fairly infrequent (as they have a relatively long useful life), this could still not be described as being of a “once-and-for-all nature” producing assets or advantages of an enduring benefit. They are enduring to the extent that there will be a reduction in repairs and maintenance required in relation to the pulsators in succeeding years, but the same can be said of many repairs and maintenance expenditure items. This does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the expenditure is on capital account. It cannot be said that the replacement of the pulsators with new ones of the same capacity whether of the same type or different models using the same technology, has done more than at most restore that part of the milking plant to its “as new” condition. Conclusion It is considered that the replacement of the pulsation units would be in substance the renewal or replacement of defective parts, rather than a renewal or replacement of substantially the whole (per Wakely and Wheeler). It is expenditure that does no more than restore an asset to an “as new” condition, rather than create a new asset. It is not considered that the replacement of all the pulsators at one time would involve significant reconstruction resulting in an operationally superior asset. Nor would it necessarily significantly increase the overall value of the milking plant. However, the situation might be different if the replacement of the pulsation units formed part of a wider programme of replacement and/or upgrade (c.f. Case N8 and Sherlaw). It would then be relevant to ascertain the taxpayer’s underlying intention in undertaking the replacement (Auckland Gas; Hawkes Bay Power). However, a programme of replacement and/or upgrade will usually be distinct from a programme designed simply to maintain an asset in good working order over its useful life, e.g. a periodic replacement of worn and wearing rubberware to ensure that untimely and costly breakdowns do not occur). Replacement of analogue pulsators with electronic pulsators An issue arises as to whether the same conclusion holds if a farmer changes all the pulsation units with new technology, e.g. moving from an analogue system to electronic vacuum pulsators. The question then is whether the “upgrading” of the pulsator units is an extensive enough renewal of the milking plant asset when considered as a whole, to fall on capital account. It is worth noting here the following comments from Wakely and Wheeler: The question of repair is in every case one of degree, and the test is whether the act to be done is one which in substance is the renewal or replacement of defective parts, or the renewal or replacement of substantially the whole. In that case, the judge in discussing the difference between a repair and a renewal said (at page 923): “Repair” and “renew” are not words expressive of a clear contrast. Repair always involves renewal; renewal of a part; of a subordinate part. A skylight leaks; repair is effected by hacking out the putties, 35 putting in new ones, and renewing the paint. A roof falls out of repair; the necessary work is to replace the decayed timbers by sound wood; to substitute sound tiles or slates for those which are cracked, broken, or missing; to make good the flashings, and the like. Part of a garden wall tumbles down; repair is effected by building it up again with new mortar, and, so far as necessary, new bricks or stone. Repair is restoration by renewal or replacement of subsidiary parts of a whole. Renewal, as distinguished from repair, is reconstruction of the entirety, meaning by the entirety not necessarily the whole but substantially the whole subject-matter under discussion. (Emphasis added) In Case N8 Bathgate J drew the distinction in these terms (page 3,073): If a repair does not significantly improve the asset or make it different in kind by changing its character, and thus increase its value or extend its useful life, and does no more than restore it to its original condition, then that is more likely to be a deductible item of repair and maintenance. The expenditure would generally be deductible also if the expense is for an amount that is regularly incurred by reason of ordinary wear and tear, or the expense is small and subordinate in nature in relation to the whole value of the asset involved. On the other hand work resulting in a significant increase in value of the asset, a change in its character or kind, of an amount not regularly incurred, or substantial in amount in relation to the value of the asset prior to the work, may be more likely to be capital expenditure of the nature not allowed as a deduction... The ready mixed concrete plant in Case N8 provides some analogies with a milking plant, although on a much larger scale. Both are assets or entireties made up of a number of subsidiary units, each performing a function that is one step in an overall process. In Case N8, very few working parts of the concrete mixing process were untouched and not renewed or replaced to some extent. However, in the situation being considered here only the pulsators are being replaced, albeit with modern technology. The replacement is therefore not on the same scale in relation to the total entity, i.e. the milking plant. Using the language in Lurcott v Wakely and Wheeler, the replacement of the pulsators in the milking plant seems to be the “renewal or replacement of subsidiary parts of a whole”. It does not amount to “reconstruction of the entirety, meaning by the entirety not necessarily the whole, but substantially the whole subject-matter under discussion”, i.e. the milking plant. However, against this is the change in the character of the milking plant brought about by the change from the old mechanical pulsation units to the new electronic units. In a number of R&M cases where individual parts of the larger asset have been replaced using more modern materials or technology, the expenditure has been held to be on revenue account and not an improvement of the asset. As Willy J said in Case T43 (at page 8,292): If the only way to effect a repair is to renew that part of the building – even extensive renewal as in Conn v Robins Bros, then the work remains a repair and not an improvement ... The fact that the repair will continue the life of the building does not convert the expenditure into capital. Indeed that is the whole purpose of effecting the repairs. In Case T43 the TRA held that reasonably extensive “repairs” to a recently purchased commercial building were not an improvement. The repairs included replacing a leaking fibrolite roof with corrugated iron, replacing rotten sections of floor joists, and covering the partly rotten floorboards with a new covering of particle board. A dilapidated wall was re-clad and re-framed, and stormwater drains re-routed and renewed. The TRA decided the evidence established that as the work carried out was a repair to existing works and not the creation of a new work, it could then be 36 properly said that the building had been maintained in its original form by the repair work. The Robins Bros decision, cited in Case T43, is one often referred to where the distinction between repairs and improvements is being considered. In that case, the company carried out extensive repairs to premises it leased (as the lessee). These included replacing the slate roof with an asbestos roof, replacing some roofing timbers, inserting steel girders to support the upper storey, replacing rotten floor boards with a concrete floor, and replacing shop windows with windows of a different type. The Court held the expenditure to be on revenue account, Buckley J commenting (at page 274): In the light of that circumstance it seems to me that this was expenditure incurred by the company with a view to enabling it to continue to earn profits from its business, not by acquiring some asset for that purpose but by putting the company’s existing asset into a state of repair which would enable it to continue to use that asset. No doubt in the course of carrying out these works certain structural alterations were made, as one would expect with any extensive repair of a building over 400 years old, when repairs were being carried out at a time when building techniques have completely altered. But the fact that there were alterations in the structural details of the building does not seem to me to be a good ground for proceeding upon the basis that the work produced something new. On the contrary, I think it is implicit in the Commissioner’s finding that the result of this work was not to produce something new but to repair something which had previously existed. Upon that basis it seems to me that there is no ground for regarding this expenditure as a capital expenditure. It was expenditure incurred for the purpose of enabling the company to continue to earn its profits, and was therefore in my judgment expenditure which would properly be chargeable to income. (Emphasis added) These cases indicate that if the work undertaken affects only some parts of the entire asset and brings that asset back up to a fully functioning capacity, the work is more likely to be found to be of a revenue nature. It has also been accepted that replacement of a part with a more modern version, which may be more effective, does not necessarily mean the cost of the part is on capital account. The replacement of the pulsators has similarities with the position in Robins Bros in that the alterations to the milking plant are being made using new technology that was not available when the plant was first constructed. Although the change to an electronic system reflects an enhancement in terms of the advantages brought by new technology, it has not resulted in a change in capacity, i.e. throughput. In this regard the authorities show that an improvement in the level of anticipated future repairs does not equate to an upgrade of a capital nature, but merely reflects improved technology and the advantages that come from having a newer part. Revenue treatment of the costs of replacing old parts with new using modern material is also supported by the decisions of Morcom v Campbell-Johnson \[1956\] 1 QB 106, 115 and W Thomas & Co Pty Limited v FCT (1965) 115 CLR 58. In W Thomas & Co Pty it was held by the Australian High Court that (at page 72): It may sometimes be convenient for some purposes to contrast a “repair” with a “replacement” or “renewal”. But repairs to a whole are often made by the replacement of worn-out parts by new parts. Repair involves the restoration of a thing to a condition it formerly had without changing its character. But in the case of a thing considered from the point of view of its use as distinct from its appearance, it is restoration of efficiency in function rather than exact repetition of form or material that is significant. Blanchard J expressed similar sentiments in Auckland Gas Co where he said in his conclusions on the capital/revenue question (at page 15,022): 37 If work of a maintenance character had been done on the joints and corroded sections of pipe had been replaced, the cost involved would certainly have been deductible, even if it was done according to a programme intended eventually to restore the whole of the low pressure part of the network to an “as new” condition, with the benefit being long lasting. .... (We include in this the cost of replacement of corroded sections with piping or new jointing with greater resistance to corrosion and leak free because of new technology. As Mr Farmer said, the fact that the use of new technology will reduce future maintenance bills does not mean that the cost of the work must be charged to capital.) (Emphasis added) In the present situation the repair of the whole, the milking plant, is occurring by “replacement of worn-out parts by new parts” as discussed in W Thomas & Co Pty. Therefore, this involves “the restoration of a thing to a condition it formerly had without changing its character” because the milking plant still incorporates a pulsation unit with the same capacity. That is, in looking at the milking plant “from the point of view of its use as distinct from its appearance, it is restoration of efficiency in function rather than exact repetition of form or material that is significant”. It is understood that in some cases there may be some additional operational advantages with the new electronic units, e.g. the ability to record each cow’s milk production. Where this occurs there may be a stronger argument that the new system is an improved one as compared to the old system. This will depend on the facts of the individual case. Conclusion Where analogue pulsation units are replaced by electronic pulsation units this will generally be on revenue account given that: • such a replacement relates only to a subsidiary part of the entire asset, being the milking plant • the electronic system does not increase capacity, i.e. throughput • the reason for the change in the type of system is likely to be more of a reflection of changes in the relevant technology, than a desire to enhance the plant. However, this may not be so if the replacement coincided with the replacement of other parts of the plant or some kind of general “upgrade”. Seen together, the expenditure might be considered to be on capital account; as was the case in Case N8. It would not matter that the programme of upgrading occurred at one time, or over a period of years as in Auckland Gas (see Blanchard J’s comments on p.15,024). Stainless steel milk pipes The steel milk pipes carry milk from the cup units through a releaser milk pump, filter, and cooler to the vat. Stainless steel pipes have an extremely long life and require little maintenance beyond the replacement of minor items such as rubber joints and joining hoses, (already considered above). Given their long life, it is considered that the replacement of these pipes will only arise as part of a dairy shed complex being upgraded and therefore would be on capital account. The replacement of a damaged section of stainless steel pipe, in the 38 rare instances where that would be necessary, e.g. damage caused by a cow, is the same as that relating to the replacement of rubber hoses (considered above). Such expenditure on the pipes is probably not of a regular or recurring nature given its infrequency (although, arguably, the risk of such damage is a constant one directly related to daily operations). However, the part replaced would be so small in relation to the entire milking plant asset (or even the milk pipes themselves) as to be unlikely to give rise to an enduring benefit of any kind. Therefore, such expenditure will be on revenue account and be deductible as an ordinary business expense. Milk filters The milk filter consists of a stainless steel unit containing disposable gauze filters replaced at each milking. The stainless steel unit has an extremely long life and repairs are minimal. The replacement of gauze filters is a revenue cost as an ordinary, on-going business expense. Some, generally larger sheds, may have two milk filters. The inclusion of an additional filter would seem to occur only for the reason of increasing the capacity of the milking plant and is likely to be accompanied by upgrading of other parts of the plant. Accordingly, the cost of introducing a further filter or filters is capital in nature. Milk cooler The milk cooler is made up of a series of thin metal plates with a honeycomb network through them, encased by heavy metal plates at each end bolted together. The cooler operates in a similar way to the cooling system of a car radiator with pressure-fed cold water passing through the veins of the unit to cool the milk as it passes through. Such units have a long life with little maintenance required, although servicing may be necessary from time to time. It is understood that servicing occurs fairly infrequently (approximately every five years) and is generally carried out by specialists who replace small fittings, e.g. gaskets, and resealing. The cost of servicing a milk cooler, although infrequent, is a revenue expense, and that even if a new or reconditioned cooler of the same capacity were purchased, this would still be on revenue account. Although physically quite large, the cooler performs a relatively small part of the milking plant process, and its replacement would be no more than “renewal or replacement of subsidiary parts of a whole” (Wakely and Wheeler). However, in practice, as is the case with the milk filter unit, replacement is more likely to occur only as part of a general upgrade of some kind. In these circumstances the cost is likely to be on capital account (Case N8). Milk receiver/Air intercepter Both types of can are made of stainless steel and vary in size depending on the size of the milking operation. The milk receiver is the first collection point of milk taken from the herd. It fills to a certain level, before probes inside it (operating similar to a float system in a trough) trigger the releaser milk pump to pump the milk through the pipes to the milk filter and cooler. These cans are constructed for a long life, generally lasting the life of the shed. The see-through bolted on solid plastic covers at 39 one or both ends may deteriorate through exposure to UV rays. The cost of replacing these covers is low. The replacement of the plastic covers is a revenue expense. Although, such expenditure may be infrequent, the part replaced would be so small in relation to the milking plant asset (or even the receiving cans themselves) that it would involve only “renewal or replacement of a subsidiary part” of the asset and would not amount to “reconstruction of the entirety” (Wakely and Wheeler). Any replacement of the receiving cans as a whole would seem to be required only when there is a need to increase the capacity of the milking plant. For example, where the capacity of the shed itself has been increased because of the increased size of the herd. As such, replacement of the receiving cans is part of an expansion to the entirety of the milking plant and would generally be on capital account. Pumps/electric motors Milking plant usually includes at least three different types of pump, each with an associated electric motor. The three types of pump are: • Releaser milk pump The releaser milk pump is situated adjacent to the milk receiver and pumps milk from that reservoir through the pipes to the milk filter. It might generally be expected to have a useful life in excess of 10 years. • Vacuum pump This pump is usually situated in the milk receiving area of the shed. It provides the vacuum or suction through a series of air pipes/lines to the milking cups to remove the milk from the cow, and then draws the milk through pipes to the milk receiver. It would also be expected to have a useful life in excess of 10 years. • Plant wash water pump This pump forms part of the cleansing unit and is connected to the pipes from the wash bath. It is used for pumping the succession of cold water, hot water and detergents through the milking unit to cleanse it. Such pumps require little maintenance. Replacement of a single pump The replacement of a single pump will be on revenue account because: • The expenditure restores the asset (the milking plant), both in function and form, to its original standard without improvement. Indicatively, this places the expenditure on revenue account. (If the pump had been replaced with one of an increased capacity, this could be said to result in a permanent improvement to the milking plant (Rhodesia Railways and Highland Railway) or an “upgrading” of the plant (Auckland Gas Co) and thus be on capital account.) 40 • No “new” asset has been acquired. The pump, although relatively expensive to replace, does not form a substantial enough portion of the milking plant for it to be said that its replacement “renews” the milking plant. Neither can it be said that the milking plant has been improved. The old pump has been replaced with a pump of exactly the same capacity. The “new” asset is to be assessed from the base of the “old” asset in good repair (per Hodgins v Plunder & Pollak (Ireland) Ltd \[1957\] IR 58). Because it is rare for this type of component to require replacement, it might be argued that the payment has been made “once and for all for the enduring benefit of the taxpayer’s trade” (British Insulated and Helsby Cables Ltd v Atherton \[1926\] AC 213; 10 TC 155, BP Australia et al ), and the expenditure is therefore on capital account. However, because the pump is not a substantial enough component of the overall milking plant, it is considered that its replacement will not alone extend the life of the milking plant asset to any marked degree so as to give rise to an enduring benefit. However, the cost may be capital expenditure where, for example, replacement of a single pump: • involves a new pump that is more powerful or offers some other superior performance level or feature; or • occurs as part of a programme of more widespread renewal, upgrading, and/or extension of the milking plant (whether or not occurring at the same time). Repairs/replacement of several items of milking plant It was concluded above that the milking plant is one asset. However, that does not mean that replacing a component part of the milking plant will always be a repair and therefore revenue expenditure. The position becomes less clear when more than one component is replaced at, or near, the same time. It is acknowledged that there are an infinite number of types and combinations of repairs and replacements that may occur to milking plant, and it is not possible to deal with them all. The only workable approach is to provide some examples and outline the principles to be applied and likely outcomes, so these can be used in considering other situations. Two examples are provided by way of illustration. Example 1 Releaser milk pump replaced and vacuum pump repaired The replacement of a single vacuum pump with a new pump was considered above. The following considers a case where two pumps fail within a short period. The releaser milk pump is replaced with a new pump at a cost of approximately $7,000. The performance of the pump has gradually deteriorated throughout the previous season, but it has been possible to manage with lower milk volumes at that time. With an increase in milk volumes due in the new season, the farmer decides to replace the pump, although it could be repaired. Though the new releaser milk pump 41 is of the latest design, it offers no increase in capacity over that of the old pump when it was new. A month into the new season the vacuum pump fails. It would cost the farmer several thousand dollars to replace it with a new one. The farmer has a serviceman remove the vacuum pump and install a loan pump while the failed pump is repaired. The repairs will extend the pump’s life by several years. In applying the case law tests outlined earlier, the following comments can be made. • As with the replacement of a single pump, although two pumps are involved the expenditure can be said to do no more than restore the asset (the milking plant), both in function and form, to, at most, its original standard without improvement. Indicatively, therefore, this places the expenditure on revenue account. The expenditure on the pumps has not resulted in any increased capacity that could be said to result in a permanent improvement to the milking plant. • Arguably, no “new” asset has been acquired. Although expenditure on two pumps has been outlaid, the character of the milking plant has not changed (c.f. Case N8 or Highland Railway). Although costly to replace, the releaser milk pump does not by itself form a substantial enough portion of the milking plant for it to be said that its replacement “renews” the milking plant. This remains so, even when that replacement is considered along with the repairs to the vacuum pump. There is no programme of systematic renewal or upgrading. The events were unconnected. • It cannot be said that the milking plant has been improved beyond its original condition. The old releaser milk pump has been replaced with a pump of exactly the same capacity. The repairs to the vacuum pump have simply restored it to its usual condition, rather than extended its useful life. Indicatively, this places the expenditure on revenue account. • As with the single pump scenario, because it is rare for both these components to require replacement or major repair, it is possible to argue that the payments have been made once and for all for the enduring benefit of the taxpayer’s trade (British Insulated and Helsby Cables Ltd, BP Australia). It could be said that the expenditure should therefore be on capital account. However, the counter to this argument is the fact that the replacement of one pump and repair of the other are not substantial enough for it to be said that they will, by themselves, extend the life of the milking plant asset to any marked degree. For these reasons, the cost of the replacement of one pump and the repair of the other would, in the particular circumstances outlined, be on revenue account. Example 2 Replacement of vacuum and releaser milk pumps and pulsators As in Example 1, a dairy farmer is in the position of having to replace a vacuum pump. However, the farmer would also like to replace a number of other items at the same time ie, the pulsators and uplift pump, although they are not causing major problems. As the dry season is approaching, the decision is made to replace all three 42 components while the plant is not being used. All are to be replaced with components of the same capacity. As with the first example, the asset, against which the expenditure is to be measured, is the milking plant. Having decided that these components are part of a larger asset, it is then necessary to apply the case law tests against the expenditure incurred: • Expenditure that does no more than restore an asset to an “as new” condition, rather than create a new asset, will be deductible whether this is done within one income year, or over a number of years. However, if expenditure is on renewal, replacement, or reconstruction of substantially the whole of an asset, this is more than a repair and is non-deductible. This applies even if the asset gives no greater performance and/or has no greater life span than that of the replaced asset. Here the vacuum pump, the uplift pump, and the pulsation units are being replaced. Together these items are largely responsible for the milk extraction process – suggesting that something more than repair is being undertaken – and together their replacement has the flavour of “reconstruction of substantially the whole” (Wakely and Wheeler). • The renewal of major components, as opposed to their maintenance in a serviceable condition, can be indicative of the expenditure falling on capital account. An assessment has to be made of whether the work is of sufficient substance to place the expenditure on capital account. This will always be a question of fact and degree, and more difficult to determine in situations where the asset has not been improved in any way. • In determining whether certain work comprising repairs and or replacements of a large number of component parts is capital or revenue in nature, it is important to ascertain the taxpayer’s overall intention, i.e. to repair or to totally improve or reconstruct. Here the farmer chose to replace all of the items: the vacuum pump because it could not continue to be used; and the uplift pump and pulsation units because it was convenient to do so. It might be said that the farmer’s intention was simply to keep the milking plant going by replacing items that had worn out or would require significant repairs, i.e. there was no concerted decision to “improve” or remodel the plant. However, conversely the replacements constitute such a significant part of the total plant that the decision to replace them at the same time suggests something more than an intention simply to repair (Case N8). • Work resulting in a significant increase in value of the asset, a change in its character or kind, or involving an amount not regularly incurred, or substantial in relation to the value of the asset prior to the work, is more likely to be capital expenditure. In this case the new items will not give rise to a change in character or kind. However, it appears that the cost overall will be reasonably significant in relation to the whole. It might also be argued that the replacement of three items of equipment at the same time in this way is not in the nature of a recurrent expense. • Authorities such as Case N8 suggest that it may in the context of a total project be artificial to dissect the work into capital and revenue categories, or to further dissect a purported revenue category into capital and non-capital items. It is 43 necessary to look at the entire asset and see what existed before and after. In this example, before the expenditure the milking plant included one major item that was essentially unusable. After the replacements, the milking plant has largely been renewed through the replacement of three major items: the overall effect is one of renewal. Although part of the old milking plant asset remains, for all practical purposes the replacement of these critical components means that a largely “new” asset has been created. • The farmer chose to replace the pulsators and uplift pump at the same time as the vacuum pump. Case law (Colonial Motors) makes it clear that there is no deduction available for notional repairs – the cost of replacement will be on capital account, although repairs on the existing part would have been revenue in nature. The replacement of such a substantial portion of the milking plant would tend to, on the particular facts of this example, be on capital account. However, the result in this example would be different if the milk pump and pulsators were also in a poor state of repair and the farmer simply chose to wait until the dry season to effect repairs and/or replacement of these parts. The cases tend to indicate that where the taxpayer’s intention is simply to maintain or replace defective items, even where this is carried out in one income year (or at the same time) this will not amount to a substantial change to the whole. The correct treatment will always be a question of fact and degree. Upgrading the milking plant A dairy operation may be upgraded, usually to increase production. For example, a 16 a-side herringbone shed is converted into a 20 a-side herringbone operation. This would usually involve extending the herringbone pit and shed roof, plus the addition of new sets of droppers and clusters. An upgrade would also occur if a herringbone operation were converted to a rotary system. The extent of the cost of an upgrade appears to be a function of how compatible the old layout and equipment is to the new equipment, and the extent to which some of the existing plant may be incorporated into the new system, e.g. milk pipes and coolers having sufficient capacity to deal with increased volumes. In all these situations the milking plant would be improved beyond its original state or condition. As such, and on the basis of the authorities (e.g. Highland Railway, Case N8) the cost would clearly fall on capital account. The payments would be made “once and for all for the enduring benefit of the taxpayer’s trade” (e.g. British Insulated and Helsby Cables Ltd and BP Australia). Other equipment situated in the dairy shed It was concluded above that the milking plant is distinct from a number of other items of equipment possibly found in the dairy shed, e.g: the wash down unit; water heaters; milk storage vats; refrigeration unit; drenching system; plant wash down unit; yard wash down unit; and vat washing unit. 44 The repair and/or replacement of these items must be considered separately from the milking plant and the dairy shed. It is accepted that the cost of repairs to, or replacements of, subsidiary parts making up these assets will be revenue in nature (e.g. repairs to or replacement of sections of the water hose or pipes that form part of the wash-down unit). However, the complete replacement of such an asset (e.g. the water heater) with a new one would amount to the replacement of the entirety, i.e. a new asset, and the cost will be on capital account (Wakely and Wheeler). Rotary platforms It was earlier concluded that in a rotary dairy shed it is the rotary milking platform together with its associated drive mechanism and motor that is the asset satisfying the “entirety” test. Repairs The cost of any repairs to the rotary platform, drive mechanism or motor will be on revenue account, including the replacement of minor items, e.g. the hard rubber wheel that turns the platform, or the steel rollers on which a conventional steel platform rests. Replacement of the platform It is understood that replacement of the entire rotary platform is rare. It is most likely to occur only if a rotary cowshed is being expanded in size because of a significant increase in the size of the milking herd and the need to increase the milking plant capacity. The platform itself is by far the largest part of the rotary milking platform asset. Based on the authorities it is clear that its replacement would be on capital account, given that it would involve the reconstruction or renewal of substantially the whole of the rotary platform asset (Wakely and Wheeler, Auckland Trotting Club, Lindsay and Case N8). The platform is a significant and distinct part of the entire rotary system in terms of both sheer size and value. This would apply whether or not the new replacement platform holds more cows than the old one. As held in a number of cases (e.g. Case N8) it is not necessary that there be an increase in the capacity of the asset over that which existed previously, if the replacement is so significant that it amounts to a substantial change to the entire asset. Seemingly, the position would also be unaffected by use of part or all of the old drive machinery to rotate the new platform (Case N8). Replacement of the drive mechanism or motor As seen, whether the expense of replacing a component part will be on capital or revenue account is always one of fact and degree. The test is whether the act to be done is one that in substance is the renewal or replacement of defective parts, or the renewal or replacement of substantially the whole (Wakely & Wheeler). Case L68 concerned, inter alia, the deductibility of the cost of replacing a fishing vessel’s engine. Deane J concluded that this cost was capital in nature. Although his Honour appears to have taken into account the terms of section 115 of the Income Tax 45 Act 1976, which expressly provided for depreciation of “expenditure of a capital nature” incurred in acquiring, installing, or extending any equipment or machinery that was to be used in a fishing boat, he also concluded that the cost of acquiring the engine was, according to ordinary principles, on capital account. His Honour noted (at page 1,401): Whether expenditure is for “repairs or alterations”, or is more substantial and capital in nature, appears to depend on the scale and significance of the work done, when related to the asset to which it occurs. The larger and more significant the work, relative to the whole, the more probable it is that capital expenditure is involved. Much then depends on the scale and significance of the totality against which the comparison is to be made. It may be an entire capital enterprise, or it may be some lesser part. Various measures have been adopted in the cases to decide whether it is one or the other. In Samuel Jones and Co (Devondale) Limited v IR Commrs (1951) 32 TC 513 the Scottish Court of Session made a physical, commercial, and functional analysis of the asset being repaired relative to the totality of assets. In the Auckland Trotting Club case the Court of Appeal did not accept that approach (at p 976), and deliberately took a more restricted perspective. The court adopted, at p 975, the method stated by Kitto J in Lindsay v FC of T (1961) 106 CLR 377 at p 384: “where the question is whether expenditure has been for repairs, and ... one asks what is the entirety which it is relevant to consider, one is looking not for a profit-earning structure or entity, as such, but for a physical thing which satisfies a particular notion.” The Court thought, at p 976, that one indicator might be whether the entity repaired or replaced was “a part perfectly clearly divisible from the rest”; and that the answer in each case must be one “essentially of fact and of degree” (adopting dicta of Findlay J in Margrett v Lowestoft Water and Gas Co (1935) 19 TC 481 at p 488). Deane J went on to apply those principles to the deductibility of the cost of replacing the fishing boat engine: When the work done on the two vessels in the present case is viewed from the perspective of that cumulative test, and that derived earlier from sec 115(1), the nature of the expenditure seems to be tolerably clear. The motor of the “M”, in my view, was, and is, capital plant. As the source of the vessel’s motive power it was, and is, an essential, and relatively very substantial, aspect of the whole. Yet it was not, and is not, part of the fabric of the vessel. It could be detached from the vessel, independently traded as a commodity, and replaced, as indeed happened. The replacement also seems to me to have been capital in nature. It was an entire substitution, an order of magnitude greater than a repair, or maintenance. There may have been no improvement in function. Indeed the replacement motor was less powerful than the first. What seems more significant to me is that the life of the new motor was expected to be, and will be, much longer than could have been achieved by repair of the old motor. Deane J concluded that the asset in question was the vessel, i.e. the engine was a part of that larger asset. He then appears to have taken three factors into account in determining whether the replacement of the engine was a capital or revenue expense, i.e. the importance of the part replaced to the operation of the whole; the size of the part as compared with the whole asset; and whether the part could be removed from the whole asset and independently traded. Applying those factors in this case: • The motor is clearly fundamentally important to the operation of the platform because it provides the power to turn the platform during milking. In this respect it seems directly analogous to an engine of a fishing vessel. However, conversely 46 it would be correct in the case of most parts of a wider asset that they are necessary to the overall functionality of the asset in question. • The rotary platform itself is by far the largest part of the rotary system asset, i.e. the motor is a relatively small part of that asset. Deane J concluded that the engine of the vessel was “relatively substantial” as regards the whole boat. Apparently he did not require that the part under consideration should make up more than 50% of the total asset, or any other particular proportion, but that the asset must be of some reasonable size when compared to the overall size of the asset. A rotary motor is generally no bigger than one metre square, whereas a platform is at a minimum twenty metres in circumference. Therefore, in terms of sheer size, it is difficult to say that the motor makes up a relatively substantial part of the whole. In addition, the cost of replacing a rotary motor is small in comparison to the overall value of the rotary platform unit. Although, cost is not determinative of the issue, relative cost can be relevant. • The third point considered by Deane J was whether the part could be removed and independently traded. The electric motor is detachable, and would be tradeable in its own right as it could be used for various purposes. For these reasons it is considered that the replacement of the motor will generally be a revenue cost. However, the installation of a more powerful electric motor in the drive machinery to replace the old motor would constitute an improvement in the rotary platform asset, and would clearly be on capital account (Western Suburbs Cinemas and Highland Railways). In practice, the replacement of the entire drive mechanism would be less likely to occur than replacement of the motor. It is more likely that the drive mechanism would be repaired over time with replacements of subsidiary parts. The cost of such repairs and replacement parts would be deductible. However, in the event that an entire drive mechanism was replaced, the cost would be capital in nature for the same reasons referred to above in respect of the platform. Furthermore, the drive mechanism forms a larger part of the entire rotary system asset than the motor, and is a more integrated part of the rest of the system, given that the drive mechanism is connected to the platform, whereas the motor essentially stands alone. Dairy shed and yard It has been concluded that the yard and dairy shed together constitute a single asset making up the dairy shed complex. The dairy shed complex is the “premises” or “setting” where the dairy farmer’s milking operation is conducted and satisfies the “entirety test”. Repairs and/or alterations relating to the dairy shed complex asset fall into three different broad situations: Repairs to the complex resulting from fair wear and tear The cost of such repairs will be on revenue account, e.g. repairs to: replace a section of wire or pipe work; straighten a bent pipe, or to fix the weld or bolts which may 47 have broken. The need or occasion calling for the expenditure will be the events arising from the daily operation of the dairy milking system. The payments do not give rise to an enduring benefit when compared to the entire complex. Complete replacement of a damaged pipe work gate leading to or from the yard or shed will also be on revenue account. Such a replacement would be a replacement of a component part of an asset. In terms of the dairy shed complex, it would be a minor part, and would be far from “a reconstruction of the whole, or substantially the whole of the asset” (Wakely and Wheeler and Auckland Trotting Club). Alterations to the shed and/or yard to extend it in size It is relatively common for dairy farmers to extend their existing dairy shed, rather than to build a completely new one when they increase the size of their herd. In a herringbone system this can be done without major reconstruction of the existing shed by simply expanding the shed to hold an increased number of cows. Generally, this involves extending the existing base of the shed at one end including the central pit, extending the existing roof to cover it, adding additional bails, and adding to the milking plant according to the number of additional cows accommodated at each cycle by the extension. As in relation to milking plant, this constitutes an improvement to the asset beyond its original state or condition. As such, and on the basis of cases such as Highland Railway, the cost would fall on capital account. It would give rise to an enduring benefit in terms of increased capacity, and would relate to the structure of the operation rather than the income earning process. Alterations to the shed and/or yard to modify the herd flow The deductibility of such costs will depend on the scale of the alterations, and will always be a question of fact and degree. If the changes made and costs involved are minimal, on the basis of the capital/revenue tests identified in BP Australia, such costs would be revenue in nature. The focus is on improving the daily efficiencies of the milking process, rather than changing the overall structure to give rise to an enduring benefit. However, if changes are more substantial, e.g. the pipe work is completely dismantled and rearranged requiring relaying concrete to secure the new system, the cost involved would be capital in nature. In such a case the emphasis would have moved from simply improving the efficiency of the daily operation of the milking process (i.e. the income-earning process), to changing a part of the fixed assets which form the structure of the business. Whereas with minor alterations, perhaps made a number of times to reflect the changing needs of the daily operation, changes involving more substantial work are unlikely to be made on a recurring basis. Again, this is more suggestive of a capital expense, which should be added to the cost of the dairy shed structure and depreciated over time. Undergrounding the electricity supply to cowsheds 48 Earlier it was concluded that the electricity supply lines leading to a dairy shed (and other farm buildings) are the asset against which expenditure on repairs or alterations is to be measured. Ordinary “repairs” to overhead lines This expenditure will commonly involve repairs to parts of the overhead line or lines that run from the road boundary to the dairy shed and other farm buildings, rather than renewal or replacement of the entire line. It will include, for example, mending or replacing individual power poles, cross-arms, stays, insulators, or wires where they have been damaged by storm or accident or have rotted or otherwise deteriorated over time. These costs, which have come about through ordinary “wear and tear”, will be on revenue account as they clearly satisfy the tests for deduction as an ordinary business expense. They are likely to be recurrent, and will give rise to no greater benefit than the continued efficient operation of the power reticulation system. New, renewed, or extended overhead lines Generally, cost will be on capital account if: • an entirely new overhead line is run from the farm boundary to a new dairy shed, or an old line to an existing shed is replaced (and the old line is then pulled down); or • an existing line is extended, e.g. from the site of an old to a new dairy shed. In the first situation a “new” asset has been constructed. The cost of the new line should be capitalised (and “amortised” at 10% DV in line with clause 14 of Part A to the Seventh Schedule). If the asset (the old line) has been completely replaced or “renewed” and not “repaired”, the cost should also be on capital account. This is consistent with the observations of Buckley LJ in Wakely & Wheeler: “Repair” and “renew” are not words expressive of a clear contrast. Repair always involves renewal; renewal of a part; of a subordinate part. .... Repair is restoration by renewal or replacement of subsidiary parts of a whole. Renewal, as distinguished from repair, is reconstruction of the entirety, meaning by the entirety not necessarily the whole but substantially the whole subject matter under discussion. (These words were quoted with approval in the decision of the Court of Appeal in Auckland Trotting Club among other cases.) This situation can be distinguished from cases such as Sherlaw, and similarly from Conn v Robins Bros where significant repairs were held to be on revenue account. In that case, although the repairs were extensive, sizeable parts of the old asset remained. The extended power lines in the second situation constitute a “permanent improvement” in, or addition to, the asset. On the basis of principles established in cases such as Lindsay and Highland Railways, the cost of such an addition is not a repair and would fall on capital account. This is the position irrespective of whether the extended line results in the taxpayer deriving an increase in income (Highland Railways). 49 It is of relevance to note that Goddard J in Hawkes Bay Power warned (at page 13,705) against any suggestion that the replacement of old overhead lines with new overhead lines simply to restore the asset to its original condition would necessarily be on revenue account. In her view this was “too one-dimensional an approach” - the issue must always be one of scale and degree. Replacing overhead lines with underground cables Usually, overhead electricity lines are replaced with an underground cable in one of two situations: • The overhead line is in a poor state of repair, e.g. partially rotted poles, and instead of replacing the poles or repairing a section of overhead line the farmer elects, or is required, to install underground cable. • The existing overhead line is susceptible to storm or other damage, and the farmer replaces it with underground cable. Where, for whatever reason, a farmer decides to replace the overhead line with an underground cable, on the basis of recent authority the cost will be on capital account. The “undergrounding” will involve the “reconstruction of the entirety” of the asset in question (the electricity supply line the farmer owns) and its replacement with a new and improved asset. In Poverty Bay Electric Power Board the Court of Appeal confirmed the earlier High Court decision of Ellis J that the cost of undergrounding power lines was on capital account. Blanchard J noted at page 15,007: .... we are satisfied that the work .... was intended to produce such a different and operationally superior asset for the Board that it is impossible to regard it as anything but a capital improvement. Nor is it possible to divide the work into capital and non-capital portions, for what was substituted underground was entirely new. Reference has already been made to the characteristics of the underground cabling which make it different from and superior to overhead lines and led to the Judge’s conclusion that the work was not repairs and maintenance. In that case the overhead lines were replaced by new and significantly different underground cables. The replacements were physically larger, of greater capacity, and otherwise operationally more efficient. The Court of Appeal found that what was achieved went well beyond restoring the old lines to an “as new” state. A similar result was reached in the earlier High Court decision in Hawkes Bay Power. Again, the court considered that the replacement of one asset with an entirely new asset would be on capital account. It is considered that the principles applied in these cases apply equally to the situation of dairy farmers who, for whatever reason, place their electricity supply underground. On the findings of the cases, it would seem irrelevant to the capital/revenue issue whether farmers have chosen freely to convert from overhead to underground 50 systems, or have been in some way compelled to do so due to the attitude or actions of local authorities. In both cases, a new and different asset of enduring benefit to the farmer results, indicating that the expenditure is capital in nature. Summary of conclusions reached on the application of capital/revenue principles to specific assets: Milking plant • The replacement of minor items forming part of the milking plant, e.g. rubberware, pvc piping, the wash or mixing bath, and the jetter washers will be on revenue account. The same applies to the replacement of minor fittings forming part of some of the larger items, e.g. the replacement of “O” rings in a pulsator, gaskets, and other fittings forming part of the milk filter unit. • The replacement of one or all of the pulsator units will be on revenue account. The same situation arises when analogue pulsators are replaced with more modern technology in the form of an electronic system. • Given the long life of the stainless steel pipe work which forms part of a milking plant, its total replacement is unlikely to occur other than as part of an upgrade of the plant and would therefore be on capital account. The cost of repairs to parts of the piping, including the replacement of sections of pipe due to wear and tear, will be on revenue account. • The same approach applies to the milk filter, milk coolers, and the milk receiver/air intercepter, i.e. total replacement is unlikely to occur other than as part of an upgrade the cost of which would be on capital account. If an entire cooler should need replacing, other than as part of a general upgrade, the cost will be on revenue account. On-going servicing costs will also be deductible, as will the cost of replacing the gauze filters forming part of the milk filter unit. The same applies to the plastic covers used to cover the milk receiver and air intercepter. • The replacement of a single pump (vacuum, milklift, or water pump) forming part of the milking plant will generally be on revenue account. This result would change if the replacement involves a more powerful pump or is made as part of a programme of widespread renewal, upgrading, and/or extension of the milking plant (whether or not occurring at the same time). These factors are all indicative of the expenses being on capital account. • The situation is not as straightforward when a number of items forming part of the milking plant are replaced or repaired at, or about, the same time. By way of example, the cost of the replacement of one pump and the repair of the another will generally be on revenue account. However, the replacement of vacuum and milk pumps and the pulsator units would constitute a change to a substantial part of the milking plant and would be on capital account. • Consistent with decisions such as Case N8, costs incurred for a general upgrade of a dairy shed complex, e.g. to increase capacity, will be on capital account. 51 • The replacement of other items of equipment situated in the dairy shed, e.g. the wash down unit; water heaters; milk storage vats; refrigeration unit; drenching system; plant wash down unit; yard wash down unit; and vat washing unit will be on capital account. The cost of repairs to these items will be deductible. Rotary platform system • The cost of repairs, not involving a replacement of the entire platform or motor/drive mechanism, will be on revenue account. Such repairs will mainly involve servicing the motor and drive mechanism. It is possible that the pipe work forming part of the platform may require minor repair work from time to time. In both cases the nature of the work reflects on-going maintenance requirements rather than a capital improvement. • The cost of replacing the entire platform will be on capital account. Such a replacement would amount to a substantial change to the asset when viewed as a whole. The likelihood of replacing the platform, other than as part of a wider upgrade of the dairy operation, is minimal as platforms are anticipated to have a long, useful life. • However, the electric motor that powers the platform may well need to be replaced over the life of the rotary system. It is considered that the cost of replacing the entire motor will be on revenue account. The replacement of the motor does not amount to a change to a substantial part of the whole. However, a replacement of the drive mechanism in its entirety will be on capital account, although it is presumed that this would be a less frequent event as the mechanism is comprised of a number of working parts that are more likely to be repaired and replaced individually over time. The on-going servicing costs of these items will be deductible. Dairy shed and yards • The cost of replacing or repairing a section of wire or pipe work will be deductible. The complete replacement of a damaged pipe work gate leading to or from the yard or shed will also be on revenue account, as will repairs to the concrete surface of the dairy shed yard. • The cost of extending the size of an existing dairy shed constitutes an improvement and will be capital in nature. • The ability to deduct the cost of alterations to the dairy shed complex to improve herd flow will be a matter of degree, i.e. minor changes will be deductible but more major alterations will be capital, e.g. if the pipe work is completely dismantled and rearranged, involving relaying concrete to secure the new system. Undergrounding the electricity supply to cowsheds • The cost of ordinary, on-going repairs to existing overhead power lines supplying power to the dairy complex will be deductible, e.g. replacing an individual pole, 52 whereas the cost of replacing an entire overhead system with new poles and wires or extending an existing line will generally not be deductible. • Based on the decisions in Poverty Bay Electric and Hawkes Bay Power, the cost of replacing an overhead system with an underground system will be a capital expense. Recently acquired plant If a farmer has recently acquired a dairy farm, or secondhand milking plant or other equipment to incorporate into a dairy shed, deductibility may be affected as repairs to recently acquired assets are a special case. Repairs that may otherwise be deductible may be held to be on capital account when an asset has been acquired at a lower cost because of deferred maintenance. The Law Shipping Co Ltd v IRC (1924) 22 TC 621 (Court of Session, Scotland) concerned the purchase of a ship in need of repair. At the time the vessel was acquired it was about to sail on a freight voyage and was due for a periodical survey to ascertain its seaworthiness. Following the survey the taxpayer upgraded the ship. It was considered that most of the repairs related to the condition of the ship at the time it was purchased. The Court held that the expenditure related to the defects in the vessel at the time it was acquired and was therefore capital in nature and non- deductible. The Court also concluded that had the repair work not been required, the purchase price would have been higher. The repairs were necessary to remedy an “inherited legacy of disrepair”. Law Shipping Co was considered by the New Zealand Supreme Court in a case on appeal from the High Court of the Cook Islands: Collector of Inland Revenue, Cook Islands v AB Donald Limited \[1965\] NZLR 679. The taxpayer had purchased an ocean-going vessel, and after a short period of trading carried out substantial repairs. The issue was whether the cost of those repairs was deductible. Woodhouse J reversed the earlier decision. In his view the issue did not turn on whether the vessel could be operated immediately on purchase, but rather as to the cause of the need to repair – in this case this arose out of the operation of the vessel prior to acquisition by the taxpayer. Therefore, to the extent that the work remedied an inherited legacy of disrepair, or went beyond the restoration of wear and tear arising out of the taxpayer’s own use of the vessel, the result was an improvement, and was just as much a part of the ship’s establishment as a capital asset as the purchase price (at page 684). Another decision on this issue is Odeon Associated Theatres Limited v LJ Jones \[1972\] 1 All ER 681. That case concerned the purchase of a chain of cinemas in a relatively poor state of repair after the Second World War. The Court found that the need for repair did not affect the price paid, as the cinemas were still a fully effective profit-earning asset. Law Shipping was distinguished on the basis that here the repairs were carried out over a ten-year period. Although it was true that a portion of the expenditure had been incurred shortly after the cinemas were acquired, the repair work did not affect the use of the cinemas. The cost of the repairs was held to be deductible. 53 These cases highlight the fact that the need for the repair work should arise out of the purchaser’s, and not the vendor’s, use of the relevant asset. If the purchase price paid for an asset is lower so as to take into account the need for immediate repair work, the cost of such repairs will be on capital account. If this were shown to be the case in the acquisition of a dairy farm, or secondhand milking plant or other equipment, the same principles would apply. Comments on technical submissions received Submissions were received on a number of the key issues addressed by this statement. These were fully considered, but not necessarily agreed with. Submissions received as regards the deductibility of the cost of replacing a rotary platform motor were taken into account resulting in the conclusion set out above that such an expense will be deductible. A number of submissions were received in relation to Example 2. These submissions were given careful consideration and resulted in the example being modified to indicate a distinction between the situation where the taxpayer chooses to replace a significant portion of the entire asset where only some of the items are in need of repair, and one where a number of individual parts are in a poor state of repair necessitating repair or replacement and the taxpayer chooses to effect such work at one time because it is convenient to do so. It will however, always be a question of fact and degree in a particular taxpayer’s case, as to whether the facts show that the expenditure is more in the nature of on- going repairs, rather than a renewal of substantially the whole.
\[Interpretation statement IS0043, issued by Adjudication & Rulings in October 2004\] INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF TREATY OF WAITANGI SETTLEMENTS Introduction All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. The Crown has entered into settlements of claims in relation to historical breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi (“the Treaty”) with a number of Maori claimant groups and is in the process of negotiating settlements with other claimant groups. Generally the purpose of a Treaty settlement is to provide redress and compensation to Maori claimant groups for wrongs suffered as a result of historical breaches of the Treaty by the Crown. A Treaty settlement generally includes: • An agreed statement of the background to the claim, summarising the key facts about the history of the claim, an acknowledgement by the Crown of the wrongs done and an apology by the Crown for past injustices suffered by the claimant group and for breaches of the Treaty. • Cultural redress which is intended to meet the cultural rather than economic interests of the claimant group. Cultural redress may be made by a variety of means including gifting back sites of special significance to the claimant group, the recognition of the claimants’ mana by changing place names, a Deed of Recognition acknowledging the claimants’ association with a particular area and requiring consultation with the claimant group on specified matters. • Financial redress which may include cash, the return of land owned by the Crown and the right of first refusal to purchase specific Crown properties within a defined geographical area. As part of the settlement the Maori claimant group generally agrees to give certain undertakings (for example, to support the passing of the settlement legislation by Parliament) and agrees that the Treaty settlement will be in full and final settlement of the claimant group’s Treaty grievances. The Crown also provides funding for negotiations to claimant groups through the Office of Treaty Settlements (“the OTS”), which negotiates Treaty settlements on behalf of the Crown, to claimant groups who enter into direct negotiations with the Crown. The purpose of this Interpretation Statement is to consider: • Whether financial redress received by Maori claimant groups as compensation for historical breaches of the Treaty in settlement of claims lodged with the Waitangi Tribunal (whether as a result of the Crown’s acceptance of a recommendation of the Waitangi Tribunal or following direct negotiations with the Crown) are income; and • Whether funding for settlement negotiations provided by the Crown through the OTS is income. The Interpretation Statement does not address the income tax treatment of amounts subsequently derived from Treaty settlement payments, nor will it address other funding provided to claimant groups (such as funding provided by the Crown Forestry Rental Trust). This Interpretation Statement also does not deal with the question of whether any amount paid in addition to the financial redress agreed between the Crown and the claimants where there is a delay between settlement being reached and the financial redress being paid is income. Summary • Financial redress under a Treaty settlement is not income under section CD 3. Treaty settlement negotiations are not businesses in themselves and, in the event that any claimant groups are carrying on a business, Treaty settlements are not amounts derived from such a business. • Financial redress under a Treaty settlement is not income under ordinary concepts in terms of section CD 5. • Under section CB 5(1)(n) compensation paid under the Crown Forestry Assets Act 1989 to the successful claimants (except compensation based on market stumpage) is exempt income under section CB 5(1)(n) to the extent that in the absence of that provision the payments would be income. Compensation under the Crown Forestry Assets Act 1989 paid to the successful claimants on the return of Crown forestry land is not income under sections CD 3, CD 5, CE 1(1)(a) or (e), CE 2 or CJ 1. • Where the payment of the financial redress agreed under a Treaty settlement is delayed until settlement legislation is enacted, such redress is not gross income under section CE 1(1)(c). • Claimant funding provided by the Crown through the OTS is not income under ordinary concepts (section CD 5), nor is it an amount derived from a business (section CD 3). Claimant funding is not a payment to which section DC 1 applies as claimant funding is not provided in respect of any business carried on by claimant groups. Background In 1840 the Treaty was signed between the Crown and the Chiefs of the Confederation of United Tribes of New Zealand and a number of independent chiefs of New Zealand. Under the Treaty the Crown guaranteed to Maori “the full exclusive and undisturbed possession of their Lands and Estates Forests Fisheries and other properties which they may collectively or individually possess so long as it is their wish and desire to retain the same in their possession”. The Crown has accepted that this obligation was breached in some instances and that land was acquired from Maori in ways that breached the principles of the Treaty. A publication by the OTS, Healing the Past, Building a Future – a Guide to Treaty of Waitangi Claims and Negotiations with the Crown (“the OTS publication”) says that: Most historical Treaty claims involve one or more of the following types of land loss and alienation: 2 • purchases of Maori land by the Crown before 1865 (this includes pre-Treaty purchases later investigated and validated (“Old Land Claims”), Crown purchases and post-Treaty private purchases through the Crown’s waiver of its pre-emptive right), • confiscation of Maori land by the Crown under the New Zealand Settlements Act 1863, and or • transactions under the various Native Land Acts after 1865. (p. 41) A great deal of historical research has been done in respect of the three types of land claim by the Waitangi Tribunal, the Crown Forestry Rental Trust and the Crown, as a result of which the Crown has a good understanding of the types of land-based historical claims in every area of the country and the amount of land that was lost to Maori: see pp. 41-42 OTS publication. The OTS publication says that the Crown expects that for most claims involving large natural groups the research already completed will provide a sufficient basis to begin negotiations. However, extra research may need to be undertaken if the Crown and claimant negotiators need to agree whether particular breaches of the Treaty and its principles occurred (for example, because the claimants want the Crown to apologise for a particular action but the Crown does not initially accept that there has been a breach). Further research may also be needed on specific issues arising from a claim (for example, where more than one group is making claims over the same area or a particular site) (see pp. 42-43). The OTS publication also says: Because the Crown acknowledges that widespread breaches of the principles of the Treaty have occurred, it is now willing, if claimants wish to negotiate settlements of claims that include purchases before 1865, confiscation, and the operation and impact of the Native land laws after 1865. Claimants who want to negotiate to settle such claims do not need to go through Waitangi Tribunal Hearings or provide detailed research on each and every Crown action that they consider breached the principles of the Treaty. However, they do need to show the link between the Crown’s acts or omissions and the harm to their tupuna (ancestors). ... Although the impact of land loss on Maori society was often similar regardless of the way land was lost, the culpability (extent to which a party is wrong or to blame) of the Crown does differ from case to case. The Crown believes that the seriousness of each type of breach is different and redress should reflect that, but this is a matter for discussion during negotiations. (p. 42) The Crown has entered into settlements in respect of historical breaches of the Treaty with a number of Maori claimant groups and is in the process of negotiating other settlements. Historical breaches relate to the Crown’s actions or omissions up to 21 September 1992. The significance of that date is that it is the date on which Cabinet agreed on the general principles for settling Treaty claims. Settlement process The Waitangi Tribunal (“the Tribunal”) was established under the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975. The purpose of the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975 (“the TOWA”) is “to provide for the observance, and confirmation of the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi”. The Tribunal has exclusive authority to determine the meaning and effect of the Treaty as embodied in the Maori and English texts and to decide issues raised by differences between them: section 5(2) TOWA. The Tribunal’s main function is to inquire into and make recommendations to the Crown on claims submitted to the Tribunal by Maori: section 5 TOWA. 3 Any Maori may make a claim to the Tribunal: section 6 TOWA. The Tribunal has jurisdiction to consider the claim if the claim alleges a breach by the Crown of the principles of the Treaty that is alleged to affect the claimant prejudicially, either individually or by affecting a group of Maori of which the claimant is a member: section 6(1) TOWA. If the Tribunal finds that a claim is well-founded, it may recommend to the Crown that action be taken to compensate for or remove the prejudice or prevent other persons from being similarly prejudiced in the future: section 6(3) TOWA. The Tribunal can recommend both monetary compensation and the return of Crown land taken from Maori in breach of the principles of the Treaty and is required to identify the Maori or group of Maori to whom the land is to be returned: section 8(2) TOWA. Claimant groups may have claims investigated by the Waitangi Tribunal or they may pursue negotiations with the Crown. Claims must be lodged with the Tribunal before the Crown will begin negotiating with a claimant group but once a claim is lodged, the claimants can immediately seek negotiations with the Crown. Alternatively, the claimants may choose to have their claims heard by the Tribunal before entering negotiations: OTS publication p. 38. Some claimant groups have carried out direct negotiations with the OTS which is responsible for negotiating Treaty settlements on behalf of the Crown. The four steps of a direct negotiations process claim (as set out in the OTS publication) are as follows: • Preparing a claim for negotiation  An agreement by the Crown and the claimants to negotiate, which involves the Crown accepting that there is a well-founded grievance and the claimant group satisfying the Crown’s preference to negotiate with large natural groups that represent tribal interests (generally an iwi);  Conferral of the mandate of claimant group representatives by the claimant group and recognition of the mandate by the Crown;  The establishment of processes for consultation by claimant group negotiators with claimant group members on settlement issues and the development of a register of members. • Pre-negotiations  The signing of Terms of Negotiation which set out the ground rules for negotiations;  Approval by the relevant Ministers of the funding to claimants as a contribution to the cost of negotiations;  The claimant group identifying the areas or sites and Crown assets in which they are interested in seeking redress and the types of redress which they consider are appropriate in relation to those sites or areas. • Negotiations  The commencement of formal negotiations; 4  After sufficient progress in negotiations, the Minister in Charge of Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations may send a letter to the mandated representatives outlining the parameters of the Crown offer and seeking Agreement in Principle from the claimant group to the Crown offer. Alternatively, the Crown and mandated representatives can seek a more formal agreement (a Heads of Agreement ) which outlines the Crown’s settlement offer in more detail;  If the Agreement in Principle or the Heads of Agreement are signed by the Crown and mandated representatives a formal Deed of Settlement is prepared for initialling by the mandated representatives. • Ratification and implementation  Consultation with and ratification by members of the claimant group;  Signing the Deed of Settlement;  Implementation of the settlement, which normally requires the passing of settlement legislation. The members of a claimant group must agree on a governance entity for holding and managing settlement assets. The Crown cannot transfer settlement assets until the claimant group has a governance entity that has been considered and ratified by members of the group (pp. 71-72 OTS publication). Settlements A Treaty settlement generally includes: • An agreed statement of the background to the claim, summarising the key facts about the history of the claim, an acknowledgement by the Crown of its responsibility for breaches of the Treaty and its principles and recognition of their impact on the claimant group and an apology by the Crown for past injustices suffered by the claimant group and for breaches of the Treaty. The OTS publication says that it is considered that the Crown’s apology lays the foundation for settling historical claims of the claimant group and is a significant step towards rebuilding the relationship between the Crown and claimant group (p. 85); • Cultural redress which is intended to meet the cultural rather than economic interests of the claimant group. The aim of cultural redress is to address historical grievances arising from the loss of ownership or guardianship of sites of spiritual or cultural significance, loss of access to traditional foods or resources and exclusion from decision-making on the environment or resources with cultural significance: see p. 96 OTS publication. Cultural redress may be made by a variety of means including gifting back sites of special significance to the claimant group, the recognition of the traditional place-names and the return of moveable taonga (artefacts). : see pp. 98-99 OTS publication; • Financial redress which may include cash and the transfer of commercial assets owned by the Crown and the right of first refusal to purchase specific Crown properties within a defined geographical area. 5 As part of the settlement, claimant groups are required to give certain undertakings (such as an undertaking to support the passing of settlement legislation in Parliament) or agreements (such as agreement that the settlement will be in full and final settlement of the claimant group’s Treaty grievance). The Crown’s policy is that Treaty settlements are final. The settlement legislation prevents the courts, the Tribunal or any other judicial body or tribunal from re-opening the historical claims. See p. 32 OTS publication Crown Forestry settlements Crown forestry settlements are in a special category because of the settlement in respect of New Zealand Maori Council v AG \[1989\] 2 NZLR 142 (the Crown Forestry Assets case). The terms of the settlement were ultimately enacted in the Crown Forestry Assets Act 1989 (“the CFAA”). The case was one of a series of cases taken under section 9 of the State- Owned Enterprises Act 1986 (“the SOE Act”). Section 9 of the SOE Act provided that nothing in that Act shall permit the Crown to act in a manner which is inconsistent with the Treaty. In an earlier case (NZ Maori Council v AG \[1987\] 1 NZLR 641 (“the Lands case”)) the Court of Appeal had held that the relationship between the Crown and Maori under the Treaty had created responsibilities analogous to a fiduciary relationship and that the Crown had an active duty to act to protect the Maori people in the use of their lands (pp. 663-664); therefore, in terms of section 9 of the SOE Act, the Crown was required to ensure that that Act was administered in a manner which ensured Maori land claims were safeguarded. As a consequence, a system of memorials on land transferred to SOEs had been developed under the Treaty of Waitangi (State Enterprises) Act 1988 (provisions which are now contained in the SOE Act). Land sold with memorials on the titles for the land could be compulsorily re- acquired by the Crown following a decision by the Tribunal: section 27B SOE Act. This system applied to any land transferred by the Crown to Forestcorp Ltd. However, the Government of the day accepted a recommendation of a Forestry Working Group (established to report to the Ministers of Finance and State-Owned Enterprises as to the appropriate form in which the Crown’s forestry assets should be sold) that, instead of transferring land to Forestcorp, Crown forestry land be retained and a right to manage the land and to cut the trees on it for a specified period be sold; it was considered that this procedure would enable the value of Crown forestry assets to be maximised while taking into account the existence of Treaty issues in respect of Crown forestry assets: see summary of facts in the Crown Forests Assets case . If this procedure was followed, the memorial system would not have applied to Crown forestry land, as the memorial system applied only when the land was transferred. In the Crown Forests Assets case the Maori Council sought leave from the Court of Appeal to take the matter back to court under the leave reserved to do so in the Lands case. The Court of Appeal held that the Maori Council’s application was within the scope of the leave given and added the following observations (which indicated the court’s likely approach in any substantive hearing): It may be as well to add some observations, in the hope of helping resolution of the problem. In the judgments in 1987 this Court stressed the concept of partnership. We think it right to say that the good faith owed to each other by the parties to the Treaty must extend to consultation on truly major issues. That is really clear beyond argument. It seems that in relation to its new proposal the Government was in effect so advised by the Forestry Working Group in para 25 of their Report, already quoted. As yet the evidence before the Court does not indicate whether or not the Government accepted that recommendation. It is a matter which may be clarified if there has to be a further hearing of the case. Partnership certainly does not mean that every asset or resource in which Maori have some justifiable claim to share must be divided equally. There may be national assets or resources which, even if Maori have some fair 6 claim other initiatives have still made the greater contribution. For example – and it is only an example – that might well be true of some pine forests. Moreover, the common interests may point to the sale of forestry rights, or some of them, to the best commercial advantage. But, as the Forestry Working Group recognised, it would be inconsistent with the principles of the Treaty to reach a decision as to whether there should be a general sale without consultation. (p. 152) Therefore, the court considered that the Crown had an obligation under the Treaty to consult with Maori in relation to the Crown’s proposals for the sale of the forests. The court also raised as a possibility that Maori may not have a right under the Treaty to an equal share of exotic forests. Following the judgment a settlement was negotiated. The settlement agreement was enshrined in the CFAA. In his speech in the debate on the introduction of the Crown Forest Assets Bill (NZPD Vol 499, 1989: 11626) the Minister of State-Owned Enterprises outlined the features of the agreement between Maori and the Crown and what it was intended to achieve as follows: The agreement acknowledges that the Crown will sell the existing exotic tree crop and forestry-related assets. Purchasers will be granted a right to use the land for a term that is “evergreen” – that is, it is extended automatically by a period of 1 year until notice of termination is given. The “evergreen” term – and the termination period, if triggered – will be of sufficient length to let any tree crop established by the purchaser reach maturity, and be harvested in accordance with accepted forestry practice. Consideration for the sale will comprise an initial capital payment for the existing tree crop and related assets, and an annual market-based rental for the use of the land, which remains in the ownership of the Crown. Should the Waitangi Tribunal recommend against resumption of the land the Crown’s ownership and related rights will be confirmed. If, however, the Tribunal recommends the return of the land and part or all of the tree crop to Maori ownership, a number of options for compensation from the Crown will be open to Maori. It is important that the purchaser of the cutting rights and associated assets will in no way be involved in the compensation payment to the successful claimant, nor would the purchaser require compensation from the Crown. It is an important principle that the contract between the Crown and the purchaser remains unfettered. That principle will be met. In that way, any discount involved in the transaction for the perceived risk of successful land claims will be minimised, if not totally removed. From the time of the sale of the forest until a Waitangi Tribunal recommendation, land rental payments will be put into a fund administered by a trust known as the Rental Trust. Final beneficiaries of the trust will be the successful claimants, or, if the claim should be unsuccessful, the Crown. ... The State forests were originally intended to be covered by the Treaty of Waitangi (State Enterprises) Act. The fact that they have not been covered by that Act is the result of an unusual set of circumstances resulting from the Government’s decision not to transfer the Crown forestry assets to the Forestry Corporation. The Treaty implications of the forests are therefore unique. They are in no way a precedent for any other asset sale. The agreement is better for New Zealand – for the Government, for the taxpayers, for Maori, and for pakeha – than using the Treaty of Waitangi (State Enterprises) Act. It has been estimated that without such an agreement the value of sales of the Crown’s forestry assets might have been discounted by as much as 20 percent because of purchasers’ concerns about tenure. \[emphasis added\] In the second reading debate (NZPD Vol 502, 1989: 12997) the Minister of Forestry said: I come back to the part of the Bill in which the government has made provision to ensure that Maori interests are fairly dealt with. That provision comes about after agreement with those persons who negotiated on behalf of the Maori people and at the direction of the court. The effect of the provision is this: Crown licences will be tendered and Crown licences will be sold. If the Waitangi Tribunal should find subsequently that the land on which those forests stand ought to be returned to Maori people the Crown undertakes that the land will be transferred to those Maori people. 7 In the meantime all of the annual rentals will be placed in a rental trust – not touched by the Government – and, in the event that the Waitangi Tribunal finds in favour of the Maori people, the rental trusts and the moneys in them will be transferred to the Maori people. After the finding of the Waitangi Tribunal, all further rents will accrue to the new owners, the Maori people, but the rights of the purchaser of the forests – namely, of that person or company – are protected up to the stage at which their Crown licence ceases. Under the CFAA (which reflects the terms of the agreement reached between Maori and the Crown), Crown forestry land is to remain in Crown ownership but the Crown may issue forestry licences and “Crown forestry assets” (being forests that comprise principally exotic trees growing or standing on Crown forest land) can be transferred to the holders of such licences: sections 11 and 14 CFAA. Each licence must contain a provision that if the licensed land is required to be returned to Maori, notice terminating the licence will be given at the end of 35 years from the 30 September after the end of the initial term (if notice is given during the initial fixed term) or at the end of 35 years from the 30 September next after the date of notice: section 17(4). The Crown Forestry Rental Trust was established to hold all rents on forest land until Maori claims to forests had been determined by the Tribunal: section 34 CFAA. Under the terms of the Trust interest on the Trust’s funds was to be applied in assisting Maori claimants in the preparation, presentation and negotiation of their claims: see Latimer v CIR (2002) 20 NZTC 17,737. If a claim is successful and the Tribunal’s recommendation is accepted by the Crown: • the forestry land will be returned subject to the relevant forestry licence; • rentals under the licence held by the Crown Forestry Rental Trust and future rental will be paid to the successful claimants; and • the Crown must pay compensation to the claimants, in accordance with Schedule 1 to the CFAA: section 36 CFAA. Clause 1 of the First Schedule provides that compensation is to be paid on to Maori to whom ownership of the land is transferred. Under clause 2 the amount of the compensation is to be: (a) Five percent of the specified amount calculated in accordance with clause 3 of this Schedule as compensation for the fact that the land is being returned subject to encumbrances; and (b) As further compensation, the remaining portion of the specified amount calculated in accordance with clause 3 of this Schedule or such lesser amount as the Tribunal may recommend. Clause 3 provides that the person to whom compensation is payable (that is, the successful claimants) may nominate any of the following amounts as the “specified amount” referred to in clause 2: • The market value of the trees that may be harvested under the Crown forestry licence as at the time the recommendation for the return of land to Maori ownership becomes final (clause 3(a); or • The market stumpage, determined in accordance with accepted forestry business practice, of wood harvested under the Crown forestry licence on the land to be returned to Maori 8 ownership from the date that the recommendation of the Tribunal for the return of the land to Maori ownership becomes final under the TOWA (clause 3(b). “Stumpage” is defined in the New Zealand Institute of Forestry Professional Handbook (May 1999) as follows: The value of the standing tree. Usually expressed as the value per cubic metre (or tonne) of the logs by quality in the tree. Generally derived from the sale value of the log at a sale point (eg. “at mill”, “at wharf gate” or “on skid”) by deduction of all the costs incurred in getting the tree off the stump to that point of sale.; or • The net proceeds received by the Crown from the transfer of the Crown forestry assets to which the land to be returned relates, plus a return on those proceeds for the period between transfer and the return of the land to Maori ownership (clause 3(c). Clause 5 provides that for the purpose of clause 3(c) the return on the proceeds received shall be such amount as is necessary to maintain the real value of those proceeds during either of the following periods:  If the claim was filed before the transfer occurred, a period of not more than 4 years from the date of transfer;  If the claim was filed after the date of transfer, the period from the date of transfer to the expiration of 4 years after the claim was filed and for any period after the relevant period, an amount equal to the return on one year New Zealand Government stock measured on a rolling annual basis plus an additional margin of 4 percent per annum. Funding for negotiations The Crown, through the OTS, will provide a contribution to the costs of direct negotiations. The amount of the funding depends on the features of the claimant group (how big the claimant group is, how scattered, whether consultation will require hui, tribal structures) and the complexity of the claim. Any claimant funding provided by the OTS is granted for the purposes of negotiations only and not for reimbursing research costs: p. 43 OTS publication. Funding will not be provided to a claimant group unless the representatives of a claimant group have established that they have a mandate to represent the group but once mandating has been established, the Crown will consider reimbursement for mandating costs already incurred. Payments are then made by instalments of no more than $50,000 at a time. Each payment will be linked to the progress of negotiations and reaching the most important milestones. The OTS requires that audited accounts be provided to the OTS once the milestones relating to the claimant funding have been achieved. Audited accounts must be provided at least every twelve months regardless of whether the milestones have been achieved. Invoices must be provided for every tranche up to $50,000 before the tranche may be released. Claimant funding does not represent an advance in respect of financial redress under a Treaty settlement. The funding provided will be over and above any money or other assets eventually given to the claimant group as redress for its historical Treaty claims. If a claimant group incurs costs over and above the amount of approved funding, in exceptional circumstances, the Crown may consider providing additional funding which is likely to be a payment “on account” of the final settlement. Once settlement has been reached, any approved claimant funding which have not been spent will be paid to the claimant group. Refer p. 56 OTS publication. 9 Legislation Section CB 5(1)(n) provides: To the extent that in the absence of this section the following amounts would be gross income, they are exempt income: ... (n) Payments made to any person as compensation under the First Schedule (except clause 3(b)) of the Crown Forest Assets Act 1989. Section CD 3 provides: The gross income of any person includes any amount derived from any business. The definition of “business” in section OB 1 reads as follows: “Business” (a) Includes any profession, trade, manufacture, or undertaking carried on for pecuniary profit: (b) Is further defined in Schedule 6A for the purposes of that Schedule: Section CD 5 provides: The gross income of any person includes any amount that is included in gross income under ordinary concepts. Section CE 1(1)(a), (c) and (e) provide: The gross income of any person includes— (a) All interest, investment society dividends, and annuities: Provided that where any securities have been acquired by purchase otherwise during the income year, the Commissioner may, where the Commissioner considers it equitable so to do, apportion between the transferor and the transferee any interest due or accruing due at the date of the transfer and not then paid: ... (c) Income derived under the accrual rules: ... (e) All rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues (including payment for or in respect of the goodwill of any business, or the benefit of any statutory licence or privilege) derived by the owner of land from any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land, or from the grant of any right of taking the profits of the land. Section CE 2 provides: Subject to sections CJ 1 and FF 7, the gross income of any person includes any amount derived from the use or occupation of any land: 10 Sections CJ 1(1) and (2) provide: (1) The gross income of any person shall include any amount (including an amount deemed to have been realised under section FB 4 or section GD 1 or section GD 2) derived in any income year from— (a) The extraction, removal, or sale or other disposition of any minerals, flax, or timber; or (b) The sale or other disposition of any right to take timber,— whether by the owner of the land from or on which the minerals, flax, or timber are obtained or situated or by any other person. (2) A sale or disposition of land with standing timber on the land, except to the extent that the timber is— (a) Timber comprised in ornamental or incidental trees; or (b) Subject to a forestry right (as defined in section 2 of the Forestry Rights Registration Act 1983) registered under the Land Transfer Act 1952; or (c) Subject to a profit à prendre granted before 1 January 1984,— shall be deemed to include a sale or other disposition of timber for the purposes of this section (whether or not the sale or other disposition includes other land or other assets or the land and timber are assets of a business), and in every such case— (d) the part of the consideration attributable to the timber, including the amount determined under section FB 4, GD 1 or GD 2, is to be treated as the consideration paid for the timber; and (e) the amount of consideration under paragraph (d) is treated as— (i) gross income of the person selling or otherwise disposing of the land; and (ii) the cost of the timber to the person acquiring the land. Section DC 1 provides: (1) This section shall apply in respect of— (a) Any payment (in this section referred to as a “grant”) made to any taxpayer in any income year by the Development Finance Corporation of New Zealand or the New Zealand Film Commission or by any department or instrument of the Executive Government of New Zealand or any local authority, being a payment in the nature of a subsidy or grant in respect of any business carried on by that taxpayer other than a payment to which section CC 3 or section DL 3 (except section DL 3(6)), applies: (b) Any expenditure in respect of which a grant is made. (2) Where, and to the extent that, in any income year, a grant is made to any taxpayer in respect of expenditure incurred by the taxpayer (not being expenditure of any of the kinds referred to in subsection (3)) that is allowed as a deduction under this Act, the amount of the deduction otherwise allowed, in respect of that expenditure shall be reduced by the amount of that grant, and the amount of that grant shall be deemed not to be gross income of that taxpayer. (3) Where, and to the extent that, a grant is made to any taxpayer in respect of expenditure incurred by that taxpayer in the acquisition, construction, installation, or extension of any asset (being an asset in respect of which a deduction for depreciation is allowed under this Act), the amount of that expenditure shall, for the purposes of determining the amount of any deduction allowed in respect of the depreciation of that asset, be deemed to be reduced by the amount of that grant, and the amount of that grant shall be deemed not to be gross income of the taxpayer. (4) Subject to section DC 3, this section shall not apply to the amount of any payment in the nature of an advance or loan. 11 (5) For the purpose of giving effect to this section, the Commissioner may at any time amend any assessment, notwithstanding the time bar. Section EB 1(1) provides: (1) For the purposes of this Act an amount shall be deemed to have been derived by a person although it has not been actually paid to or received by the person, or already become due or receivable, but has been credited in account, or reinvested, or accumulated, or capitalised, or carried to any reserve, sinking, or insurance fund, or otherwise dealt with in the person's interest or on the person's behalf. Section EH 21(1) provides: The accrual rules apply to a person who is a party to a financial arrangement and who is a New Zealand resident. “Financial arrangement” is defined in section EH 22(1) as follows: (1) A financial arrangement is (a) a debt or debt instrument, including a debt that arises by law; (b) an arrangement (that may include a debt or debt instrument or an excepted financial arrangement) under which a person receives money in consideration for a person providing money to any person (i) at a future time, or (ii) when an event occurs in the future or does not occur (whether or not the event occurs because notice is or is not given). Relevant provisions of the Crown Forests Assets Act 1989 (“the CFAA”) are set out below Section 11 of the CFAA provides: ( 1) The responsible Ministers may, on behalf of the Crown, transfer Crown forestry assets to any person for such consideration, and on such terms and conditions, as the responsible Ministers may agree with that person. (2) Crown forestry assets that are described in paragraph (a) of the definition of that term in section 2 of this Act may only be transferred to a person to whom it is proposed to grant a Crown forestry licence in respect of the land on which those assets are situated. (3) Nothing in subsection (2) of this section prevents the transfer of any Crown forestry assets referred to in that subsection in compliance with— (a) The terms of any contract that existed immediately before the commencement of this Act; or (b) The terms of any contract that the responsible Ministers consider appropriate to enter into in accordance with current accepted business practice; ... Section 13 of the CFAA provides: Notwithstanding any Act or rule of law, Crown forestry assets growing or standing on, or fixed to, or under or over, any land may be transferred under section 11 of this Act, notwithstanding that neither the land nor any interest in the land is being transferred. For the purposes of that transfer, the assets and the land shall be regarded as separate assets each capable of separate ownership. 12 Section 17 of the CFAA provides: (1) For the purposes of this section termination period means the period of 35 years at the end of which a Crown forestry licence terminates in relation to the licensed land or any part of it. (2) Subject to this section, every Crown forestry licence that relates to Crown forest land that is situated in a district specified in the Schedule 3 to this Act, or on which a forest specified in that Schedule is located, shall comprise, as an initial fixed term, the term set out opposite that district or forest, as the case may be, in that Schedule, and shall then run from year to year by way of automatic extension. (3) Subject to this section, every other Crown forestry licence shall run from year to year by way of automatic extension. (4) Every Crown forestry licence shall provide that if a recommendation is made under section 8HB(1)(a) of the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975 that becomes a final recommendation under that Act for the return of the licensed land, or any part of it, to Maori— (a) The responsible Ministers shall give notice to the licensee that the recommendation has become a final recommendation: (b) Notice shall be given to the licensee terminating the licence, or terminating the licence in so far as it relates to part of the licensed land, as the case may be,— (i) If the notice is given during the initial fixed term, at the expiration of a period of 35 years commencing on the 30th day of September next after the end of that term; or (ii) If the notice is given after the initial fixed term, or if the licence does not comprise an initial fixed term, at the expiration of a period of 35 years commencing on the 30th day of September next after the date on which the notice is given: (c) In relation to the licensed land, or that part of it to which a notice of termination applies, as the case may be,— (i) During the termination period the rights of the licensee under the licence in respect of that land shall be restricted to protecting, managing, harvesting, and processing the tree crops standing on that land at the commencement of that period; and (ii) The licensee shall exercise those rights in accordance with accepted forestry business practice; and (iii) The licensee shall, during the termination period, from time to time in accordance with the licence, give notice to the licensor of those parts of that land, including buildings and other fixed structures, roads, tracks, and access ways, that are no longer required by the licensee for exercising the licensee's rights under the licence during that period; and (iv) The licensor shall take possession of any land referred to in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph notified as being no longer required, and the licence shall cease to apply to that land except for provisions that relate to the rights and obligations of the parties during the balance of the termination period. (5) Every Crown forestry licence shall provide that if a recommendation is made under section 8HB(1)(b) or section 8HB(1)(c) or section 8HE of the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975 that the licensed land, or part of it, not be liable to be returned to Maori ownership,— (a) The licence shall, as regards the licensed land or any part of it to which the recommendation relates, be deemed to have been granted for an initial fixed term of 35 years whether or not the licence comprised an initial fixed term in accordance with subsection (2) of this section and whether or not the licence has been in force for the whole or part of that term: 13 (b) Notice may be given to the licensee terminating the licence— (i) If the notice is given during the initial fixed term, at the expiration of a period of 35 years commencing on the 30th day of September next after the end of that term; or (ii) If the notice is given after the expiration of the initial fixed term, at the expiration of a period of 35 years commencing on the 30th day of September next after the date on which the notice is given: (c) Subject to the terms and conditions of the licence and to any enactment or rule of law, the licensee shall have the right, while the licence remains in force, to use the licensed land for any purpose whether or not it relates to the harvesting, planting, management or processing of trees on the licensed land. Section 36 of the CFAA provides: (1) Where any interim recommendation of the Waitangi Tribunal under the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975 becomes a final recommendation under that Act and is a recommendation for the return to Maori ownership of any licensed land, the Crown shall— (a) Return the land to Maori ownership in accordance with the recommendation subject to the relevant Crown forestry licence; and (b) Pay compensation in accordance with the Schedule 1 to this Act. (2) Except as otherwise provided in this Act or any relevant Crown forestry licence, the return of any land to Maori ownership shall not affect any Crown forestry licence or the rights of the licensee or any other person under the licence. (3) Any money required to be paid as compensation pursuant to this section may be paid without further appropriation than this section. Schedule 1 of the CFAA reads as follows: 1. Compensation payable under section 36 of this Act shall be payable to the Maori to whom ownership of the land concerned is transferred. 2. That compensation shall comprise— (a) Five percent of the specified amount calculated in accordance with clause 3 of this Schedule as compensation for the fact that the land is being returned subject to encumbrances; and (b) As further compensation, the remaining portion of the specified amount calculated in accordance with clause 3 of this Schedule or such lesser amount as the Tribunal may recommend. 3. For the purposes of clause 2 of this Schedule, the specified amount shall be whichever of the following is nominated by the person to whom the compensation is payable— (a) The market value of the trees, being trees which the licensee is entitled to harvest under the Crown forestry licence, on the land to be returned assessed as at the time that the recommendation made by the Tribunal for the return of the land to Maori ownership becomes final under the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975. The value is to be determined on the basis of a willing buyer and willing seller and on the projected harvesting pattern that a prudent forest owner would be expected to follow; or (b) The market stumpage, determined in accordance with accepted forestry business practice, of wood harvested under the Crown forestry licence on the land to be returned to Maori ownership from the date that the recommendation of the Tribunal for the return of the land to Maori ownership becomes final under the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975. If notice of 14 termination of the Crown forestry licence as provided for under section 17(4) of this Act is not given at, or prior to, the date that the recommendation becomes final, the specified amount shall be limited to the value of wood harvested as if notice of termination had been given on that date; or (c) The net proceeds received by the Crown from the transfer of the Crown forestry assets to which the land to be returned relates, plus a return on those proceeds for the period between transfer and the return of the land to Maori ownership. 4. For the purposes of clause 3(c) of this Schedule, if the land to be returned is included within an area that was offered for sale as a single lot, the transfer proceeds in relation to each hectare of land returned to Maori ownership shall be not less than an amount equal to the average price per hectare of the forest lot specified in the selling process; except that— (a) Where a bid is accepted for a number of lots as one parcel, the average price shall be based on the price for the total parcel; and (b) Where the lot concerned had an average age of less than 5 years, the average price applied shall be the average price of all lots transferred within the same Crown Forestry Management Limited administrative district existing at the time of transfer. 5. For the purposes of clause 3(c) of this Schedule, the return on the proceeds received by the Crown shall be— (a) Such amount as is necessary to maintain the real value of those proceeds during either— (i) In the case where the claim was filed before the transfer occurred, a period of not more than 4 years from the date of transfer of the Crown forestry assets; or (ii) In the case where the claim was filed after the date of transfer of the Crown forestry assets, the period from the date of transfer of the Crown forestry assets to the date of expiration of 4 years after the claim was filed; and (b) In respect of any period after the period described in subparagraph (i) or subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (a) of this clause (as extended under clause 6 of this Schedule), equivalent to the return on one year New Zealand Government stock measured on a rolling annual basis, plus an additional margin of 4 percent per annum. For the purposes of this clause, a claim shall be deemed to be filed on such date as is certified by the Registrar of the Tribunal. 6. The period of 4 years referred to in clause 5 of this Schedule may be extended by the Tribunal where the Tribunal is satisfied— (a) That a claimant with adequate resources has wilfully delayed proceedings in respect of a claim; or (b) The Crown is prevented, by reasons beyond its control, from carrying out any relevant obligation under the agreement made on the 20th day of July 1989 between the Crown, the New Zealand Maori Council, and the Federation of Maori Authorities Incorporated. 7. All payments under this Schedule, other than payments for the purposes of clause 3(b) of this Schedule, shall be made within 2 months after the date of the Tribunal's recommendation, or such later date as the Tribunal may direct, or the parties may agree. 8. All payments for the purposes of clause 3(b) of this Schedule shall be calculated at 3 monthly intervals and shall be paid within one month of the relevant 3 monthly period. 15 9. Payments under this Schedule, other than payments made for the purposes of clause 3(c) of this Schedule on which interest is payable in accordance with clause 5(b) of this Schedule, shall not bear interest. “Crown forestry assets” is defined in the CFAA as follows: Crown forestry assets means— (a) Every forest that comprises principally exotic trees growing or standing on Crown forest land; and (b) All improvements on, or associated with, Crown forest land and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, includes: (i) All buildings and other structures affixed to that land; and (ii) All roads, tracks, accessways, firebreaks, bridges, culverts, irrigation works, erosion works, water-races, drainage works, water storage, and all works and services related to the prevention, detection, or fighting of fire; and (c) All plant, equipment, vehicles, tools, logs, consumable supplies, raw materials, forest produce and stores used or associated with the management of other Crown forestry assets; and (d) The forest stand records of the Crown; and (e) All rights (whether vested or contingent) under leases, licences, agreements for sale and purchase, profits à prendre, easements (including easements in gross), rights to take standing timber and growing crops, and any other form of right to occupy or use land other than Crown forest land; and (f) All patents, trademarks, copyright, and other intellectual property rights (whether protected by registration or other formal process, or not) and all planning and other statutory consents used in connection with the management of Crown forestry assets or Crown forest land; and (g) Shares or other securities in companies holding Crown forestry assets and shares or other securities held by the Crown for forestry purposes; and (h) All contracts entered into by the Crown in respect of Crown forestry assets referred to in the preceding paragraphs of this definition or the use of Crown forest land— but does not include contracts that are not capable of assignment by the Crown and the leases or licences specified in the Schedule 2 to this Act: Analysis Whether amount derived from any business – section CD 3 A business “includes “any profession, trade, manufacture, or undertaking carried on for pecuniary profit”. For there to be a business there must be a genuine intention to make a profit. In order to determine whether the activity is carried on with the intention of making a profit, the taxpayer’s subjective evidence of intention is relevant but must be tested against objective evidence. It is, therefore, necessary to consider both the nature of the taxpayer’s activities and the intention of the taxpayer in engaging in those activities. Factors that may be relevant in considering whether a taxpayer is carrying on a business include: the nature of the activity, the period during which the activity is engaged in, the scale of operations and the volume of transactions, the commitment of time, money and effort, the pattern of activity and the financial results. The fundamental concept of a business is that it is an activity that is 16 carried on in an organised, systematic and coherent manner that is directed at the end result of obtaining a profit. See Grieve v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,682. Not every receipt by a taxpayer who carries on a business is income under section CD 3. Section CD 3 applies to amounts derived “from any business”. The amount in question must be income and it will be income if it is derived from the current operations of the business, ie, it is “an ordinary incident of the business” or derived “in the ordinary course of the business”. In CIR v City Motor Service Ltd \[1969\] NZLR 1010 Turner J said: ... in my opinion in the words “from the business” of the company something more is meant than merely “as a result of the fact that the company was carrying on this business”. I think that from the business must mean from the current operations of the business.” ...remembering that Income Tax is always a tax on Income I conclude without difficulty that the words “from any business” in an Income Tax Act must mean “from the current operations of any business” and no more. They are not, in my opinion, apt to include accretions to the capital assets of the taxpayer which although they may result from the fact of his carrying on business, yet do not arise from the actual operations of that business. (p. 1017) ... But income tax being “always a tax on income”, the crucial question in New Zealand must therefore in result be the same as that in Australia. Is the receipt income or capital? If it is gains or profits from a business, then the question reduces itself to whether these were derived from the current operations of the business, and therefore income, or whether no more than can be contended, as regard their connection with the business, than that without the existence of the business they would not have accrued. If no more than this last can be proved, the gains cannot be assessable income, and simply because they are not derived from the current operations of the business. (pp. 1017-1019) In order to determine whether amounts are income from a business it is necessary to consider the nature of the business and the relationship of the transactions under which the amounts are received to the business. In AA Finance Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,383 Richardson J said: Whether gains produced in a business are revenue or capital depends on the nature of the business and the relationship of the transactions producing the gain to the conduct of the business. The classic statement in that regard is that of the Lord Justice Clerk in California Copper Syndicate Ltd (Limited and Reduced) v Harris (Surveyor of Taxes) (1904 5 TC 159 at p 166 that: “... enhanced values obtained from realisation or conversion of securities may be so assessable, where what is done is not merely a realisation or conversion of investment, but an act done in what is truly the carrying on, or carrying out, of a business.” Liability to tax does not depend on showing that the taxpayer is carrying on a separate business of dealing in investments. A transaction may be part of the ordinary business of the taxpayer or, short of that, an ordinary incident of the business activity of the taxpayer although not its main activity. A gain made in the ordinary course of carrying on the business is thus stamped with an income character. (p. 11,391) Whether the pursuit of a Treaty settlement is a business in itself A claimant group is normally a tribal-based group. A Treaty settlement is negotiated and entered into by representatives of that group on behalf of the members of the group and must be ratified by the members before it is binding on the claimant group. Financial redress negotiated under a Treaty settlement is transferred to and managed by the claimant group’s 17 governance entity. Before the Crown transfers financial redress, the Crown must be satisfied that the claimant group’s governance entity is fully accountable to the members. Under the Treaty the Crown guaranteed to Maori property rights existing as at the date of the Treaty. The breach of that obligation forms the basis for Treaty claims for financial redress. The purpose of the financial redress is to compensate the claimants for the economic losses resulting from the Crown’s breaches of the Treaty. The OTS publication says: Financial and commercial redress also recognise that where claims for the loss of land and/or resources are established, the Crown’s breaches of the principles of the Treaty will usually have held back the full economic development of the claimant group concerned. The Crown does not provide full compensation based on a calculation of total losses to the claimant group... but it does contribute to re-establishing an economic base as a platform for future development. (p. 87) In determining the quantum of redress that is offered, the Crown takes into account the amount of land lost to the claimant group through the Crown’s Treaty breaches, the relative seriousness of the breaches involved, the benchmarks set by existing settlements for similar grievances. Secondary factors are the size of the claimant group today, whether there are any overlapping claims and any other special factors: refer OTS publication p. 89. A purpose of a Treaty claim is to obtain compensation for economic losses resulting from the Crown’s breaches of its obligations under the Treaty. Those obligations include a guarantee of property rights held by Maori as at the date of the Treaty: see NZ Maori Council v AG \[1989\] 2 NZLR 142; NZ Maori Council v AG \[1994\] 1 NZLR 513. Essentially the loss for which compensation is received is a loss of a capital nature. A Treaty settlement also generally has a dimension beyond the compensation for economic losses. The other elements of a settlement are the Crown’s apology and acknowledgement, and cultural redress. The Crown’s acknowledgement and apology and cultural redress (which normally form part of the settlement reached) are intended to recognise non-economic losses of the claimant group. Normally Treaty settlement deeds include a statement setting out the historical events giving rise to grievances, an acknowledgement by the Crown of acceptance of responsibility for the breaches and an apology by the Crown for its acts or omissions. The Crown’s apology and acknowledgement are considered to be an important contribution to the settlement of Treaty grievances. The OTS publication states that it is recognised that excessive land loss had a harmful effect on Maori social development and has been accompanied by the loss of access to forests, waterways, food resources and places of spiritual and cultural value: p. 18. “Cultural redress” is intended to address concerns raised by claimant groups in negotiations regarding issues of cultural, rather than economic, significance to the claimant groups. Cultural redress includes provision for consultation on the management, control or ownership of sites, areas or customary resources on Crown-owned land with which the claimant group has traditional and cultural associations and recognition of traditional place names. The OTS publication says that issues of cultural significance have often been raised by claimant groups in negotiations with the Crown. Under the test in Grieve both the taxpayer’s intention, and the nature and scale of the activity carried on by the taxpayer, are relevant in determining whether the taxpayer is carrying on a business. A Treaty settlement is a one-off event as the Crown seeks a comprehensive 18 settlement of all claims of a claimant group and the Crown’s policy is that all settlements are to be final. A Treaty claim does not involve regular and recurrent transactions by claimant groups but the pursuit of a Treaty claim is carried on in an organised, systematic and coherent manner, generally over a period of years, with a view to obtaining a significant amount under a Treaty settlement. However, the Commissioner considers that the making of a Treaty claim is not for that reason a business. A Treaty claim is carried on with the intention of recovering compensation for past wrongs, in the form of economic redress, cultural redress and also an acknowledgement and apology from the Crown for its breaches of the Treaty, rather than with the intention of profit. A Treaty claim is not a purely commercial activity. The acknowledgement and apology and the cultural redress are regarded as important aspects of settlements. A Treaty claim is undertaken in order to recover compensation for a past loss rather than to make a profit. Whether financial redress under a Treaty settlement is an amount derived from another business The governance entities which receive Treaty settlement assets on behalf of claimant groups may either be existing entities or entities established for the purpose of receiving Treaty settlements. Some governance entities may carry on activities outside the Treaty claim and such activities may be businesses. It is also possible that individual members of the claimant group, on whose behalf the settlement assets are received, may be carrying on a business and the individual members of a claimant group may be deemed by section EB 1 to have derived the settlement payment, on the basis that settlement payments have been dealt with in their interest or on their behalf by the entity which has received the settlement. (However, in some cases the settlement legislation has expressly provided that the settlement is for the benefit of the claimant group and not for the benefit of any individual, particular marae or particular hapu, except to the extent determined otherwise after the settlement by the governance entity: see section 467 Ngai Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998; section 17 Pouakani Claims Settlement Act 2000.) The Commissioner considers that even if the claimant group or individual members of the group were carrying on a business, a Treaty settlement is not an amount derived from any business carried on by such persons. A Treaty claim does not involve regular or recurrent transactions. The Crown’s policy is that settlements are to be final settlement of all historical claims of the claimant group. A Treaty settlement is not a transaction that is entered into as part of the ordinary operations of any business carried on by a claimant group. The Treaty itself is not an ordinary commercial contract and is regarded as having constitutional significance: see NZ Maori Council v AG \[1994\] 1 NZLR 513. The majority of claims involve land claims. The basis for financial redress under a Treaty settlement is that land or other resources have been lost to the claimant groups as a result of the Crown’s Treaty breaches. The OTS publication indicates that financial redress under Treaty settlements recognises that Treaty breaches resulting in loss of land or other resources have had a detrimental effect on the overall economic position of claimant groups. The OTS publication says that: Commercial and financial redress recognises that where claims for the loss of land and/or resources are established, the Crown’s breaches of the principles of the Treaty will usually have held back the full economic development of the claimant group concerned. ... 19 It is impossible to put a precise value on the economic losses resulting from most Treaty breaches. This is because so much time has passed, and because the effects of various causes on the economic status of the claimant group today is such a complex matter European settlement has also brought benefits to Maori that cannot be easily expressed in money terms. However, many commentators estimate that the losses to Maori amount to tens of billions of dollars. (p.87-89) Financial redress under a Treaty settlement is paid to compensate for the loss of land or other resources held at the time that the Treaty was signed. Evidence was given by the Maori applicants in “the Lands case” and accepted by the court that land has a special significance in Maori culture. Richardson J commented: The uncontested evidence in this case... amply justifies and supports conclusions of historians as to the crucial importance of land in Maori culture. The New Zealand Maori Council in its paper Kaupapa – Te Wahanga Tuatahi expresses it in this way: “It \[Maori land\] provides us with a sense of identity, belonging and continuity. It is proof of our continued existence not only as a people, but as the tangatawhenua of this country. It is proof of our tribal and kin group ties. Maori land represents turangawaewae. It is proof of our link with ancestors of our past, and with the generations yet to come. It is an assurance that we shall forever exist as a people, for as long as the land shall last.” (p. 674) Given that evidence, the Commissioner considers that it is unlikely that land in respect of which compensation is paid under Treaty settlements would be treated as an asset of a revenue nature. Compensation payments take the character of that which they replaced: London and Thames Haven Oil Wharves Ltd v Attwooll \[1967\] 2 All ER 124 and Burmah Steamship Co Ltd v CIR (1930) 16 TC 67. In Burmah Steamship, where a ship owner had received damages for breach of contract by a late delivery of a ship (which was, therefore, unavailable for trading operations), the damages were held to be business income as the damages were compensation for loss of trading receipts. Lord Clyde said: In the present case there can be no doubt that, when the Appellant entered into the contract with the repairers, the consequences of a failure by the latter to deliver punctually, which were in the contemplation of both parties at the time, were that the Appellant would be deprived of the opportunity of putting the vessel to immediate profitable use in his business. It was in respect of this deprivation that the damages were recovered. The contemplated “hole” in the Appellant's profits was unfortunately made, and in my opinion the damages recovered must go, as a matter of sound commercial accounting, to fill that “hole”, and therefore constitute a proper item of profit in the Appellant’s profit and loss account. (p. 136) The London & Thames Haven Oil Wharves Ltd case concerned an insurance payment made to the owner of a wharf damaged by one of its shipping company clients. Part of the insurance payments related to consequential damage for loss of the use of the wharf (that is, the loss of profits from destruction of trading stock). Diplock LJ held that that part of the insurance payment was income from the taxpayer's business. He said: Where, pursuant to a legal right, a trader receives from another person compensation for the trader's failure to receive a sum of money which, if it had been received, would have been credited to the amount of profits (if any) arising in any year from the trade carried on by him at the time when the compensation is so received, the compensation is to be treated for income tax purposes in the same way as that sum of money would have been treated if it had been received instead of the compensation. The rule is applicable whatever the source of the legal right of the trade to recover the compensation. It may arise from a primary obligation under a contract, such as a contract of insurance; from a secondary obligation arising out of non-performance of a contract, such as a right to damages, either liquidated, as under the demurrage clause in a charterparty, or unliquidated; from an 20 obligation to pay damages for tort, as in the present case; from a statutory obligation; or in any other way in which legal obligations arise. (p. 134) The principle set out in those cases was applied in Case S104 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,662 and in Case T47 (1998) 18 NZTC 8,319. In those cases taxpayers who had been prevented from logging a native forest by a Government regulation had received a settlement payment from the Government. In both cases the TRA considered that the payment was income from the partnership’s business, being compensation for loss of the profit that they would have derived from logging the forest. However, in The Glenboig Union Fireclay Co Ltd v IR Commissioners (1922) 12 TC 427, where a taxpayer in the business of manufacturing fire clay goods and selling raw clay had received a payment for ceasing to work fire clay fields over which it had mining rights, it was held that the compensation payment was a receipt of a capital nature being an amount received for sterilisation of a capital asset. The fact that the amount of the compensation was determined having regard to profits that would have been earned from the fire clay left unworked was not relevant. The issue was whether the compensation was paid to compensate for a loss of a revenue or of a capital nature. Lord Clyde said: In truth the sum of money is the sum paid to prevent the \[taxpayer\] obtaining the full benefit of the capital value of that part of the mines which they are prevented from working by the Railway Company. It appears to me to make no difference whether it be regarded as a sale of the asset out and out, or whether it be treated merely as a means of preventing the acquisition of profit that would otherwise be gained. In either case the capital asset of the Company to that extent has been sterilised and destroyed, and it is in respect of that action that the sum of £15,316 was paid. It is unsound to consider the fact that the measure, adopted for the purpose of seeing what the total amount should be, was based on considering what are the profits that would have been earned. That, no doubt, is a perfectly exact and accurate way of determining the compensation ... But there is no relation between the measure that is used for the purpose of calculating a particular result and the quality of the figure that is arrived at by means of the application of that test. I am unable to regard this sum of money as anything but capital money ... (pp. 463-464) Compensation paid to replace amounts that would have been receipts of a revenue nature from a business carried on by a claimant group would prima facie be income. The Commissioner considers that financial redress under Treaty settlements is paid to compensate for a loss of a capital nature, being assets held by Maori at the time the Treaty was signed. Therefore, financial redress under Treaty settlements is not income on that basis.. Conclusion The Commissioner considers that the pursuit of a Treaty settlement in respect of historical breaches of the Treaty is not a business in itself and that even if a claimant group carries on another activity which constitutes a business, financial redress under Treaty settlements is not an amount derived from a business carried on by the claimant group or by members of the claimant group. Whether financial redress under Treaty settlements is income under ordinary concepts – section CD 5 Amounts which are income under ordinary concepts are gross income: section CD 5. Whether or not a particular payment is income under ordinary concepts depends upon its quality in the hands of the recipient. There is no necessary connection between the character 21 of a payment in relation to the payer and its character as a receipt by the payee: Scott v C of T (1966) 117 CLR 514; The Federal Coke Company Ltd v FCT 77 ATC 4255; Reid v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,176. Periodicity, regularity or recurrence of payments may indicate that the payments are income, but this factor is not conclusive. It is necessary to consider the relationship between the payer and payee and the purpose for which the payment is made. In Reid v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,176 Richardson J commented as follows: There may be difficulty in marginal cases in determining what are the ordinary concepts and usages of mankind in this regard and to assist in that determination there has been much discussion in the cases of criteria which bear on the characterisation of receipts as income in particular classes of case. The major determinant in many cases is the periodic nature of a payment ( FC of T v Dixon (1952) 86 CLR 540; and Asher v London Film Productions \[1944\] 1 All ER 77). If it has that quality of regularity or recurrence then the payments become part of the receipts upon which the recipient may depend for his living expenses, just as in the case of a salary or wage earner, annuitant or welfare beneficiary. But that in itself is not enough and consideration must be given to the relationship between payer and payee and to the purpose of the payment, in order to determine the quality of the payment in the hands of the payee. (p. 5,183) The approach in Hallstroms Pty Ltd v FCT (1946) 72 CLR 634 was described by Richardson J as exemplifying the governing approach in New Zealand for determining whether a receipt of an expense is of a capital or revenue nature: see CIR v Thomas Borthwick & Sons (Australasia) Ltd (1992) 14 NZTC 9,101, 9,103. In CIR v Wattie (1998) 18 NZTC 13,991 Lord Nolan confirmed that similar principles apply to both expenditure and receipts and that the Hallstroms approach is to be adopted in determining whether a receipt is capital or revenue: It is well settled that in considering whether a particular item of receipt or expenditure is of a capital or revenue nature the approach to be adopted should be that described by Dixon J in Hallstroms Pty Ltd v FCT (1946) 72 CLR 634 and p 648 where he said that the answer to the question:- “...depends on what the expenditure is calculated to effect from a practical and business point of view, rather than upon the juristic classification of the legal rights, if any, secured, employed or exhausted in the process.” Dixon J was speaking in terms of expenditure but it is familiar law that within the context of the same business, similar principles will apply to payments and to receipts. This appears from the general discussion of the earlier cases by Lord Macmillan in Van Den Berghs Ltd v Clark \[1935\] AC 431 at pp 438 to 41, and from the Borthwick case itself, which was concerned with the character of a receipt. (p. 13,997) In determining whether a receipt is capital or revenue, the issue is the consideration provided for the payment. Where the recipient does not provide consideration for the payment it is appropriate to consider the purpose of the payment. In The Federal Coke Company Ltd v FCT 77 ATC 4255 Brennan J said: When a recipient of moneys provides consideration for the payment, the consideration will ordinarily supply the touchstone for ascertaining whether the receipt is on revenue account or not. The character of an asset which is sold for a price, or the character of a cause of action discharged by a payment will ordinarily determine, unless it be a sham transaction, the character of the receipt of the price or payment. The consideration establishes the matter in respect of which the moneys are received. The character of the receipt may then be determined by the character, in the recipient’s hands, of the matter in respect of which the moneys are received. Thus, when moneys are received in consideration of surrendering a benefit to which the recipient is entitled under a contract, it is relevant to enquire whether or not that benefit was a capital asset in his hands. To adapt the words of Lord Macmillan in Van den Berghs Ltd. V. Clark (1935) A.C. at p. 443, and of Williams J. in Bennett v. F.C. of T. (1947) 75 C.L.R. 480 at p. 485, the enquiry is whether the congeries of the rights which the recipient enjoyed under the contract and which for a price he surrendered was a capital asset. 22 When a recipient gives no consideration for a receipt, it is not possible to identify the matter in respect of which the moneys are received by reference to rights which the recipient surrenders. Nevertheless, an enquiry into the “how and why’’ of the receipt may reveal the matter in respect of which the payment is received. If there be a consensus between the payer and the payee, their common understanding may identify the relevant matter. The intention or understanding of the payer alone is insufficient for “it would plainly be unsound to allow a determination of the character of a receipt in the hands of the recipient to be affected by a consideration of the uncommunicated reasoning which led the payer to agree to pay it’’ (McLaurin v. F.C. of T. (1961) 104 C.L.R. 381 at p. 391). (p. 4,273) Therefore, the character of the asset sold for the payment or the character of the cause of action discharged by the payment will ordinarily determine the character of the payment. Treaty settlements do not involve a gain from property, nor do they involve the provision of services. Treaty settlements are one-off events. Although it is possible that Treaty settlement payments could be made in instalments, regularity or recurrence of itself does not indicate that the payments are income. It is also necessary to consider the relationship between the payer and payee and the purpose of the payment in order to determine whether the payments are income: see Reid v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,176. Treaty settlements may include the giving of undertakings by the claimants (such as an agreement that the settlement is full and final settlement of claims under the Treaty). However, the settlements are not paid for such undertakings. The undertakings are part of the procedure by which a Treaty claim is settled. Financial redress under a Treaty settlement is paid in order to provide compensation for historical breaches of a Treaty between the Crown and the ancestors of the members of claimant groups. Where compensation is paid for the deprivation of an asset of a capital nature, the compensation will also be a receipt of a capital nature: see Burmah Steamship Co Ltd v IRC (1930) 16 TC 67. In Burmah Steamship Lord Clyde said: It is true that the measure by which the amount of damages or compensation is ascertainable is no criterion of the capital or revenue character of the sum recovered for the purpose of adjusting an Income Tax account of profits and gains (Glenboig Union Fireclay Coy. v Inland Revenue, 1921 S.C. 400, 1922 S.C. (H.L.) 112). But, as the case just referred to shows, it is very relevant to enquire whether the thing in respect of which the taxpayer has recovered damages or compensation is deprivation of one of the capital assets of his trading enterprise, or — short of that — a mere restriction of his trading opportunities. The purpose of the financial redress made under a Treaty settlement is to compensate the claimants for a loss caused by breaches of the Treaty. Such a loss is a loss of a capital nature, being assets held by Maori at the time the Treaty was signed. Conclusion Given the above, the Commissioner considers that financial redress provided to settle historical Treaty grievances is not income under ordinary concepts in terms of section CD 5. Crown forestry land settlements • Generally compensation payments made to settle historical Treaty grievances (including compensation payments made on the return of Crown forestry land to Maori ownership) are not income under section CD 3 or section CD 5. 23 • In some circumstances Treaty settlement payments in respect of Crown forestry land are also exempt under section CB 5(1)(n). The circumstances in which Crown forestry settlement payments are exempt under section CB 5(1)(n) are discussed in detail below. • Although the Commissioner considers that section CD 3 and section CD 5 would not apply to Treaty settlements in respect of Crown forestry land, a number of other provisions could apply to such Crown forestry settlement payments as are not exempt under section CB 5(1)(n). These provisions (which are discussed below) are: sections CE 1(1)(a) and (e), CE 2 and CJ 1. Exemption under section CB 5(1)(n) in respect of compensation payments made under the CFAA The consequences when Crown forestry land is returned to Maori ownership under a Treaty settlement are set out in the CFAA. The Crown has sold forests on Crown forestry land and has granted licences in respect of Crown forestry land to the licensees. If Crown forestry land is returned to Maori ownership, it will be returned subject to a licence, which will terminate at the end of the notice period (35 years from the applicable date): see section 13(5) CFAA. Forests on the land are not returned to the successful claimants, the forests having previously been transferred to the licensees. During the termination period the licensees will continue to have the right to harvest trees growing on the land at the time the land is returned. The land will be resumed progressively by the claimants as trees growing on the land at the time of its return are harvested. On the return of Crown forestry land to Maori ownership, the Crown must pay compensation to the Maori to whom ownership of the land is transferred in accordance with the First Schedule to the CFAA: section 36 CFAA; clause 1 First Schedule. There are two aspects to the compensation paid under the CFAA: • First, in every case where Crown forestry land is returned to Maori an amount equal to five percent of the “specified amount” (however the specified amount is calculated) must be paid in order to compensate for the fact that the land is returned “subject to encumbrances” (that is, subject to the right of licensees to continue to harvest trees standing on the land until the end of the termination period): clause 2(b) First Schedule CFAA. • Secondly, the Crown is required to pay further compensation, being the balance of the specified amount or such lesser amount as the Tribunal may recommend: clause 2(b) First Schedule CFAA. Section 8HB of the TOWA (which empowers the Tribunal to hear claims in relation to land licensed under the CFAA) does not indicate what matters the Tribunal is to take into account in determining the further compensation to be paid. However, the function of the Tribunal is to inquire into and make recommendations to the Crown on claims alleging a breach by the Crown of the principles of the Treaty. In NZ Maori Council v AG \[1994\] 1 NZLR 513 the Privy Council commented on the meaning of “principles of the Treaty” as follows: In their Lordships’ opinion the “principles” are the underlying mutual obligations and responsibilities which the Treaty places on the parties. They reflect the intent of the Treaty as a whole and include, but are not confined to, the express terms of the Treaty.... With the passage of time, the “principles” which underlie the Treaty have become much more important than its precise terms. 24 Foremost amongst those “principles” are the obligations which the Crown undertook of protecting and preserving Maori property, including the Maori language as part of taonga, in return for being recognised as the legitimate government of the whole nation by Maori. The Treaty refers to this obligation in the English text as amounting to a guarantee by the Crown. This emphasises the solemn nature of the Crown’s obligation. It does not however mean that the obligation is absolute and unqualified. This would be inconsistent with the Crown’s other responsibilities as the government of New Zealand and the relationship between Maori and the Crown. (p. 517) Therefore, on the return of Crown forestry land the successful claimants will receive at least 5 percent of the “specified amount” calculated in accordance with clause 3 and could receive as further compensation, an amount up to the balance of the “specified amount”, unless the Tribunal determines that a lesser amount should be paid. Each of the amounts referred to in clause 3 are measures of the value of the forests on the land returned. Under clause 3 of the First Schedule the “specified amount” is whichever of the following amounts is nominated by the successful claimants: • The market value of trees on land returned as at the time of the recommendation to return the land becomes final (clause 3(a) of the First Schedule CFAA); • The market stumpage harvested under the licence from trees on the land returned from the date that the recommendation to return the land becomes final; (clause 3(b) of the First Schedule CFAA). • The net proceeds received by the Crown from the sale of the forests on the land to be returned “plus a return on those proceeds for the period between the transfer and the return of the land to Maori ownership” (clause 3(c) of the First Schedule CFAA). The Income Tax Act 1976 was amended with effect from 25 October 1989 by the addition of section 61(62) (now section CB 5(1)(n). Under section CB 5(1)(n) to the extent that in the absence of that provision, the payments would be gross income, payments of compensation under the First Schedule (except clause 3(b)) of the CFAA are exempt income. Therefore, compensation paid under the CFAA would be exempt income under section CB 5(1)(n), unless it is calculated under clause 3(b), that is, by reference to the market stumpage. Whether compensation payable under the CFAA would be gross income in the absence of section CB 5(1)(n) Section CB 5(1)(n) exempts compensation payments under the CFAA “to the extent that in the absence of that section” they would be gross income. The Commissioner considers that compensation payments made under the CFAA to claimant groups on the return of Crown forestry land to Maori ownership would not (in the absence of section CB 5(1)(n)) be gross income under sections CD 3, CE 1(1)(e), CE 2, CJ 1, CE 1(1)(a) or CD 5. These provisions are discussed below. (a) Amounts derived from a business – section CD 3 For the reasons outlined previously, the pursuit of a Treaty settlement in respect of Crown forestry land is not a business in itself and if the successful claimants carry on another activity which constitutes a business, compensation payments under the CFAA are not amounts derived from such a business. 25 (b) Payments for use of land – section CE 1(1)(e) Section CE 1(1)(e), which refers to amounts derived by the owner of land from a lease, licence or easement in respect of land or from the grant of a right of taking profits of the land, does not apply to the compensation payments for the following reasons: • The payments are not received by the claimants as owners of the land, nor are they received from a licence or for the grant of cutting rights in respect of timber on the land. The payments would be received on the transfer of ownership of Crown forestry land to the successful claimants. Under the terms of the Crown Forestry Rental Trust on the return of any licensed land to Maori ownership, the successful claimants are entitled to receive the rental received by the trustees in respect of that land from the commencement of the licence until resumption and to receive future rental direct from the licensee: clause 11.1 of the Deed of Trust. Therefore, past and future rental payments are distinct from and are payable to the successful claimants in addition to the compensation paid under the First Schedule of the CFAA. • The payments are not received for the grant of a right to take profits of the land. Any grant of cutting rights made in respect of Crown forestry assets is made by the Crown and not by the successful claimants. • The Crown does not act on behalf of the successful claimants in granting the licences and selling the forests. In the Crown Forests Assets case the court considered that the Crown had an obligation under the Treaty to consult with Maori (as the other party to the Treaty) about the proposed sale of the forests. The consultation led to the agreement which specified how Crown forestry land and Crown forestry assets were to be dealt with pending resolution of claims under the Treaty and the consequences once a claim was resolved. The Maori Council and the Federation of Maori Authorities consented to the creation of the licences and the sale of the forests but until a recommendation of the Tribunal that the land be returned to the successful claimants is accepted by the Crown, the claimants have no rights in respect of the land other than inchoate rights under the Treaty. (c) Amounts derived from the use or occupation of any land – section CE 2 Section CE 2 refers to amounts derived from the use or occupation of land. In Smith v CIR \[1969\] NZLR 565 it was held that section 91(a) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 (which included in the definition of income “all profits or gains derived from the use or occupation of land”) did not apply to a profit derived from the assignment of a right to cut timber. Although that right was an interest in land, the court considered that neither the original grantee nor the assignees acquired any property in the land. The court considered that section 91(a) was limited to the gain derived from the use or occupation of the land in the sense of a tangible, physical thing. Haslam J said: Mr Carroll also rested part of his argument upon the submission that the term “land” embraced all estates or interests therein, and referred to the definition of the phrase “owner of land” in s. 2 of the Act, which applies “unless the context otherwise requires”. The word “land” itself is defined, with an even stronger qualification about inconsistency in the context, in s. 4 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1924 as including “. . . messuages, tenements, hereditaments . . .”. While the right created by the grant under review would fall within the relevant 26 passage in either statutory definition, I think that in the context of s. 91 the term “land” should be read in its primary connotation. I read the section as designed to clarify and extend the incidence of taxation in relation to profits and gains derived from the use and occupation of land. If this word be considered in its setting in s. 91 (1) (a), then emphasis is given to the financial yield derived by virtue of use or occupation by the taxpayer.... I conclude therefore that in s. 91 this word bears its everyday sense of a solid part of the earth's surface, and does not include estate or interest in realty. (p. 568-569) The Commissioner considers that section CE 2 applies to amounts derived from agricultural use of the land. The Commissioner considers that section CE 2 does not apply to compensation payments made under the CFAA. Clause 2 of the First Schedule to the CFAA recognises that the land is returned subject to rights of the licensees which effectively prevent the claimants from having full use of the land while the licensees retain the right to cut trees situated on the land. The compensation is, in part, compensation for the fact that the land is returned subject to the use or occupation by the licensees. However, for section CE 2 to apply, the amounts must be derived from the actual physical use of the land by the successful claimants rather than as a consequence of the successful claimants having an interest in the land. Section CE 2 is expressed to be “subject to” section CJ 1. Therefore, section CJ 1 prevails over section CE 2 where the receipts in question are amounts derived from the sale of timber: refer C & J Clark Ltd v IRC \[1971\] 1 WLR 905. (d) Amounts derived from the sale of timber or right to take timber – section CJ 1 The Commissioner considers that the compensation payments are not income under section CJ 1(1) or (2) for the following reasons: • Under section CJ 1(1) amounts deemed to have been derived under section FB 4, GD 1 or GD 2 from the sale or disposition of timber or the right to take timber are income. Sections FB 4, GD 1 and GD 2 would apply where the timber is trading stock. Even if these provisions were relevant, a claimant group to which Crown forestry land is returned would not derive any amounts from the sale of timber or the right to take timber. The grant of the licence and the sale of forests are made by the Crown and not by the claimants. When forestry land is returned to Maori claimants, the forests standing on that land are not returned to them. The forests have been transferred outright to licensees and in terms of section 13 of the CFAA, for the purposes of the transfer, the forestry assets and the land are regarded as separate assets each capable of separate ownership. On the return of the land to Maori ownership the rights of the licensee are preserved. Timber harvested from Crown forestry land that is subject to a licence is sold by the licensee, not by the claimants. • In terms of section CJ 1(2) the sale or disposition of standing timber is gross income except:  Timber that is comprised in ornamental or incidental trees; or  Timber that is subject to a forestry right;  Timber that is subject to a profit à prendre granted before 1 January 1984. The compensation is not paid for the sale of standing timber as the forests are not owned by the successful claimants. The forests are sold by the Crown to the licensees before the return of the land to Maori. 27 (e) Interest – section CE 1(1)(a) The “specified amount” under clause 3(c) of the First Schedule includes a return on the net proceeds received by the Crown from the transfer of Crown forestry assets to which land to be returned to Maori ownership relates. Under the common law, interest is the consideration for the use of a sum of money owed to or belonging to another person: Re Euro Hotel (Belgravia) Ltd \[1975\] 3 All ER 1075. The true character of the payment is not determined by its description in the agreement or the legislation. In Riches v Westminster Bank Ltd \[1947\] AC 390 Viscount Simon commented: The real question, for the purpose of deciding whether the Income Tax Acts apply, is whether the added sum is capital or income, not whether the sum is damages or interest. (p. 396) Viscount Simon went on to say: I come then to the second stage and ask what is the character of interest allowed under section 28 of the \[Civil Procedure\] Act of 1833. Here the argument is that, call it interest or what you will, it is damages and, if it is damages, then it is not interest in the proper sense’ or ‘interest proper’, expressions heard many times by your Lordships. This argument appears to me fallacious. It assumes an incompatibility between the ideas of interest and damages for which I see no justification. It confuses the character of the sum paid with the authority under which it is paid. Its essential character may be the same, whether it is paid under the compulsion of a contract, a statute or a judgment of the court. In the first case it may be called ‘interest’ and in the second and third cases “damages in the nature of interest” or even “damages”. But the real question is still what is its intrinsic character, and in the consideration of this question a description due to the authority under which it is paid may well mislead. (p. 406) A distinction has been drawn in case law between an amount paid to compensate for a loss of a capital nature that is calculated by reference to interest (which remains a receipt of capital)\_ and an amount paid to compensate for a delay in payment of compensation once the amount of the compensation has been determined (which is income under ordinary concepts). The application of this principle is illustrated by Simpson v Executors of Bonner Maurice as Executor of Edward Kay (1949) 14 TC 580. The Bonner Maurice case concerned a UK resident and national who, at the outbreak of the First World War, owned German stocks and shares which were deposited with banks in Germany. The dividends and interest were collected by the banks. During the war money could not be sent from Germany to the UK so that the dividends and interest accumulated in the banks. In 1917 some of the dividends and interest were paid to an official called the Treuhander. After the end of the war the money was returned to the representatives of the original owner under the Treaty of Versailles. They also received payments under a provision of the Treaty of Versailles which provided that nationals of the Allied and Associated Powers should be entitled to “compensation in respect of damage or injury inflicted upon their property, rights or interests” in Germany. That compensation was calculated on the basis of interest at 5 percent over the amount handed over to the Treuhander. Rowlatt J held that the compensation was not income: The Treuhander did not receive this money subject to any liability to hold it as interest. No doubt the German law recognised it as remaining the property of \[the British national\], but not so as to bear interest. The Treaty did not give \[the British national\] any right to interest, nor did it declare the Treuhander a trustee so as to found any consequential claim for interest; it did not empower the tribunal to give interest as such, or to make any declaration as to the character of the purpose for which the Treuhander had held the money. The Treaty gave compensation, and the tribunal which assessed the principal sum has assessed it on the basis of interest. I think this sum first came into existence by the award, and no previous history or anterior character can be attributed to 28 it. It is exactly like damages for detention of a chattel, and unless it can be said that damages for detention of a chattel can be called rent or hire for the chattel during the period of detention, I do not think this compensation can be called interest. (pp. 592-593) In Raja’s Commercial College v Gian Singh & Co Ltd \[1977\] AC 312, the Privy Council explained the Bonner Maurice case. Lord Fraser, who gave the judgment of the Privy Council, commenting on the above passage from the judgment in that case, said at p. 322: The last sentence of that passage is no doubt quite accurate in relation to chattels which, if not detained, would have been used by the owner for his own purposes but it is not applicable to chattels which the owner would have let out on hire, for example a motor-car belonging to a car rental firm or a TV set owned by a rental company. In the Court of Appeal Lord Hanworth MR said that the compensation was for preventing the British national from exercising the power of disposition over his property and he went on to say, at p. 602: “The way to estimate that compensation or damages – the sensible way no doubt – would be by calculating a sum in terms of what interest it would have earned. That has been done, but the sum that was paid has not been turned into interest so as to attach income tax to it. It remains compensation and, for these reasons, it appears to me that it is not a sum which attracts or attaches income tax to it. Refer also Public Trustee v CIR \[1960\] NZLR 365; Marshall v Commissioner of Taxes \[1953\] NZLR 335; Whitaker v FCT 98 ATC 4823. The Commissioner considers that the situation in the Bonner Maurice case is analogous in that compensation under clause 3(c) is compensation for a loss of a capital nature which is calculated by reference to interest. The entitlement of the successful claimants to the amount would come into existence if their claim was successful but they have no previous entitlement to the payment of an amount representing a return on the net proceeds received by the Crown from the transfer of the Crown forestry assets to which the land returned relates. The statutory definition of “interest” refers to a payment made “in respect of or in relation to money lent” except repayment of the principal sum: section OB 1. At its widest, “money lent” includes an “amount paid to, or for the benefit of, or dealt with in the interest of or on behalf of, any other person in consideration for an agreement or a promise to pay by the other person, where that amount is exceeded by the amount payable to the person in accordance with the agreement or the promise”: para (d), definition of “money lent” in section OB 1. The Commissioner considers that a Treaty settlement in respect of Crown forestry land does not involve the successful claimants paying an amount to the Crown in consideration for an agreement by the Crown to pay a greater amount. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that where compensation payments are determined under clause 3(c) and an imputed return is added to the net proceeds of sale in order to calculate the specified amount under clause 3(c), compensation payments would not (in the absence of section CB 5(1)(n)) be interest. (f) Income under ordinary concepts – section CD 5 Whether a payment is of a capital or revenue nature depends on what the payment is calculated to effect from a practical and business point of view: Hallstroms Pty Ltd v FCT (1946) 72 CLR 634. The character of the asset transferred for the payment or the character of the cause of action discharged by the payment will ordinarily determine the character of the payment: The Federal Coke Company Ltd v FCT 77 AT 4255. 29 The stated purpose of the compensation paid under clause 2(a) of the First Schedule (that is, an amount equal to 5 percent of the “specified amount”) is that it compensates for the fact that the land is returned subject to the rights of the licensee to continue to harvest trees on the land. A payment which represents compensation for the loss in value of land, that is a capital asset, or for interference with the ability of the claimants to use the land, is a payment of a capital nature: Barrett v FCT 15 ATD 149 and Nullaga Pastoral Co Pty Ltd v FCT 78 ATC 4329. The Commissioner considers that payments of compensation under clause 2(a) of the First Schedule to the CFAA are not income as they are paid in order to compensate for the fact that the claimants do not immediately have full use of the land. The payments do not constitute consideration for a right to take something from the land, this right having previously been granted by the Crown to the licensee. The successful claimants may also receive further compensation of an amount up to the balance of the specified amount. Settlements in respect of Crown forestry land and Crown forestry assets are settlements of claims for compensation in relation to historical breaches by the Crown of its obligation under the Treaty protect the Maori people in the use of their lands and other assets held at the time that the Treaty was signed. The CFAA applies only to forests which are principally exotic forests standing on Crown forestry land. In the Crown Forests Assets case the Court of Appeal referred to the possibility that the principles of the Treaty may not entitle Maori to share equally in the ownership of exotic forests. The settlement (which is reflected in the CFAA) appears to acknowledge that possibility as, in terms of clause 2(b) of the First Schedule of the CFAA, the successful claimants would receive less than 100 percent of the value of the forests (the specified amount), if the Tribunal so determines. The Commissioner considers that compensation under the First Schedule to the CFAA (however it is calculated) relates to capital assets of the claimants. The Commissioner, therefore, considers that the compensation payments are not income under ordinary concepts. Conclusion The issue of whether compensation under Crown forestry settlements is interest has been considered because it is not clear why compensation in relation to Crown forestry land settlements was exempt income in some cases but not others. Whether compensation under the CFAA is exempt income depends on the method used to calculate the amount of the compensation. One of those methods appeared to include an amount based on the time value of money: clause 3(c) Schedule to the CFAA. Compensation payments under the CFAA (except compensation calculated under clause 3(b), that is, compensation calculated by reference to market stumpage) are exempt income under section CB 5(1)(n). The question of whether compensation under the CFAA would be income in the absence of section CB 5(1)(n) has been considered in an attempt to ascertain the policy underlying the exemption. Section CB 5(1)(n) applies to the extent that in the absence of that provision Crown forestry compensation payments would be gross income. Section CB 5(1)(n) does not, however, provide that such payments are income. The CFAA and section CB 5(1)(n) reflect the terms of the settlement between the Crown and the Maori Council. It appears that the predecessor of section CB 5(1)(n) was enacted in order to confirm what the parties to the settlement considered was the existing position. The Commissioner considers that the better view is that the exclusion was not intended to alter the existing position, which was that compensation 30 payments (however calculated) would not have been gross income under the predecessors of sections CD 3, CD 5, CE 1(1)(a) or (e), CE 2 or CJ 1. Compensation in relation to Crown forestry settlements would not be gross income under sections CD 3, CD 5, CE 1(1)(a) or (e), CE 2 or CJ 1 in the absence of section CB 5(1)(n). Whether financial redress under Treaty settlements is income under the accrual rules In most cases settlement legislation is required in order to ensure the finality of a Treaty settlement, to provide for Statutory Instruments, to remove statutory memorials from land titles in the claim area and to vest land in the claimant group, if normal administrative land transfer processes would not be appropriate. Therefore, there may be a delay between the settlement being agreed and payment being made. Settlements may be conditional upon the passing of settlement legislation. For the accrual rules to apply there must be a financial arrangement. Paragraph (a) of the definition of “financial arrangement” in section EH 22(1) refers to a debt or debt instrument. The Commissioner considers that where a settlement is conditional on the passing of legislation to give effect to the settlement, the settlement does not give rise to a debt or debt instrument in terms of paragraph (a) of the definition of “financial arrangement”, as the obligation to make payment will not be unconditional. To be a debt or debt instrument, there must be an unconditional obligation to make payment: Case Q2 (1993) 15 NZTC 5,005. In Case Q2 Judge Willy said: The 1987 report of the Consultative Committee, Exhibit 3, contained an information release from the Office of the Minister of Finance relevant to this matter. In explaining the definition of “financial arrangement” the Minister says: “The definition includes within the umbrella term financial arrangement or debt instrument. The term debt instrument has been used as it describes most financing arrangements involving the provision of credit in money or monies worth. The term debt instrument is intended to apply to every conceivable type of the \[sic\] provision of credit including all forms of Government commercial paper, Government stock, Treasury Bills, Kiwi Bonds and so on. And whether or not secondary market operators reconstruct split or hybridise such instruments. It is intended to include everything that is not equity and to avoid artificial distinctions based on technical legal rather than economic or substantial differences.” It should be noted at this point that in law a “debt” is usually defined as a sum of money payable in respect of a liquidated money demand recoverable by action; Rawley v Rawley \[1886\] 1 QBD 460 or as it was put in Ogdens Limited v Weinberg (1906) 95 TLR 567 by Lord Davey. “The word debt no doubt means something recoverable by an action for debt and nothing can be recovered in an action for debt except what is ascertained or can be ascertained. A claim for an amount which is uncertain and cannot be adjusted in an account cannot I think be justly called a debt.” In Words and Phrases Legally Defined, 3rd Edition, it is said that the legal definition of a debt is “a sum of money due by certain and expressed agreement”. (p. 5014) This aspect of the judgment was not discussed in the appeal of the case (CIR v Dewavrin Segard (NZ) Ltd (1994) 16 NZTC 11,048). For there to be a financial arrangement in terms of paragraph (b) of the definition, there must be: 31 • An arrangement; • Under which \[the Crown\] receives money; • In consideration for the Crown providing money to the claimant group at a future time. The definition of “money” in section OB 1 includes “money’s worth” whether or not it is convertible into money. In McElwee v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,288 the High Court held that although a benefit need not be convertible into money to be “money’s worth” for the purposes of the accruals provisions, it must be able to be valued. Therefore, the court held that a guarantee for no consideration was not a financial arrangement. The High Court accepted the following comments by Glazebrook & Oliver in The New Zealand Accrual Regime – a practical guide (1989) at p 51: The second operating principle of accrual income and expenditure calculations is that all benefits received and provided under a financial arrangement which are included in accrual calculations must be convertible into monetary equivalents. This principle is not explicit in the legislation but can be inferred from the fact that the accrual rules operate on what are essentially cash flow calculations. If a benefit is not given a monetary equivalent, it cannot be included in the accrual calculation. This is not to say that a benefit must in practice be convertible into money.... What is required is that the benefit be able to be assigned a monetary value. The Commissioner considers that a Treaty settlement is not a financial arrangement under paragraph (b) of the definition of that expression as the payment made by the Crown is not “in consideration for” a benefit received by the Crown. Treaty settlement payments are made to compensate the claimants for past economic losses suffered as a result of the Crown’s breaches of the Treaty rather than in return for anything provided to the Crown under a Treaty settlement. Undertakings or agreements given by the claimants under a Treaty settlement are merely part of the process by which settlement is effected. Conclusion The Commissioner considers that a Treaty settlement where payment is delayed until the passing of settlement legislation is not a financial arrangement. Where a Treaty settlement is conditional upon the passing of settlement legislation, the settlement is not a “debt or debt instrument”. A Treaty settlement is also not a “financial arrangement” in terms of paragraph (b) of the definition of that term. Claimant funding The first stage in a direct negotiation with the Crown is that representatives of the claimant group must establish that they have a mandate to represent the members of the group and the Crown must accept that there is a well-founded grievance. Once that stage has been reached, the claimant group may apply to the Crown for reimbursement of the costs incurred in seeking a mandate (locating, registering and informing members of the claim). The claimant group can also apply for further funding for the cost of negotiating the Terms of Negotiation and for the costs of negotiating the final Deed of Settlement. The OTS publication says that the Crown will not necessarily provide full funding for negotiations. In assessing the amount of the Crown’s contribution the OTS will take into account the following matters: • The complexity of the claim; • Whether there are any overlapping claims or interests that need to be taken into account; 32 • Whether there is consensus within the claimant group regarding the negotiations; • The size of the claimant group and whether the members are scattered throughout the country; • Whether consultation is likely to require hui to be arranged outside the main city centres. The funding for the negotiation process is paid in instalments. Periodicity, recurrence and regularity are indicators that receipts are income but these factors are not conclusive: Reid v CIR. In order to determine the character of a payment in the hands of the recipient it is necessary to establish what is the consideration provided for the payment and if no consideration was given for the payment, the circumstances in which the payment is received must be considered: Federal Coke. Although the timing of the payment of instalments is linked to milestones in the settlement negotiations, there is no obligation to repay instalments already received if milestones are not met. The OTS publication also makes it clear that the Terms of Negotiation and the Heads of Agreement are entered into on a “without prejudice” basis. Neither party is bound until the Deed of Settlement is finally executed following ratification. At the time when funding is approved the Crown accepts that the claimant group has suffered from breaches of the Treaty and its principles. No funding is provided before the claimant group has established that it has a mandate because the Crown does not wish to be seen to take sides. The negotiations relate to the content of the settlement package, including what is to be included in the Crown’s acknowledgement and apology, the nature of cultural redress and the nature or quantum of the assets or cash that are to be transferred to the claimants: see p. 84 OTS publication. The funding is provided by the Crown in order to facilitate the settlement of Treaty grievances. The benefit sought by the Crown from the provision of funding is comprehensive and lasting settlements. Comprehensive and lasting settlements are not possible unless they are supported by the members of the claimant group and unless all historical grievances are addressed in the settlement. Funding is provided to claimant groups to enable them to consult with their members and in order to enable all grievances to be dealt with in the settlement. The amount of the funding is determined by the complexity of the Treaty claim and by the degree of difficulty likely to be encountered by the claimant group in consulting with members and obtaining ratification of the settlement. The Commissioner considers that claimant funding does not represent consideration for any income earning activity carried on by claimant groups and is not income under ordinary concepts. The funding is not a payment for a product or a service supplied by the claimants and is not income from a business. The funding is not made available for the provision of research to the Crown. Normally direct negotiations are undertaken in circumstances where sufficient historical research has already been carried out to enable the Crown to determine that there has been a breach. The OTS publication specifically says that the Crown does not provide funding for research (p. 43 OTS publication). The negotiation process is not a business in itself and is not part of the ordinary business operations of a business carried on by a claimant group. Claimant funding is provided when it is accepted that there is a basis for a Treaty claim and the funding is provided in order to facilitate the comprehensive and lasting 33 settlement of Treaty grievances by enabling claimant groups to consult with their members and by enabling all grievances to be addressed in the settlement. Payment in the nature of a subsidy or grant in respect of a business carried on by claimant groups – section DC 1 Section DC 1(2) applies to a payment in the nature of a subsidy or grant in respect of any business carried on by a taxpayer made to the taxpayer by the Development Finance Corporation New Zealand or the New Zealand Film Commission or any department or instrument of the Executive Government of New Zealand and to expenditure in respect of which such a grant is made: section DC 1(1). The effect of section DC 1(2) is that any deduction allowable in respect of the expenditure incurred by the taxpayer in respect of which such a grant is made is reduced by the amount of the grant and the amount of the grant is deemed not to be gross income. Therefore, if section DC 1(2) applied, the expenditure equivalent to the amount of the claimant funding would not be an allowable deduction and the amount of the claimant funding would not be income. The test of whether an entity is an instrument of the executive government of New Zealand is the degree of control which Ministers or central government agencies exercised over the entity: CIR v Medical Council of NZ (1997) 1 NZTC 13,088. The OTS which is subject to a high degree of control from its Minister and Cabinet is an instrument of the executive government of New Zealand. However, the Commissioner considers that even if claimant funding was a payment in the nature of a grant or subsidy, the claimant funding is not a grant made in respect of any business carried on by claimant groups. As outlined previously, the negotiation of a Treaty settlement is not a business, or part of any other business carried on by the claimant group or individual members of the claimant group. Therefore, section DC 1 does not apply to funding towards negotiating costs provided to claimant groups by the OTS. Conclusion The Commissioner considers that funding provided to claimant groups to cover the costs of negotiating a Treaty settlement is not an amount derived from any business carried on by a claimant group (section CD 3) and is not income under ordinary concepts (section CD 5). As the funding is not a payment in respect of any business carried on by a claimant group, section DC 1 does not apply. Conclusions The Commissioner considers that: 1. Financial redress paid by the Crown to a claimant group as compensation for historical breaches of the Crown’s obligations under the Treaty: • is not gross income under section CD 3. The pursuit of a Treaty claim is not a business in itself as a Treaty claim is made to recover compensation for a loss for both economic losses and non-economic losses rather than with the intention of making a profit. Although some claimant groups or individual members of a claimant group may carry on a business, the payment would not be an amount derived from any business carried on by the claimant group as the payment is made to compensate for a loss of a capital nature; and 34 • is not gross income under section CD 5 as the payments are made to compensate the claimant group for the loss of an asset of a capital nature. The payments do not involve a gain from property, do not involve the provision of services and are not made for undertakings given by the claimant group. 2. Compensation paid under the First Schedule to the CFAA on the return of Crown forestry land to a claimant group is exempt income under section CB 5(1)(n) where the amount of the compensation is calculated under clauses 3(a) and 3(b) of the First Schedule, that is, by reference to the market value of forests on the land returned or by reference to the net proceeds received by the Crown from the sale of the forests. In the absence of section CB 5(1)(n) compensation paid under the First Schedule to the CFAA (including compensation calculated by reference to market stumpage in terms of clause 3(b)) would not be income as the compensation: • is not gross income under section CD 3 as a Treaty claim does not constitute a business in itself and the compensation would not be an amount derived from any business that may be carried on by the claimant group or the members of a claimant group; • is not gross income under section CE 1(1)(e). The compensation is not an amount derived by the claimants from a licence or for the grant of cutting rights in respect of timber on the land or for the grant of a right of taking profits of the land. Licences and cutting rights are granted by the Crown to the licensees before the return of any Crown forestry land to a claimant group under a Treaty settlement. Past licence payments in respect of the land are held by the Crown Forestry Rental Trust for the benefit of the claimant group and future licence payments would be made to the claimant group in addition to compensation under the CFAA. • is not gross income under section CE 2. The compensation is not derived by the claimant group from the use or occupation of land. The compensation is paid, in part, as compensation for the fact that the claimant group does not immediately have the use and occupation of the land as the land is returned subject to the rights of the licensees. • is not gross income under section CJ 1. The compensation is not derived from the sale of timber, the right to take timber or standing timber. The right to take timber is sold by the Crown to the licensees before the return of the land to the claimant group. • where compensation is calculated under clause 3(c) of the First Schedule to the CFAA and includes an imputed return on the net proceeds of sale received by the Crown from the sale of the forests on the land, the compensation does not include interest which is gross income under section CE 1(1)(a). The compensation is not consideration for the use of money owed to or belonging to the claimant group, and is not paid in respect of “money lent”, as defined in section OB 1. • is not gross income under section CD 5 as the payment is paid as compensation for the fact that the land is returned subject to the rights of the licensees (so that the 35 ability of the claimant group to use the land is impeded) and as compensation in respect of capital assets of the claimant group. 3. Where the payment of financial redress under a Treaty settlement is delayed until settlement legislation is enacted, the financial redress will not be gross income under section CE 1(1)(c). A Treaty settlement does not constitute a financial arrangement as: • A settlement that is conditional upon the passing of settlement legislation is not a debt or debt instrument in terms of paragraph (a) of the definition of “financial arrangement”; and • A Treaty settlement does not constitute an arrangement under which the Crown receives money in consideration for the Crown providing money to the claimant group because any benefit received by the Crown under the settlement is an intangible benefit and is not, therefore, “money’s worth”. 4. Funding provided by the Crown through the OTS to a claimant group to enable the claimant group to carry out direct negotiations with the Crown in respect of a Treaty settlement is not gross income under sections CD 3 or CD 5. The benefit sought by the Crown from the provision of the funding is the promotion of comprehensive and lasting settlements by enabling the claimant groups to consult with their members and by enabling all issues to be addressed in the settlement. The funding is not an amount derived from a business carried on by the claimant group as the negotiation process is not a business in itself and is not part of the ordinary business operations of the claimant group. The funding is not income under ordinary concepts as it is not consideration for any product or service provided by the claimant group. 36
\[Interpretation statement IS0044 issued by Adjudication & Rulings in May 2000\] FINANCIAL PLANNING FEES—INCOME TAX DEDUCTIBILITY SUMMARY All references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This interpretation statement considers the deductibility under section BD 2, of a range of financial planning fees charged to investors. In this regard the status of the investor will be important, i.e. whether the taxpayer is a passive investor, a speculative investor, or in the business of trading in investments. This statement replaces Public Ruling BR Pub 95/10 that appeared in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 7 (January 1996), and the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996 re- issue BR Pub 95/10A published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 8, No10 (December 1996). The Public Ruling ceased to apply at the end of the 1998-1999 income year. Some of the conclusions in this statement differ from those in Public Ruling BR 95/10, reflecting experience and case law arising from decisions from the Taxation Review Authority (TRA) and the High Court since that Ruling was issued. These changes will impact most on those investors coming within the definition of “passive investor” described in the statement. This category of investor will now, in certain circumstances, be entitled to deduct a greater range of fees than detailed in the earlier binding ruling. In general, financial planning fees will be deductible if they are incurred in deriving the taxpayer’s gross income, under section BD 2(1)(b)(i), or incurred in the course of carrying on a business for the purposes of deriving gross income under section BD 2(1)(b)(ii). Deductibility is prohibited if the fees are of a capital nature under section BD 2(2)(e). The deductibility of financial planning fees depends on whether the investment to which the fees are paid relates to: • an “excepted financial arrangement” (e.g. shares and options to purchase shares), or • a “financial arrangement” (e.g. bonds, bank loans, mortgages, and government stock). If the investment is an excepted financial arrangement, deductibility of fees will depend on whether the fee is part of the cost of the investment, and whether that investment is “trading stock” or “revenue account property” of a business or speculative investor respectively. The primary focus of this interpretation statement is on this type of investment. If the investment is a financial arrangement, the accruals rules apply and the treatment of planning fees will depend on whether the financial arrangement was entered into 1 2 before or after the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999 received its royal assent on 20 May 1999. Full details of how the “old” and “new” accrual rules apply to financial planning fees are discussed later. Planning fees will be non-deductible if the income derived from the investments is exempt income or non-assessable income. Fee categories The fees charged by financial advisers vary from one adviser to another, but generally can be separated into a number of categories. Financial planners give the fees they charge various names, but the crucial point is the nature of the fees charged and when they are incurred. The nature and the timing of when the fees are incurred will determine whether they are of a revenue nature and therefore deductible for income tax purposes, or whether they are of a capital nature and not deductible. The fees can be summarised as: (a) Initial planning fees: Fees charged in relation to services provided by the adviser for the initial interview where the investor and the adviser discuss the investor’s investment goals, savings objectives, cash requirements, and life and general insurance requirements. The adviser then prepares a draft portfolio plan for the investor. Further interviews, discussions, and adjustments to the draft plan may follow until it is acceptable to the investor. (b) Implementation fees: All fees for services associated with implementing the draft plan devised in (a). They will include any one-off up front fees paid to or made in respect of services or charges to advisers, administrators, executors, fund managers, etc., to purchase or acquire the investments. They include brokerage, and any payments to custodians on implementation of the plan or charges by fund managers for entry into the investments. (c) Administration fees: Generally described by advisers as “annual on-going” fees. They are charged by the adviser to cover the costs of maintaining records of the investor’s transaction with the adviser. This category also includes charges relating to the handling of cash for the investor, such as the withdrawal and deposit in the investor’s account with the administrator, bank charges, and other administration fees. Also included are any fees or commissions charged by the adviser for collecting income from the investments and arranging this to be paid to or credited to the investor’s account with the adviser or to the investor’s own bank account. (d) Monitoring fees: Annual charges for monitoring and reporting to the investor on the performance of the portfolio (including the performance of the fund managers and the adviser) in terms of the investor’s goals and relaying this information to the investor. The adviser will, from time to time, report on the portfolio’s performance and relay this information to the investor. (e) Evaluation fees: Any fees for services relating to an evaluation of an existing portfolio. Typically, where an investor has an existing portfolio of 3 investments and either seeks a financial adviser’s advice for the first time, or seeks confirmation that the portfolio’s performance is matching the goals originally set either by the investor or with the assistance of a financial planner at the initial planning stage. This is a more detailed examination of performance of the portfolio than simply monitoring performance and reporting to the client. It may or may not result in a recommendation from the adviser to make changes to investments within the portfolio to maintain the investor’s aims. (f) Re-planning fees: Fees for services relating to the re-planning of a portfolio arising from category (e) services due to changes to the investor’s objectives. This could entail minor changes, or the complete restructuring of investments and a change in investment strategy. Re-planning fees do not necessarily refer to advice supplied by the same adviser. The fees could be for advice by an adviser to a new client who had previously managed his or her own portfolio or had previously engaged a different adviser. Included in this category are any other fees as described in Initial planning fees at (a) above, when there has been a complete restructuring of investments. (g) Switching fees: Fees related to the costs involved in selling existing investments and/or purchasing new investments arise from a recommendation by the adviser as a result of category (e) or category (f) services. The fees will be charged by the adviser for changing investments within the portfolio. Also included are any fees relating to the withdrawal in whole or in part from an existing portfolio. Financial planners may charge a global fee that will include fees for more than one of the above categories. It will then be necessary for the fees to be apportioned between the categories, based on the actual work done, to ensure the fees are correctly treated for deductibility purposes. A similar apportionment exercise needs to be undertaken in the case of “performance fees”, where an investor may have the option of being able to elect to pay a performance fee instead of fees for some or each of the categories noted above. Performance fees are a form of global fee paid to advisers based on how well the portfolio of investments selected by the adviser and agreed to by the investor, is performing against some pre-determined measure. The calculation of the seven categories of fees noted above might be based on a standard fee structure, hours of work put in by the adviser, the amount of the investments made by the investor, or a combination thereof. Performance fees on the other hand, are calculated under some pre-determined formula based on how well the investor’s portfolio, as recommended by the adviser, performs over a period of time. These fees could include a standard amount, plus a percentage based on the extent to which the level of growth or return from the portfolio exceeds previously agreed targets, or the fee could be based solely on a percentage of the returns/agreed targets. Irrespective of the name given to the fee, or the basis of its calculation, the income tax treatment of the fees will be determined having regard to the services performed in establishing, administering and altering the investor’s portfolio, based on the seven 4 categories of services mentioned above. It may be that in certain cases the performance fee is paid in respect of all the seven categories of services, while in other instances the fee may be only for the services coming within some of the categories, e.g. the administration and monitoring fee categories. In view of this, it is not the description (label) that the adviser attaches to the fee charged that is relevant, rather it is what service(s) the fee is actually paid for that determines whether or not the fee is deductible. Performance fees are in reality no different to any other global or multi-service fee charged by an adviser . How the amount is apportioned among the categories of services is a question of fact to be determined in the circumstances of the particular case. Investor categories Investors fall within one of three categories: Passive investors: Persons whose primary aim is to derive dividend and interest income from a secure investment portfolio. There may also be a secondary hope or possibility that the investments will provide long-term capital appreciation. They will make changes to their investment portfolio from time to time to achieve this aim. Some investors may also be “actively” involved in monitoring their investment portfolios (or engage a financial adviser to do this for them) to ensure that the primary aim of maximising dividend and interest yield is maintained. The passive investor will not be in business as an investor, nor will the investor buy or sell investments for short-term gains (speculator). Speculative investors: Investors who acquire an investment with the intention of selling it for the purpose of making a profit from the transaction. These acquisitions and sales are generally of a one-off nature. Business investors: Persons are in the business of investing when the nature of their activity, and their intention in respect of that activity, is sufficient to amount to a business (as discussed later in this statement). The following table is a summary of the income tax treatment of financial planning fees as they apply to excepted financial arrangements (e.g. shares and share options and interests in unit trusts) discussed in this statement. The table also indicates when the fees will be deductible. The deductibility of fees relating to financial arrangements is discussed later.

(2) Deductible in the year incurred, unless • the fee is “accrual expenditure”, or • the fee is in respect of “preliminary expenses” (i.e. paid before any such activity has commenced). (3) Deductible in the year incurred, unless • the fee is “accrual expenditure”, or • paid in respect of a “financial arrangement” (4) Deductible in the year incurred, unless • there is a significant change to the investment structure (e.g. a change from a rental producing structure to a share investment portfolio resulting in a changed income flow) ISSUES The question considered in this statement is: in what circumstances will the Commissioner allow financial planning fees as a deduction under either section BD 2 or the accruals rules of the Income Tax Act 1994? This will be determined by the following: • Whether the taxpayer is a passive, speculative, or a business investor. • The nature of the service fees charged to the investor by the financial adviser, and whether these fees are on revenue or capital account. • If the fees are paid before the commencement of a speculative or business undertaking, whether the fees are “preliminary expenditure” and not deductible. • How the trading stock and revenue account property rules affect the deductibility of planning fees. • If the planning fees are “accrual expenditure”, how deductibility is affected. • If the investment is a “financial arrangement” as defined, whether the arrangement was entered into before or after 20 May 1999 - the date of royal assent of the Taxation (Accruals Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999. If the arrangement was entered into before 20 May 1999, whether: • the investor is a cash basis holder or a non-cash basis holder, • the fees are contingent or non-contingent on the implementation of the financial plan. • if the fees are non-contingent, whether they are more or less than 2% of the “core acquisition price”. If the arrangement was entered into on or after 20 May 1999, whether: • the investor is a cash basis person. • the fees are non-contingent. If they are non-contingent, they are excluded from the accrual rules and treated under normal income tax deductibility rules. Distinction between “excepted financial arrangements” and “financial arrangements” 6 Given that the focus of this statement is on excepted financial arrangements, it is important to know the distinction between excepted financial arrangements and financial arrangements. Both terms are defined in the Act. In the context of this statement excepted financial arrangements are basically equity investments that rely on the profitability of the entity invested in to determine the return to the investor. Shares and share options are a more common form of excepted financial arrangements as far as investors are concerned. On the other hand, financial arrangements are debt instruments that will generally have a fixed rate of return in the form of interest. The definition in the Act describes a financial arrangement as any debt or debt instrument, or any arrangement whereby a person obtains money in consideration for a promise by any person to provide money at some future time or upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of some future event or events. It also includes any arrangement that is substantially similar in nature. Bonds, bank loans, mortgages, and government stock are examples of financial arrangements. BACKGROUND An investor who seeks advice from a financial adviser will be charged for the services provided. Whether any of these fees are deductible for income tax purposes will depend on the type of fee expense incurred and the type of investor who incurs the fee. When an initial financial plan has been devised, agreed to by the investor, and implemented by the adviser, that is not necessarily the end of the matter. Usually systems are in place that require the adviser’s continual involvement. Most financial advisers offer a continuing monitoring service that is generally part of an overall advisory package. The investments are often (but not always) placed in the care of a custodian (presumably for security reasons), the income derived from the investments passes to the adviser or custodian where it is placed in a trust account before being able to be drawn upon by the investor. The maintenance of these trust accounts by the adviser usually incurs costs that are charged to the investor. As part of the service, the adviser may monitor the portfolio to ensure that the aims of the investor are continually met. For this service the investor will often pay further fees. From time to time as part of this monitoring service the adviser can recommend changes to the investment mix. If the investor accepts these recommendations to change investments, further fees are incurred which may include brokerage and switching fees. It is the Commissioner’s view that Public Ruling (BR Pub 95/10) has been useful in respect of the deductibility of expenditure incurred in deriving gross income by investors. However, despite the issue of the Ruling there has been occasional uncertainty on how it should be applied. This is especially so for passive investors, and how the continuing on-going costs should be dealt with. Although some of these were discussed within the commentary definitions of the three categories identified, investors, especially passive investors, may have difficulty in applying the Ruling. It seemed logical to extend and further define the present three categories to make it easier for investors to decide whether or not the fees they pay are deductible. 7 An issue that was not fully considered in Br Pub 95/10 was the deductibility of fees incurred by business and speculative investors before their activity commenced. Another issue not fully considered was the deductibility of fees once a speculative activity had commenced. These issues are now reconsidered, as are legislative changes to the trading stock rules and the accrual rules. Financial advisers charge for a number of services provided to their clients, sometimes using different names for these component services. The tax treatment of the fees depends not on the name given to the service, but on the nature of the service. To determine the correct tax treatment of a service, it is important to identify the exact service a financial adviser provides. The adoption of the expanded categorisation of fees in this statement is intended to make it easier for passive investors to determine whether the fees they pay will be deductible for income tax purposes. The categories correspond to the process usually followed when an investor seeks the assistance of a financial adviser. In some instances financial advisers will charge a global fee that may include fees for more than one of the categories of fees described in this statement. Then it will be necessary to apportion the fees into the appropriate fee categories in order to determine deductibility. In addition, since the issue of Public Ruling BR Pub 95/10, the question of the deductibility of financial planning fees has been considered in three cases before the Taxation Review Authority (TRA). One of these cases was appealed by the Commissioner and heard before the High Court. These cases have established a framework of case law that requires some amendments to the Commissioner’s position set out in BR Pub 95/10. LEGISLATION Deductibility Expenditure can be deducted from gross income if it is provided for in the Income Tax Act 1994. Section BD 2 states: An amount is an allowable deduction of a taxpayer - (a) if it is an allowance for depreciation that the taxpayer is entitled to under Part E (Timing of Income and Deductions), or (b) to the extent that it is an expenditure or loss (i) incurred by the taxpayer in deriving the taxpayer’s gross income, or (ii) necessarily incurred by the taxpayer in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving the taxpayer’s gross income, or (iii) allowed as a deduction to the taxpayer under Part C (Income Further Defined), D (Deductions Further Defined), E (Timing of Income and Deductions), F (Apportionment and Recharacterised Transactions), G (Avoidance and Non-Market Transactions), H (Treatment of Net Income of Certain Entities), I (Treatment of Net Losses), L (Credits) or M (Tax Payments). 8 Prohibition on deductibility Section BD 2(2) qualifies the general deductibility test in section BD 2. Section BD 2(2)(e) prohibits the deduction of capital. It denies a deduction for expenditure: (e) of a capital nature, unless allowed as a deduction under Part D (Deductions Further Defined), E (Timing of Income and Deductions). Section BD 2(b) prohibits a deduction where the expense relates to exempt income, denying a deduction for expenditure: (b) incurred in deriving exempt income under Part C (Income Further Defined), D (Deductions Further Defined), or F (Apportionment and Recharacterised Transactions). Assessability Under section BD 1, certain types of income are assessable. Sections CD 3, CD 4, and CE 1 further define income. The following income types are relevant to this statement: • Business profits - section CD 3. • Personal property sales - section CD 4. • Interest, dividends, and annuities - section CE 1(1)(a). • Benefits from money advanced - section CE 1(1)(b). • Accruals income - section CE 1(1)(c). Definition “Business” - Includes any profession, trade, manufacture, or undertaking carried on for pecuniary profit: Qualified accruals rules The qualified accruals rules in Part EH provide rules for the timing and recognition of income derived and expenditure incurred in respect of financial arrangements. A financial arrangement is widely defined and means: a debt or debt instrument, an arrangement whereby a person receives money in consideration for a promise for repayment of that money at some future time or at the occurrence of any event, and any arrangements that are substantially similar. Bonds, bank loans, mortgages, and government stock are examples of financial arrangements. The deductibility of financial adviser’s fees paid in respect of these financial arrangements is dealt with under the accruals rules and could result in a different tax treatment to investments such as company shares, which are not financial arrangements (i.e. they are “excepted financial arrangements”). The legislation provides a method for calculating the income (or loss) from financial arrangements. Basically, this methodology compares the total amounts paid out, with the total amounts received, from each financial arrangement. The difference is either gross income or expenditure incurred from the arrangement. Implementation fees paid to a financial adviser for the acquisition of a financial arrangement are included in the calculation of the income (or loss). This matter is further considered in this statement under the heading Qualified accruals rules and implementation fees. 9 If a planning fee is paid in advance to cover future income years, the fees may be “accrual expenditure”, and deductibility may be spread over the number of years to which the fees relate. This too is discussed in more detail later in the statement under the heading Where the fee is ‘accrual expenditure’. Definitions “Accrual expenditure”, in section EF 1 and EF 4, in relation to any person, means any amount of expenditure incurred on or after 1 August 1986 by the person that is allowed as a deduction under this Act, ..........., other than expenditure incurred - (a) In the purchase of trading stock; or (b) In respect of any financial arrangement; or (c) In respect of a specified lease, or a lease to which section EO 2 applies, or “Core acquisition price” (i) In relation to the holder of the financial arrangement, the value of all consideration provided by the holder in relation to the financial arrangement; or (ii) In relation to the issuer of the financial arrangement, the value of all consideration provided to the issuer in relation to the financial arrangement. “Excepted financial arrangement” means any of the following arrangements: (includes) (f) In relation to a holder or an issuer, shares, other than withdrawable shares, or an option to buy shares, other than withdrawable shares, where those shares were or that option was acquired or issued by the person before 8.00 p.m. New Zealand Standard Time on 18 June 1987; (g) In relation to a holder or an issuer, shares, other than withdrawable shares, or an option to acquire or to sell or otherwise dispose of shares, other then withdrawable shares, where those shares were or that option was acquired or issued by the person after 8.00 p.m. New Zealand Standard Time on 18 June 1987: “Financial arrangement” - (a) Subject to paragraph (b), means - (i) Any debt or debt instrument; and (ii) Any arrangement (whether or not such arrangement includes an arrangement that is a debt or debt instrument, or an excepted financial arrangement) whereby a person obtains money in consideration for a promise by any person to provide money to any person at some future time or times, or upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of some future event or events (including the giving of, or failure to give, notice); and (iii) Any arrangement which is of a substantially similar nature (including, without restricting the generality of the preceding provisions of this subparagraph, sell-back and buy-back arrangements, debt defeasances, and assignments of income); - but does not include any excepted financial arrangement that is not part of a financial arrangement: (b) ... 10 Trading stock Changes have been made to the tax rules regarding the valuation of trading stock. The Taxation (Tax Credits, Trading Stock, and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1998 made changes that will affect business and speculative investors. The amending legislation inserted a new subpart EE into the Income Tax Act 1994. The definition of “trading stock” has been clarified so that it is limited to anything that is manufactured, produced, or acquired and held for sale or exchange in the ordinary course of a business. Generally, commencing from the 1998-1999 income year, business investors will now be required to value their trading stock at cost or, in the case of an excepted financial arrangement where the stock is worthless, at a nil value under section EE 3. The previous valuation options of market value and replacement price are no longer available. For business investors, trading stock will not include any investment that is a financial arrangement to which the qualified accruals rules apply. However, excepted financial arrangements (shares, options, and other equity type investments) must be valued at cost under section EE 13. For speculative investors, “revenue account property” (property that is either trading stock or would give rise to gross income of the investor when sold or disposed of) that is an excepted financial arrangement, must also be valued at cost. Under section EF 2(1 A) these “costs” of acquiring revenue account property (the investments) are not allowed as a deduction until such time as the investments to which they relate are sold. Definition “Revenue account property” means, in respect of any person, property which is trading stock of the person or otherwise property in respect of which any amount derived on disposition would be gross income of the person other than under section EG 19 (disposal of depreciable property): Legislation Section EE 5(1) A taxpayer, other than a small taxpayer, that is valuing closing stock at cost, must include all costs required to be included by generally accepted accounting principles and must allocate those costs to closing stock using methods acceptable under generally accepted accounting principles. Section EE 13 (1) An excepted financial arrangement that is trading stock must be valued at cost. (2) In calculating the value of an excepted financial arrangement that is trading stock or revenue account property, a taxpayer must use one of the cost-flow methods authorised in section EE 6. (3) An excepted financial arrangement that is trading stock may be valued at nil if it - (a) Has no current or likely future market value; and (b) Has been written off as worthless by the taxpayer. 11 Section EF 2(1) Subject to subsection (2), a taxpayer must allocate an allowable deduction in respect of the cost of any revenue account property to the later of - (a) The income year in which the property is disposed of by the taxpayer; and (b) The income year (or years) in which the gross income is derived by the taxpayer in respect of the disposition of the property. TYPES OF INVESTOR The income tax treatment of initial planning, implementation, administration, monitoring, revaluation, re-planning, and switching fees differs, depending on whether the investor is: • a passive investor • a speculative investor • in the business of investing. These types of investor are defined for the purposes of this statement, and are discussed in more detail below. When is an investor a passive investor? A passive investor is a person whose primary aim is to derive dividend and interest income from a secure investment portfolio. There may also be a secondary hope or possibility that the investments will provide long-term capital appreciation. A passive investor will make changes to the investment portfolio from time to time to achieve this aim. Some investors may also be “actively” involved in monitoring their investment portfolios (or engage a financial adviser to do this for them) to ensure that the primary aim of maximising dividend and interest yield is maintained. The passive investor will not be in business as an investor, nor will the investor buy or sell investments for short-term gains (speculator). When is an investor a speculative investor? A speculative investor is someone who either: • Acquires an investment with the intention of selling it; or • Carries on or carries out an undertaking or scheme, involving the investment, entered into or devised for the purpose of making a profit. Profits derived or losses incurred in those circumstances are assessable under section CD 4 and deductible under section BD 2. Investors are not speculative investors simply because they would like to see their investment capital increase, or that they may sell their investment if the capital 12 increases. Most passive investors fall within that description. It is the person’s dominant purpose that is important in this distinction. An investor may be a speculative investor in relation to one investment, and not in relation to another. For example: an investor has a number of financial arrangements and investments in unit trusts, and decides as a single transaction to buy some listed shares with the intention of selling them in the next month or so. The dominant purpose for buying the shares is for resale at a profit. In respect of the transaction the investor is a speculative investor. However, if a speculative investor regularly carries out activities of speculating in investments, the question arises as to whether those activities constitute a business of speculating. As discussed below, whether an investor is in business will be a question of fact in each case. An investor’s status as a speculator or in business may affect the deductibility of some planning fees. When is an investor in business? Section OB 1 defines “business” to include: any profession, trade, manufacture, or undertaking carried on for pecuniary profit. Whether a taxpayer is in the business of investing is dependent on that taxpayer’s fact situation. The tests and criteria established by cases such as Grieve v CIR (1989) 6 NZTC 61,682 and CIR v Stockwell (1992) 14 NZTC 9,191 are relevant to this question. The leading “business” case in New Zealand is that of Grieve. In that case the Court of Appeal concluded that there are two aspects to the concept of a business: • the nature of the activity; and • the intention with which the taxpayer undertakes the activity. This approach was followed in Stockwell. The decision in Stockwell is useful in determining whether an individual is in the business of investing. In Stockwell the Court of Appeal discussed, as obiter dicta, the question of when a taxpayer is in business. The Court observed that the question of whether a taxpayer was in business for tax purposes depended on whether the activities undertaken by the taxpayer were sufficiently continuous and extensive to constitute being a business. That is a question of fact and degree and is dependent upon the taxpayer’s particular fact situation. In Grieve, Richardson J set out some factors relevant to the inquiry as to whether a taxpayer is in business: • the nature of the taxpayer’s activities; and • the period over which the taxpayer engages in the activity; and • the scope of the taxpayer’s operations; and • the volume of transactions undertaken; and 13 • the commitment of time, money, and effort by the taxpayer; and • the pattern of activity; and • the financial results achieved by the activity. These factors were reiterated by the Court of Appeal in Stockwell. The Court commented that the test is objective rather than subjective. Taxpayers’ intentions are, therefore, evidenced by their activities (the extent and continuity), not by their own personal view of their activities. In Stockwell the Court of Appeal also provided some observations or guidelines regarding the extent and continuity of activity required to constitute a business: • The fact that a taxpayer’s activity is sufficient to render his or her returns assessable under section 65(2)(e) (now section CD 4) does not mean that the activity is a business. • Where the taxpayer’s activity is merely a means of supplementing an already adequate income, the taxpayer is unlikely to be in the business from which that supplementary income is derived. • If the taxpayer is in full-time employment and engages in a spare-time activity, the presumption will be against that spare-time activity being a business. • If the taxpayer is either unemployed or retired and is only engaged in moderate (investment) activity, the presumption is against that activity being a business. Ultimately, whether a person is in the business of investing will be a question of fact. In seeking to determine whether a taxpayer is in the business of investing, the Commissioner uses the criteria identified above from the Grieve and Stockwell decisions. The following are examples to indicate whether or not an investor is a passive investor, and whether an investor is in the business of investing. Example 1 Investor A is an investment adviser employed by Bank. She spends most of her day advising investors of their investment opportunities and implementing investments for them. Investor A and her husband have a young family and have recently bought a larger house. The extent of their personal investments is minimal. Besides Investor A’s membership of a superannuation scheme operated by Bank, Investor A and her husband have a few thousand dollars invested as a lump sum in a managed fund. They approached a financial adviser for advice on which fund to invest in. The continuity and extent of Investor A’s investment activities make it unlikely that she is in the business of investing. Her employment activities of investment advice do not have any bearing on her personal activities. They must be viewed separately. Investor A is a passive investor. 14 Example 2 Investor B is a retired bank manager. Throughout his professional career he has acquired a number of investments from which he has continued to derive both income and capital growth. Investor B uses the services of a financial adviser in managing his investments. While Investor B takes an interest in the performance of his investments, he leaves the majority of the work to his financial adviser. Investor B only undertakes a minimal amount of buying and selling. Except for some superannuation entitlements, Investor B derives all his income from these investments. If there are no other relevant facts, Investor B is not in the business of investing. Although the investments represent the majority of his income, his activities lack sufficient extent and continuity to constitute a business of investing. Cooke P in Stockwell considered there would be a presumption against a taxpayer being in the business of investing where a retired person undertook merely modest investment activity. The fact that the investments represent a taxpayer’s primary source of income does not automatically make the activity the taxpayer’s business. Investor B is a passive investor. Example 3 Taxpayer C was made redundant by his employer and received a large severance payment. He wished to buy some form of business but could not decide what type. In the intervening period, rather than invest his severance pay in fixed securities, he decided to undertake some share dealing activity with the purpose of increasing his capital. Over a period of eighteen-months he spent considerable time pursuing this activity. He instructed and used a regular professional sharebroker from whom he received regular client letters. Taxpayer C received weekly share advice letters from other professional advisors that contained recommendations as to when to buy and sell shares. He studied the daily newspapers, noting share prices of listed companies in which he held shares and the share price movements of other companies. Taxpayer C read articles relating to listed companies’ shares and share movements, and watched any sharemarket programs on television. He read annual reports of companies in which he held shares, and of some other market leaders. He regularly received share analysis publications from his sharebroker, which gave detailed analysis of the prospects of a number of leading companies in a wide range of sectors, with recommendations as to the buying and selling of shares. During this time Taxpayer C purchased and sold many shares. Any shares purchased were only held for as long he considered he could maximise returns on each share parcel. He acquired the shares on all occasions for the purpose of selling them at a profit and did not purchase them for dividend income. During this time he received other income in the form of superannuation payments and some consultancy fees from his former employer. On the basis of his activities, his purpose and intention with regard to the purchase and sale of shares, Taxpayer C is considered to be in the business of investing. 15 Deductibility provisions (a) General deductibility The general deductibility section is section BD 2(1). Section BD 2(1)(b)(i) applies if the planning expenditure is incurred in gaining or producing gross income. Section BD 2(1)(b)(ii) applies to expenditure incurred in carrying on a business. Section BD 2(1) is subject to section BD 2(2). Section BD 2(2)(e) prohibits the deduction of capital expenditure. “Capital” is not defined. (b) The capital/revenue distinction The courts have had to decide if expenditure is capital in nature in numerous cases. Often they examine various tests to decide whether expenditure has the features of capital, although they emphasise that tests are merely a guide and the particular facts of each situation will determine the matter. In deciding whether planning fees are capital or revenue expenditure, the question is whether the fees are incurred in relation to the capital assets (the profit making structure), or in relation to the income that an investor derives from those assets. The Privy Council in BP Australia Ltd v FCT (1965) 3 All ER 209, cited with approval various judgments of the New Zealand Court of Appeal (e.g. CIR v Mc Kenzies New Zealand Ltd (1983) 10 NZTC 5233 and CIR v LD Nathan & Co Ltd (1972) NZLR 209), and followed the approach of Dixon J in Sun Newspapers Ltd v FCT (1938) 61 CLR 337 who said that there were three matters to consider when determining whether expenditure is capital or income: • The character of the advantage sought • The manner in which it is to be used, relied upon or enjoyed (and in this and the preceding factor recurrence may be relevant) • The means adopted to enjoy it. In BP Australia Ltd the Privy Council analysed the character of the advantage sought by the expenditure using a number of tests. The Privy Council considered: • The need or occasion that calls for the expenditure • Whether the payments were paid out of fixed or circulating capital • Whether the payments were of a once and for all nature, producing assets or advantages that are of an enduring benefit • How the sum in question would be treated on ordinary accounting principles • Whether the sums were expended on the structure within which the profits were to be earned or as part of the income-earning process. The approach adopted by the Privy Council was to consider what the expenditure was calculated to effect. 16 BP Australia has recently been cited in a number of cases before the TRA, and one case heard on appeal to the High Court, dealing with the deductibility of financial planning fees. These cases make it clear that there is a difference in treatment between financial planning fees incurred to commence an investment strategy, and fees paid subsequently to monitor or change an existing portfolio of investments. These cases are discussed in more detail under the heading Case law later in this statement. The Authorities and the Court applied the criteria from BP Australia to the specific fact situation of each case. It is, therefore, considered useful to discuss the capital/revenue distinctions from BP Australia in some detail before proceeding further. The Sun Newspapers tests The first test mentioned in Sun Newspapers, and examined in BP Australia, was the character of the advantage sought. In the context of financial planning fees, the effect the investor wishes to achieve is a plan or strategy for investing his or her financial assets to achieve investment goals. The need or occasion for the expenditure is the investor’s decision to examine his or her financial assets, and to receive initial advice on the best mix and type of assets in which to invest. The investor incurs a planning fee for such advice. The advice received relates to the investor’s capital assets. As a general proposition, the direct purpose of the initial planning advice is to establish the best mix of investments to achieve the investor’s investment goals. The result the investor wishes to achieve may be to derive more income from his or her investments, or it may be another result. Following the initial advice, the investor may subsequently wish to reduce or increase the risk of a portfolio, or may wish to change investments to produce tax-paid returns on retirement. He or she may wish to change from intangible assets to property investments. This subsequent advice may relate to the investor’s capital assets, which are the investor’s profit-earning structure, or to the profit-making process. Analysis of whether planning advice is capital or revenue expenditure may be similar to analysing whether fees for legal and other professional advice are capital or revenue. It may not always be possible to point to an enduring asset. As with professional advice, the test is to determine whether the expenditure is incurred in relation to the profit-earning structure, or the profit-making process. In Foley Bros Pty Ltd v FC of T (1965) 13 ATD 562, the full High Court of Australia held that in examining the matter to which legal fees related, “the true contrast is between altering the framework within which income producing activities are for the future to be carried on and taking a step as part of those activities within the framework”. The question is whether the expenditure is incurred to achieve an enduring advantage. This test of capital is not whether expenditure results in a permanent, tangible asset (Kemball v C of T \[1932\] NZLR 1305, John Fairfax and Sons Pty Ltd v FC of T (1959) 101 CLR 30), but if the expenditure is incurred to obtain an advantage or something of lasting value. The financial adviser provides an initial plan that becomes the investment framework for the investor. The plan is of continuing benefit to the investor because it forms the investor’s strategy. Using the investor’s goals, the adviser provides an approach to investment that takes into account those goals, and may identify particular investments that will enable those goals to be achieved. Over 17 time, particular investments may no longer serve the purpose of achieving the investor’s goals, and the adviser may recommend new investments. When that happens, the adviser’s new advice may relate to bringing into effect a new investment strategy. The time that a plan is of value to an investor will vary. It will be unusual for a plan to be developed each year. Although aspects of the plan may change as the performance of a particular investment changes or if the investor’s goals change, the initial plan is nonetheless something of lasting value rather than something that is a regular, recurring expense incurred in deriving investment income. Fixed or circulating capital In BP Australia the Privy Council considered that the test of whether sums were payable out of fixed or circulating capital tended in that case to favour the payments as revenue expenditure. The members of the Judicial Committee said (14 ATD 1, 8) that fixed capital is that on which a taxpayer looks to get a return by its trading operation, and circulating capital is that which comes back in the taxpayer’s trading operations. Their Lordships considered that the amounts paid by BP to a service station owner for exclusive dealership (trade ties) were sums that had to come back penny by penny with every order during the period in order to reimburse and justify the particular outlay for the trade ties. They concluded that the lump sums were part of the consistent demand that must be answered out of the returns of the trade. As such, the Privy Council found that the sums were payable out of circulating capital. The test that examines whether expenditure relates to fixed or circulating capital is not usually relevant to a passive or speculative investor. “Fixed capital” and “circulating capital” are relevant terms to a business that has fixed plant and circulating capital that are turned over while making profits and would apply to a business investor. Accounting treatment In BP Australia the Privy Council noted that the sums paid to retailers were entered into the profit and loss account by BP’s accountants. The Privy Council considered it would have been inappropriate to put the sums on the balance sheet. However, they accepted it was misleading to put the whole sum into one year’s expenses. They contemplated the idea of deducting the payments and adding back the unexpired value, but concluded that accountants did not follow this practice. Allocation to revenue was the “slightly preferable” view. In Christchurch Press Company Limited v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10, 206, Gallen J noted that there was no evidence on the appropriate accounting treatment of such a payment. However, his Honour referred to a comment of Lord Donovan in IRC v Land Securities Investment Trust Limited \[1969\] 2 All ER 430, 433 (PC) where his Lordship said that where a company used its own employees to build an extension to its factory, the accountant should debit the wages to the capital account relating to the extension. Although the comments of Lord Donovan were criticised by counsel for the taxpayer in Christchurch Press, the Court considered it was at least an indication of what the position was when the case was decided. For passive and speculative investors, the accounting treatment is not relevant as they are not in business. 18 Benefit obtained and method of payment The other two considerations mentioned in Sun Newspapers are the manner in which the benefit obtained by the expense is used, relied upon, or enjoyed, and the method of payment. The initial planning advice will be used as the investor’s on-going investment strategy. The advice forms the basis for investment of the investor’s capital assets. The method of payment is usually a one-off payment when a plan is first prepared. Further payments may also be made for planning advice if the adviser suggests modifications to the investor’s portfolio, or if the investor’s goals change. However, as discussed under Case Law, the method of payment is not determinative in deciding whether financial planning fees are on revenue or capital account. (c) Fees incurred in gaining or producing non-assessable or exempt income No deduction is available to the extent to which fees are incurred in the production of non-assessable or exempt income. Section BD 2 only allows a deduction for expenditure incurred in the production of gross income, or for expenditure necessarily incurred in the carrying on of a business for the purpose of gaining or producing gross income. Section BD 2(2)(b) denies a deduction for expenditure incurred in gaining exempt income. The link between gross income and planning fees will not be present when investments purchased on the advice in a plan are tax-paid investments, e.g. insurance bonds. Fees paid for investments that do not result in gross income are not deductible for any investor, even if the investor is in the business of investment or is a speculative investor. Therefore, where expenditure on financial planning fees produces non-assessable or exempt income, the fees cannot be deducted. Having determined the general requirements of deductibility, it is necessary to discuss how these requirements apply to the three categories of investors. A. Passive investors - deductibility of fees A passive investor is a person whose primary aim is to derive dividend and interest income from a secure investment portfolio. A secondary hope or expectation may be that the investments will provide long-term capital growth. The passive investor will not be in business as an investor, nor will the investor buy and sell investments for short-term gains. However, most investors are likely to sell and replace investments, from time to time, to ensure that the aims of their investment strategy are continually met. Section BD 2(1)(b)(i) applies to passive investors if the planning expenditure is incurred in gaining or producing gross income, i.e. the fees must have the requisite connection with the producing of gross income to be deductible Section BD 2(1)(b)(ii) does not apply to passive investors or speculative investors because it only applies to expenditure incurred in carrying on a business. In addition, section BD 2(2)(e) prohibits the deduction of capital expenditure. 19 Fees for financial plans will fail the general deductibility test under section BD 2(1)(b)(i) if the fees do not have the requisite connection with gross income. For example, when the plan is developed, the investor may not have decided whether to implement it. The investor may have received other advice, and see the plan as a possible method of capital asset reorganisation. No direct link may exist between the plan and deriving gross income from investments purchased on the advice contained in the plan. If the investor has already put a plan in place, and receives further advice from an adviser to achieve new goals, the necessary connection with gross income may be present. However, as discussed above, the fees will not be deductible if they are capital in nature. To determine whether the fees are revenue or capital in nature, it is necessary to examine each of the categories of expenditure charged by financial advisers. Initial planning fees These fees are charged for services provided by the adviser for the initial interview where the investor and the adviser discuss the investor’s investment goals, savings objectives, cash requirements, and life and general insurance requirements. The adviser then prepares a draft portfolio plan for the investor. Further interviews, discussions, and adjustments to the draft plan may follow until it is acceptable to the investor. Initial planning fees are not deductible to passive investors because they relate to the creation of a capital structure (the profit or income earning structure) and are therefore capital expenditure. In some situations, planning fees are not deductible for the further reasons that they are not deductible under the general deductibility section, or because they relate to exempt income or private expenditure. Implementation fees Often financial advisers use another organisation (a “custodian”) to place investments. Advisers pass on the custodian’s implementation charge to the investor, either within their fee, or separately as a disbursement. Implementation fees include fees payable to investment fund managers for entry into the investments. Implementation fees are directly related to establishing the investor’s income earning structure, and are not related to the income earning process. The effect achieved is that the investor obtains a new capital asset. The investment asset obtained as a result of the investor incurring an implementation fee will endure, because a passive investor does not buy and sell financial assets frequently and will hold the asset for a time. Implementation fees are not regular or recurring expenses and, therefore, are not deductible to passive investors for income tax purposes. In Case U53 87 ATC 351 heard before the Australian Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the taxpayer paid a fee called a service fee that was calculated as a percentage of the value of units the investor bought in a unit trust. (The same unit trust was involved in Case U160 87 ATC 935.) The investment document stated that 20 the service fee was for payment in advance for services to be rendered throughout the life of the fund. No description of the nature of the services was provided in the prospectus of the unit trust. The Tribunal in both cases held that the charges on the basis of a percentage of funds invested indicates that if any services were to be rendered, they would not be in the nature of management services, which were provided for elsewhere in the investment documents. The Tribunal in both cases held that the service fee was in reality part of the cost of the units and was a capital cost. On the basis of Case U53 and Case U160, fees that are an entry cost are not deductible implementation fees. An exception to the general position that implementation fees are not deductible to passive investors, relates to implementation fees that are part of the cost of “financial arrangements” - see below under the heading Qualified accruals rules. Administration fees These fees are paid to reimburse the adviser for the costs incurred in maintaining the investor’s portfolio, such as, the collection of income and depositing funds to the investor’s bank account or paying direct to the investor. These administration costs are part of the process of the investor earning gross income from the investments. They directly relate to the returns from the investments, rather than relating to the capital investments themselves. Administration fees are often regular, on-going expenses. The investor does not receive an enduring advantage as a result of this expenditure, and the expenses can not be linked to the capital structure of the investments. Administration fees are deductible to passive investors under section BD 2(1)(b)(i) because they have a nexus with gross income. In some cases, an administration fee could be paid for several years in advance. Such expenditure could meet the definition of “accrual expenditure” to which section EF 1 applies. The effect of this is that any portion of accrual expenditure not expended in that income year will not be an allowable deduction. That is, the unexpired portion of any such expenditure will be included in the gross income of the passive investor for the income year in which the payment is made, and as such will increase the gross income of the passive investor. See further discussion on this point under the heading Where the fee is “accrual expenditure”. Monitoring fees Monitoring involves the adviser monitoring and evaluating the performance of the investor’s portfolio. Monitoring services include collecting data on the investor’s investments, and events and research material that have implications for the investor, and reporting to the investor on this data. The financial adviser may also evaluate performance of the investment portfolio (including performance of fund managers and the adviser) in terms of the investor’s goals, and relay this information to the investor. 21 Monitoring may include arranging the collection of income from investments and exchanging currency. Monitoring fees are usually charged as a percentage of the investment funds under the adviser’s management. For passive investors, monitoring is typically on an annual or semi-annual basis. For business investors, monitoring may be more often. These fees are paid for the adviser to monitor the performance of the investor’s investments. These, like the administration fees, are for management services that are part of the process of the investor earning gross income from investments. The services relate more to the returns from the investments than the investments themselves. Monitoring fees are often regular, on-going expenses. The investor does not receive an enduring advantage as a result of monitoring. Monitoring fees are deductible by passive investors under section BD 2(1)(b)(i). As noted under Administration fees, to the extent that monitoring fees are accrual expenditure, their deduction will be affected by section EF 1. Evaluation fees Evaluation fees relate to services for a more extensive evaluation of the investor’s investments. These services will occur where the investor, who has already established an income earning structure (in other words an investment portfolio), desires a review to ensure that the investments are meeting the goals and aims decided at the initial planning stage. This is a more detailed examination of the performance of the investments, rather than simply monitoring performance and reporting to the investor. The service may or may not result in a recommendation from the adviser to make changes. Because these services are directly related to the income earning process, they are revenue in nature. They will qualify for a deduction, provided the advice received and implemented does not result in a significant change to the income earning structure, e.g. changing from a portfolio of rental properties to one of shares and securities. In this latter situation the fees will be a prohibited deduction by the operation of section BD 2(2)(e). They are on capital account being a change in the income earning structure. Re-planning fees Re-planning services may be provided as part of the financial adviser’s on-going service. Using information received from monitoring or re-evaluating an investor’s portfolio, the financial adviser may recommend changes to the investor’s investments. The changes may be made to bring the investor’s portfolio into line with the investor’s goals and risk profile, to take advantage of better or new opportunities, or to take into account a change in the investor’s requirements. Some financial advisers may call a fee for this service a monitoring fee. In this situation the service is better described as a planning fee or a re-planning fee, even though some of the original investments may be retained. 22 As with evaluation fees discussed above, deductibility of this category of fee will depend upon whether the new plan makes some adjustments to the existing income structure or there is a complete or significant change to the income earning structure. For passive investors this means that where the change is only to the type of investments held, the fee will be deductible. On the other hand, if the re-planning fees result in a significant change in the investment structure or a change in investment type (e.g. share to rental properties), the fee will not be deductible. See further discussion below under Recent case law. Switching fees These fees are the costs incurred by investors for buying, selling, or changing investments. Whether these costs are deductible as a revenue expense or are prohibited for a deduction because they are of a capital nature will depend on the extent of the changes made to the investment structure. As with the discussion above under Evaluation fees and Re-planning fees, the crucial factor is the extent of the changes. Changes within an investment type will generally be revenue whereas a change to the type of investment structure, or significant changes to an existing structure, will be capital. See further discussion under, Recent case law below. Recent case law Three recent Taxation Review Authority cases, and one that has been appealed to the High Court, have dealt with the deductibility of what were described by financial advisers as “portfolio establishment (or monitoring) fees”. All the cases dealt with the deductibility of fees from the same financial planning firm. In the first case, Case T42 (1998) 18 NZTC 8,285, the Authority found in favour of the husband and wife taxpayers. The objectors had claimed a deduction for what was described by the financial planner as “portfolio establishment costs”. Up until the time the objectors sought the advice of the financial planner, the husband had managed a portfolio of shares and other income earning investments. One of these investments was a superannuation scheme. This was “cashed up” and added to the other investments that formed the total investment capital from which the financial planner created a new portfolio of investments. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue argued that the portfolio establishment costs were of a capital nature and not deductible, as there was a creation of a new or substantially changed income producing asset. However, Judge Willy determined that the fees were incurred in the monitoring and changing of the taxpayers’ existing investment portfolio rather than the planning or implementation of a new one. The taxpayers had previously managed their own portfolio for a number of years and this was significant in Judge Willy’s reasoning. Case T42 was appealed by the Commissioner (C of IR v BO and M North, (1999) 19 NZTC 15,219). The High Court confirmed the TRA’s decision and dismissed the appeal. Finding for the taxpayers, Williams J said that the payments of the financial planning fees were revenue in nature and deductible for income tax purposes. The fees had been charged for a change in investment without a change in object (“...though the mix of their investments changed markedly, the object of their investments did not”). In applying the tests in BP Australia, the Court ruled that it 23 was not determinative that one of those tests, that the fee was paid “once and for all”, was a point in favour of the Commissioner when seen against all the other factors required to be taken into account. In the second TRA case, Case T64 (1998) 18 NZTC 8,493, the Authority considered the deductibility of a similar portfolio monitoring fee paid by the objector to the financial adviser. In this case the objector had no previous experience in managing an investment portfolio. Judge Barber found that the costs of the fee were of a capital nature and not deductible to the taxpayer. The case concerned a taxpayer who on retirement cashed up shares and superannuation benefits from a family company. He then paid a financial consultant to invest the funds for him as a retired person to achieve a particular level of income. At paragraph 34 of the judgment Barber J said: The essential issue is whether the costs of becoming involved in such funds is part of an income earning process or is related to establishing a capital structure from which income flows. It must be correct to say that, pending the deposits of the said proceeds into the objector’s bank account, he held investments in the family auctioneering company and in the associated company and he held a stake in a superannuation fund. However, these holdings would not be regarded in normal speech as investments for the purpose of gaining investment income, because the main investment (in the auctioneering company) was to provide capital to give the objector (and other family members) a job, salary, and, presumably, some dividends. The other shares and superannuation were part of this concept. Upon retirement and sale of the auctioneering business and maturity of superannuation, the objector was simply holding all his funds in a bank account pending the design for him by experts of a financial investment structure off which he expected to achieve a certain level of income. It seems to me that the fee cannot be fairly regarded as incurred in the course of earning income but as incurred in the course of establishing the structure to obtain income. Accordingly, payment of the said consultancy fee represents capital expenditure. In the judgment, the Authority distinguished this present case from Case T42 (discussed earlier). The critical difference is that in Case T42 the objector had an existing “extensive” share portfolio, and the Authority held that the fee was expended as part of the process by which the taxpayers earned their income from their investment portfolio. On the ordinary principles of commercial accounting, that fee would be treated as a debit to revenue and not capital. Willy J found the expenditure to be part of the income earning process because only the prudent management of investments was involved. Interestingly, Barber J in Case T64 stated at paragraph 35, that: Even if one would normally regard the holding of shares in the auctioneering company, with its associated entitlement to superannuation, as an investment structure, it seems to me that the fee in question was incurred to completely change and reconstruct that investment structure. Accordingly, the fee can still not be regarded as incurred in the course of an income earning process. This is consistent with the earlier view stated, that a complete change/restructure of investments is on account of capital. At paragraph 39 Barber J said the fees are capital because they relate to an investment portfolio being “created or substantially modified”. This view appears to be consistent with Willy J’s view that the planning or implementation of a new investment portfolio is on account of capital. 24 In the third TRA case, Case U12, the Authority considered a similar case. Here, the taxpayer, before undertaking the investment plan devised by her financial advisers, held her funds in fixed interest bank securities. As these bank deposits had frequently matured she had shopped around for the best investment rates. However, this took up much of her time and she thought it attractive to let the financial planning adviser take over the investment activity. About 40% of her investment capital stayed in similar fixed interest investments, the remainder being in equity investments. The Commissioner, basing his submissions on an analysis of Cases T42 and T64, submitted that there had been either a clear commencement of a totally new investment structure/strategy or a significant change in an investment structure/strategy. Therefore, the fee was incurred to obtain an appropriate structure or investment of capital from which to achieve income and the fee must be of a capital nature and not deductible. It was not part of an income earning process. In finding for the taxpayer Judge Barber said that the decision was consistent with Cases T42 and T64 and with the High Court decision in CIR v North. Judge Barber held that the taxpayer was an active investor, and that her investment aims did not alter fundamentally, i.e. the change was to her mix of investments. Hence the fees were paid in relation to changes to the income earning process of the taxpayer and not the income earning structure. If they had been the latter, as in Case T64, the payment would be on capital account. It is clear that two factors emerged from the case law that has determined the deductibility of planning fees. One is whether or not the taxpayer had some form of investment strategy prior to seeking and paying for financial advice. If the taxpayer had an existing portfolio of investments, and had active involvement with managing those investments prior to seeking financial advice, it seems the courts would find that the cost of the fees would be incurred in the income earning process (Case T42, CIR v North, and Case No.U12). On the other hand, if there were no prior investment activities, as in Case T64, the fees would most probably be incurred in establishing a portfolio from which future income could be derived. The other factor that has emerged from case law is that where investment aims or objects have not fundamentally changed, even though there may be a significant change in the investments held (TRA CaseU12 and C of IR v North), the fees will be on revenue account. In contrast, where an investment structure has been created or where the investment aims or objects have fundamentally changed, the costs of planning fees will be on capital account. While each case will be decided on its facts, based on the cases cited above, there would need to be either a complete change in investment direction (e.g. a change from a portfolio of shares and fixed interest deposits to rental property), or an almost complete change to an existing portfolio. In this regard, Williams J in C of IR v North stated: In this case \[Case T42\] Willy DCJ was considering a transposition of investments by an experienced investor without change of object. In Case T64 Barber CJ was considering a fundamental change from an investment of capital designed to provide employment, salary and associated benefits to the investment of that capital in investments of a very different nature designed to provide income. 25 ... it would be imprudent to go further than the comments already made save to say that Cases T42 and T64 clearly indicate the difference in result which is likely to occur between fees charged for a change in investments of a broadly similar nature without change in object by contrast with those charged for fundamental changes in investments where the aim of the objector also alters. The words “significant” and “substantially modified” are usually interpreted in the context of their use and the facts of the particular case. For example, in the English Court of Appeal in Granada Theatres v Freehold Investments (Leytonstone) \[1958\] 1 W.L.R 845, Jenkins LJ said: Next, what is meant by the words ‘of a substantial nature’? In a South Australian case, Terry’s Motors v. Rinder (\[1945\] S.A.R. 167), the word ‘substantial’ is pilloried as a word devoid of any fixed meaning and as being an unsatisfactory medium for conveying the idea of some ascertainable proportion of a whole. In Palser v. Grinling, Property Holding Co., Ltd. v. Mischeff (\[1948\] 1 All E.R. 1) a question arose as to what was a ‘substantial portion’ of a rent, and the decision is summarised (not perhaps very helpfully) in the headnote (\[1948\] A.C. 291), saying that ‘substantial’ does not mean ‘not unsubstantial’, but is equivalent to ‘considerable’, and that the judge of fact must decide the matter according to circumstances in each case; In Case TRA No.U12 it was determined that there was a significant change in the investment structure, yet the expenditure was still held to be on revenue account (there being no change to the aims or objects). Therefore, in the context of these cases it seems that the change must be more than significant before a deduction will be prohibited as being on capital account. This is consistent with the earlier view that a considerable change (being nearer to a complete change) in investment structure would need to occur before the expenditure would be denied as a deduction. For example, a change from the ownership of buildings, from which rental income is derived, to a portfolio of security and equity investments which produces interest and dividend income would be considered to be more than a significant change. In these situations there would be a discontinuation of one income earning process for another. The cost of changing from rental income to interest and dividend income, including planning advice fees, would be on capital account as there is a complete change in the income earning structure (C of IR v North). There will be situations where the investor undertakes a significant change in investment strategy over a period of time, such as selling shares to invest the proceeds in rental properties. The investor sells the shares within the portfolio over a number of years to achieve the best return from those sales. The question this raises is whether the fees, charged by a financial adviser on advice as to the optimum time to sell each bundle of shares, will be deductible as a revenue expense or non-deductible as being capital in nature. In the context of the discussion above it could be argued that each sale of each bundle of shares is not a significant change. However, it is the Commissioner’s view that the systematic disposal of the shares is a process of changing the income earning structure, and therefore the fees charged will be on capital account. Another example of a more than significant or a considerable change is where a taxpayer is made redundant from his work and receives a redundancy payment of $100,000. The money is immediately deposited in a three-month fixed-term account at his local bank while he decides what to do with it. He seeks the advice of a financial planner with the view of investing the redundancy proceeds in shares and 26 securities from which he intends to derive interest and dividends to supplement some part-time employment income. On the basis of the definitions contained in this statement, the taxpayer can be described as a passive investor. The planning fees incurred in establishing the taxpayer’s portfolio will be on capital account as they are the costs of creating an investment structure (Case T64). The simple depositing of the money in the fixed-term account could not be considered to be prior investment activity as there was no “active management” of the investment (C of IR v North). The Australian Tax Office (ATO) issued a determination (DT 95/60) in December 1995 dealing with the deductibility of financial planning fees. The conclusion reached by the ATO was basically the same as Public Ruling BR Pub 95/10. That is, that generally the fee for drawing up a financial plan is on capital account. The determination stated: In our view, a fee paid to an investment adviser to draw up an investment plan in these circumstances would be a capital outlay even if some or all of the pre-existing investments were maintained as part of the plan. This is because the fee is for the advice that relates to drawing up an investment plan. The character of the outgoing is not altered because the existing investments fit in with the plan. It is still an outgoing of capital ... (Emphasis added.) The ATO determination is consistent with the view of the law taken in BR Pub 95/10, that fees incurred in the creation of, or changes to, an investment plan, are on capital account. Were it not for the recent TRA and High Court cases discussed above, it could be argued that the better view of the law when deciding whether financial planning fees were deductible or not, would be to treat the portfolio as being a collection of individual investments, each investment being a separate asset (unless the taxpayer is a dealer or trader). In applying the capital/revenue deductibility rules on such a basis, the result may be that advice leading to the sale of any such capital asset would be on capital account. Therefore, for passive investors, who sought financial advice that may lead to the sale of one parcel of shares to purchase another parcel, the cost of making those changes (e.g. switching fees) would be on capital account. However, with the decisions of the High Court (C of IR v North) and the TRA (CaseU12), the Commissioner considers that the matter is now to be determined by the weight of this more recent authority. In these two cases it was held that because the taxpayers had an existing portfolio of investments, and there was no change to the investors’ aims or objects, the fees related to the income earning process (rather than to a collection of capital assets) and were deductible. Apportionment of global fees This interpretation statement categorises the component parts of financial planning fees, based on the process of obtaining an initial financial plan, subsequent monitoring of the plan, and any following adjustments or alterations to that plan. It is considered that if fees are charged by financial advisers on the basis of the description of these categories, then determining what amount is deductible will be on a more objective basis than the previous Public Ruling. In the event that a financial planner charges a global fee (e.g. performance fees) for all the services, an apportionment of that global fee, based on the categories discussed in this statement, will be required. The amount allocated to each category will be a question of fact in each case. Example 4 27 Investor D has a portfolio of investments consisting of shares in listed public companies and deposits in a savings account at his local bank. He seeks advice from a financial adviser as to the appropriateness of these investments, taking into account current dividend and interest income and long-term capital growth. The advice is to completely alter his portfolio by selling off all current investments and investing the proceeds into residential rental properties. The Commissioner considers that this is more than a significant change to the income earning structure. The former income earning process has ceased and a new one commenced. The fees charged to the investor will not be deductible for income tax purposes as they are of a capital nature. Example 5 Investor E has an investment portfolio consisting of shares that generate dividends, and fixed interest debentures. The income from the shares has been inconsistent over the last few years despite, from time to time, the investor selling poor performing company shares and replacing them with shares in companies that seemed to paying better dividends. He seeks advice on what is the best option to ensure he has some certainty in future annual income. His financial adviser recommends that to ensure certainty he should cash up all current investments and place the proceeds in long term fixed interest bank deposits. He agrees to this and asks the adviser to arrange the sale of the shares and arrange to deposit the proceeds in fixed interest deposits. In this situation the Commissioner considers that there has been a significant change in the income earning process. The investor has made a fundamental change to the investment strategy, i.e. changing from an investment portfolio where there was some uncertainty in the income from company shares to the continuing certainty of long- term interest bearing deposits. There has been a significant change in the portfolio’s capital structure, and any financial planning fees incurred by Investor E will be of a capital nature and not deductible. Example 6 Investor F is a retired farmer who used the proceeds from the sale of her farm to buy shares in a number of publicly listed companies in the agriculture sector. After a few years of ownership of these shares, she considered that the dividend yield from some of the companies was inadequate and sought the advice of a financial adviser as to her best option to increase her dividend income. Her financial adviser suggests that she sells the majority of her existing portfolio and uses the proceeds to purchase shares in various telecommunication companies that were expected to perform better than the companies in which she held shares. She asked if the financial planning fees she incurred would be deductible against the dividend income. On the basis of the case law discussed in this statement it is the Commissioner’s view that the change is not a significant change to the income earning structure of Investor F. The changes made to the portfolio are part of the income earning process and the fees incurred are for the purpose of increasing the dividend income. Therefore, they are on revenue account and qualify as a deduction for income tax purposes. 28 B. Speculative investors - deductibility of fees Speculative investors are investors who acquire an investment with the intention of selling it for the purpose of making a profit from the transaction. These acquisitions and sales are generally of a one-off nature. For a speculative investor, any difference between the cost of the investment and the amount received on disposal of the investment is gross income or a deductible loss. Their investments are called revenue account property as they have been purchased for the purpose of resale. Where a speculative investor seeks planning advice, the deductibility of the fees charged by a financial planning adviser, and the timing of such deductions, will depend on the nature of the fees charged. Preliminary expenditure Any planning advice received by a speculative investor prior to commencing the speculative activity may not have the necessary nexus between the derivation of income from speculating in investments. For example, in Case Q18 (1993) 15 NZTC 5,100 the objector intended setting up as a self-employed architect, but before doing so and while still an employee, he undertook a business diploma course at a university. The Commissioner disallowed the claim. In finding for the Commissioner, Barber J at page 5,103 said: In other words, the relevant expenditure was incurred by the objector in November 1988 to prepare him to set up his business as a self-employed architect. That business was not established before 18 November 1989. That type of expenditure is capital in nature and is not revenue . Accordingly, the expenditure cannot be deducted. The expenses were preliminary to the establishment of the self- employed architectural business rather than in the course of it. If the objector had been in business at the time he became liable for the course fees, then they would be revenue and deductible. They would not then have been preparatory in nature. (Emphasis added.) The essential feature of this case is that while the expenditure had a sufficient nexus to an income earning process it was incurred by the objector before he entered into business. Therefore, the expenditure was preliminary to the establishment of the business and of a capital nature. There was not a sufficient nexus between the expenditure and the income earning process that commenced subsequent to incurring the course fees. Fees for services, such as planning advice (such as how to go about speculating in investments) received before any activity of speculation has commenced will not, on the basis of Case Q18, be deductible. The advice will form the base knowledge to be utilised when the speculative activity commences. Cost of revenue account property As discussed earlier, investments held for the purpose of resale are revenue account property. Under the new trading stock rules revenue account property must be valued at cost. “Cost” is not defined in the Act in relation to investments that are “excepted 29 financial arrangements” (e.g. shares and options), and therefore cost must take its ordinary meaning. In general terms, the cost of revenue account property will be its purchase price and the cost of acquisition. Implementation, commissions, and brokerage fees paid by an investor to acquire or sell investments will be part of the cost of those investments. The effect of treating these fees as part of the cost of revenue account property is that they are not deductible when incurred, but when the investments to which they relate are eventually sold. On-going planning fees Once a speculative activity has been commenced, an issue arises as to whether subsequent planning advice is deductible, and if so, when. In the case of planning fees relating to specific investments, it is considered that such fees meet the definition of cost, i.e. they have a direct nexus to the investments and are part of the cost of acquisition. Therefore, the fees will be part of the cost of revenue account property, and deductible when the investments to which the fees relate are later sold. Where fees do not relate to specific investments, deductibility will depend upon whether they have a sufficient nexus to the gross income derived. Due to the one-off nature of speculative activities, income must be produced (at some stage) from that particular investment. Without this connection, it cannot be said that the fees are incurred in order to derive gross income. As such, the fees will not be deductible. This raises yet another concern: the extent of the speculation. If the speculation is such that there is an on-going activity, it could be that the nature of the activities are more akin to a business, with the result that fees not relating to specific investments will have a nexus to the gross income. Whether the investor has an activity that is more than of a one-off nature will be a question of fact. If it is determined that the activity is more akin to a business, the fees will have the same tests of deductibility as that for a business investor (discussed below). Other matters Due to the one-off nature of a speculative activity, such investors will generally not incur administration, monitoring, administration, evaluation, re-planning and switching fees. To the extent that a speculative investor’s fees are accrual expenditure, the deduction of those fees will be affected by section EF 1. The effect of section EF 1 is that any accrual expenditure that has not been expended in that income year will not be an allowable deduction in that year, and as such will increase the gross income of the investor. See further discussion on this point under the heading Where the fee is “accrual expenditure”. If the investment is a financial arrangement, the treatment of fees paid may be governed by the accruals rules - see details later in this statement. C. Investors in the business of investing - deductibility of fees 30 Business investors are in the business of investing when the nature of their activity, and their intention in respect of that activity, is sufficient to amount to a business (as discussed earlier in this statement). Investors in the business of investing can deduct, with some restrictions as indicated below, all the fees described above (initial planning, implementation, administrating, monitoring, evaluation, pre-planning, and switching fees) under either section BD 2(1)(b)(i) or section BD 2(1)(b)(ii). If an investor is in the business of investing, any difference between the cost of the investment and the amount received on disposal of the investment is assessable income or a deductible loss. The investments are trading assets and not capital assets of the investor. Therefore, fees do not fail the test of non-deductibility for the reason that they relate to the investor’s profit-making process. To the extent that a business investor’s fees are accrual expenditure (as discussed earlier), the deduction of those fees will be affected by section EF 1. The effect of section EF 1 is that any accrual expenditure not expended in that income year will not be an allowable deduction in that year, and as such will increase the gross income of the investor. See further discussion on this point under the heading Where the fee is “accrual expenditure”. Establishment fees For business investors, planning fees will be deductible under section BD 2(1)(b)(i) or section BD 2(1)(b)(ii) if they have the necessary connection with the derivation of gross income. However, as discussed above under the heading Speculative investors - deductibility of fees, consideration would need to be given as to whether the expenditure was incurred in establishing the capital base/asset from which the business is carried on. These “preliminary to business” expenses can include costs, such as fees charged by a financial adviser for reporting on an overall business strategy, evaluating business risks, and options. The expenditure is generally incurred before the investor commences a business of investing. In these circumstances, the costs relate to the capital structure of the business rather than being incurred in the course of operating the business. Therefore, the costs are non-deductible. Implementation fees The timing of deductions for implementation fees for business investors is subject to either the qualified accruals rules where they are paid in relation to the acquisition of a financial arrangement (discussed below), or the trading stock provisions, i.e. trading stock is valued at cost. For the same reasons discussed above under the heading Speculative investors - deductibility of fees, such fees will be added to the cost of the investment. If the relevant investment is still on hand at year’s end, the deductibility of implementation fees is effectively deferred until the investment is sold. If the accruals rules apply, they take precedence over the rules applying to trading stock. On-going planning advice 31 For the same reasons noted under Speculative investors - deductibility of fees, on- going planning advice relating to specific investments are added to the cost of the investment, as such fees meet the definition of cost. However, unlike speculative investors, general planning advice, unrelated to specific investments, will have a nexus to a business investors gross income as the nature of a business investor’s activities is to earn gross income from trading in shares or other investments. Therefore, such fees will be deductible when incurred. Example 7 Investor I is an accountant, employed part-time by a major corporate. Three years ago Investor I inherited a substantial sum of money which she put into a wide range of investments. She actively participates in managing her investments. She uses her tax knowledge and accounting expertise to analyse her investments’ performances on a regular basis. She engages the services of a financial adviser so that she can obtain independent, objective, third party advice (and to implement her investment strategies). Although Investor I derives a significant income from her employment as an accountant, the extent and continuity of her investment activities (and her active participation) should be sufficient for Investor I to be considered to be in the business of investing. Investor I is a business investor and all fees, within the restriction explained above, are deductible. Where the fee is “accrual expenditure” “Accrual expenditure” is a term used to describe a payment that relates to costs that extend past the end of the current income year, i.e. in the context of financial planning fees, payments in advance of the services provided. For example, accrual expenditure could be an up-front payment covering the services of the financial planner for a three-year period. To the extent that a fee is accrual expenditure, for any type of investor, the deduction of those fees will be affected by section EF 1. Under section EF 1(1), accrual expenditure is allowed as a deduction in the year in which it is incurred. However, the unexpired portion of that expenditure must be returned as gross income. In effect, section EF 1(1) allows only a deduction for the expired portion of the expenditure. The amount returned as the unexpired portion in one year is allowed as a deduction in the following income year or years. However, under the exemptions provided in Determination E10, the accrual expenditure rules would only apply if the unexpired portion of the fee exceeded $12,000 and the services to which the fee relates are due to expire later than six months from the end of the investor’s income year. The accrual expenditure rules do not apply where the investment is a financial arrangement. Example 8 32 Investor J pays a monitoring fee of $21,000 to a financial advisor to cover all monitoring services for a period of three years - the services are to be equally spread over the three years. The effect of applying the accrual expenditure rules is that in the first income year only one-third ($7,000) of the fee is deductible, i.e. $21,000 is allowed as a deduction. However, $14,000 is added back to income as the unexpired portion of accrual expenditure. The unexpired portion is deducted in the following year and any remaining unexpired portion is added back to income. Effectively this will allow a deduction of $7,000 in each of the three years. Qualified accruals rules and implementation fees The Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999 changed the treatment of financial arrangements entered into on or after 20 May 1999, the date the Act received the Royal Assent. The changes as they relate to the deductibility of financial planning fees are: • The removal of the references to “issuer” and “holder”. The new legislation only refers to a “party” (to a financial arrangement). • With the removal of the holder/issuer distinction, the cash basis holder exemption from the spreading methods has been extended to all parties to financial arrangements. These exemption thresholds have been amended by: (a) increasing from $600,000 to $1,000,000 the threshold in respect of the value of financial arrangements held, and (b) increasing the income and expenditure thresholds from financial arrangements from $70,000 to $100,000, and (c) increasing the threshold whereby a breach of the cash basis threshold occurs where the investor creates a deferral of income, or an acceleration of expenditure, in excess of $40,000. • Removal of the 2% threshold for non-contingent fees. Previously, non-contingent fees up to 2% of the core acquisition price did not have to be spread. This threshold has been removed so that all non-contingent fees are not now spread. The treatment of fees is reflected in the definition of “consideration” in section EH 48. • Non-contingent fee is defined in section OB 1 as a fee for services provided in relation to a person becoming a party to a financial arrangement that is payable whether or not the arrangement proceeds. The amended accrual rules apply only to financial arrangements entered into on or after the date the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999 received the Royal Assent - 20 May 1999. Any financial arrangements entered into before this date are still dealt with under the former rules. To accomplish the distinction between the former and the new provisions the accrual rules are set out in 33 two divisions. The rules existing prior to the introduction of the new legislation are contained in Division 1, that is, sections EH A1 to EH 19. Division 2 has been inserted after section EH 19 and contains the amended accrual rules. These rules apply to financial arrangements entered into after 20 May 1999. The rules dealing with each division are now discussed. Division 1 Division 1 applies to financial arrangements entered into prior to 20 May 1999. “Financial arrangement” is a defined term in the Act. Broadly, it includes debt instruments, and does not include shares or interests in unit trusts. Therefore, it would apply to such investments as mortgages, loans, government stock, commercial bills, and forward exchange contracts. Financial arrangement implementation fees For passive, speculative, and business investors, the deductibility of financial arrangement implementation fees is given special treatment. Such fees must be dealt with under the qualified accruals rules. For such fees the distinction between passive, speculative, and business investors is often no longer important as the deductibility of the fees is provided for by statute. There are, however, some exceptions to the statutory deductibility of the fees where the distinction between passive, speculative, and business investors is still important. Implementation fees that are part of the acquisition price of the financial arrangement will be allowed as a deduction against income earned from the financial arrangement either: • On the maturity, remission, or sale of the financial arrangement for cash basis holders; or • Over the life of the financial arrangement for non-cash basis holders. Implementation fees that are part of the acquisition price of the financial arrangement include: • Contingent fees, to the extent that they are provided in relation to the financial arrangement; and • Non-contingent fees, to the extent that they exceed 2% of the core acquisition price, and to the extent they are provided in relation to the financial arrangement. Non-contingent fees that are no more than 2% of the core acquisition are deductible under the normal rules for deducting financial planning fees. In this case, the distinction between passive, speculative, and business investors is important. Contingent implementation fees 34 Where implementation fees are contingent on the financial arrangement being implemented, the fees are part of the “core acquisition price” of the financial arrangement and as such are subject to the accruals rules. The core acquisition price is defined to include “the value of all consideration provided by \[the investor\] in relation to the financial arrangement”. Implementation fees paid to financial advisers or other organisations for their services in implementing financial arrangements are provided “in relation to the financial arrangement”. See Tax Information Bulletin Vol 3, No 4 (December 1991) at pages 5 and 6. Category 1: cash basis holders A cash basis holder is a natural person for whom either the total value of all financial arrangements held by that person will not exceed $600,000, or the income derived in the year by the person from financial arrangements will not exceed $70,000. A further requirement is that the difference between the income that would be returned under the accruals rules, and the income returned as a cash basis holder, does not exceed $20,000. An investor who is a cash basis holder returns income and expenditure relating to financial arrangements as and when the income is derived and expenditure incurred. Implementation fees that are part of the acquisition price, however, cannot be taken as a deduction in the year they are incurred. Instead, when the investment matures, is remitted, or is sold, the investor will get credit for the fees when he or she performs a cash base price adjustment. The cash base price adjustment compares all amounts received by the investor in respect of the investment, with all amounts provided by the investor in relation to the investment. The amounts provided by the investor are the acquisition price. This calculation will usually mean a comparison of the amount returned at the end of the investment and interest received, with the amounts provided and any direct costs of the investment. If the cash base price adjustment results in a positive amount, the amount is income to the investor. If the cash base price adjustment results in a negative amount, the amount is an allowable deduction. Because implementation fees are part of the acquisition price, they can be offset against income received from the financial arrangement. This has the effect of allowing a deduction for the fees on the maturity, remission, or sale of a financial arrangement. Accordingly, if an investor is a cash basis holder, he or she may deduct implementation fees, irrespective of whether the investor is a passive investor, in the business of investing, or a speculative investor. Category 2: non-cash basis holders If an investor is not a cash basis holder, he or she must return income and expenditure according to the rules set out in section EH 1. Section EH 1(1) requires that for the purposes of calculating income and expenditure under sections EH 1(2) to (6), regard must be had to the amount of consideration provided by the person. The accruals rules spread the difference between amounts received by the person and amounts 35 provided by the person over the life of the financial arrangement. Where implementation fees are part of the acquisition price of the arrangement, they will be one of the amounts provided by the person that is spread over the life of the arrangement. While the Act does not strictly allow a deduction for the implementation fees under the accrual rules, the end result is the same as the investor returns less income over the life of the financial arrangement, i.e. on the sale or disposition of the financial arrangement, the accruals rules arrive at a net result for tax purposes taking into account all costs and fees associated with its acquisition. Non-contingent implementation fees It is most likely that implementation fees will be contingent on the implementation of a financial plan. However, if implementation fees are not contingent on the implementation of the plan, they are covered by specific rules: • If the non-contingent fees are no more than two percent (2%) of the core acquisition price, they are excluded from the accruals rules calculations and their deductibility is tested under normal income tax rules. • If the non-contingent fees are greater than two percent (2%) of the core acquisition price, they are included within the accruals rules calculations to the extent that they exceed 2% of the core acquisition price. The remaining amount of fees (that is equal to 2% of the core acquisition price) is deductible or otherwise under normal income tax rules. Thus for non-contingent fees amounting to 2% or less of the core acquisition price of the financial arrangement, the distinction between passive, business, and speculative investors is important as the normal income tax rules of deductibility will apply. For non-contingent fees, to the extent that they exceed 2% of the core acquisition price of the financial arrangement, the discussion above relating to contingent fees is relevant. Example 9 Investor K is a cash basis holder who has invested in a number of financial arrangements on the advice of her financial adviser. Investor K is a passive investor. She paid a fee of 2% of the cost of the financial arrangements as a commission to her adviser. The fee was contingent on the financial arrangements being purchased. Investor K may not initially deduct the fee. The fee is a contingent fee and included in the acquisition price of the financial arrangement as a direct cost of the investment. As a contingent fee, it is not deductible until a cash base price adjustment is made on the maturity, remission, or sale of the financial arrangement. At that time it will be allowed as an amount provided by the investor, to be offset against amounts received. If the fee charged was a non-contingent fee, then, to the extent that it was no more than 2% of the core acquisition price of the financial arrangement, it would be 36 excluded from the accruals rules and tested according to normal principles. As such it would be non-deductible, as Investor K is a passive investor. Division 2 This division applies to financial planning fees incurred in respect of financial arrangements entered into on or after 20 May 1999. As discussed earlier the distinction between holder and issuer has been removed and the term “cash basis person” applies to all parties to the financial arrangement who satisfy the following criteria. Contingent fees - Cash basis person concession In Division 2, (section EH 27(1)) the concessions for determining whether a person is a cash basis person have been extended. A cash basis person is a natural person who is a party to financial arrangements where the absolute value of each of the person’s financial arrangements added together has a total face value of not more than $1,000,000 (up from $600,000). Alternatively, under the new income and expenditure threshold, a person will be a cash basis person if the absolute value of the person’s income or expenditure, calculated under the accrual rules, from the financial arrangements is less than $100,000. The absolute value of the person’s income and expenditure means that income is not offset by any expenditure. For example, a person with two financial arrangements, one deriving income of $50,000 and the other incurring expenditure of $20,000, would have an absolute value of $70,000. The income and expenditure threshold ($100,000) is not breached and the person is a cash basis person. If either one or both of above two threshold tests are met, a further requirement to qualify as a cash basis person is that the taxpayer must also meet the deferral test. A breach of the deferral test occurs if the person creates a deferral of income or an acceleration of expenditure in excess of $40,000 in aggregate. (Section EH 27(3).) Non-contingent fees Under Division 2 all non-contingent fees are excluded from the accrual rules calculations, and their deductibility is subject to the normal income tax rules (essentially, whether there is a nexus to the income derived). This means that the deductibility of fees dealt with earlier in this statement under the separate headings of passive, speculative, and business investors will apply instead of the accrual rules. Transitional adjustments As discussed above, Division 1 applies to financial arrangements entered into before 20 May 1999. However, under section EH 17, investors may choose to apply the new rules in Division 2 to those financial arrangements. This will be useful, for example, if investors wish to account for all arrangements on a similar basis. Full details of this option and other changes to the accrual rules are included in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 11, No 6 (July 1999).
\[Interpretation statement IS0052 issued by Adjudication & Rulings in June 2001\] FINANCIAL PLANNING FEES—GST TREATMENT This statement sets out the Commissioner’s view on the GST treatment of services provided in relation to financial planning fees charged by financial advisers to plan, implement, and monitor an investment portfolio for their investor clients. This interpretation statement replaces Public Ruling BR Pub 95/11 that appeared in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 7 (January 1996). The Public Ruling ceased to apply from 31 March 1999. There are seven categories of financial planning fees, which are based on the process of obtaining an initial financial plan, the subsequent monitoring of that plan, and any following adjustments or alterations to the plan. The question of the GST treatment hinges on the actual nature of the services provided rather than the label applied to those services. The following table summarises the GST treatment of services provided in relation to the various categories of financial planning fees that are charged by financial advisers. The table is a general guide only and should be read in conjunction with the more detailed explanations of each particular category contained in this interpretation statement. Fee Category Services Subject to GST Initial planning fees Yes Implementation fees No Administration fees No Monitoring fees Yes Evaluation fees Yes Re-planning fees Yes Switching fees No INTRODUCTION All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This statement considers the GST treatment under sections 3 and 14, of a range of services provided by financial advisers for financial planning fees charged to investors. In this regard, the actual nature of the services provided is important and 1 2 will determine the liability to GST of the financial planning fees paid for those services. The services will be exempt from GST under section 14 (exempt supplies) if: • the activities undertaken involve the supply of “financial services” in terms of section 3; or • the services are not in themselves “financial services”, but are supplied together with a supply of “financial services”, and those other services are reasonably incidental and necessary to that supply of financial services, and are not otherwise specifically excluded from being exempt supplies. Activities that involve the provision of advice are generally excluded from the meaning of “financial services”. BACKGROUND An investor who seeks advice from a financial adviser will be charged for the services provided. Whether these fees are exempt supplies or subject to GST will depend on the nature of the services provided. When an initial financial plan has been devised, agreed to by the investor and implemented by the adviser, that is not necessarily the end of the matter. Usually systems are in place that require the adviser’s continued involvement. Most financial advisers offer a continuing monitoring service that is generally part of an overall advisory package. The investments are sometimes (but not always) placed in the care of a custodian (commonly for security reasons) who may have also been involved in the acquisition of the investments. The income derived from the investments may pass to the adviser or custodian where it is placed in a trust account before being able to be drawn upon by the investor. The maintenance of these trust accounts by the adviser usually incurs costs that are charged to the investor. As part of the service, the adviser may monitor the portfolio to ensure that the aims of the investor are continually met. For this service the investor will often pay further fees. From time to time as part of this monitoring service the adviser can recommend changes to the investment mix. If the investor accepts these recommendations to change investments, further fees are incurred which may include switching fees. It is the Commissioner’s view that public ruling BR Pub 95/11 has been useful in respect of the GST treatment of the financial planning fees. However, despite the issue of the ruling there has been occasional uncertainty on how the ruling should be applied. Although some of these were discussed within the commentary definitions of the three categories identified, participants in the financial planning industry may have had difficulty in applying the ruling. It seemed logical to extend and further define the present three categories to make it easier for advisers and others in the financial planning industry to decide whether or not the planning fees were subject to GST. Similar issues arose and the same approach was taken in relation to the previous income tax public rulings (Public Rulings BR Pub 95/10 and 10A) that dealt with the income tax deductibility of financial planning fees charged to investors. 3 Financial advisers charge for a number of services provided to their clients, sometimes using different names for these component services. The GST tax treatment of the fees depends not on the name given to the service, but on the nature of the service. To determine the correct tax treatment of a service, it is important to identify the exact service a financial adviser provides. The adoption of the expanded categorisation of fees in this statement is intended to make it easier for financial advisers and others to determine how fees charged and the services provided will be treated for GST purposes. The categories correspond to the process usually followed when an investor seeks the assistance of a financial adviser. FEE CATEGORIES The fees charged by financial advisers vary from one adviser to another, but generally they can be separated into a number of categories. Financial planners give the fees charged various names, but the crucial point that determines the GST treatment is for what service(s) the fee is actually paid. The nature of the service provided will determine whether the fees paid are for a supply of a “financial service” and thus an exempt supply, or otherwise qualify as a supply of services exempt from GST. The fees can be summarised as: (a) Initial planning fees: Fees charged in relation to services provided by the adviser for the initial interview where the investor and the adviser discuss the investor’s investment goals, savings objectives, cash requirements, and life and general insurance requirements. The adviser then prepares a draft portfolio plan for the investor. Further interviews, discussions, and adjustments to the draft plan may follow until it is acceptable to the investor. (b) Implementation fees: All fees for services associated with implementing the draft plan devised in (a). They will include any one-off up-front fees paid to or made in respect of services or charges to advisers, administrators, executors, fund managers, etc., to purchase or acquire the investments. They include payments to custodians on implementation of the plan or charges by fund managers for entry into the investments. (c) Administration fees: This fee category is generally described by advisers as “annual on-going” fees. They are charged by the adviser to cover the costs of maintaining records of the investor’s transactions with the adviser. This category also includes charges relating to the handling of cash for the investor, such as the withdrawal and deposit in the investor’s account with an administrator, bank charges, and other administration fees. Also included are any fees or commissions charged by the adviser for collecting income from the investments and arranging for this to be paid to or credited to the investor’s account with the adviser or to the investor’s own bank account. (d) Monitoring fees: Annual charges for monitoring and reporting to the investor on the performance of the portfolio (including the performance of the fund managers and the adviser) in terms of the investor’s goals, and relaying this information to the investor. The adviser will prepare these reports from time 4 to time. (e) Evaluation fees: Any fees for services relating to an evaluation of an existing portfolio. Typically, these arise where an investor has an existing portfolio of investments and either seeks a financial adviser’s advice for the first time, or seeks confirmation that the portfolio’s performance is matching the goals originally set by either the investor, or with the assistance of a financial adviser at the initial planning stage. This is a more detailed examination of performance of the portfolio than simply monitoring performance and reporting to the client. It may or may not result in a recommendation from the adviser to make changes to investments within the portfolio to maintain the investor’s aims. (f) Re-planning fees: Fees for services relating to the re-planning of a portfolio sometimes arising from category (e) services due to changes to the investor’s objectives. This could entail minor changes, or the complete restructuring of investments and a change in investment strategy. Re-planning fees do not necessarily refer to advice supplied by the same adviser. They could be for advice by an adviser to a new client who had previously managed his or her own portfolio or had previously engaged a different adviser. Included in this category are any other fees as described in Initial planning fees at (a), when there has been a complete restructuring of investments. (g) Switching fees: Fees related to the costs involved in selling existing investments and/or purchasing new investments arising from a recommendation by the adviser as a result of category (e) or category (f) services. The fees will be charged by the adviser for changing investments within the portfolio. Also included are any fees relating to the withdrawal in whole or in part from an existing portfolio. If financial planners charge a global fee (that includes fees for more than one of the above categories), it will be necessary for that fee to be apportioned between the categories, based on the particular services provided for the fee, to ensure the fees are correctly treated for GST purposes. A similar apportionment exercise needs to be undertaken in the case of “performance fees”, where an investor may have the option of being able to elect to pay a performance fee instead of fees for some or all of the categories noted above. Performance fees are a form of global fee paid to advisers, based on how well the portfolio of investments selected by the adviser and agreed to by the investor is performing against some pre-determined measure. The calculation of the seven categories of fees noted above might be based on a standard fee structure, hours of work put in by the adviser, the amount of the investments made by the investor, or a combination of those. Performance fees on the other hand, are calculated under some pre-determined formula based on how well the investor’s portfolio, as recommended by the adviser, performs over a period of time. These fees could include a standard amount, plus a percentage based on the extent to which the level of growth or return from the portfolio exceeds previously agreed targets, or the fee could be based solely on a percentage of the returns/agreed targets. 5 Irrespective of the name given to the fee, or the basis of calculation, the GST treatment of the fees will be determined having regard to the services performed in establishing, administering, and altering the investor’s portfolio, based on the seven categories of services mentioned above. It may be that in certain cases the performance fee is paid in respect of all seven categories of services, while in other instances the fee may be only for services coming within some of the categories, e.g. the administration and monitoring fee categories. In view of this, in determining the GST treatment it is not the description (label) the adviser attaches to the fee charged that is relevant, rather it is what service(s) the fee is actually paid for. Performance fees are in reality no different to any other global or multi-service fee charged by an adviser. How the amount is apportioned among the categories of services is a question of fact to be determined in the circumstances of the particular case. ISSUES The question considered in this statement is: in what circumstances will the Commissioner treat the services provided in respect of financial planning fees as an exempt supply of services under section 14 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985? This will be determined by: • The nature of the service provided for the fees charged, and whether these fees are in respect of a “financial service” in terms of section 3. • In the event that the fees are not in respect of a financial service, whether the services are reasonably incidental and necessary to that supply of financial services. This is subject to the services supplied for those other fees not otherwise being specifically excluded from being exempt supplies. LEGISLATION The legislation relevant to this statement is contained in sections 3 and 14. Section 14 provides a GST exemption for certain supplies, including the supply of financial services, and section 3 defines the term “financial services” for the purposes of the Act. Paragraph (a) of section 14(1) is relevant for the purposes of this statement and provides: The following supplies of goods and services shall be exempt from tax: (a) The supply of any financial services (together with the supply of any other goods and services, supplied by the supplier of those financial services, which are reasonably incidental and necessary to that supply of financial services), not being (i) A supply of financial services which, but for this paragraph, would be charged with tax at the rate of zero percent pursuant to section 11A of this Act; or (ii) A supply of goods and services which (although being part of a supply of goods and services which, but for this subparagraph, would be an exempt supply under this paragraph) is not in itself, as between the supplier of that first-mentioned supply and the recipient, a supply of financial services in respect of which this paragraph applies: 6 The parts of the section 3 definition of “financial services” that are relevant for the purposes of this statement are as follows: (1) For the purposes of this Act, the term “financial services” means any one or more of the following activities: (a) The exchange of currency (whether effected by the exchange of bank notes or coin, by crediting or debiting accounts, or otherwise): .... (c) The issue, allotment, drawing, acceptance, endorsement, or transfer of ownership of a debt security: (d) The issue, allotment, or transfer of ownership of an equity security or a participatory security: .... (ka) The payment or collection of any amount of interest, principal, dividend, or other amount whatever in respect of any debt security, equity security, participatory security, credit contract, contract of life insurance, superannuation scheme, or futures contract: (l) Agreeing to do, or arranging, any of the activities specified in paragraphs (a) to (ka) of this subsection, other than advising thereon. ANALYSIS General requirements of the legislation affecting financial services In order to determine whether particular services supplied are exempt, it is necessary that the supplies fall into the criteria stipulated in section 14. Section 14(1)(a) requires that there must be either a supply of a financial service or the supply of a good or a service that is “reasonably incidental and necessary” to the supply of a financial service provided by the same supplier. This raises two interpretation matters: • What are financial services; and • What does “reasonably incidental and necessary” mean? What are financial services? Section 3 defines “financial services”. In terms of the issues raised by this statement concerning the treatment of financial planning fees, the relevant subparagraphs of section 3(1) are: (1) For the purposes of this Act, the term “financial services” means any one or more of the following activities: (a) The exchange of currency (whether effected by the exchange of bank notes or coin, by crediting or debiting accounts, or otherwise): .... (c) The issue, allotment, drawing, acceptance, endorsement, or transfer of ownership of a debt security: (d) The issue, allotment, or transfer of ownership of an equity security or a participatory security: 7 .... (ka) The payment or collection of any amount of interest, principal, dividend, or other amount whatever in respect of any debt security, equity security, participatory security, credit contract, contract of life insurance, superannuation scheme, or futures contract: (l) Agreeing to do, or arranging, any of the activities specified in paragraphs (a) to (ka) of this subsection, other than advising thereon . \[Emphasis added\] The parts of section 3(1) under consideration raise two further interpretative matters: the meanings to be ascribed to the words “arranging” and “advising” as used in paragraph (l). A number of the supplies of services under consideration involve financial advisers providing various levels of advice or arranging for another organisation to implement an investor’s financial plan (place investments, etc.) and/or to collect income from the investments and arrange payment or crediting to the investor. A preliminary issue is the position under section 3(1)(l) of persons or organisations who may act as intermediaries between the investor and the person actually undertaking the activities specified in paragraphs (a), (c), (d) or (ka) of section 3(1). Intermediaries and section 3(1)(l) The agreeing to do or arranging any of the activities listed in section 3(1) in terms of paragraph (l), encompasses the activities of brokers or intermediaries who arrange for the provision of financial services, such as mortgage, superannuation and life insurance brokers. This finding was concluded in Product Ruling BR Prd 96/30 issued by Inland Revenue in respect of section 3(1)(l) (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 8, No 8, November 1996). The adviser often does not actually undertake the activities in section 3(1)(a) to (ka), but is authorised to arrange the activities to be undertaken for and on behalf of another (the investor). In this situation the adviser is acting as an intermediary. In other words, the financial adviser itself does not implement the plan but acts on behalf of its clients and gets someone else to implement the plan. This factor does not take the intermediary’s actions outside the ambit of section 3(1)(l). Similarly, where a custodian is involved, it is the custodian who usually implements the financial plan on instruction from the financial adviser. Even though there is another intermediary besides the financial adviser, the fees incurred for the activities undertaken by the custodian are still within the ambit of section 3(1)(l). Meaning of “arranging” used in section 3(1)(l) The term “arranging” is not defined in the Act. However, in ordinary use “arranging” is capable of being given a wide or a narrow interpretation. A wide interpretation would include every step that could result in a financial service being provided to the client, independently of whether a service is actually provided or of any intention of a service being provided. This would include promotions and marketing which do not necessarily lead to any service being provided or research into any areas to which investment may be expanded in the future. 8 By comparison, a narrow meaning requires a nexus or a close linkage to the provision of the actual financial service to the client. These activities would include brokerage activities or filling out forms for a client. The activities are for a specific purpose, and it is highly probable that the supply of a financial service will occur following those activities. For example, the general monitoring of the debt securities market would not be arranging the issue of a debt security, despite the monitoring being required for the making of a prudent investment. Although the courts have not specifically discussed the term “advising” in the context of section 3(1)(l), there are cases that indicate that a narrow interpretation such as outlined above should be applied. Davison CJ in Databank Systems Limited v CIR (1987) 9 NZTC 6,213 (HC) indicated that an appropriate meaning would be “cause to occur”. This suggests that there is also an element of certainty that the financial service will be provided to the client. Equally, Lord Templeman in CIR v Databank Systems Limited (1990) 12 NZTC 7,227 (PC) indicated that the exemption did not extend to activities which merely resulted in the supply of financial services thus rejecting the wide interpretation of “arranging”. These two judgments indicate the need for a close connection between the activity undertaken and the financial service supplied to the ultimate recipient (the investor) in order for that activity to be the arranging of the financial service. Databank (PC) also illustrates the principle that it is the actual arranging activity being undertaken that is paramount and not the overall nature of the activity comprising the services being supplied to the ultimate recipient. Both the Databank (PC) and Turakina Maori Girls College Board of Trustees v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 1,032 (CA) decisions demonstrate the importance of dissecting the transaction involved to determine precisely what activity is being undertaken in order to establish whether a financial service is being provided. In summary, while the New Zealand courts have not directly considered what constitutes arranging in terms of section 3(1)(l), they have provided some determinative guidelines in establishing the application of arranging. That is, “arranging” is to be interpreted in a narrow sense, and that when considering what is inclusive of arranging, it is important to dissect the transaction involved to determine precisely what activity is being undertaken, and not be swayed by the overall nature of the activity that the recipient or supplier may be involved with. This is in order to establish whether it is a financial service that is being provided (Databank (PC), Turakina Maori Girls College and Case Q10 (1993) 15 NZTC 5,061). Putting this into the context of section 3(1)(l), “arranging” must have a direct connection to the specific supply of the financial service. It is not enough that the arranging may have caused the supply of that financial service, what is necessary is that the activity of arranging intentionally causes the provision of a financial service as defined in section 3(1)(a) to (ka). This interpretation is consistent with how the courts in the United Kingdom have defined the term “making of arrangements” (Hargreaves Landsdown Asset Management v C & E Commrs \[1995\] BVC 896, Dogbreeders Associates v C of CE (1989) VATTR 317 and Donald Ford v The Commissioners (1987) VATTR 130) and how Revenue Canada has defined the term “arranging” in its policy statement (Ruling No. 11783-2). 9 In order to establish whether there is an activity of arranging pursuant to section 3(1)(l), it is therefore necessary to establish the following criteria: • The service to which the arranging relates is a financial service as defined by section 3(1)(a) to (ka) (Databank (PC)); and • The activity is a precursor to the provision of a financial service which the intended recipient of that financial service has already decided to use or to obtain. “Arranging activities” that arise before a decision is made to proceed by the intended recipient, are considered too far removed and the provision of the financial service too uncertain. Therefore, provision of the financial service being arranged must not be subject to another person’s overriding decision on whether to proceed. The “arranging” activity is tainted by the financial service’s character as it is closely connected and has the purpose of organising the provision of that financial service or causing it to occur (Dogbreeders Associates, Databank (HC)); and • The activity undertaken is to intentionally cause the provision of the financial service. This does not mean that no arranging has taken place if the financial service is cancelled or does not proceed. As long as the requisite activity is undertaken with the specific intention of causing the provision of a financial service to a recipient, then it will meet the test of “arranging” (Databank (HC), Dogbreeders Associates and Donald Ford). Meaning of “advising thereon” used in section 3(1)(l) Section 3(1)(l) expressly excludes the activity of “advising thereon” from the concept of arranging a financial service, and therefore the “financial services” definition. If a service is advisory, then it is not an exempt supply under section 14(1)(a). The courts in New Zealand (and overseas) have not considered the words “advising thereon”. However, the word “advice” has been considered. In JR Moodie Co Ltd v Minister of National Revenue \[1950\] 2 DLR 145 Rand J (at p.148) stated: The word “advice” in ordinary parlance means primarily the expression of counsel or opinion, favourable or unfavourable, as to action, but it may chiefly in commercial usage signify information or intelligence. The Concise Oxford Dictionary suggests two types of advising (being consistent with the Moodie decision). Advising that involves a degree of counsel or recommendation, and advising that merely involves notification; the dissemination of information. In one sense, the exclusion for “advising thereon” from the paragraph (l) activity of “agreeing to do, or arranging” other financial services activities, could be said not to apply to the mere provision of information to a client in order for that client to decide where the funds should be invested. However, it is possible to argue that the reference to “advising thereon” is in fact capable of wider meaning and also excludes (from financial services) the provision of information. 10 To assist in settling this point it is necessary to consider the meaning of the word “thereon”. Comparing the meaning of “thereon” with the word “thereof” may also assist in determining the meaning to be applied to the phrase “advising thereon”. The Concise Oxford Dictionary (8 th ed.), for example, includes the following definitions: thereof adv. formal of that or it. thereon adv. archaic on that or it (of motion or position). on ... 14. concerning or about ... In the context in which the phrase “advising thereon” is used in section 3(1)(l), it is considered that it bears the more limited of the two possible meanings. That is, the exclusion for “advising thereon” requires more than mere notification of or the dissemination of information regarding the activities in section 3(1)(a) to (ka). Rather it excludes activities involving a degree of interpretation of information, counsel or opinion relating to those activities. However, in the case of the information and reporting services provided by financial advisers or planners, many such services may well incorporate a range of the varying levels of advice. Given that, careful consideration will be necessary by advisers and planners to determine whether their particular services are, or are not, subject to the exclusion for “advising” on the activities specified in section 3(1)(a) to (ka). Even if an activity is not “advising”, it does not mean that it will automatically be a financial service or a supply of services exempt from GST. The requirement that the activity be itself a financial service or the arranging of a financial service, or “reasonably incidental and necessary” to a supply of an associated financial service (discussed below) must still be met. Meaning of “reasonably incidental and necessary” in section 14(1)(a) As referred to earlier in this statement, the supply of services that are “reasonably incidental and necessary” to the supply of any financial service and supplied by the same supplier, are also exempt supplies under section 14(1)(a). The Act does not define the term “reasonably incidental and necessary” and there are no cases on the meaning of this particular phrase. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the ordinary usage of the component parts of this phrase. The Act does however import an element of reasonableness to both “incidental” and “necessary”, by the inclusion of the word “reasonably” in the phrase “reasonably incidental and necessary” itself. Most of the cases are fact-specific in their interpretations and indicate that what is “necessary” or “incidental” is largely a question to be decided on the particular facts of each case. The following summarises those interpretations. It can be reasoned that the phrase “reasonably incidental and necessary” is designed to measure two separate although related things: 11 • • • • Firstly, the level of association or connection between the type of financial services supplied and the type of other goods and services supplied which are under consideration, viz “incidental” (or “reasonably incidental”); and Secondly, how essential or “necessary” the other goods or services are for that supply of financial services to occur. Were that not the case there would have been no need to include both elements in the phrase, as simply including the narrower of the two conjunctive tests would have been all that was needed. Parliament could not have enacted a provision that leads to absurdity or an incongruous result, requiring a lesser degree of connection (“reasonably incidental”) but at the same time be essential (“necessary”) for the supply of the financial service to occur. It is therefore considered that “reasonably” applies to both “incidental” and “necessary”. “Reasonably incidental” A number of cases have suggested that incidental means ancillary or consequential or provided in subordinate conjunction with something else. From these cases, the word “incidental” suggests that the service must be an associated service that is secondary to and that depends on a financial service as the main or primary service. It must be a consequence of a financial service or provided in conjunction with one of the financial services in section 3(1). The meaning of the words “reasonably incidental” is something more than that which has a mere casual, accidental, or fortuitous connection with the other item. It also means something more than an item that may only possibly or sometimes be associated with the other item. From the cases, the words suggest a service that it is reasonable to expect will be supplied or offered with the financial service. In the context of section 14(1)(a) a service that is “reasonably incidental” to the supply of a financial service is an associated service: That is ancillary to (C and E Commissioners v CH Beazer (Holdings) plc (1989) 4 BVC 121 and C and E Commissioners v Wellington Private Hospital Ltd (CA) \[1997\] BVC 251), or occurs or is provided in subordinate conjunction with (Department of Health and Social Security v Envoy Farmers \[1976\] 1 WLR 1,018, Canadian National Railway v Harris \[1946\] 2 DLR 545, CH Beazer (Holdings), and Wellington Private Hospital), the financial service (i.e. is a service that is secondary to and dependent on the financial service as the primary service, and provided in combination or conjunction with that financial service); (see also Mindell v Canadian Northern Shield Insurance (1990) 43 CCLI 191, Re Fahy’s Will Trusts \[1962\] 1 All ER 73, AG v Pontypridd Urban District Council \[1906\] 2 Ch 257); and That it is reasonable to expect the supplier to provide in the course of undertaking the supply of the financial service (CIR v Databank Systems Ltd (1990) 12 NZTC 7,227 (PC)). 12 Something is not “reasonably incidental” if it is merely desirable or profitable (Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council \[1991\] 1 All ER 545), or convenient or advantageously provided with the financial service rather than by necessary implication being incidental or accessory to it (AG v Manchester Corporation \[1906\] 1 Ch 643). \[Reasonably\] “necessary” The word “necessary” narrows the meaning of the phrase “reasonably incidental and necessary”. The word “necessary” can be interpreted as having a wide or a narrow meaning. The Concise Oxford Dictionary definition imparts an ingredient of being essential to the activity being performed. However, there is an issue in terms of how essential the performance is in relation to the fulfilment of a specific activity. The case law is fact specific on this point and it is the actual context in which the term “necessary” appears that indicates in broad terms the degree of essentiality that the term “necessary” is designed to effect. For example, in Re an Inquiry under the Company Securities (Insider Dealing) Act 1985 \[1988\] 1 All ER 203 at 208, Lord Griffiths stated that “necessary” has a meaning that lies somewhere between “indispensable” on the one hand, and “useful” or “expedient” on the other, and suggested “really needed” as the meaning. In Europa Oil (NZ) Ltd (No2) v CIR (1974) 1 NZTC 61,169 the New Zealand Court of Appeal considered the meaning of the word “necessarily” in the context of deductions required to be “necessarily incurred” under the income tax general deductions provision. McCarthy P in the leading judgment, disagreed with the High Court of Australia’s interpretation of “necessarily” in Ronpibon Tin NL & Tongkah Compound NL v FCT (1949) 78 CLR 47 and held that there was no justification for watering-down the usual meaning of the word. The Court of Appeal commented further on the meaning of “necessarily” in its subsequent decision, Europa Oil (NZ) Ltd (No.2) v CIR (1974) 1 NZTC 61,238, stating that the word did not merely mean “clearly appropriate or adapted for” as was suggested in Ronpibon Tin. The Court of Appeal has therefore rejected a wider meaning for the word. The degree of necessity required for a non-financial service to be “reasonably incidental and necessary” to a financial service, on the basis of the context that “necessary” arises in section 14(1)(a), and also based on the comments of McCarthy P in Europa Oil (No.2), can be taken to mean that the provision of the service must be seen from the surrounding circumstances to be needed or required for the provision of a financial service stipulated in section 3(1). The meaning to be applied to the word “necessary” (qualified by “reasonably”) and the phrase “reasonably incidental and necessary” must also be considered in the context in which the words appear in the Act. That is, as an extension to an exemption, when the prima facie position under the Act is that all supplies are taxable unless made expressly exempt. This also indicates that the words should not be interpreted too widely. 13 • • Summary - “reasonably incidental and necessary” In summary, for an additional non-financial service to be “reasonably incidental and necessary” to the provision of a financial service, it must be an associated service that: Is of a type that it is reasonable to expect the supplier to provide in the course of undertaking the supply of the financial service, and that is secondary to and dependent on the financial service as the primary service, and supplied together with or as a consequence of that financial service; and Can be seen from the surrounding circumstances to be needed or required for the supply of the financial service to the recipient. Apportionment of global fees Before discussing how the above legislative principles relating to the GST treatment of financial services apply, it is necessary to determine how global fees are to be apportioned. Where a global or combined fee is charged for several supplies of services, some of which are exempt supplies and some of which are standard-rated services, section 10(18) requires an apportionment of the fee between the taxable and exempt supplies: CIR v Smiths City Group Limited (1992) 14 NZTC 9,140. Under section 10(18), if a taxable supply is not the only supply to which a consideration relates, the supply shall be deemed to be for such part of the consideration as is properly attributable to it. This interpretation statement has categorised the component parts of financial planning fees based on the process of obtaining an initial financial plan, subsequent monitoring of the plan, and any following adjustments or alterations to that plan. It is considered that if fees are charged by financial advisers on the basis of the description of these categories, then determining what amount is subject to GST will be on a more objective basis than the previous public ruling. In the event that a financial planner charges a global fee (e.g. performance fees) for some or all of the different supplies of services provided, an apportionment of that global fee, based on the categories discussed in this statement, will be required. The amount allocated to each category will be a question of fact in each case. As noted earlier, the label given to such a supply is not necessarily determinative of the nature of the supply. It is a question of fact what services are provided for the fee, and it is the actual services provided that will determine the GST treatment. Appropriate apportionment methods The object of any apportionment is to identify the part of the consideration that is “properly attributable” to the taxable supply in question. The answer can only depend on the circumstances of the particular case and must be fair and reasonable and not be arbitrary or based on mere speculation: Ronpibon Tin NL v FC of T; Tongkeh NL v FC of T (1949) 78 CLR 47; 8 ATD 431; Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271. 14 The onus will be on the adviser to show that a defined part of the consideration is properly attributable to something other than a taxable supply, although absolute precision or scientific calculation of an amount is not required as long as there is some intelligible basis supporting the conclusion: Buckley & Young. Depending on the facts of the case, an appropriate method of apportioning the global fee may be to apply a “time apportionment method” using the adviser’s time spent carrying out the activity of each category of service provided. In apportioning such a global fee any clearly identifiable direct expenses (those that clearly relate to a specific category) not specified separately from the global fee, would usually first be deducted and put to that category. The remaining global fee would then be apportioned on the basis of the time spent carrying out the activity of each category of service provided (the time apportionment method). GST treatment of the particular services in the new categories Having discussed the legislative principles relating to the GST treatment of financial services generally, those principles will now be applied in relation to the seven separate financial planning fees categories. Initial planning fees These fees relate to services provided by the adviser from the initial interview stage up to the finalisation of the portfolio plan for the investor. Events leading up to this point may include the preparation of a draft plan, subsequent discussions with the investor, and adjustments to the draft until it is acceptable to the investor. Initial planning services do not come within any of paragraphs (a) to (ka) of the definition of “financial services” in section 3(1) and in particular paragraphs (a), (c), (d) or (ka), which are the only ones in this group relevant to this statement. The only possibility is paragraph (l). In relation to paragraph (l), it is unlikely that initial planning services in this category would fall within the narrow interpretation of “arranging” as set out earlier in this statement. In many cases where an investor seeks initial planning services, it is not until the adviser completes the portfolio plan and it is approved and adopted by the investor that a final decision to invest is likely to be made. Activities undertaken before a decision to invest or a positive intention of entering into the transaction would appear too far removed and the provision of the financial service is too uncertain (not that it is essential for actual provision of a financial service to be the outcome). Initial planning services in the circumstances outlined would not be an arranging service that is tainted by the character of any other financial service the advisers may provide, as it is not closely connected to nor has the purpose of organising the provision of that financial service. To that extent, therefore, such initial planning activities would not come within the initial section 3(1)(l) requirement that they involve “agreeing to do or arranging” any of the paragraph (a) to (ka) activities. If that happens such activities have failed the first test, and the fact that they may also be 15 excluded from being financial services by virtue of the subsequent “advising” criterion in paragraph (l) is of little relevance. Situations may exist where planning services meet the first requirement of agreeing to do or arranging. However, even if meeting the “arranging” requirement in paragraph (l), initial planning services will fall squarely within the ordinary meaning of “advising” and thus the general exclusion for advising activities in paragraph (l). In this connection, the preparation of the portfolio plan will certainly involve to a significant degree the provision of advice and suggestions or recommendations by the adviser. Initial planning services provided by advisers are not reasonably incidental and necessary to any supply of financial services on the basis outlined earlier in this statement. Services that are reasonably incidental and necessary to the supply of any financial service (i.e. a supply coming within section 3(1)(a) to (l)) are also exempt supplies under section 14(1)(a). As outlined in the next section, where an adviser arranges implementation of an investment plan, once adopted by the investor those implementation services are generally financial services. However, the initial planning services are not an additional subordinate service arising out of, or provided in conjunction with and ancillary to, any implementation of that advice (i.e. a supply of financial services). The existence of the initial planning services is not dependent on the supply of those implementation services. Initial planning services are therefore not reasonably incidental and necessary to the supply by the adviser of any financial services. Initial planning services’ fees are subject to GST. They do not constitute financial services under any of paragraphs (a) to (ka) of section 3(1), nor do these activities as undertaken by advisers generally constitute the “agreeing to do or arranging” of any of the paragraph (a) to (ka) activities in terms of paragraph (l). The initial planning services do involve advisers in “advising” the investor on an investment programme, and therefore come within the specific exclusion from the definition of a financial service in section 3(1)(l). Implementation fees This category relates to all fees for services associated with implementing the initial investment plan devised in the preceding section. They will include any one-off, up- front fees paid to or made in respect of services or charges to advisers, administrators, executors, fund managers, etc., to purchase or acquire the investments. The fees include payments to custodians on implementation of the plan or charges by fund managers for entry into the investments. These services are provided in relation to the placement of investments. The role played by the adviser in relation to the services may vary. In some cases the adviser may directly undertake the purchase or acquisition of investments whether they be debt securities, equity securities, or participatory securities. However, usually the adviser will engage another organisation (e.g. a broker) to implement the investment plan on the adviser’s instructions and place investments on behalf of the investor. This other organisation is often referred to as the “custodian”. 16 As previously noted, the use of one or more intermediaries does not prevent the services provided by them from being financial services in terms of section 3(1)(l). To the extent that the adviser may directly undertake the purchase or acquisition of investments in the form of a debt security, equity security or participatory security, those implementation services constitute financial services in terms of section 3(1)(c), (d), and/or possibly paragraph (l). As such they are, therefore, exempt supplies. The activity of transferring ownership of such securities is itself a financial service under paragraphs (c) or (d). On the other hand, the implementation of the investor’s investment plan by the adviser organising the placement of the investments constitutes the arranging of that transfer of ownership activities in terms of paragraph (l). Such organising the placement of investments comes within the meaning of “arranging” as outlined earlier in this statement. In situations where a custodian implements the plan and acquires the particular investments on the instruction of the financial adviser, the fees charged by the adviser to the investor are also for an exempt supply of arranging financial services in terms of section 3(1)(l). The arranging service is tainted by the financial service’s character, as it is closely connected to and has the purpose of organising the provision of that financial service or causing it to occur. If the adviser uses a custodian (or other person or organisation) to place investments and passes on any of that person’s charges for this service to the investor as a disbursement, no GST consequences will arise for the adviser if the adviser is acting as the investor’s agent. Section 60(2) deems a taxable supply of goods and services made to an agent on behalf of a principal to be a supply made to the principal. Under this section, a supply of services that the adviser receives as agent for a client investor is deemed to be supplied to the investor client, not to the adviser. If the adviser pays for the supply and the client investor reimburses the adviser for that payment, the reimbursement is not consideration for a supply of services by the adviser. The adviser does not have to account for GST output or input tax on the supply. The discussion on the GST consequences of disbursements was outlined in the item Disbursements by professional firms on behalf of clients - GST on page 5 of Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 1 (July 1994). Where the adviser incurs custodian’s charges in the capacity of principal, and on- charges the investor as part of an “implementation fee”, no GST output tax is payable by the adviser so long as the services supplied by the adviser in respect of that implementation fee are themselves still financial services. In this respect it is not the name given to the fee that determines the GST treatment but the actual nature of the services provided. 17 NB. Whether the adviser is acting in the capacity of principal (or agent of the investor) will be established based on the facts. That is, the nature of the contract or arrangements between the parties. Implementation services will be financial services under section 3(1)(c), (d), and/or (l), and as such they are exempt supplies under section 14(1)(a). Administration fees These fees are generally described by advisers as “annual on-going” fees. They are charged by the adviser in respect of services provided in, and to cover costs of, maintaining records of the investor’s transactions with the adviser. They are also in respect of services and charges relating to the handling of cash for the investor, such as the withdrawal and deposit in the investor’s account with an administrator, bank charges, and other administration fees. Any fees or commissions charged by the adviser for collecting income from the investments and arranging these to be paid to or credited to the investor’s account with the adviser or to the investor’s bank account are also included. The different activities or services described as falling within the administration fees category are addressed individually. Income collection and distribution Fees or commissions charged by the adviser for collecting income from the investments and arranging these to be paid to or credited to the investor’s account with the adviser or to the investor’s bank account, may generally be accepted as falling within the wording of section 3(1)(ka). That is, “the payment or collection of any amount of interest, principal, dividend, or other amount”. This is on the basis that the amounts concerned relate to investments in a debt security, equity security, participatory security, credit contract, contract of life insurance, superannuation scheme, or futures contract. Alternatively, if part of the activities performed by the adviser in collecting investment income and arranging payment or crediting to the investor’s account (as described in this fees category) do not fall entirely within section 3(1)(ka), then they usually constitute financial services within paragraph (l). That is, the activities would fall within “arranging” one of the activities specified in the earlier paragraphs of section 3(1). This is on the basis that the particular service involved actively carrying out a service prior to the actual payment of an amount in respect of the investment. There is a direct nexus between the adviser doing this and the actual payment of an amount in respect of the investments, which is a financial service within paragraph (ka) of section 3(1). If a person other than the adviser (e.g. custodian or investment administrator) performs the income collection and distribution activities under consideration in this part of the statement, those activities would generally be financial services in terms of either section 3(1)(ka) and/or (l). 18 Cash handling services and charges Services and charges relating to the handling of cash for the investor, such as the withdrawal and deposit in the investor’s account with an administrator, bank charges, etc., are also considered initially under section 3(1)(ka) and/or (l). This is on the basis that the “investor’s cash” referred to relates to money either arising from investment income, investment sales or withdrawals, or provided by the investor to make initial, additional or new investments. Furthermore, the same person or organisation undertakes both the cash handling services and the associated income collection and distribution services or investment placement services (or the arranging of such services), whether it is the adviser or administrator, etc. Subject to the money concerned relating to investments of the type specified in paragraph (ka), the activities referred to can be considered to come within the wording in the paragraph: ... payment or collection of any amount of interest, principal, dividend, or other amount whatever in respect of ... To the extent that it could be argued that part of the cash handling activities referred to may not directly involve “payment or collection of ... or other amount whatever”, it is considered they could come within section 3(1)(l) as being involved with the arranging of such activities. A direct nexus exists between the adviser or administrator doing this and the actual payment of an amount in respect of the investments. On the other hand, it could be argued that the cash handling activities are not always a precursor to the payment or collection of the investor’s interest, principal, dividend or other amount or “cause that collection or payment to occur” and are therefore not “arranging”. However, even if the cash handling activities referred to do not constitute arranging, they would still qualify as an exempt supply under section 14(1)(a). That is on the grounds that they are “reasonably incidental and necessary” to the Income collection and distribution services element of the administration fees already stated to be a financial service. Without the cash handling services and investor accounts, the adviser or administrator would be unable to undertake the financial service of collecting and processing distributions for investors; those distributions being placed in each investor’s “cash holding account”. Maintaining such investors’ accounts is essential to the adviser or administrator being able to supply the service of income collection and distribution for investors. Consequently, cash handling activities are regarded as being reasonably incidental and necessary to the Income collection and distribution services element of the administration services that are a financial service supplied by the same person. On that basis, to the extent there is doubt as to these services qualifying as financial services under section 3(1)(ka) and/or (l), they would still qualify as an exempt supply in terms of section 14(1)(a). That is, they are reasonably incidental and necessary to the Income collection and distribution services element of the administration fees already stated to be a financial service. 19 Maintaining records of the investor’s transactions with the adviser To the extent that these activities relate to records of cash transactions between the adviser and investor, the reasoning and conclusions outlined in the previous section will apply equally here. This is on the basis that both the records maintenance activity and the associated income collection and distribution services and/or investment placement services (or the arranging of such activities), to which the cash transactions relate, are undertaken by the same person or company, whether it is adviser or administrator, etc. Where this occurs, this part of the administration fee activities will constitute an exempt supply. That will be either by virtue of being a financial service under section 3(1)(ka) and/or (l) or a supply of a service that under section 14(1)(a) is reasonably incidental and necessary to those other supplies making up the administration fee services as described (which in themselves are financial supplies supplied by the same person or company). The position may be somewhat different where the maintaining of transaction records’ activity referred to is undertaken by someone other than the person or company maintaining and operating the investor’s investment cash account (or carrying out income collection and distribution or investment placement services). In that situation, the maintaining of transaction records could not be a supply of services that are reasonably incidental and necessary to another supply of services that are financial services as required by section 14(1)(a). If the transaction records relate to the placing of investments and/or implementation of an investment plan (the undertaking or arranging of which it is considered is a financial service under section 3(1)(c), (d) and/or (l)), then (subject to the above comments) the keeping of such records is reasonably incidental and necessary to those other services. The keeping of such records would be essential as opposed to merely being a desirable adjunct to such activities. Summary Based on the activities making up the administration fee category being as described, the services provided in relation to administration fees constitute exempt supplies either: • by virtue of being financial services coming within one of the paragraphs in section 3(1); or • by being reasonably incidental and necessary to the supply of those financial services in terms of section 14(1)(a). Monitoring fees Monitoring fees are the annual charges for services provided in monitoring and reporting to the investor on the performance of the portfolio (including the performance of the fund managers and the adviser) in terms of the investor’s goals. The adviser will from time to time prepare reports on the portfolio’s performance and relay this information to the investor. 20 Earlier in this statement, it was concluded that the context in which the word “advising” is used in the phrase “advising thereon” in section 3(1)(l) indicates the more limited of two possible meanings. That is, the exclusion for advising thereon requires more than mere notification of or the dissemination of information regarding the financial service activities in section 3(1)(a) to (ka). Rather it excludes activities involving a degree of interpretation of information, counsel or opinion relating to those activities. Based on the description of monitoring services outlined, such services will not usually be subject to the “advising thereon” exclusion from financial services within the terms of section 3(1)(l). However, as indicated earlier, some information and reporting services provided by financial advisers or planners may well incorporate levels of advice that fall inside the meaning attributed to the exclusion for advising on the activities specified in section 3(1)(a) to (ka). Careful consideration will, therefore, be necessary to determine whether particular services are, or are not, subject to the exclusion. As discussed, even if an activity is not “advising” it does not mean that it will automatically be a supply of services that is exempt from GST. The requirement that the activity itself be a financial service or the arranging of a financial service, or reasonably incidental and necessary to a supply of an associated financial service still has to be met. Based on the earlier criteria in this statement for satisfying the “agreeing to do, or arranging” requirements in section 3(1)(l), the monitoring services do not meet those tests. Neither are monitoring services reasonably incidental and necessary to another supply of services which is itself a financial service. On this basis, monitoring fees will be regarded as not constituting a financial service in terms of section 3(1) or an exempt supply in terms of section 14(1)(a) and are therefore subject to GST. Evaluation fees This category includes fees relating to services involving subsequent evaluations of the portfolio’s performance, where the investor generally seeks confirmation that an already established portfolio is matching the goals set by either the investor or at the initial planning stage. This is a more detailed examination of performance of the portfolio than simply monitoring performance and reporting to the client. It may or may not result in a recommendation from the adviser to make changes to investments within the portfolio to maintain the aims established in the initial planning stage. Evaluation fees arise where the investor already has an existing portfolio and seeks advice to make changes to the income producing structure but not to the aims or goals of that structure. The services covered by these fees can be compared with and are similar in nature to some of those provided under the Initial planning fee category discussed earlier, in particular the provision of advice relating to future investment options and preparation of an investment plan. As such the GST treatment of evaluation fees is reasonably 21 clear and is in line with that applying to Initial planning fee services. That is, the services do not come within any of paragraphs (a) to (ka) of the definition of “financial services” in section 3(1) and in particular paragraphs (a), (c), (d) or (ka), which are the only ones in this group relevant to this statement. The only possibility is paragraph (l). However, to the extent that these evaluation fee services do happen to involve agreeing to do, or arranging any of the activities specified in section 3(1)(a) to (ka), the services would fall squarely within the “advising” exclusion in section 3(1)(l). Evaluation fees are therefore subject to GST. Re-planning fees The category includes fees relating to services involving a re-planning of a portfolio sometimes arising from Evaluation fees services due to changes to the investor’s objectives. This could be a minor change or a complete restructuring of investments and a change in investment strategy. Re-planning fees do not necessarily refer to advice supplied by the same adviser. The fees could be for advice by an adviser to a new client who had previously managed his or her own portfolio or had previously engaged a different adviser. The category could include any other fees for services as described in Initial planning fees above, when a complete restructuring of investments has occurred. As the name suggests, a re-planning could involve the restructuring of the current portfolio to meet the investor’s existing or changed investment goals and usually includes recommendations or suggestions for future investment. The services covered by these fees are very similar to those in the Evaluation fees category above, except that re-planning fees arise when there is a change in the investor’s investment objectives. The distinction is that Evaluation fees relate to looking at performance against original objectives whereas re-planning fees involve looking at new objectives and what changes are needed to achieve that. The services covered by re-planning fees do not include those relating to actual implementation of changes, which will come within the Switching fees category below. The GST treatment for services in the re-planning fee category is therefore the same as for Evaluation fees and the analysis is in line with that applying to Initial planning fee services. That is, the services do not come within any of paragraphs (a) to (ka) of the definition of “financial services” in section 3(1) and in particular paragraphs (a), (c), (d) or (ka), which are the only ones in this group relevant to this statement. The only possibility is paragraph (l). However, to the extent that these services do happen to involve agreeing to do, or arranging any of the activities specified in section 3(1)(a) to (ka), the services would fall squarely within the “advising” exclusion in section 3(1)(l). Re-planning fees are therefore subject to GST. Switching fees These fees relate to the costs involved in selling existing investments and/or purchasing new investments arising from a recommendation by the adviser as a result 22 of services suppled in relation to the two preceding fee categories (Evaluation fees and Re-planning fees). The fees will be charged by the adviser for services provided in changing investments within the portfolio, and will include any fees for services relating to the withdrawal in whole or in part from the then existing portfolio. The services provided for these fees have close similarities to those in the Implementation fees category, and in fact will include many that are the same. In particular up-front fees paid to or made in respect of services or charges to advisers, administrators, executors, fund managers, etc., to purchase or acquire the new investments will arise in both the implementation fees and switching fees categories. The same can be said for payments to custodians (on implementation of any amended plan), or charges by fund managers for entry into new investments. Section 3(1) will apply to services in the switching fees category, in the same way as it applied to those services in the implementation fees category. The analysis relating to the application of the law to these services is the same. The activity of transferring ownership of debt, equity, or participatory securities is a financial service under section 3(1)(c) or (d). To the extent that the adviser directly undertakes the sale or purchase of such securities as part of a switching of investments exercise, those switching services constitute financial services in terms of section 3(1)(c), (d) and/or paragraph (l). As such they are, therefore, exempt supplies. If a custodian implements an amended plan and switches or changes the particular investments on the instruction of the financial adviser, the fees charged by the adviser to the investor are also for an exempt supply of arranging financial services in terms of section 3(1)(l). This is in line with the conclusions drawn earlier as to the meaning of “arranging”. Examples These examples are included to assist in explaining the application of the law. Example 1 Financial Adviser prepares an initial portfolio plan, and charges Investor $2,000 for it. Investor decides to accept the plan, and asks Financial Adviser to arrange with Custodian for its implementation. Financial Adviser asks, on Investor’s behalf and as Investor’s agent, for Custodian to implement the plan. Custodian’s fee is charged to Investor by an invoice sent to Financial Adviser. Financial Adviser passes the invoice on to Investor. Custodian’s fee is $1,500, additional to the $2,000 charged by Financial Adviser. The $2,000 Financial Adviser charges Investor is for a taxable supply of initial planning services. The advice falls either outside the agreeing to do or arranging requirement, or within the “advising” exclusion, in paragraph (l) of the section 3(1) definition of “financial services”. Financial Adviser must account for GST output tax on the supply. 23 Passing on Custodian’s invoice to Investor has no GST implications for Financial Adviser, because Financial Adviser is simply the agent of Investor. Custodian’s services are exempt supplies of implementation services and no GST output tax needs to be returned by Custodian. Example 2 Six months after implementing the plan, Financial Adviser passes on to Investor dividend income collected on Investor’s behalf. Financial Adviser also conducts an evaluation of the investment portfolio’s performance. Financial Adviser charges a small commission of $50 for collecting the dividend income and $250 for the evaluation service. The $50 charge for collecting dividends is consideration for an exempt supply under section 3(1)(ka). Financial Adviser does not need to return GST on the amount. The $250 for the portfolio review is an evaluation service and as such is within the “advising” exclusion in section 3(1)(l) and therefore subject to GST. Financial Adviser must return GST output tax on this amount. Example 3 Financial Adviser has prepared a portfolio plan (involving debt, equity, and participatory securities within the meaning of section 3) that Investor asks Financial Adviser as agent to arrange with Custodian to implement. Financial Adviser maintains a record of transactions between Investor, Financial Adviser and Custodian relating to investment purchases and placement, sales/withdrawals and collection, and distribution of investment income to Investor. Financial Adviser undertakes collection and distribution of investment income and operates a cash account for Investor through which movement of funds is recorded. Financial Adviser charges an annual on-going fee of $500 for the record administration and maintaining the account for Investor, plus an income collection and distribution commission of 5% of the investment income collected. The 5% commission for collecting investment income is an exempt supply, being in respect of a financial service under section 3(1)(ka). The annual on-going fee of $500 for services in administering Investor’s records and cash account is not in respect of a financial service under any of the paragraphs of section 3(1). However, those services would be regarded as being reasonably incidental and necessary to the financial service of payment or collection of interest, dividends, principal (section 3(1)) and/or to an extent, the arranging of the investment placement portfolio implementation financial service (section 3(1)(l)), and thus would be an exempt supply under section 14(1)(a). Financial Adviser does not need to return GST on either of these fee amounts. Comments on technical submissions received 24 Some comments received in the course of producing this item suggested that the phrase “reasonably incidental and necessary” appearing in section 14(1)(a) should be interpreted as meaning highly expedient and that other narrower meanings for the phrase given in the draft item, such as an integral part of, were inconsistent with that wider meaning. These comments led us to review the cases used to determine the meaning of the phrase “reasonably incidental and necessary”. That review concluded that the previous range of meanings given for the phrase was too wide. The cases, in particular Databank, Re an Inquiry, and Europa Oil (No.2), together with the context in which the provision incorporating the phrase appears in the Act, show that the meaning of the phrase “reasonably incidental and necessary” is not as wide as the words highly expedient suggest. The cases and legislative context also indicate that the meaning of the phrase is not as narrow as the words an integral part of suggests. The Commissioner’s view of the meaning of the phrase is as set out earlier in the interpretation statement, and is considered to describe more clearly now what the cases have interpreted as the goods and services that come within the phrase “reasonably incidental and necessary”.
SHORTFALL PENALTY FOR NOT TAKING REASONABLE CARE SUMMARY 1.1 All legislative references in this statement are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. 1.2 This statement provides a detailed interpretative explanation of the shortfall penalty imposed by the Commissioner under section 141A of the Act on taxpayers who do not take reasonable care in carrying out their tax obligations. Where a taxpayer does not meet the standard of reasonable care, the result may be that too little tax is paid or payable or a tax benefit, credit, or advantage is overstated. This interpretation statement deals with some interpretative issues relating to the section, and is intended to complement and be read together with Standard Practice Statement INV-200, Shortfall penalties – not taking reasonable care appearing in Tax Information Bulletin Vol. 10, No 3 (March 1998) which applies to tax positions taken before 1 April 2003. The main features of this statement are: • The standard of “reasonable care” in respect of section 141A involves establishing what a reasonable person would do in the same circumstances and takes into account such factors as the age, health, and background of the taxpayer in question. • The statement provides guidance as to how the standard of reasonable care is applied to various types of taxpayers, e.g., business persons, clients of agents, and tax specialists. It also examines how the reasonable care standard applies in certain situations such as receipt of Inland Revenue advice, complexity of the law, materiality, and arithmetical errors. • The reasonable care standard does not mean perfection, but refers to the effort required commensurate with the reasonable person in the taxpayer’s circumstances. • In determining whether the standard of reasonable care has been met, the Commissioner will consider the likelihood of a tax shortfall, the quantum of the shortfall and the difficulty of preventing a tax shortfall. • Although a taxpayer is liable for the actions of their employees, the question of whether the taxpayer has taken reasonable care must still be considered. • The shortfall penalty payable by the taxpayer, for not taking reasonable care, can be reduced for the taxpayer’s previous behaviour, voluntary disclosure or where the tax shortfall is temporary. (The penalty can also be increased where the taxpayer obstructs the Commissioner.) 1 • In the Commissioner’s view, section 141JAA, which provides for the penalty payable to be capped in some situations, is only applicable after other reductions have been made. 2. BACKGROUND 2.1 Following a review of the compliance and penalties legislation, the Tax Administration Amendment Act (No 2) 1996 introduced new rules to address problems that existed with the previous legislation. The problems that were identified in the review included unfairness to the majority of taxpayers who comply with the law, unnecessary costs to those involved, unclear legal processes and requirements, and rules that did not fit in with the self- assessment environment. 2.2 The Taxpayer Compliance, Penalties, and Disputes Resolution Bill – Commentary on the Bill (September 1995) (“Commentary on the Bill”) states that: The reforms proposed in this bill will promote fairer and more effective enforcement of the Inland Revenue Acts. They will enhance taxpayers’ understanding of their obligations and the standards expected of them and will improve consistency in the application of penalties overall and between different tax types. 2.3 Section 139 sets out the purpose of the penalties legislation as being the encouragement of voluntary compliance and co-operation with the Department, the consistent and impartial imposition of penalties, and the setting of penalties to fit the seriousness of the breach of tax obligations. 2.4 As part of these reforms, new civil penalties were introduced to replace additional tax and penal tax. These penalties include a late filing penalty, late payment penalty, shortfall penalties, and various other civil penalties. This statement provides an explanation of some interpretative aspects of one of the shortfall penalties – the penalty for not taking reasonable care covered by section 141A of the Act. 2.5 Following the enactment of the Taxation (Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003, there have been some changes to the legislation that applies to a tax position that a taxpayer takes, generally, on or after 1 April 2003. These further changes are noted in this statement and include the monetary cap of $50,000 on the shortfall penalty payable by the taxpayer for not taking reasonable care, which in some circumstances is provided for under section 141JAA. 2.6 This interpretation statement applies, except as otherwise specified, with respect to tax obligations, liabilities, and rights that are to be performed under or arise in respect of: (a) The Income Tax Act 1994 in relation to the tax on income in the 1997- 98 income year and subsequent years to and including the 2004-05 income year and then the Income Tax Act 2004, in relation to the tax on income in the 2005-06 and subsequent income years: 2 (b) The Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 in relation to supplies made in taxable periods commencing on or after 1 April 1997. 3. ISSUE 3.1. The issue addressed by this statement is the Commissioner’s interpretation of section 141A with particular emphasis on the meaning of the standard of “reasonable care”. 4. LEGISLATION 4.1 Section 15B sets out the taxpayer’s tax obligations: \[taxpayer’s tax obligations applicable prior to the 2002-03 income year\] 15B Taxpayer's tax obligations 15B A taxpayer must do the following: (a) Unless the taxpayer is a non-filing taxpayer, correctly determine the amount of tax payable by the taxpayer under the tax laws: (b) Deduct or withhold the correct amounts of tax from payments or receipts of the taxpayer when required to do so by the tax laws: (c) Pay tax on time: (d) Keep all necessary information (including books and records) and maintain all necessary accounts or balances required under the tax laws: (e) Disclose to the Commissioner in a timely and useful way all information (including books and records) that the tax laws require the taxpayer to disclose: (f) To the extent required by the Inland Revenue Acts, co-operate with the Commissioner in a way that assists the exercise of the Commissioner's powers under the tax laws: (g) Comply with all the other obligations imposed on the taxpayer by the tax laws.

(2) The penalty payable for not taking reasonable care is 20% of the resulting tax shortfall. (3) A taxpayer who, in taking a taxpayer’s tax position, has used an acceptable interpretation of the tax law is also a taxpayer who has taken reasonable care in taking the taxpayer’s tax position. \[for “tax positions” taken on or after 1 April 2003\] 141A Not taking reasonable care (1) A taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty if the taxpayer does not take reasonable care in taking a taxpayer’s tax position (referred to as “not taking reasonable care”) and the taking of that tax position by that taxpayer results in a tax shortfall.

(3) A taxpayer, who takes an acceptable tax position is also a taxpayer who has taken reasonable care in taking the taxpayer’s tax position. (4) Subsection (3) and section 141B (1B) do not exclude a taxpayer who makes a mistake in the calculation or recording of numbers in a return from being liable for a penalty for not taking reasonable care. 4.3 The following terms are defined in section 3(1): “Correct tax position” means the correct tax position established under one or more tax laws: “Shortfall penalty” means a penalty imposed under any of sections 141A to 141K for taking an incorrect tax position or for doing or failing to do anything specified or described in those sections: \[definition of “tax law” prior to 1 April 2002\] “Tax law” means— (a) A provision of the Inland Revenue Acts or an Act that an Inland Revenue Act replaces: (b) An Order in Council or a regulation made under another tax law: (c) A non-disputable decision: (d) In relation to an obligation to provide a tax return or a tax form, also includes a provision of the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992 or a regulation made under that Act or the Accident Insurance Act 1998 or a regulation made under that Act. \[definition of “tax law” with effect on or after 1 April 2002) “Tax law” means— (a) A provision of the Inland Revenue Acts or an Act that an Inland Revenue Act replaces: 4 (b) An Order in Council or a regulation made under another tax law: (c) A non-disputable decision: (d) In relation to an obligation to provide a tax return or a tax form, also includes a provision of the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992 or a regulation made under that Act or the Accident Insurance Act 1998 or a regulation made under that Act or the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation, and Compensation Act 2001 or a regulation made under that Act: \[for “tax positions” taken prior to 1 April 2003\] “Tax position” means a position or approach with regard to tax possible, under one or more tax laws, including without limitation (a) A liability for an amount of tax, or the payment of an amount of tax: (b) An obligation to deduct or withhold an amount of tax, or the deduction or withholding of an amount of tax: (c) A right to a tax refund, or to claim or not to claim a tax refund: (d) A right to a credit of tax, or to claim or not to claim a credit of tax: (e) The provision of a tax return, or the non-provision of a tax return: (f) The derivation of an amount of gross income or exempt income or a capital gain, or the inclusion or non-inclusion of an amount in gross income: (g) The incurring of an amount of expenditure or loss, or the allowing or disallowing as a deduction of an amount of expenditure or loss: (h) The availability of net losses, or the offsetting or use of net losses: (i) The attaching of a credit of tax, or the receipt of or lack of entitlement to receive a credit of tax: (j) The balance of a tax account of any type or description, or a debit or credit to such a tax account: (k) The estimation of the provisional tax payable: (l) Whether the taxpayer must request an income statement or respond to an income statement issued by the Commissioner: (m) The application of section 33A(1): (n) A right to a rebate: \[for “tax positions” taken on or after 1 April 2003\] “Tax position” means a position or approach with regard to tax under one or more tax laws, including without limitation a position or approach with regard to– (a) A liability for an amount of tax, or the payment of an amount of tax: (b) An obligation to deduct or withhold an amount of tax, or the deduction or withholding of an amount of tax: (c) A right to a tax refund, or to claim or not to claim a tax refund: (d) A right to a credit of tax, or to claim or not to claim a credit of tax: (e) The provision of a tax return, or the non-provision of a tax return: (f) The derivation of an amount of gross income or exempt income or a capital gain, or the inclusion or non-inclusion of an amount in gross income: (g) The incurring of an amount of expenditure or loss, or the allowing or disallowing as a deduction of an amount of expenditure or loss: 5 (h) The availability of net losses, or the offsetting or use of net losses: (i) The attaching of a credit of tax, or the receipt of or lack of entitlement to receive a credit of tax: (j) The balance of a tax account of any type or description, or a debit or credit to such a tax account: (k) The estimation of the provisional tax payable: (l) Whether the taxpayer must request an income statement or respond to an income statement issued by the Commissioner: (m) The application of section 33A(1): (n) A right to a rebate: “Tax shortfall”, for a return period, means the difference between the tax effect of— (a) A taxpayer’s tax position for the return period;

SHORTFALL PENALTY FOR NOT TAKING REASONABLE CARE THE SHORTFALL PENALTY PAYABLE UNDER SECTION 141A 5.1 Section 141A(1) provides for a shortfall penalty to be imposed on a taxpayer for “not taking reasonable care” in the taking of a taxpayer’s tax position. Where that tax position results in a tax shortfall: A taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty if the taxpayer does not take reasonable care in taking a taxpayer’s tax position (referred to as “not taking reasonable care”) and the taking of that tax position by that taxpayer results in a tax shortfall. 5.2 The shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care is 20% of the resulting tax shortfall (section 141A(2)). (2) The penalty payable for not taking reasonable care is 20% of the resulting tax shortfall. 5.3 The terms “shortfall penalty”, “taxpayer’s tax position”, “tax position”, and “tax shortfall” are all defined in section 3(1). 5.4 There is no definition for the term “reasonable care” in the Act. However, section 141A(3) provides that a taxpayer who has used an “acceptable interpretation” (or with application to tax positions taken on or after 1 April 2003, a taxpayer who “takes an acceptable tax position”), in taking a taxpayer’s tax position is one who has taken reasonable care in the taking of the taxpayer’s tax position. Section 141A(3) states: (3) A taxpayer who takes an acceptable tax position is also a taxpayer who has taken reasonable care in taking the taxpayer's tax position. 5.5 Interpretation Statement IS0055 provides the Commissioner’s view on what is an unacceptable tax position (applicable to tax positions taken on or after 1 April 2003). 5.6 With application to a tax position taken on or after 1 April 2003, section 141A(4) provides that a taxpayer who makes a mistake in the calculation or recording of numbers in a return is specifically not excluded from being liable for a penalty for not taking reasonable care under section 141A. Section 141A(4) states: (4) Subsection (3) and section 141B(1B) do not exclude a taxpayer who makes a mistake in the calculation or recording of numbers in a return from being liable for a penalty for not taking reasonable care. 7 5.7 In this context, it is considered that “return” refers to the taxpayer’s tax return. “Tax return” is defined in the Act. “Tax return” means a form or document that a taxpayer is required by a tax law— (a) To complete; and (b) To provide to the Commissioner,— whether in electronic or written form and whether provided in respect of a period or not; and also includes a tax form issued by another taxpayer that the taxpayer provides to the Commissioner: 5.8 It is noted that section 141A(4) does not provide that the taxpayer who makes a mistake in the calculation or recording of numbers in a return is necessarily liable for a shortfall penalty under section 141A. Extent of application of section 141A 5.9 It should be noted that section 141A also applies to employers who do not take reasonable care in their tax obligations in respect of the deduction of tax from employees. The definitions of “tax law” and “tax position” mean that section 141A can apply to any of the Inland Revenue Acts. However, for the Child Support Act 1991 and Student Loan Scheme Act 1992, section 141A applies only in respect of employer obligations under these Acts. 6. NOT TAKING REASONABLE CARE INTRODUCTION 6.1 As noted above, there is no definition for the term “reasonable care” in the Act. The word “care” is defined in The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles (Brown, L, (ed.), volume 1, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1993)), at page 516) to mean: ... 3 serious attention, heed, caution, pains (assembled with care; handle with care) ... 6.2 In the context of section 141A(1), the word “care” suggests the attention that a taxpayer takes in the taking of the taxpayer’s tax position, with the adjective “reasonable” being used to describe the level or standard of attention required. In The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles, volume 2, at page 2496, “reasonable” is defined to mean: ... 5 Within the limits of reason; not greatly less or more than might be thought likely or appropriate; moderate, ... 6.3 Thus, taking reasonable care is giving appropriately serious attention to imposed obligations. Lack of reasonable care has long been one of the constituents of the tort of negligence. It is, therefore, helpful as background to consider the law relating to the tort of negligence. 8 NEGLIGENCE IN TORT 6.4 In defining the standard of care in negligence cases, the Courts have laid down the concept of the “reasonable person”. Alderson B in Blyth v Birmingham Waterworks (1856) 11 Ex 781 at page 784 stated: Negligence is the omission to do something which a reasonable man, guided upon those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs, would do; or do something which a prudent and reasonable man would not do. 6.5 The standard of care in negligence is not dependent upon the person’s individual characteristics (Glasgow Corporation v Muir \[1943\] AC 448 at page 457 per Lord Macmillan): the standard is that of a reasonable person. Consequently, the circumstances of the person may dictate that they seek outside assistance (Todd, S, (ed.), The Law of Torts in New Zealand, 3rd edition, (Wellington: Brookers Limited, 2001) at pages 389-392). Therefore, an incapacitated person, whether in law or physically, can be held to have been negligent when he or she has attempted to do something beyond his or her capacity (Spiers v Gorman \[1966\] NZLR 897 at pages 905 – 906 (a minor); Billy Higgs & Sons Ltd v Baddeley \[1950\] NZLR 605 at page 614 (physical incapacity)). 6.6 In this context, when using an expert’s assistance, it is necessary that the expert is advised of all necessary information. In the tax context, it was held in Pech v Tilgals \[1994\] ATC 4206 that, when instructing tax agents, a taxpayer’s standard of care requires that the tax agent is comprehensively instructed and that the tax return that the principal is declaring to be correct must be inspected by the principal following its completion. However, it was also held that it was not necessary for the taxpayer to cover every contingency exhaustively by acquainting him or herself with all possible considerations that a reasonable person would not deal with. 6.7 The standard of care of a reasonable person does not require perfection. As Laidlaw J said in the Canadian case of Arland v Arland and Taylor \[1955\] OR 131 at page 142: \[The reasonable man\] is not an extraordinary or unusual creature; he is not superhuman; he is not required to display the highest skill of which anyone is capable; he is not a genius who can perform uncommon feats, nor is he possessed of unusual powers of foresight. He is a person of normal intelligence who makes prudence a guide to his conduct. He does nothing that a prudent man would not do and does not omit to do anything that a prudent man would do. He acts in accordance with general and approved practice. His conduct is guided by considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs. His conduct is the standard adopted by the community by persons of ordinary intelligence and prudence. \[emphasis added\] 6.8 The use of hindsight is not relevant in determining whether or not a person has been negligent. In Duchess of Argyll v Beuselinck \[1972\] 2 Lloyds Rep 172 at page 185, Megarry J stated: 9 In this world there are few things that could not have been better done if done with hindsight. The advantages of hindsight include the benefit of having a sufficient indication of which of the many factors present are important and which are unimportant. But hindsight is no touchstone of negligence. 6.9 In tort, a reasonable person takes notice of standards that are authoritative, sensible, accepted, or persuasive (Froom v Butcher \[1975\] 3 All ER 520 at page 526 per Lord Denning) and, in so doing, will be expected to keep abreast of such standards if it is reasonable to do so (Graham v Co-operative Wholesale Society Ltd. \[1957\] 1 WLR 511). 6.10 In Paris v Stepney Borough Council \[1951\] AC 367, it was held that the degree of care required was dependent upon the gravity of the consequences if anything went wrong; a higher degree of care is required when the consequences of getting it wrong are serious. REASONABLE CARE IN RELATION TO THE PARTICULAR PERSON 6.11 As to the degree of care required, there are traditionally no “high” or “low” standards, to use the terminology in Russell v Harris \[1960\] NZLR 902. Much care or little care may be needed depending upon the circumstances. 6.12 In tort, an inexperienced person is required to exercise the care of the ordinary person. The clearest example of this in relation to negligence is the English Court of Appeal case of Nettleship v Weston \[1971\] 3 All ER 581. The case involved the alleged negligence of Mrs Weston who was learning to drive when she caused an accident. It is well established that a person driving a motor vehicle owes a duty of care to any passengers in the vehicle as well as to other persons on or near the roadways. One of the issues for the court was whether or not Mrs Weston had breached this duty by not taking reasonable care. Lord Denning MR made the following observations regarding the standard of reasonable care at page 586: It is no answer for him to say: “I was a learner-driver under instruction. I was doing my best and could not help it.” The civil law permits no such excuse. It requires of him the same standard of care as any other driver. “It eliminates the personal equation and is independent of the idiosyncrasies of the particular person whose conduct is in question”: see Glasgow Corpn v Muir \[1943\] 2 All ER 44 at 48 per Lord Macmillan. The learner-driver may be doing his best, but his incompetent best is not good enough. He must drive in as good a manner as a driver of skill, experience and care, who is sound in wind and limb, who makes no errors of judgment, has good eyesight and hearing and is free from any infirmity. 6.13 In this regard, the test is not whether a person has tried to exercise reasonable care, but rather whether he or she has in fact done so (Bailey v Taylor \[1936\] NZLR 806). This indicates that the test for reasonable care is an objective one. 6.14 In the case of persons who hold themselves out as experts in a particular area, such as a specialist surgeon, the standard of care may be higher. In the Law of Torts in NZ, 3 rd edition, Brookers 2001, it is stated at page 385 that, in the case of those who have special skills, the standard of conduct must conform to that 10 which ought to be attained by persons holding themselves out as possessing the relevant skills. Bannerman, Brydone Forster & Co v Murray \[1972\] NZLR 411 is New Zealand Court of Appeal authority for this proposition (in relation to solicitors). However, an expert in a particular field is not required to exercise a greater degree of care than an ordinary person unless he or she holds him or herself out to be such (Stokes v Guest, Keen & Nettlefold (Bolts and Nuts) Ltd \[1968\] 1 WLR 1776). 6.15 As can be seen from the cases, the test for reasonable care in the tort of “negligence” is generally objective. The rationale behind this common law test is that people are not to be encouraged to engage in something beyond their capabilities. Clerk & Lindsell on Torts, 18th ed, London, Sweet & Maxwell 2000 speculate that insurance considerations have contributed to the objective standard, being that of the activity rather than the actor and state at paragraph 7.163, in relation to Nettleship v Weston: Policy justification Basing the objective standard on the activity rather than the actor gives the reasonable expectations of the claimant priority over those of the defendant. This policy is most evident in cases where the activity affects the safety of the general public and where, as a consequence, it is likely that those undertaking the activity will be insured. 6.16 However, there is some authority for the consideration of personal characteristics or circumstances in the application of the tort test of negligence, albeit in exceptional circumstances. Salmond on the Law of Torts, 16 th ed, at page 225 discusses the standard of care in relation to actions which the person is compelled to carry out. After stating that the test for negligence is objective, Salmond qualifies the test in the following terms: If, however, a person thus deficient in some attribute of the ordinary and average man is placed without his own choice in some situation where the possession of that attribute is requisite for the avoidance of harm, he is not responsible for negligence merely because the ordinary man could have avoided the accident. He must be judged with reference to his own capacities of mind and body, and if he does his best, he does enough, even though a man better endowed would have been bound to do much more. A blind man must not voluntarily do an act which can be safely done only by those who have eyes to see, but if he has such action thrust upon him through no choice of his, he will not be judged as though he could see. 6.17 There are also cases that have considered the culpability of the defendant. At page 391 of The Law of Torts in New Zealand, 3 rd ed, Brookers, 2001, it is stated: ... that in exceptional circumstances the courts’ insistence on the maintenance of strictly objective standards ... gives way in the face of the plaintiff’s innocence of any culpability or fault. 6.18 Mansfield v Weetabix Ltd \[1998\] 1 WLR 1263 is cited in this respect. The case concerned a driver who could not function properly because, unknown to him, he suffered from malignant insulinoma which starved the brain of glucose. Accordingly, an accident in which he crashed into the plaintiff’s shop was not his fault and he was not negligent. Leggatt LJ, in the English Court of Appeal, rejected strict liability in the following words: 11 In my judgment the standard of care that Mr Tarleton was obliged to show in these circumstances was that which is to be expected of a reasonably competent driver unaware that he is or may be suffering from a condition that impairs his ability to drive. To apply an objective standard in a way that did not take account of Mr Tarleton’s condition would be to impost strict liability. But that is not the law. 6.19 The Law of Torts in New Zealand goes on to state that mental disability stands on the same footing as physical disability so far as the standard of care issue is concerned. It is noted that this approach has been taken in Canada in cases such as Buckley v Smith Transport \[1946\] 4 DLR (Ont CA) but not in Australia (in Adamson v Motor Vehicle Insurance Trust \[1956\] WALR 56). However, as discussed later in this statement, there is Australian authority that supports some consideration being given to the person’s experience, education and skills in determining whether there has been a lack of reasonable care in the tax context. NEGLIGENCE IN A TAX CONTEXT 6.20 In Case W4 (2003) 21 NZTC 11,034, which concerned “gross carelessness”, Judge Barber, in the TRA, referred to the circumstances of the taxpayer in the application of the test for “reasonable care”. He stated at page 11,044 of the judgment as follows: I can accept that the test of reasonable care is whether a taxpayer of ordinary skill and prudence would have foreseen as a reasonable probability or likelihood the prospect that an act, or failure to act, would cause a tax shortfall, having regard to all the circumstances. As with gross carelessness, whether the taxpayer acted intentionally is not a consideration. It is not a question of whether the taxpayer actually foresaw the probability that the act or failure to act would cause a tax shortfall, but whether a reasonable person in the circumstances of the taxpayer would have seen the tax shortfall as a reasonable probability. Reasonable care must include exercising reasonable diligence to determine the correctness of a return. It must also include the keeping of adequate books and records or to properly substantiate items, and generally making a reasonable attempt to comply with the tax law. The effort required of the taxpayer is commensurate with the reasonable person in the taxpayer’s circumstances. What must be expected is the achievement of a standard appropriate to the category of taxpayer, rather than that of the individual taxpayer concerned. Materiality must be implicit in the standard of reasonable care so that consideration will be given not only to the nature of the shortfall, but also to its size in relation to the taxpayer. This means there may be varying degrees of care required depending on the particular circumstances. \[emphasis added\] 6.21 This clearly contemplates consideration of the circumstances of the taxpayer. 6.22 In the earlier decision of Judge Barber in Case W3 (2003) 21 NZTC 11,014, which concerned gross carelessness and, in the alternative, lack of reasonable care, there was no discussion of the taxpayer’s circumstances. However, there was no reason for a lesser standard to be applied in that case as the taxpayer was an accountant. In Case W3, the issue was whether a higher standard was required but, on the facts, Judge Barber did not find it necessary to decide on the matter. 12 6.23 Therefore, it can be seen that the common law in applying a test of reasonable care to determine whether a breach of duty has occurred, applies an objective test that is not generally qualified by the characteristics or circumstances of the person. It is necessary, however, to consider the particular circumstances and background to section 141A. LEGISLATIVE BACKGROUND 6.24 Determining what constitutes “reasonable care” and where it must be taken requires consideration of legislative intent. In this respect, the statutory context of section 141A and background materials to the legislation are relevant. 6.25 The Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a Government discussion document (August 1994) at page 19 stated the following: Reasonable care will become a basic standard that all taxpayers must exercise in fulfilling any tax obligation. The standard requires taxpayers to take the same level of care that a reasonable person would take in the same circumstances. What is reasonable depends on the facts and circumstances of each situation, including the person’s experience, education and skills. It equates with the concept of negligence in the civil law of torts, for which the jurisprudence is well established. \[emphasis added\] 6.26 However, the Commentary on the Bill at page 11 states that the standard of care required is determined by focusing on the “reasonable” person, i.e. one of ordinary skill and prudence: The test of reasonable care is whether a person of ordinary skill and prudence would have foreseen as a reasonable probability or likelihood the prospect that an act (or failure to act) would cause a tax shortfall, having regard to all the circumstances. 6.27 The Commentary on the Bill at page 11 also notes that the taxpayer’s intention is irrelevant, as is whether or not the taxpayer foresaw that a shortfall would result: The test does not depend on the taxpayer’s intention, or whether the taxpayer actually foresaw that the act or failure to act would cause the shortfall; rather, it asks whether a reasonable person would have foreseen it. 6.28 When the Taxpayer Compliance, Penalties, and Disputes Resolution Bill (1995) was introduced into Parliament, the then Minister of Revenue used the following example to illustrate these points to highlight the focus on the person of ordinary skill and prudence: The test of reasonable care is whether a person of ordinary skill and prudence would have foreseen as a reasonable probability the prospect that an act would cause a tax shortfall, having regard to all the circumstances. (NZPD Vol 550, 1995: 9339) 6.29 However, the issue of a particular taxpayer’s circumstances was specifically addressed when the Finance and Expenditure Committee reported back on the above Bill. The report included the following: 13 We examined the "reasonable care" policy statement (refer Appendix I) that the department intends to publish in a Tax Information Bulletin after enactment of the bill. The statement defines the standard and describes in detail the intended operation of the penalty. It emphasises the flexible character of the standard, the relative ease with which it should be met by a very significant majority of taxpayers, the importance of the particular circumstances of each taxpayer, and the essentially non-onerous obligations the standard is intended to impose. 1. Conclusion Having considered the statement and having derived comfort from the examples in the statement, we determined that the "reasonable care" provision should not be amended. However, this is only on the basis that the concepts and interpretations outlined in the draft policy statement represent the department's application of the law, without change. We expect the courts to regard our comments in this report, together with the department's declared intentions set out in Appendix I, to represent Parliament's intentions in regard to the meaning and administration of the Act in this respect, as well as in respect of other key aspects discussed elsewhere in this report. \[emphasis added\] 6.30 The FEC report appears to support the Parliamentary intention being that, although the test is objective, the personal circumstances of the taxpayer are taken into account in establishing whether the taxpayer has exercised reasonable care. In other words, it is necessary to consider what a reasonable person in the taxpayer’s circumstances would have done. 6.31 The discussion on reasonable care in Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 8, No 7 (October 1996) at page 11 is consistent with the above approach: The reasonable care test requires a taxpayer to exercise the care that a reasonable person would be likely to exercise in the taxpayer’s circumstances to fulfil the tax obligations. It is not a question of whether the taxpayer actually foresaw the probability that the act or failure to act would cause a tax shortfall, but whether a reasonable person in the same circumstances would have foreseen the shortfall as a reasonable probability. It equates with the concept of negligence in the civil law of Torts, and the jurisprudence is well established: “Negligence is to be measured objectively by ascertaining what in the circumstances would be done or omitted by the reasonable man.” (Meulen’s Hair Stylists Ltd. v CIR; Meulen’s Hair Stylists (Lambton Quay) Ltd. v CIR \[1963\] NZLR 797). In the tax context, reasonable care includes exercising reasonable diligence to determine the correctness of the tax position. It also includes keeping adequate books and records to substantiate items properly, and generally making a reasonable attempt to comply with the tax law. The reasonable care test is not intended to be overly onerous to taxpayers. Reasonable care does not mean perfection. The effort required of the taxpayer is commensurate with that of a reasonable person in the taxpayer’s circumstances. \[emphasis added\]. 6.32 The TIB discussion continues: The circumstances that may be taken into account when determining whether a taxpayer has exercised reasonable care include: • the complexity of the law and the transaction (the difficulty in interpreting complex legislation); 14 • the materiality of the shortfall (the gravity of the consequence and the size of the risk); • the difficulty and expense of taking the precaution; • the taxpayer’s age, health and background. \[emphasis added\] 6.33 This also indicates a test where attributes of the taxpayer such as age, health, and background are taken into account in establishing whether reasonable care has been exercised. 6.34 Other tax jurisdictions have similar provisions where the setting of a standard of care is required. Consideration of these provisions and their application may be helpful. THE AUSTRALIAN APPROACH TO THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE TAXPAYER 6.35 Section 141A was largely derived from the equivalent Australian provision (section 226G of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936). Section 226G provides that a penalty tax may be imposed where shortfalls are caused by a failure to take reasonable care. Accordingly, Australian case law on section 226G is of some relevance. The Australian provision provides: Subject to this Part, if: (a) a taxpayer has a tax shortfall for a year; and (b) the shortfall or part of it was caused by the failure of the taxpayer or of a registered tax agent to take reasonable care to comply with this Act or the regulations; the taxpayer is liable to pay, by way of penalty, additional tax equal to 25% of the amount of the shortfall or part. 6.36 Section 226G differs from section 141A in that it specifically penalises taxpayers for their tax agents’ failures to take reasonable care, although, in other respects, the interpretation and application of the Australian provision are useful as a basis for understanding section 141A. 6.37 In the explanatory memorandum to the Taxation Law Amendment (Self Assessment) Bill 1992 (Cth), which introduced section 226G of the Australian Act, the standard of reasonable care was described in terms of a taxpayer’s circumstances: The effort required is one commensurate with all the taxpayer’s circumstances, including the taxpayer’s knowledge, education, experience and skill. 6.38 Case 34/95 95 ATC 319 at page 324 and Arnett & Ors v FCT 98 ATC 2137 at page 2,140 cite this passage from the explanatory memorandum with approval, as do Schott v FCT 1999 ATC 2,234 at 2,236 – 2,237, Cripps v FCT 1999 ATC 2428, and Davis v FCT 2000 ATC 2,044 at 2,050. 6.39 In this context, the Australian Tax Office (the “ATO”) issued Taxation Ruling TR 94/4, where it promulgated its understanding of the meaning of taking 15 reasonable care under section 226G of the Australian Act. Paragraph 6 of the ruling describes the standard of care to be the reasonable, ordinary person – this indicating a similar basis to the person of ordinary skill and prudence used in the Commentary to the Bill. However, it also takes into account the person’s circumstances, for example, the experience, education and skill of the person: The reasonable care test requires a taxpayer to take the care that a reasonable ordinary person would take in all the circumstances of the taxpayer to fulfil the taxpayer’s tax obligations. Provided that a taxpayer may be judged to have tried his or her best to lodge a correct return, having regard to the taxpayer’s experience, education, skill and other relevant circumstances, the taxpayer will not be liable to pay penalty. 6.40 Paragraph 14(f) of Taxation Ruling TR 94/4, cited with approval in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Case 11/97 97 ATC 173 at page 187, considered the issue of interpretations of tax laws in the context of the lack of reasonable care penalty provision: On questions of interpretation, reasonable care requires a taxpayer to come to conclusions that would be reasonable for an ordinary person to come to in the circumstances of the taxpayer. If the taxpayer is uncertain about the correct tax treatment of an item, reasonable care requires the taxpayer to make reasonable enquiries to resolve the issue. This is different from the reasonably arguable position standard \[i.e. the equivalent of unacceptable interpretation in New Zealand\], which does not look at the taxpayer’s efforts in resolving the issue, nor the circumstances of the taxpayer, but solely at the merits of the arguments in support of a position. 6.41 Paragraph 6 of Taxation Ruling TR 94/4 was cited with approval in Cripps v FCT; and in Re Carlaw and FCT 95 ATC 2166. Re Carlaw considered, among other things, whether a taxpayer, who claimed a deduction for meal expenses, was liable for a penalty under section 226G. On the basis that he had taken advice from a qualified tax agent and the fact that the deduction claimed was reasonably arguable if, in fact, incorrect, the taxpayer was successful in his appeal against the penalty imposed. At page 2,170, McMahon (DP) stated: The taxpayer is a truck driver. He made claims for deductions pursuant to advice he received from a qualified tax agent, who had been engaged by his union. If a man in that position is advised that he may make a claim, can it be said that he fails to take reasonable care to comply with the Act if the claim is unsuccessful? I think not. Clearly the mere fact that a claim is made can not thereby render the conduct of a taxpayer careless, particularly when that claim is reasonably arguable. ... That advice had some measure of support from Case U148 \[87 ATC 868\], from the article of Mr Durack which I have quoted, and from observations made in \[FCT v Edwards 94 ATC 4255\] and in \[Roads & Traffic Authority v FCT 93 ATC 4508\]. Although in the circumstances of Mr Carlaw’s employment and consumption of food I do not consider that the expenditure claim is properly deductible, I do not consider that he has displayed a failure to take reasonable care to comply with the Act in making his claim. 6.42 In contrast, in Re Sparks v FCT 43 ATR 1,324, although the taxpayer and his wife employed an accountant to make their returns, it was held that Mr Sparks was liable for a shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care because he had failed to inform his accountant of certain interest income. Mr and Mrs Sparks 16 had failed to return that interest in their annual returns. Mr Sparks notified the Commissioner of this when he was advised that he was to be audited. Mrs Sparks also notified the Commissioner of the omission in her returns, although at the time she had not been advised of any prospective audit. Although Mr and Mrs Sparks employed an accountant to make their returns, the Tribunal upheld that there was no cause to possibly remit the tax penalty payable by Mr Sparks under section 226G, on the basis that they had received erroneous advice. “Mr Sparks simply failed to inform his accountant of the existence of the interest income” (paragraph 9 of Re Sparks). 6.43 Case 34/95 concerned the actions of a tax agent who incorrectly claimed a deduction for a superannuation contribution for a taxpayer. The Australian provision is wider than the New Zealand provision and attributes to the taxpayer, any lack of reasonable care on the part of the tax agent. In Case 34/95, the Tribunal applied the reasonable person test. The Tribunal held that the taxpayer’s agent had failed to take reasonable care, and, accordingly, in affirming the taxpayer’s tax shortfall penalty, the Tribunal was “satisfied \[that\] the tax shortfall was caused by the failure of the taxpayer or tax agent to take reasonable care to comply with the Act”. The Tribunal made the following statement referring to the appropriate standard of care: 21. The explanatory memorandum to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Self Assessment) Bill 1992, the Bill which introduced section 226G to the Act, illuminates Parliament’s intended meaning of the phrase “reasonable care”. In that document, at page 80, it is explained that reasonable care “requires a taxpayer to make a reasonable attempt to comply with the provisions of \[the Act\] and regulations. The effort required is one commensurate with all the taxpayer’s circumstances, including the taxpayer’s knowledge, education, experience, and skill”. 6.44 In short, the Australian provision seems to require that the taxpayer’s circumstances including the taxpayer’s knowledge, education, experience, and skills are to be taken into account in determining whether they have taken reasonable care. CANADIAN APPROACH TO THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE TAXPAYER 6.45 Section 227.1(1) of the Canadian Income Tax Act 1994 imposes a liability to deduct tax on the directors of a corporation where the corporation has failed to deduct the tax. 6.46 Section 227.1(3) provides that a director is not liable under subsection (1) if the director exercised: ... the degree of care, diligence and skill to prevent the failure that a reasonably prudent person would have exercised in comparable circumstances. 6.47 CCH Canadian Tax Reporter Commentary on the Canadian Income Tax Act 1994 provides the following comment on section 227.1(3): The leading case on the standard of care requirement under subsection 227.1(3) is the Federal Court of Appeal decision in Soper v. The Queen, (F.C.A.) 97 DTC 5407. The Court in Soper began its analysis on the issue by summarizing the common law 17 standard applicable to directors. The Court quoted from the seminal judgement in Re City Equitable Fire Insurance Company, \[1925\] 1 Ch. 407 (C.A.) (referred to above), which set out the minimum standard of care, diligence and skill required of directors under the common law: ... The Court in Soper held that the statutory standard of care under subsection 227.1(3) is, in many ways, the same as that under the common law. In particular, the Court held that the standard of care laid down in subsection 227.1(3) is inherently flexible. Rather than treating directors as a homogeneous group of professionals whose conduct is governed by a single, unchanging standard, the provision embraces a subjective element which takes into account the personal knowledge and background of the director, as well as his or her corporate circumstances in the form of, among other things, the company's organization, resources, customs and conduct. Thus, more is expected of individuals with superior qualifications and business experience, as compared to individuals without such qualifications and experience. According to the Court, the standard of care set out in subsection 227.1(3) is neither purely objective nor purely subjective. Rather, the provision contains both objective elements (embodied in the reasonable person language) and subjective elements (inherent in individual considerations like “skill” and the idea of “comparable circumstances”). Accordingly, the standard can be properly described as “objective subjective”. \[emphasis added\] 6.48 It is, therefore, apparent that the approach taken in Canada, in setting the threshold for reasonable care in a taxation context, is to take into account the circumstances of the person such as education and business experience. APPLICATION OF THE “NEGLIGENCE” TEST TO THE STANDARD OF REASONABLE CARE 6.49 It is also apparent that a test, taking into account the taxpayer’s age, health, and background, was what the New Zealand legislators intended. The standard of care for negligence is generally accepted as purely objective, being the level of care a reasonable person would take in the same circumstances. The jurisprudence in relation to tort law does not generally permit factors such as the taxpayer’s age, health, and background to be taken into account in applying the test. 6.50 It is considered that a test which takes into account the taxpayer’s circumstances better fulfils the intention of section 141A and, as discussed above, was what Parliament intended. This view is supported by the discussion document, the report of the Finance and Expenditure Committee, and TIB Vol 8, No 7 (October 1996). 6.51 It would also appear that this interpretation accords with the scheme and purpose of the penalty provisions of the Tax Administration Act. The purposes of the penalty provisions are set out in section 139. 139 The purposes of this Part are— 18 (a) To encourage taxpayers to comply voluntarily with their tax obligations and to co-operate with the Department; and (b) To ensure that penalties for breaches of tax obligations are imposed impartially and consistently; and (c) To sanction non-compliance with tax obligations effectively and at a level that is proportionate to the seriousness of the breach. 6.52 It is considered that section 139 supports a test that takes account of the taxpayer’s circumstances in interpreting what is “not taking reasonable care”. The taxpayer’s circumstances would encompass the factual background as well as the personal attributes of the taxpayer, such as age, health and background. The wording of the purpose provision does not support a regime of penalising taxpayers who complete tax returns with reasonable care. Therefore, the underlying purpose of the regime would seem to support taking account of the characteristics of the taxpayer, such as the taxpayer’s age, health, and background, as well as objective elements, when considering the application of section 141A. 6.53 This approach has been followed in Canada and Australia. It is also be noted that the Australian Administrative Tribunal in numerous cases (Schott, Cripps, Davis, and Arnett) refer to Case 34/95 and its citation of the explanatory memorandum regarding the taking into account of the particular circumstances of the taxpayer. Carlaw and Cripps also refer to the ATO Taxation Ruling TR 94/4 relating to a person’s particular circumstances. It would seem that the same reasoning as set out in the Australian memorandum could be applied in New Zealand. Implications for tax specialists 6.54 It is also necessary to examine the implications for tax specialists. If a taxpayer consults a tax specialist or agent, the taxpayer would generally be taking reasonable care in terms of the legislation and common law, provided that all relevant tax details are disclosed to the tax specialist or agent. As to the tax specialist’s own obligations, the tort of negligence is generally focused on owing a duty of care to a person as in the case of the specialist surgeon holding himself or herself out as an expert to a patient and carrying out surgery on the patient. However, the question arises as to what is the duty of care on tax specialists in terms of their own tax obligations as possibly they are not holding themselves out as tax specialists to the Commissioner when they are filing their own tax returns. In terms of the test of what a reasonable person in the taxpayer’s circumstances would do, it would follow that the standard of care for a tax specialist would be higher than the standard for an ordinary taxpayer. This would seem to accord with the intention of the legislation, which is that taxpayers are diligent in fulfilling their tax obligations. This is also consistent with lowering the standard of reasonable care to take account of instances where health, age, and background are factors in not meeting the normal standard. 6.55 The ATO ruling (Taxation Ruling TR 94/4) does not specifically cover the above issue. Paragraph 36 of the ruling does, however, discuss the example of the standard of care required by a tax agent in attending to a client’s tax affairs 19 being higher than that of an ordinary taxpayer. The ruling states, in relation to an example: The standard of care required by a tax agent is higher than that expected of an ordinary taxpayer due to the knowledge, education, skill and experience of the agent obtained from continual exposure to the operation of the financial system and similar transactions in numerous clients. When examining a taxpayer's affairs, a tax agent would be expected to apply this experience to the taxpayer's situation and to ask the questions necessary to correctly prepare the client’s return. 6.56 In the New Zealand Taxation Review Authority decision, Case W3, referred to above, Judge Barber was asked to consider whether an accountant would be held to a higher standard than a layperson in the preparation of his own GST return. Although Judge Barber did not find it necessary to determine the issue, he stated as follows: ... \[Counsel for the Commissioner\] seems to accept that such an aspect can be put to one side and the focus can be upon what the ordinary person should have done in such a case. \[Counsel for the Commissioner\] submits that, even on that basis, the disputant’s lack of investigation into, or his disregard of, record keeping requirements is below the level which a prudent person would be expected to adopt and shows a careless approach to the correct returning of output tax on the $37,864.09 additional income. NON-NATURAL PERSON LIABILITY FOR LACK OF REASONABLE CARE 6.57 Questions of vicarious liability may arise where the responsibility for taking a tax position is delegated. In the case of a corporate or “non-natural person” taxpayer, all such responsibility will necessarily be delegated to a natural person. However, the same law as to vicarious liability would apply in either situation; the actions of an employee, in the course of his or her employment, are attributed to the employing company as to any other employer. VICARIOUS LIABILITY 6.58 It is vicarious liability that is relevant to the taking of reasonable care since “not taking reasonable care” is not concerned with intention or mens rea. The classic statement from Salmond on Torts (9th ed), p 95, as to vicarious liability in terms of employers was adopted by Lord Thankerton in the Privy Council case of Canadian Pacific Railway Co v Lockhart \[1942\] 2 All ER 464 at 467: It is clear that the master is responsible for acts actually authorised by him: for liability would exist in this case, even if the relation between the parties was merely one of agency, and not of service at all. But a master, as opposed to the employer of an independent contractor, is liable even for acts which he has not authorised provided that they are so connected with acts which he has authorised that they may rightly be regarded as modes – although improper modes – of doing them. In other words, a master is responsible not merely for what he authorises his servant to do, but also for the way in which he does it... On the other hand, if the unauthorised and wrongful act of the servant is not so connected with the authorised act as to be a mode of doing it, but is an independent act, the master is not responsible; for in such a case the servant is not acting in the course of his employment, but has gone outside of it. 20 6.59 The decision in Canadian Pacific Railway Co v Lockhart was followed by the New Zealand Court of Appeal in Union Steam Ship Company of New Zealand v Colville \[1960\] NZLR 100 and would, thus, appear to be good law in New Zealand. Vicarious liability as it applies to supervision and delegation of tasks to staff 6.60 Although the definition of “taxpayer” is wide, not taking reasonable care relates to the “taxpayer’s tax position” which is “a tax position taken by a taxpayer in or in respect of a tax return; or an income statement; or a due date”. Taxpayers are responsible for the acts of their employees provided the acts were within the acts authorised for that employee. Therefore, if an employee fails to meet the reasonable care standard in taking a tax position, the taxpayer employer is liable for the failure, whether the taxpayer is a natural person or not. The only difference between the application of this rule to natural person taxpayers and non-natural person taxpayers is that a non-natural person must act through agents and employees as it is incapable of acting otherwise. 6.61 Although a taxpayer is liable for the actions of their employees, the question of whether the taxpayer has taken reasonable care must still be considered. 6.62 The question arises as to the application of the test where it considers the age, health and background of the taxpayer when it is an employee who is acting on the taxpayer’s behalf. There are several points to be made in this respect. An employee authorised to take the tax position may take reasonable care based on his or her age, health or background. However, the authorisation of that person may expose the taxpayer to the lack of reasonable care penalty should a tax shortfall result. This is so whether a natural person taxpayer authorised that employee or another employee of a non-natural person taxpayer authorised that person to take the taxpayer’s tax position. 6.63 The question would be whether a reasonable person would have delegated to that person the preparation of the tax return and the taking of a tax position on the taxpayer’s behalf. If the extent and nature of some incapacity of the employee would be known or suspected by a reasonable employer (or the taxpayer’s employee who delegated the task to that person) then this would constitute not taking reasonable care. If, as a consequence, a tax shortfall arose in relation to that tax position, section 141A would apply. It would not be the acts of the incapable employee that would constitute not taking reasonable care provided that the incapable employee met the standard for a person in their circumstances. It would be the delegation of the task to that person whether by the taxpayer or an authorised employee of the taxpayer that would constitute not taking reasonable care. 6.64 The same principles would apply to the employees who, while not preparing the tax return, do perform other relevant functions concerned with the taking of a tax position. If, for example, a storeman provides incorrect stock figures to the accountant preparing the tax return and there is a tax shortfall as a result 21 then, depending on the circumstances, this could be a failure to take reasonable care in the taking of the tax position. 6.65 The principles in relation to liability for employees and their failure to take reasonable care can be summarised as follows: • The employer is vicariously liable for the acts of employees committed in the course of employment. • The same principles of vicarious liability will also apply to taxpayers, whether natural persons or not, who delegate the preparation of tax returns to employees. • The use of an employee that a reasonable person would know or suspect to be incapable of correctly filing the tax return can expose the taxpayer to a shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care. This would apply regardless of whether the task is delegated by the taxpayer or by another employee of the taxpayer. • The lack of care would also encompass situations where employees provide assistance or information to be used in taking a tax position, or perform other relevant functions concerned with taking a tax position. Taxpayers are equally liable for the actions of these employees, as they are for the actions of the staff member who actually prepares the tax return. • The penalty can apply regardless of whether the employee completing the return took reasonable care given their age, health and background. The penalty is applied to the taxpayer – not the employee. INDICIA OF NOT TAKING REASONABLE CARE FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTION 141A 6.66 Having established that the test for not taking reasonable care is similar to that of negligence in tort, but taking into account the taxpayer’s circumstances, it is necessary to apply this test in the tax context. What factors indicate that a taxpayer has or has not taken reasonable care in taking a taxpayer’s tax position? This involves determining what a taxpayer of ordinary skill and prudence would do or not do in the taxpayer’s circumstances. Those circumstances include the taxpayer’s attributes (such as age, health, background, etc) and this may have an impact on the level of care to be exercised. The reasonable person test – some factors to be considered in relation to the standard. 6.67 When the Taxpayer Compliance, Penalties, and Disputes Resolution Bill was introduced into Parliament, the Minister of Finance stated: What is reasonable will depend on the type of obligation involved. For example, a salary and wage earner will generally satisfy the reasonable care test by carefully following the tax guide. Reasonable care for a business taxpayer will include putting into place appropriate record-keeping systems and other procedures to ensure that the business income and expenditure is properly recorded and classified for tax purposes. (NZPD Vol 550, 1995:9339) 22 6.68 The Commentary on the Bill at page 12 was more specific: The circumstances that will be taken into account when determining whether a taxpayer has exercised reasonable care may include the complexity of the law and the transaction, the materiality of the shortfall (the gravity of the consequence and the size of the risk) and the difficulty and expense of taking the precaution. 6.69 Traditionally, it could be said in tort law that there are four main factors to be considered in setting the standard of reasonable care: • Probability of injury (or in a tax context, the likelihood of a tax shortfall); • Gravity of the risk (which in a tax context would be the quantum of the shortfall); • Burden of precautionary measures (which in a tax context would be the difficulty of preventing a tax shortfall); and • Social value of the activity (which is not relevant in the tax context). 6.70 Mason J provided a helpful summary of the legal position in Wyong Shire Council v Shirt (1980) 146 CLR 40 at 47-48 which is consistent with those circumstances to be taken into account set out in the Commentary on the Bill and quoted above. Mason J said: In deciding whether there has been a breach of the duty of care the tribunal of fact must first ask itself whether a reasonable man in the defendant’s position would have foreseen that his conduct involved a risk of injury to the plaintiff or to a class of persons including the plaintiff. If the answer be in the affirmative, it is then for the tribunal of fact to determine what a reasonable man would do by way of response to the risk. The perception of the reasonable man’s response calls for a consideration of the magnitude of the risk and the degree of the probability of its occurrence, along with the expense, difficulty and inconvenience of taking alleviating action and any other conflicting responsibilities which the defendant may have. It is only when these matters are balanced out that the tribunal of fact can confidently assert what is the standard of response to be ascribed to the reasonable man placed in the defendant’s position. \[emphasis added\] 6.71 The criteria for consideration provided by Mason J have subsequently been quoted and applied by the Court of Appeal in Wilson & Horton v AG \[1997\] 2 NZLR 513, 521. 6.72 The Commentary on the Bill is consistent with this when it states: The circumstances that will be taken into account when determining whether a taxpayer has exercised reasonable care may include: the complexity of the law and the transaction, the materiality of the shortfall (the gravity of the consequence and the size of the risk) and the difficulty and expense of taking the precaution. 6.73 The Commentary on the Bill also indicates the factors to be considered for business taxpayers: For a business, reasonable care will also take into account the size and nature of the business, the internal controls in place and business record keeping practices. 23 6.74 In summary, factors indicating that a taxpayer has not taken reasonable care will depend on the particular obligations of the taxpayer. The obligations of a salary or wage earner are likely to be satisfied by carefully following the tax guide. However, in a more complex tax situation, such as that of a business, reasonable care by a taxpayer will mean using an accounting system appropriate to the size, number and complexity of transactions. Taking reasonable care may also mean delegating those tasks relevant to the taking of a tax position only to appropriate staff. These matters will be highlighted further in the discussion below under the headings, “the likelihood of a tax shortfall”, “the quantum of a tax shortfall” and the “difficulty of preventing a tax shortfall”. Example one A staff member of a large business makes an error of $10,000 in transferring figures from work papers to the GST return. The owner of the business is aware that the same staff member has made a similar transposition error in the previous period’s GST return. In this case, it could be concluded that a reasonable owner would have foreseen a risk and put simple checks in place that would at least reduce the risk of obvious errors. Therefore, the taxpayer would be liable for a shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care in respect of the second shortfall. (Whether the first shortfall would give rise to a penalty would depend on the particular circumstances of the error in that instance.) Example two In a similar scenario to example one, a staff member of a large business makes an error of $10,000 in transferring figures from work papers to the GST return. The owner of the business is aware that the same staff member has made a similar transposition error in the previous period’s GST return. After the first error, the owner provided additional training for the staff member on the requirements for GST and also implemented a system whereby the GST returns were checked by a supervisor before they were submitted to the IRD. Although a second error was subsequently made, it involved the transposition of two figures from the working papers to the GST return. Instead of an amount of $111,570, the amount shown on the GST return as a refund was $111,750. In this case, as a reasonable owner, the owner has put simple checks into place to reduce the risk of obvious errors and the error is relatively minor. Therefore, the taxpayer would not be liable for a shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care in respect of the second shortfall. (As for example one, whether the first shortfall would give rise to a penalty would depend on the particular circumstances of the error in that instance.) Likelihood of a tax shortfall 6.75 One aspect of determining whether or not a person has taken reasonable care concerns whether or not the consequences of a person’s action or inaction would have been foreseeable to the person (Duchess of Argyll v Beuselinck \[1972\] 2 Lloyds Rep 172 at page 185; Wyong Shire Council v Shirt (1980) 146 CLR 40 at page 47). The Commentary on the Bill at page 11 puts it this way: 24 The test of reasonable care is whether a person of ordinary skill and prudence would have foreseen as a reasonable probability or likelihood the prospect that an act (or failure to act) would cause a tax shortfall, having regard to all circumstances. The test does not depend on the taxpayer’s intention, or whether the taxpayer actually foresaw that the act or failure to act would cause a shortfall; rather, it asks whether a reasonable person would have foreseen it. 6.76 The difficulty of balancing the risk of an event happening against the difficulty of eliminating the risk was discussed by Lord Reid in Overseas Tankship (UK) v The Miller Steamship Co Pty (The Wagon Mound (No2)) \[1966\] 2 All ER 709 (PC). Lord Reid stated at page 719: Bolton v Stone (\[1951\] 1 All ER 1078, \[1951\] AC 850, HL.), posed a new problem. There a member of a visiting team drove a cricket ball out of the ground on to an unfrequented adjacent public road and it struck and severely injured a lady who happened to be standing in the road. ... So it could not have been said that, on any ordinary meaning of the words, the fact that a ball might strike a person in the road was not foreseeable or reasonably foreseeable. It was plainly foreseeable; but the chance of its happening in the foreseeable future was infinitesimal. ... The House of Lords held that the risk was so small that in the circumstances a reasonable man would have been justified in disregarding it and taking no steps to eliminate it. It does not follow that, no matter what the circumstances may be, it is justifiable to neglect a risk of such a small magnitude. A reasonable man would only neglect such a risk if he had some valid reason for doing so: eg, that it would involve considerable expense to eliminate the risk. He would weigh the risk against the difficulty of eliminating it. ... In the present case there was no justification whatever for discharging the oil into Sydney Harbour. Not only was it an offence to do so, but also it involved considerable loss financially. If the ship’s engineer had thought about the matter there could have been no question of balancing the advantages and disadvantages. From every point of view it was both his duty and his interest to stop the discharge immediately. ... If a real risk is one which would occur to the mind of a reasonable man in the position of the defendant’s servant and which he would not brush aside as far- fetched, and if the criterion is to be what that reasonable man would have done in the circumstances, then surely he would not neglect such a risk if action to eliminate it presented no difficulty, involved no disadvantage and required no expense. ... The most that can be said to justify inaction is that he would have known that this could only happen in very exceptional circumstances; but that does not mean that a reasonable man would dismiss such risk from his mind and do nothing when it was so easy to prevent it. If it is clear that the reasonable man would have realised or foreseen and prevented the risk, then it must follow that the appellants are liable in damages. ... 6.77 Accordingly, it must be considered whether a reasonable person would have foreseen that consequence and the actions that that reasonable person would have taken to prevent the risk foreseen. 6.78 Materiality may be relevant in determining whether a taxpayer has taken reasonable care. In many cases a tax shortfall may be considered material, where the shortfall is a substantial amount in comparison to the taxpayer’s tax liability, and it is considered that a reasonable person would have foreseen that something was incorrect. However, although the quantum of the tax shortfall 25 is relevant, other factors may also indicate whether the taxpayer has taken reasonable care. Example three A taxpayer returns $50,000 taxable income but omits a further $10,000 from his return. It can be accepted from the proportionally large amount of the omission that the taxpayer should have been aware that not all income had been returned. This is regardless of whether or not the taxpayer used an agent to complete his return. The tax shortfall is large relative to the taxpayer’s taxable income. In the absence of any special circumstances, the taxpayer breached the standard of reasonable care in this case. Example four In contrast to the previous example, a large company returns taxable income of $50,000,000, but omits an additional $10,000 of assessable income. Subject to consideration of the circumstances that led to the error, the amount of the omission when compared with the taxable income of the company does not support the view that there was a lack of reasonable care. The tax shortfall, in relation to the taxable income, may mean that the company, despite the error, still took reasonable care in the preparation of its income tax return. 6.79 In some cases, it may also be appropriate to consider the quantum of the assessable income of the taxpayer for the relevant period when a tax shortfall arises in respect of an error in relation to assessable income. Other relevant matters might include the total deductions of a taxpayer where a tax shortfall relates to an incorrect deduction. The number of transactions, whether giving rise to the assessable income or deductions, may also be a factor to be considered. For example, it would be easier to review and check a smaller number of transactions rather than a large volume. This is, however, subject to the expectation that to take reasonable care with a large volume of transactions or transactions involving large amounts, suitable systems to deal with these transactions would be expected to be in place. 6.80 To summarise, in respect of the likelihood of a tax shortfall, the test is whether a reasonable person, in the circumstances of that taxpayer, would have foreseen the likelihood of a tax shortfall. The test is not whether the taxpayer concerned foresaw the tax shortfall. Factors indicating that a taxpayer may not have taken reasonable care include: • repeated errors where the taxpayer has been advised or is otherwise aware that mistakes have previously been made; • systems’ failures the risks of which are foreseeable or for which the taxpayer has not established adequate safeguards and monitoring; • delegating matters relating to the taking of a tax position to employees who are known or would be suspected by a reasonable employer of lacking the capacity to take reasonable care (for example, inadequately trained staff or inexperienced or temporary staff); and 26 • the size of the tax shortfall, in that an error of a substantial amount in comparison to the taxpayer’s tax liability or assessable income would be more easily foreseen. Quantum of tax shortfall 6.81 The Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a Government Discussion document at page 18 states that failure to fulfil statutory obligations should normally attract a sanction: The fundamental obligation on taxpayers is to pay the correct amount of tax on time. Failure to satisfy this or any other legal requirement imposed on taxpayers by Parliament should normally attract a sanction. 6.82 However, the gravity of the risk or the size of the tax shortfall is a relevant factor to be considered in determining the standard of care required. Difficulty of preventing a tax shortfall 6.83 A reasonable person takes notice of standards that are authoritative, sensible, accepted or persuasive, and, in so doing, keeps abreast of such standards if it is reasonable to do so (Froom v Butcher \[1975\] 3 All ER 520 at page 526; Graham v Co-operative Wholesale Society Ltd \[1957\] 1 WLR 511). In the context of tax law, a taxpayer exercising reasonable care would make use of up-to-date, freely available material such as tax guides issued by the Inland Revenue Department, Tax Information Bulletins, public rulings, and interpretation statements and guidelines (or if he or she did not have the necessary skills to do so, would seek help). A taxpayer with relatively simple tax affairs, such as a salary and wage earner, would be expected at least to consider relevant tax guides issued by the Inland Revenue Department and seek clarification if necessary. Tax agents and advisors 6.84 Generally, a taxpayer will not be liable for a shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care in respect of the lack of care by the agent, in respect of the provision of advice or in respect of the agent’s preparation of the tax return. The Taxpayer Compliance Penalties and Disputes Resolution Bill (September 1995) states: Taxpayers are also required to take reasonable care in interpreting the law. If they are uncertain as to the tax treatment of an issue, reasonable care will require them to make inquiries to resolve this, by consulting the Inland Revenue Department or a tax adviser. A taxpayer who has reasonably relied on the advice of a tax adviser or the department will usually be considered to have exercised reasonable care. However, a failure to provide adequate information when seeking advice, a failure to provide reasonable instructions to a tax adviser, or unreasonable reliance on a tax adviser or on wrong advice may still expose the taxpayer to a penalty for lack of reasonable care. 6.85 A taxpayer who takes reasonable care will make inquiries if they are uncertain over a tax matter. This may involve consultation with Inland Revenue or a tax advisor and will require the taxpayer to provide adequate information when 27 seeking the advice. Where that taxpayer seeks advice on a particularly complex tax issue, it may be quite reasonable for the taxpayer to rely on a tax agent’s advice without much questioning. However, where the advice appears manifestly wrong or unreasonable on the basis of the taxpayer’s own knowledge, a taxpayer who takes reasonable care will question such advice. This does not imply though that the taxpayer is required to have any particular knowledge of tax laws. 6.86 To summarise, in respect of the difficulty of preventing a tax shortfall, it is considered that a taxpayer who takes reasonable care: • will, if necessary, seek help, although a wage or salary earner may generally satisfy the reasonable care test by carefully following the tax guide and it is considered that taxpayers with more complex tax affairs will follow appropriate guidance from Tax Information Bulletins and other up-to-date public and freely available guidance or interpretative material issued by the Inland Revenue Department; • will consult Inland Revenue or a tax advisor where they are uncertain as to the tax treatment of an issue; • will provide adequate information when seeking advice to resolve a tax matter; • will question advice where it appears manifestly wrong or unreasonable, on the basis of the taxpayer’s own knowledge; and • will utilise adequate systems appropriate for the size of the business and the number and complexity of the transactions. Example five A taxpayer engages an agent to complete her income tax return. She provides her agent with her dividend statements. However, due to the disorderly manner in which she keeps her papers, she omits one of the statements, which is for a large amount of money. In the absence of any special circumstances, the taxpayer in this case will be liable to a penalty for not taking reasonable care with the information she provided to her agent. Example six A taxpayer is audited and is found to have incorrectly claimed private motor vehicle expenses against business income. In a subsequent year the taxpayer’s return is prepared by an agent and the same expenses matter results in a shortfall. Depending on the circumstances, the taxpayer may have displayed a lack of reasonable care for this second omission. The taxpayer should have been alerted by the previous audit discrepancy and ensured that the subsequent return was correctly completed. (It is possible, depending on the circumstances that a shortfall penalty might also apply in relation to the first shortfall.) 28 Inland Revenue advice 6.87 If a taxpayer seeks advice from Inland Revenue disclosing all relevant facts, and follows that advice, this would be taking reasonable care, unless there was some reason for the taxpayer to question that advice, if, for example, the taxpayer still has doubts due to his or her own tax knowledge or conflicting advice has been received from a tax agent. However, this would only be the case if the taxpayer has provided full and correct facts when obtaining advice from the Department. The taxpayer, since the onus of proof of taking reasonable care rests with him or her, should document any oral advice from Inland Revenue showing details of when and from whom the advice was sought or retain any written advice from Inland Revenue. Summary – not taking reasonable care 6.88 The test of “reasonable care” is what a reasonable person in the taxpayer’s circumstances would have done in the same situation. The taxpayer’s circumstances would encompass the factual situation as well as the personal attributes of the taxpayer such as age, health and background. For business taxpayers, this is likely to include the size and nature of the business, the internal controls in place and the record keeping practices. In addition, various circumstances, which may indicate the level of care necessary to fulfil tax obligations in the taking of the taxpayer’s tax position include: • the extent and complexity of tax law underpinning the particular type of tax obligation; • the likelihood of a tax shortfall; • the quantum of tax shortfall; and • the difficulty of preventing a tax shortfall. It is also emphasised that the reasonable care test does not mean perfection. The effort required of the taxpayer is commensurate with the reasonable person in the taxpayer’s circumstances. 7. REDUCTIONS, INCREASES AND A CAP ON THE SHORTFALL PENALTY Overview 7.1 The shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care is subject to various possible reductions of the shortfall penalty payable. These are provided for under sections 141FB (previous behaviour), 141G (voluntary disclosure) and 141I (temporary shortfall). However, section 141J (limitation of reduction) provides where the taxpayer qualifies for a reduction in shortfall penalty under both section 141G and where there is a temporary tax shortfall, the shortfall penalty is reduced only once and that will be by 75%. 7.2 Although the above sections provide for the shortfall penalty to be reduced in a number of situations, the shortfall penalty payable for not taking reasonable 29 care is also subject to 25% increase, under section 141K, if the taxpayer obstructs the Commissioner in determining the correct tax position. 7.3 Section 141JAA, which applies only to tax positions taken on or after 1 April 2003, provides that the shortfall penalty payable by the taxpayer for not taking reasonable care may not be more than $50,000, if the taxpayer voluntarily discloses the tax shortfall or the Commissioner determines the shortfall within specified time limits and provided section 141K does not apply. Shortfall penalty reductions 7.4 Section 141FB was replaced effective 21 December 2004. Section 141FB provides for a 50% reduction of the amount of the shortfall penalty that would otherwise be payable if the taxpayer is not: • convicted of an offence that is a disqualifying offence; or • liable for another shortfall penalty that is a disqualifying penalty. 7.5 The relevant part of section 141FB is set out below: ... (2) A shortfall penalty (called the current penalty) for which a taxpayer is liable under any of sections 141A to 141D is reduced, to 50% of the amount that would be payable by the taxpayer in the absence of this section, if the taxpayer is not— (a) convicted of an offence that is a disqualifying offence: (b) liable for another shortfall penalty that is a disqualifying penalty for the purpose of this subsection. (3) For the purpose of this section — disqualifying offence means — (a) an offence under section 143A, 143B, 143F, 143G, 143H or 145 for which a conviction is entered— (i) on or after 26 March 2003; and (ii) before the taxpayer takes the tax position to which the current penalty relates: (b) an offence under section 143 or 144 that relates to the type of tax to which the current penalty relates and for which a conviction is entered— (i) on or after 26 March 2003; and (ii) after the date that precedes, by the period specified in subsection (4), the date on which the taxpayer takes the tax position to which the current penalty relates; and (iii) before the taxpayer takes the tax position to which the current penalty relates disqualifying penalty means — (a) for the purpose of subsection (1), a shortfall penalty that — (i) relates to the type of tax to which the current penalty relates; and 30 (ii) is for evasion or a similar act; and (iii) is not reduced for voluntary disclosure by the taxpayer; and (iv) relates to a tax position that is taken on or after 26 March 2003 and before the date on which the taxpayer takes the tax position to which the current penalty relates: (b) for the purpose of subsection (2), a shortfall penalty that— (i) relates to the type of tax to which the current penalty relates; and (ii) if the current penalty is— ... (B) for not taking reasonable care or taking an unacceptable tax position, is a shortfall penalty of any sort; and (iii) is not reduced for voluntary disclosure by the taxpayer; and (iv) relates to a tax position that is taken— (A) on or after 26 March 2003; and (B) after the date that precedes, by the period specified in subsection (4), the date on which the taxpayer takes the tax position to which the current penalty relates; and (C) before the date on which the taxpayer takes the tax position to which the current penalty relates. (4) The period referred to in the definitions of disqualifying offence and disqualifying penalty, in subsection (3), and in subsection (5) is— (a) 2 years, if the current penalty relates to— (i) the taxpayer's application of the PAYE rules: (ii) fringe benefit tax: (iii) goods and services tax: (iv) resident withholding tax: (b) 4 years, if the period is not given by paragraph (a). (5) For the purpose of subsections (1) and (2), a shortfall penalty that relates to a tax shortfall arising from a tax position taken by a taxpayer is determined as if the taxpayer were not liable for a shortfall penalty that relates to a tax shortfall arising from another tax position taken by the taxpayer, if— (a) the Commissioner becomes aware of both tax shortfalls as a consequence of a single investigation or voluntary disclosure; and (b) the taxpayer— (i) takes both tax positions on the same date: (ii) is not liable for a shortfall penalty at any time in the period specified in subsection (4) that ends on the earliest date on which the taxpayer takes a tax position that gives rise to a tax shortfall of which the Commissioner becomes aware as a consequence of the investigation or disclosure to which paragraph (a) refers. 31 7.6 In the case of a penalty for not taking reasonable care in respect of GST, FBT, PAYE or RWT, if the taxpayer has not been liable to pay a tax shortfall penalty relating to the same tax type within the previous two years (not being a penalty reduced for voluntary disclosure), the 50% reduction provided for under section 141FB can apply. For other tax types, there is a four year period of “good behaviour” required. The reduction applies separately for each type of tax such as PAYE, income tax and GST. A penalty imposed in respect of one tax does not mean that the reduction is not available for other tax types. If the taxpayer has made a voluntary disclosure, this does not interrupt the taxpayer’s good behaviour period. 7.7 Section 141G provides for reducing the shortfall penalty for voluntary disclosure of the tax shortfall. The relevant parts of section 141G state: 141G. Reduction in penalty for voluntary disclosure of tax shortfall— (1) A shortfall penalty payable by a taxpayer under any of sections 141A to 141EB may be reduced if, in the Commissioner's opinion, the taxpayer makes a full voluntary disclosure to the Commissioner of all the details of the tax shortfall, either— (a) Before the taxpayer is first notified of a pending tax audit or investigation (referred to in this section as “pre-notification disclosure”); or (b) After the taxpayer is notified of a pending tax audit or investigation, but before the Commissioner starts the audit or investigation (referred to in this section as “post-notification disclosure”). ... (3) The level by which the shortfall penalty is reduced— (a) For pre-notification disclosure is 75%: (b) For post-notification disclosure is 40%. ... 7.8 Where there is a temporary tax shortfall, section 141I provides for reducing the shortfall penalty. The relevant part of the section states: 141I. Reduction where temporary shortfall— (1) A shortfall penalty payable by a taxpayer under any of sections 141A to 141EB must be reduced if and to the extent that the tax shortfall is temporary. (2) The level by which a shortfall penalty is to be reduced for a temporary tax shortfall is 75% of the penalty that applies to all or that part of the tax shortfall that is a temporary tax shortfall. ... The application of section 141J 7.9 A shortfall penalty payable by the taxpayer, for example, under section 141A (for not taking reasonable care), may qualify to be reduced under sections 141G (for making a voluntary disclosure in accordance with this provision) and also under section 141I (if the shortfall penalty is payable in respect of a 32 temporary shortfall). Therefore, it appears that these provisions have the potential to provide for a 75% reduction under section 141G and also a 75% reduction under section 141I. However, in this situation, section 141J limits the reductions available for the taxpayer. Section 141J provides: 141J. Limitation on reduction of shortfall penalty— If— (a) A taxpayer who is liable to pay a shortfall penalty makes a voluntary disclosure in accordance with section 141G or section 141H; and (b) The shortfall penalty is payable in respect of a temporary tax shortfall,— the shortfall penalty— (c) Is to be reduced only once; and (d) Will be reduced by 75%. \[emphasis added\] 7.10 Accordingly, where a taxpayer may qualify for their shortfall penalty payable under section 141A to be reduced under more than one of the reduction provisions, section 141J provides that the shortfall penalty will be reduced only once and, as set out in section 141J(d), that reduction will be 75%. 7.11 As section 141J provides for a limitation on some shortfall penalty reductions, this section can only effectively apply after the application of the reduction provisions. Shortfall penalty monetary cap 7.12 Section 141JAA provides that “a shortfall penalty payable by a taxpayer for not taking reasonable care ..., may not be more than $50,000”, provided the other conditions of the section are met. The section states: (1) Despite section 141J, a shortfall penalty payable by a taxpayer for not taking reasonable care, or for taking an unacceptable tax position, may not be more than $50,000 if the taxpayer voluntarily discloses the shortfall, or the Commissioner determines the shortfall, no later than the date that is the later of— ... 7.13 It is noted that, unlike sections 141FB, 141G and 141I, section 141JAA does not actually “reduce” the penalty. It merely provides that the penalty may not be more than $50,000. The only way in which it can be determined that the penalty would otherwise be more than $50,000 is to work through the sections needed to calculate the shortfall penalty payable. Therefore, it is necessary to consider section 141A, under which the penalty originates, and then apply the reduction provisions, as modified by section 141J. 7.14 It is also noted that although section 141JAA refers to “a shortfall penalty payable by the taxpayer for not taking reasonable care”, the section does not specifically refer to section 141A, the provision under which this shortfall penalty originates. 33 7.15 This contrasts with the terminology used in the reduction provisions, which specifically refers to the shortfall penalty payable under the relevant originating section. (For the present discussion, the originating sections are sections 141A to 141EB, but, as noted above, section 141JAA is applicable only to shortfall penalties that originate from sections 141A and 141B.) 7.16 It is considered that this difference in the terminology supports the view that the shortfall penalty payable by the taxpayer, to which section 141JAA applies, is that payable under the originating provision, but reduced by the applicable reduction provisions. Accordingly, it would be not be appropriate for section 141JAA to refer to the penalty payable under section 141A when the penalty that originated under that provision may have been reduced by the application of the reduction provisions. 7.17 Although the use of “despite” at the beginning of section 141JAA could indicate that section 141JAA is to be applied either “after applying” section 141J or “to the exclusion of” section 141J, it is considered that, in the context of the whole of section 141, section 141JAA should not be applied to the exclusion of section 141J, but after section 141J (in situations where the application of section 141J is appropriate). Therefore, it would follow that section 141JAA should also be applied after the reduction provisions. 7.18 The alphanumeric order of the particular provisions also supports the view that section 141JAA should be applied after the application of the reduction provisions. Although not conclusive in itself, it is considered that, had it been intended that the capping provision of section 141JAA be applied before the reduction sections, the capping provision would have been inserted in a location before the reduction provisions. 7.19 Accordingly, it is considered that it is only by applying the reduction provisions first, that the “shortfall penalty payable”, to which section 141JAA refers, can be determined. The application of section 141JAA can then provide a cap to the shortfall penalty, if the time requirements of section 141JAA are met. 7.20 A final point to consider, in this respect, is the reason for setting the cap for these penalties at $50,000 under section 141JAA. The discussion document Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review (2001) states: 8.35 A monetary cap on the shortfall penalty for lack of reasonable care will be introduced. Such a cap would ensure that the penalty for such breaches is not out of step with other monetary penalties imposed under the Tax Administration Act. In addition, a cap is likely to reduce compliance and administrative costs as taxpayers will have less incentive to dispute the imposition of a penalty they consider unfair. 8.36 The cap will be set at $50,000 per tax position, which equates to the maximum criminal penalty imposed under the Income Tax Act. Taxpayers who deliberately attempt to abuse the existence of this cap will risk incurring the uncapped gross carelessness penalty (set at 40 percent of the shortfall). To ensure that taxpayers still have an incentive to take reasonable care over very significant tax positions, the cap will be limited to 34 those shortfalls identified through voluntary disclosure or Inland Revenue audit within two months of filing the return. \[emphasis added\] 7.21 Accordingly, if section 141JAA was applied before the other reduction provisions, the correspondence with the maximum criminal penalty would be defeated. Section 141JAA applies after the reduction provisions 7.22 It is considered that the shortfall penalties payable by the taxpayer for not taking reasonable care under section 141A are reduced, as applicable by the reduction provisions, before the application of section 141JAA. It is also considered that section 141JAA is applied after the application of section 141J, if the taxpayer is eligible for deductions under section 141G and also section 141I. Accordingly, under the reduction provisions, the shortfall penalty payable by the taxpayer for not taking reasonable care or for taking an unacceptable tax position is to be reduced by a maximum of 75%. Then, if section 141JAA is also applicable, the resultant shortfall penalty payable for not taking reasonable care may not be more than $50,000 if the taxpayer either voluntarily discloses the shortfall or the Commissioner determines the shortfall within the given time periods. 7.23 This view also means that the intended correspondence of the capped shortfall penalty under section 141JAA with the maximum criminal penalty is maintained. 7.24 Therefore, it is the Commissioner’s view that the section 141JAA cap of $50,000, on the shortfall penalty payable by a taxpayer for not taking reasonable care is only applicable after all other relevant reductions have been made, including the limiting provision of section 141J. 7.25 It should be noted that section 141JAA also applies to shortfall penalties under section 141B, for taking an unacceptable tax position. This is discussed in the Interpretation Statement IS0055. Section 141JAA provides 7.26 Prima facie, there are two situations when the shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care may not be more than $50,000. These are: • if the taxpayer voluntarily discloses the shortfall; or • the Commissioner determines the shortfall, provided these events occur within the time constraints set out in section 141JAA (1)(a) and (b). 7.27 “Commissioner” is defined in section 3 as meaning: “Commissioner of Inland Revenue”, or “Commissioner”, means the Commissioner of Inland Revenue appointed or deemed to have been appointed under 35 this Act; and includes any person for the time being authorised to exercise or perform any of the powers, duties, or functions of the Commissioner: 7.28 Accordingly, in the clause “the Commissioner determines the shortfall”, it is considered that “Commissioner” (i.e. the person who determines the shortfall) includes any person for the time being authorised to exercise or perform any of the powers, duties or functions of the Commissioner. 7.29 Before going on to consider the meaning of “determines” in this context, it is helpful to consider what it is that must be determined, i.e. “the shortfall”. What is “the shortfall”? 7.30 In the context of section 141JAA, it is considered that “the shortfall”, that the Commissioner determines, refers to “the tax shortfall”, as it is only in respect of a tax shortfall that the shortfall penalties, referred to in section 141JAA, apply. “Tax shortfall” is defined in section 3 of the Act as follows: “Tax shortfall”, for a return period, means the difference between the tax effect of— (a) A taxpayer's tax position for the return period; and (b) The correct tax position for that period,— when the taxpayer's tax position results in too little tax paid or payable by the taxpayer or another person or overstates a tax benefit, credit, or advantage of any type or description whatever by or benefiting (as the case may be) the taxpayer or another person: 7.31 A tax shortfall indicates that there is a difference between the correct tax position and the taxpayer’s tax position. Therefore, it is considered that if “the Commissioner determines the shortfall”; the Commissioner determines the difference between the correct tax position and the taxpayer’s tax position. As the difference is between two amounts, it is considered that section 141JAA requires the Commissioner to determine the amount of the tax shortfall. 7.32 An examination of the sections, under which a taxpayer becomes liable to pay a shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care or for taking an unacceptable tax position, supports this view. 7.33 Section 141A(1) provides that a taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty, if the taking of the tax position without reasonable care results in a tax shortfall: A taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty if the taxpayer does not take reasonable care in taking a taxpayer's tax position (referred to as “not taking reasonable care’) and the taking of that tax position by that taxpayer results in a tax shortfall. \[emphasis added\] 7.34 Section 141A(2) provides that the amount of the penalty payable is a percentage of the resulting tax shortfall: (2) The penalty payable for not taking reasonable care is 20% of the resulting tax shortfall. \[emphasis added\] 36 7.35 Section 141B(4) provides similarly in respect of unacceptable tax position. 7.36 Therefore, for the two shortfall penalty situations to which section 141JAA applies, the penalty payable by the taxpayer only arises if there is a tax shortfall and the amount of the shortfall penalty payable is directly proportional to the amount of the tax shortfall in each case. Accordingly, for a shortfall penalty to be payable by a taxpayer for not taking reasonable care or for taking an unacceptable tax position, it is necessary to identify the amount of the tax shortfall. 7.37 This is also supported by the definition of “shortfall penalty” in section 3, which states: “Shortfall penalty” means a penalty imposed under any of sections 141A to 141K for taking an incorrect tax position or for doing or failing to do anything specified or described in those sections. 7.38 For a penalty to be “imposed”, the penalty must be quantified and, as the amount is a percentage of the tax shortfall, it is necessary that the tax shortfall is quantified. 7.39 Therefore, it follows that for section 141JAA to apply to “a shortfall penalty ... payable by a taxpayer for not taking reasonable care or for taking an unacceptable tax position”, the amount of the tax shortfall is quantified either by disclosure by the taxpayer or as the Commissioner determines. Ordinary meaning of “determines” 7.40 As “determines” is not defined in section 3 of the Act or section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, it is appropriate to consider the ordinary meaning of the word. 7.41 The Shorter Oxford Dictionary 5 th ed (2002) provides the following relevant definition: determine: verb trans 4 settle or decide ( a dispute, controversy, etc., or a sentence, conclusion, issue, etc.) as a judge or arbiter 7.42 Using this definition, it appears that, in the context of section 141JAA, when “the Commissioner determines the shortfall”, the Commissioner makes a decision about the shortfall or decides the shortfall. Typically, the Commissioner would decide the shortfall as a result of an audit, but the means by which “the Commissioner determines the shortfall” are not defined in the legislation. Interpretation of “determines” by the courts 7.43 The meaning of “determines” was discussed by the Supreme Court of Victoria in City of Heidelberg v McPherson \[1964\] VR 783. The relevant section in that case used the words “... where any council determines that the execution of any works of the construction of a private street is necessary”. Although 37 the provision is different, it is helpful to note that the Court described the meaning of “determines” as “decides or forms the opinion” (p 785). 7.44 In Muir v Inland Revenue Commissioners \[1966\] 3 All ER 38, the English Court of Appeal considered the meaning of the phrase: An appeal, once determined by the commissioners, shall be final, and neither the determination of the commissioners nor the assessment made thereon shall be altered, except ... (s. 50 (2) Income Tax Act 1952) 7.45 The court held that: It is plain that there the words “determined” and “determination” are equivalent to: decided and decision ... (p 48) 7.46 Although referring to the word in the past tense, this view mirrors that of the Australian court in the City of Heidelberg case: to determine is to decide. This meaning is consistent with the ordinary meaning of “determine”, i.e. “settle or decide as a judge or arbiter”. In each case, something is decided by the party who is determining it. 7.47 To consider the application of this meaning in the context of the legislation, it is appropriate to consider some of the background to the introduction of section 141JAA. Background to the introduction of section 141JAA 7.48 Section 141JAA was inserted in the Act by the enactment of the Taxation (Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003. 7.49 As part of the preliminary consultation process prior to enactment of the Taxation (Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003, a discussion document, Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review (August 2001) was issued for comment. Under Chapter 8 of the document, “Two further issues relating to shortfall penalties”, the document outlined the following background and proposed reform: Additional issue: A cap on the penalty for lack of reasonable care Background 8.33 Where a tax shortfall is large, the corresponding shortfall penalty is also large. In most cases this is appropriate – but the Government is concerned about the application of the lack of reasonable care penalty to very large errors which are speedily identified and corrected. For example, a business taxpayer under calculated their GST outputs by $45 million and, because no systems were in place to identify this shortfall, the under-calculation results in unpaid GST of $5 million. Inland Revenue identities the shortfall and determines a lack of reasonable care: the penalty is $1 million. 8.34 Given the nature of the breach, the Government considered the size of the penalty in such cases is excessive. 38 Proposed reform 8.35 A monetary cap on the shortfall penalty for lack of reasonable care will be introduced. Such a cap would ensure that the penalty for such breaches is not out of step with other monetary penalties imposed under the Tax Administration Act. In addition, a cap is likely to reduce compliance and administrative costs as taxpayers will have less incentive to dispute the imposition of a penalty they consider unfair. 8.36 The cap will be set at $50,000 per tax position, which equates to the maximum criminal penalty imposed under the Income Tax Act. Taxpayers who deliberately attempt to abuse the existence of this cap will risk incurring the uncapped gross carelessness penalty (set at 40 percent of the shortfall). To ensure that taxpayers still have an incentive to take reasonable care over very significant tax positions, the cap will be limited to those shortfalls identified through voluntary disclosure or Inland Revenue audit within two months of filing the return. \[emphasis added\] 7.50 From the discussion document, it appears that the intention of the proposed reform was that the cap would be limited to tax shortfalls identified through voluntary disclosure or Inland Revenue audit, within the required time limit. Timing of “determines” 7.51 It is noted that no reference was made in the proposal for the legislation requiring either a NOPA to be issued or for an agreed adjustment to be obtained, before the $50,000 monetary cap be applied to the shortfall penalty payable by the taxpayer. Further, a NOPA is the first step in the disputes resolution process and the imposition of the penalty will not necessarily be a matter which proceeds under the disputes resolution process. Therefore, it is not appropriate to equate the word “determines” with “has issued a NOPA”. 7.52 For similar reasons, “the Commissioner determines” cannot relate to the decision of Adjudication (or other assessing officer), at the end of the disputes resolution process, as the time limits in the disputes resolution process for the various documents are such that this process could not be completed within the time set out in section 141JAA. It is also inappropriate to require an adjustment to be agreed by the taxpayer within the time limits set out in section 141JAA, as the taxpayer has a statutory right to dispute or challenge their assessment in accordance with the time limits set out in the disputes resolution process. Further, section 141JAA refers to “determines” in the context of the situation where “the Commissioner determines the tax shortfall”. Therefore, on the legislation, it appears that once the Commissioner (or one of his authorised officers) decides that there is a relevant tax shortfall within the time limits set out in the section, the cap applies. 7.53 This view is supported by the fact that the legislation provides for no particular process by which the Commissioner communicates the fact to the taxpayer that a shortfall is “determined” or decided within the terms of section 141JAA. The legislation merely requires that either the voluntary disclosure of a shortfall by the taxpayer within the time limits (for which a penalty in excess 39 of $50,000 is payable by the taxpayer for not taking reasonable care), or the Commissioner deciding that there is such a shortfall within the time limits, is sufficient for the application of the section. Conclusion 7.54 Section 141JAA was enacted with the intention of recognising the taxpayer who voluntarily discloses a shortfall within the given time limits or for whom the Commissioner decides that there is a relevant shortfall, within the given time limits. This latter case may occur, for example, in an audit where an investigator identifies a relevant tax shortfall. The essence is that, for the monetary cap to apply, the relevant tax shortfall is either disclosed by the taxpayer within the time limits or a person, authorised by the Commissioner, decides that there is a relevant tax shortfall, within the time limits. The section does not require the Commissioner to issue a NOPA in respect of the tax shortfall or obtain an agreed adjustment within the given time limits. Accordingly, it is considered that the taxpayer should benefit from the monetary cap as soon as the Commissioner (as defined in section 3) decides the amount of the shortfall, if the time requirements of section 141JAA are met and section 141K does not apply. Shortfall penalty increases 7.55 Section 141K provides for an increased penalty where the taxpayer obstructs the Commissioner. Section 141JAA does not apply if section 141K applies. Section 141K states: 141K. Increased penalty for obstruction— (1) A shortfall penalty payable by a taxpayer under any of sections 141A to 141EB may be increased by the Commissioner if the taxpayer obstructs the Commissioner in determining the correct tax position in respect of the taxpayer's tax liabilities. (2) The level by which a shortfall penalty may be increased for obstruction is 25%. Related Standard Practice Statements 7.56 The following related Standard Practice Statements may also assist in the interpretation and application of the above adjustment provisions to the shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care: • INV-231 Temporary Shortfall – permanent reversal (published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 11, No 8 (September 1999)); • INV-251 Voluntary Disclosures (published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 14, No 4 (April 2002)); • INV-260 Notification of a Pending Audit or Investigation (published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 2 (February 2000)); and • INV-295 Reduction of Shortfall Penalties for Previous Behaviour (published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 16, No 3 (April 2004)). 40
SHORTFALL PENALTY – UNACCEPTABLE INTERPRETATION AND UNACCEPTABLE TAX POSITION 1. SUMMARY 1.1 All legislative references in this statement are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 unless otherwise noted. 1.2 The Taxation (Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003 amended section 141B with effect from 1 April 2003. This Interpretation Statement sets out the Commissioner’s view on shortfall penalties imposed under section 141B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“the TAA”) for an “unacceptable interpretation” of a tax law in relation to a tax position taken by a taxpayer (applicable before 1 April 2003) and an “unacceptable tax position” taken by a taxpayer on or after 1 April 2003. 1.3 As the law before the 2003 amendment remains relevant to taxpayers who are or may become involved in the dispute resolution process for tax positions taken prior to 1 April 2003, the Commissioner’s view on the earlier provision relating to “unacceptable interpretation” will be considered first. It is considered appropriate that the statement is ordered in this way, as not only is there greater interpretative difficulty associated with the previous provision, but it is considered that a number of the interpretative issues addressed, in respect of the previous provision, apply to the current provision. 1.4 This Interpretation Statement covers particularly: • what is an unacceptable tax position; • can a mistake of fact lead to an unacceptable interpretation; • the meaning of the test “about as likely as not to be correct”; and • what are the changes relevant to a taxpayer’s tax position taken on or after 1 April 2003? 1.5 In summary, the conclusions of this Interpretation Statement for tax positions taken before 1 April 2003 are: 1. An “interpretation” involves a person formulating an understanding or explanation of something and the person must have turned his or her mind to a tax law before an interpretation of it can be said to be made. 2. Section 141B relates to the understanding and application of a tax law by the taxpayer to a set of facts. 3. A simple mistake is neither an application nor an interpretation of a tax law. 4. A mistake of law may be based on a mistake of fact but, on the facts, there may also be an unacceptable interpretation. 1 5. Where a tax shortfall is caused by a mistake of fact and there is no interpretation or application of a tax law, a taxpayer might still be liable, under section 141A, for “not taking reasonable care”. 6. A tax agent’s interpretation will be imputed to the taxpayer where the agent, who completes the taxpayer’s tax return, takes the tax position on the taxpayer’s behalf. 7. The non-application of a tax law will be an “interpretation or an interpretation of an application of a tax law”, if a taxpayer turned his or her mind to whether or not that tax law applied to a particular factual situation. 8. There must be, at least, about an equal chance of an interpretation being likely to be correct as it is to be incorrect. The use of the word “about” makes the test less stringent but the interpretation still needs to be close to or around 50% likely to be correct. 9. In determining whether an unacceptable interpretation has been taken in arriving at a tax position, matters that must be considered include all Court or Tribunal decisions and relevant extrinsic materials issued up to one month before the tax position has been taken. 10. Before section 141B applies, the tax shortfall must exceed the given threshold. 1.6 In summary, the conclusions of the interpretation statement in respect of the changes to section 141B, that relate to tax positions taken on or after 1 April 2003 are: 1. The making of an “interpretation or an interpretation of an application of a tax law” is not longer required for the application of section 141B. 2. To take an unacceptable tax position, a taxpayer is required merely to take a tax position that, when viewed objectively, fails to meet the standard of being about as likely as not to be correct. 3. An unacceptable interpretation of the law can give rise to an unacceptable tax position, but is no longer a requirement of section 141B. 4. The threshold levels, which a tax shortfall must exceed to qualify as an unacceptable tax position, have increased. 5. Penalties of 20% may be reduced to 10% as a result of a taxpayer’s prior good compliance. 6. In the Commissioner’s view, section 141JAA, which provides for the penalty payable to be capped in some situations, is only applicable after all other reductions have been made. 2 2. BACKGROUND 2.1 Section 139 of the TAA states that the purpose of Part IX - Penalties is to encourage taxpayers to comply voluntarily with their tax obligations, ensure that penalties for breaches of tax obligations are imposed impartially and consistently and to sanction non-compliance with tax obligations effectively and at a level that is proportionate to the seriousness of the breach. This Interpretation Statement deals with the situation where a penalty is imposed because there is a shortfall of the taxpayer’s tax obligations as a result of the taxpayer’s tax position based on an “unacceptable interpretation” or an “unacceptable tax position”, as provided for under section 141B. 2.2 Section 141B provides for a shortfall penalty (defined in section 3(1) TAA): “Shortfall penalty” means a penalty imposed under any of sections 141A to 141K for taking an incorrect tax position or for doing or failing to do anything specified or described in those sections: 2.3 Section 141B(1) defines what is meant by “an unacceptable interpretation” in relation to a “tax position” taken by a taxpayer. Before the Taxation (Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003 significantly amended section 141B in relation to tax positions taken on or after 1 April 2003, the provision applicable to obligations relating to the 1997/98 and subsequent income years and to dutiable periods commencing on or after 1 April 1997 read: 141B UNACCEPTABLE INTERPRETATION (1) In relation to a tax position taken by a taxpayer, an unacceptable interpretation— (a) Is an interpretation or an interpretation of an application of a tax law; and (b) Viewed objectively, that interpretation or application fails to meet the standard of being about as likely as not to be correct. 2.4 The amended provision, as a result of the Taxation (Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003, is applicable to tax positions taken on or after 1 April 2003. The amended section 141B(1) reads: 141B UNACCEPTABLE TAX POSITION (1) A taxpayer takes an unacceptable tax position if, viewed objectively, the tax position fails to meet the standard of being about as likely as not to be correct. (1B) A taxpayer does not take an unacceptable tax position merely by making a mistake in the calculation or recording of numbers in a return. 2.5 A comparison of section 141B, both before and after the 2003 amendment, highlights that, despite some fundamental similarities, the application of these provisions may differ for the same set of facts. The earlier provision defines “unacceptable interpretation” as “an interpretation or an interpretation of an application of a tax law” and sets out the test by which to judge the interpretation or application as unacceptable. In contrast, the amended provision refers to neither an interpretation nor an application but merely sets out the test by which the tax position of the taxpayer is judged unacceptable. The amended provision, section 141B(1B), also exempts some mistakes from 3 being considered “unacceptable tax positions”. Whether a tax shortfall is due to a mistake in the calculation or recording of numbers will depend on the facts in each case. 2.6 Common to section 141B both before and after the 2003 amendment are the preliminary requirements that the taxpayer must have taken a tax position from which a tax shortfall arises and that tax shortfall exceeds the thresholds set out in section 141B(2). If any of these elements are unable to be established, the taxpayer will not be liable for any shortfall penalty under section 141B. 3. LEGISLATION Tax Administration Act 1994 3.1 The Taxation (Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003 amended a number of provisions relating to “Unacceptable Interpretation”. The provisions set out below are as they read prior to the passing of that Act. These are followed by the amended provisions. Legislation relating to tax positions taken before 1 April 2003 3.2 Section 3(1) provides a definition for “tax position”: “Tax position” means a position or approach with regard to tax possible under one or more tax laws, including without limitation— (a) A liability for an amount of tax, or the payment of an amount of tax: (b) An obligation to deduct or withhold an amount of tax, or the deduction or withholding of an amount of tax: (c) A right to a tax refund, or to claim or not to claim a tax refund: (d) A right to a credit of tax, or to claim or not to claim a credit of tax: (e) The provision of a tax return, or the non-provision of a tax return: (f) The derivation of an amount of gross income or exempt income or a capital gain, or the inclusion or non-inclusion of an amount in gross income: (g) The incurring of an amount of expenditure or loss, or the allowing or disallowing as a deduction of an amount of expenditure or loss: (h) The availability of net losses, or the offsetting or use of net losses: (i) The attaching of a credit of tax, or the receipt of or lack of entitlement to receive a credit of tax: (j) The balance of a tax account of any type or description, or a debit or credit to such a tax account: (k) The estimation of the provisional tax payable. (l) Whether the taxpayer must request an income statement or respond to an income statement issued by the Commissioner: (m) The application of section 33A(1): (n) A right to a rebate: 3.3 Section 141B imposes a shortfall penalty on taxpayers who take an “unacceptable interpretation”: 4 141B UNACCEPTABLE INTERPRETATION 141B(1) In relation to a tax position taken by a taxpayer, an unacceptable interpretation— (a) Is an interpretation or an interpretation of an application of a tax law; and (b) Viewed objectively, that interpretation or application fails to meet the standard of being about as likely as not to be correct. 141B(2) A taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty if— (a) The taxpayer's tax position involves an unacceptable interpretation of a tax law; and (b) The tax shortfall arising from the taxpayer's tax position exceeds both— (i) $10,000; and (ii) The lesser of $200,000 and one percent of the taxpayer's total tax figure for the relevant return period. 141B(3) For the purposes of this section, a taxpayer's total tax figure is— (a) The amount of tax paid or payable by the taxpayer in respect of the return period for which the taxpayer takes the taxpayer's tax position before, in the case of income tax, any group offset election or subvention payment; or (b) Where the taxpayer has no tax to pay in respect of the return period— (i) Except in the case of GST, an amount equal to the product of— (A) The net loss of a taxpayer in respect of the return period, ascertained in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994, are to be used in this subsection as if they had a positive value; and (B) The basic rate of income tax for companies in the relevant return period; or (ii) In the case of GST, the refund of tax to which the taxpayer is entitled for the return period,— that is shown as tax paid or payable, or as net losses of the taxpayer, or as a refund to which the taxpayer is entitled, in a tax return provided by the taxpayer for the return period. 141B(4) Where subsection (2) applies, the shortfall penalty payable is 20% of the resulting tax shortfall. 141B(5) For the purposes of this section, the question whether any interpretation of a tax law is acceptable or unacceptable shall be determined as at the time at which the taxpayer takes the taxpayer's tax position. 141B(6) For tax positions involving an interpretation of a tax law or laws that have been taken into account in a tax return, the time the taxpayer takes the taxpayer's tax position is when the taxpayer provides the return containing the taxpayer's tax position. If the taxpayer does not provide a tax return for a return period, the taxpayer takes the taxpayer's tax position on the due date for providing the tax return. 141B(7) The matters that must be considered in determining whether the tax position taken by a taxpayer involves an unacceptable interpretation of a tax law include— 5 (a) The actual or potential application to the tax position of all the tax laws that are relevant (including specific or general anti-avoidance provisions); and (b) Decisions of a court or a Taxation Review Authority on the interpretation of tax laws that are relevant (unless the decision was issued up to one month before the taxpayer takes the taxpayer's tax position). 141B(8) For the purpose of determining whether the resulting tax shortfall is in excess of the amounts specified in subsection (2)(b),— (a) A tax return provided by— (i) A partnership; or (ii) Any other group of persons that derive or incur amounts jointly or that are assessed together,— is to be treated as if it were a tax return of every taxpayer who is a partner in the partnership or person in such group; and (b) The tax rate in a return period applying to a partnership is deemed to be the same as the basic rate of income tax for companies for the relevant period. 141B(9) The amounts or the percentage specified in subsection (2) may be varied from time to time by the Governor-General by Order in Council. Legislation relating to tax positions taken on or after 1 April 2003 3.4 For tax positions taken on or after 1 April 2003, section 141B has the revised heading “Unacceptable Tax Position”. In this amended provision, the references to “interpretation” and “application” are largely removed and the monetary limits for tax shortfalls, above which a taxpayer is liable for a shortfall penalty, are increased. 141B UNACCEPTABLE TAX POSITION (1) A taxpayer takes an unacceptable tax position if, viewed objectively, the tax position fails to meet the standard of being about as likely as not to be correct. (1B) A taxpayer does not take an unacceptable tax position merely by making a mistake in the calculation or recording of numbers in a return. (2) A taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty if the taxpayer takes an unacceptable tax position and the tax shortfall arising from the taxpayer’s tax position is more than both— (a) $20,000; and (b) the lesser of $250,000 and 1% of the taxpayer’s total tax figure for the relevant return period. ... (5) For the purposes of this section, the question whether any interpretation of a tax law is acceptable or unacceptable shall be determined as at the time at which the taxpayer takes the taxpayer's tax position. ... (7) The matters that must be considered in determining whether the taxpayer has taken an unacceptable tax position include— (a) The actual or potential application to the tax position of all the tax laws that are relevant (including specific or general anti-avoidance provisions); and 6 (b) Decisions of a court or a Taxation Review Authority on the interpretation of tax laws that are relevant (unless the decision was issued up to one month before the taxpayer takes the taxpayer's tax position). ... 3.5 Section 141JAA provides that for tax positions taken on or after 1 April 2003, subject to certain requirements, there is a cap of $50,000 on the penalty for taking an unacceptable tax position: 141JAA SHORTFALL PENALTY FOR NOT TAKING REASONABLE CARE OR FOR TAKING UNACCEPTABLE TAX POSITION MAY NOT BE MORE THAN $50,000 (1) Despite section 141J, a shortfall penalty payable by a taxpayer for not taking reasonable care, or for taking an unacceptable tax position, may not be more than $50,000 if the taxpayer voluntarily discloses the shortfall, or the Commissioner determines the shortfall, no later than the date that is the later of – (a) the date that is 3 months after the due date of the return to which the shortfall relates; and (b) the date that follows the due date of the return to which the shortfall relates by the lesser of – (i) 1 return period; and (ii) 6 months (2) This section does not apply if section 141K applies. 3.6 Amendments to the definitions in section 3 include a revision to the definition of “tax position”. The revised definition omits “possible” after “regard to tax” and inserts “a position or approach with regard to”. The revised part of this definition is set out below. The remainder of the definition is otherwise unchanged to that set out above and applicable before the 2003 amendment. “Tax position” means a position or approach with regard to tax under one or more tax laws, including without limitation a position or approach with regard to — ... 3.7 The amended section 3 also provides definitions for “unacceptable tax position” and “acceptable tax position” applicable on or after 1 April 2003 and repeals the definition of “acceptable interpretation”: “unacceptable tax position” is defined in section 141B. “acceptable tax position” means a tax position that is not an unacceptable tax position. 3.8 Section 141FB provides for a reduction of penalties in some circumstances. The following legislation was effective 26 March 2003 until 21 December 2004 with application to a tax position that a taxpayer took on or after 1 April 2000 unless the taxpayer was liable, before 26 March 2003, to pay a shortfall penalty for taking the tax position. The relevant parts of section 141FB, effective 26 March 2003 until 21 December 2004, state: 7 141FB REDUCTION OF PENALTIES FOR PREVIOUS BEHAVIOUR ... (2) A shortfall penalty payable by a taxpayer under any of sections 141A to 141D (called in this section the current penalty) is reduced to 50% of the penalty that would otherwise be payable under those sections if, after the date specified in subsection (3) and before the date on which the taxpayer becomes liable for the current penalty, the taxpayer has not been liable to pay a shortfall penalty that – (a) Related to the same type of tax as does the current penalty; and (b) If the current penalty is for – (i) Evasion or a similar act, was for evasion or a similar act; (ii) Gross carelessness or taking an abusive tax position, was for evasion or a similar act or for gross carelessness or for taking an abusive tax position (iii) Not taking reasonable care or taking an unacceptable tax position, was a shortfall penalty; and (c) Was not reduced for voluntary disclosure by the taxpayer; and (d) Was eligible for a reduction under this subsection. (3) The date referred to in subsection (2) precedes the date on which the taxpayer becomes liable for the current penalty by: (a) 2 years, if the current penalty relates to the taxpayer’s application of the PAYE rules, to fringe benefit tax, to goods and services tax, to resident withholding tax; or (b) 4 years, if the current penalty relates to any other type of tax. (4) For the purpose of subsection (2), if a taxpayer is liable for shortfall penalties that relate to tax shortfalls of which the Commissioner becomes aware as a consequence of a single investigation or voluntary disclosure, all the shortfall penalties are treated as a single combined penalty. \[emphasis from original text\] 3.9 However, effective 21 December 2004, section 141FB was replaced. The relevant parts of the replacement section state: 141FB. Reduction of penalties for previous behaviour— ... (2) A shortfall penalty (called the “current penalty”) for which a taxpayer is liable under any of sections 141A to 141D is reduced, to 50% of the amount that would be payable by the taxpayer in the absence of this section, if the taxpayer is not— (a) convicted of an offence that is a disqualifying offence: (b) liable for another shortfall penalty that is a disqualifying penalty for the purpose of this subsection. (3) For the purpose of this section “disqualifying offence” means— (a) an offence under section 143A, 143B, 143F, 143G, 143H or 145 for which a conviction is entered— (i) on or after 26 March 2003; and (ii) before the taxpayer takes the tax position to which the current penalty relates: 8 (b) an offence under section 143 or 144 that relates to the type of tax to which the current penalty relates and for which a conviction is entered— (i) on or after 26 March 2003; and (ii) after the date that precedes, by the period specified in subsection (4), the date on which the taxpayer takes the tax position to which the current penalty relates; and (iii) before the taxpayer takes the tax position to which the current penalty relates “disqualifying penalty” means— ... (b) for the purpose of subsection (2), a shortfall penalty that— (i) relates to the type of tax to which the current penalty relates; and (ii) if the current penalty is— (A) for gross carelessness or taking an abusive tax position, is a shortfall penalty for evasion or a similar act or for gross carelessness or taking an abusive tax position: (B) for not taking reasonable care or taking an unacceptable tax position, is a shortfall penalty of any sort; and (iii) is not reduced for voluntary disclosure by the taxpayer; and (iv) relates to a tax position that is taken— (A) on or after 26 March 2003; and (B) after the date that precedes, by the period specified in subsection (4), the date on which the taxpayer takes the tax position to which the current penalty relates; and (C) before the date on which the taxpayer takes the tax position to which the current penalty relates. (4) The period referred to in the definitions of “disqualifying offence” and “disqualifying penalty”, in subsection (3), and in subsection (5) is— (a) 2 years, if the current penalty relates to— (i) the taxpayer's application of the PAYE rules: (ii) fringe benefit tax: (iii) goods and services tax: (iv) resident withholding tax: (b) 4 years, if the period is not given by paragraph (a). (5) For the purpose of subsections (1) and (2), a shortfall penalty that relates to a tax shortfall arising from a tax position taken by a taxpayer is determined as if the taxpayer were not liable for a shortfall penalty that relates to a tax shortfall arising from another tax position taken by the taxpayer, if— (a) the Commissioner becomes aware of both tax shortfalls as a consequence of a single investigation or voluntary disclosure; and (b) the taxpayer— 9 (i) takes both tax positions on the same date: (ii) is not liable for a shortfall penalty at any time in the period specified in subsection (4) that ends on the earliest date on which the taxpayer takes a tax position that gives rise to a tax shortfall of which the Commissioner becomes aware as a consequence of the investigation or disclosure to which paragraph (a) refers. \[emphasis from original text\] 4. AN UNACCEPTABLE INTERPRETATION - BEFORE 1 APRIL 2003 4.1 Before the amendment to section 141B was enacted in 2003, the section was entitled “Unacceptable interpretation” and the section provided the definition for “unacceptable interpretation”. This is set out again below for convenience: (1) In relation to a tax position taken by a taxpayer, an unacceptable interpretation— (a) Is an interpretation or an interpretation of an application of a tax law; and (b) Viewed objectively, that interpretation or application fails to meet the standard of being about as likely as not to be correct. 4.2 For there to be a penalty for an unacceptable interpretation: • the taxpayer must have taken a tax position; • a tax shortfall arises from that tax position; and • that tax shortfall exceeds the amount referred to in section 141B(2)(b). 4.3 These preliminary requirements were highlighted by Barber DCJ in Case U47 (2000) 19 NZTC 9,410: 34. In terms of considering whether there has been an “\[un\]acceptable interpretation” by the disputant \[taxpayer\] as required by s 141B(1), it is necessary in terms of s 141B(2) that the disputant \[taxpayer\] has taken a tax position, that there has been a tax shortfall arising from that tax position and that the tax shortfall exceeds the amounts referred to in s 141B(2)(b). (p 9,417) 4.4 If any of these elements are unable to be established, the taxpayer will not be liable for any shortfall penalty under section 141B for unacceptable interpretation. It is appropriate, therefore, to establish the Commissioner’s view on the meaning of each of these requirements. The preliminary requirements Tax position 4.5 In relation to the first requirement that a taxpayer must have taken a tax position, the “taxpayer’s tax position” must be determined, as it is from that tax position that any tax shortfall will be calculated. The terms “taxpayer’s tax position” and “tax position” are defined in section 3(1) of the TAA. These definitions are set out below. 10 4.6 The definition of “tax position” sets out the subject of the position or approach with regard to tax under a tax law that the taxpayer may take. The definition of “taxpayer’s tax position” sets out the places where the taxpayer takes a “tax position”. “Tax position” means a position or approach with regard to tax possible under one or more tax laws, including without limitation— (a) A liability for an amount of tax, or the payment of an amount of tax: (b) An obligation to deduct or withhold an amount of tax, or the deduction or withholding of an amount of tax: (c) A right to a tax refund, or to claim or not to claim a tax refund: (d) A right to a credit of tax, or to claim or not to claim a credit of tax: (e) The provision of a tax return, or the non-provision of a tax return: (f) The derivation of an amount of gross income or exempt income or a capital gain, or the inclusion or non-inclusion of an amount in gross income: (g) The incurring of an amount of expenditure or loss, or the allowing or disallowing as a deduction of an amount of expenditure or loss: (h) The availability of net losses, or the offsetting or use of net losses: (i) The attaching of a credit of tax, or the receipt of or lack of entitlement to receive a credit of tax: (j) The balance of a tax account of any type or description, or a debit or credit to such a tax account: (k) The estimation of the provisional tax payable. (l) Whether the taxpayer must request an income statement or respond to an income statement issued by the Commissioner: (m) The application of section 33A(1): (n) A right to a rebate: “Taxpayer’s tax position” means– (a) A tax position taken by a taxpayer in or in respect of– (i) A tax return; or (ii) An income statement; or (iii) A due date: ... 4.7 A “tax return” is defined, in section 3(1) of the TAA: “Tax return” means a form or document that a taxpayer is required by a tax law— (a) To complete; and (b) To provide to the Commissioner,— whether in electronic or written form and whether provided in respect of a period or not; and also includes a tax form issued by another taxpayer that the taxpayer provides to the Commissioner: 4.8 “Tax law” is defined in section 3(1) of the TAA: “Tax law” means– (a) A provision of the Inland Revenue Acts or an Act that an Inland Revenue Act replaces: (b) An Order in Council or a regulation made under another tax law: 11 (c) A non-disputable decision: (d) In relation to an obligation to provide a tax return or a tax form, also includes a provision of the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992 or a regulation made under that Act or the Accident Insurance Act 1998 or a regulation made under that Act or the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation, and Compensation Act 2001 or a regulation made under that Act:... 4.9 A tax return would include, for example, a GST return, being a form that the taxpayer is required by a tax law to complete and provide to the Commissioner. (Section 61B of the Goods and Services Act 1985 also provides that offences committed in relation to goods and services tax are subject to the shortfall penalties.) 4.10 Having determined where a taxpayer takes a tax position, what is a tax position? The definition of “tax position” is broad and inclusive “without limitation”. “Tax position” means a position or approach with regard to tax possible under one or more tax laws (refer definition above). A tax position and Case U47 4.11 In Case U47, Barber DCJ considered the question of when a tax position is taken. In this case, there was both an error of fact and an error of law in respect of a claim for a GST input tax deduction. The disputant, who was registered for GST on an invoice basis, entered into an agreement to purchase land for its own use. The vendor of the land was not GST registered. Therefore, the transaction should have been treated as the purchase of secondhand goods for GST purposes. 4.12 In addition, although the agreement provided for part of the purchase price to be paid in one GST period and the other part in the next GST period, the purchaser’s accountant’s employee, despite having no tax invoice for the transaction, prepared the purchaser’s GST return for the first period as if the whole purchase price had been paid. A GST input tax deduction based on the whole price was, therefore, claimed in the first period. This gave rise to an agreed tax shortfall that exceeded the threshold amounts for a shortfall penalty for “unacceptable interpretation” set out in section 141B(2). 4.13 Although the taxpayer claimed that the employee had not attempted to interpret the GST Act in a manner to put a different interpretation on it, the TRA held that, notwithstanding the employee may have never looked at the appropriate section of the GST Act, the employee was considered to have made an interpretation of the relevant tax laws. Barber DCJ held that, in filing the GST return for the first period and incorrectly claiming the GST input credit component for the whole sum, the taxpayer had taken a tax position. The tax agent’s interpretation of the tax law was imputed to the taxpayer. 4.14 In this case, the tax position was taken in a “tax return” as defined in the TAA, being the GST return required by tax law to be completed and provided to the Commissioner. 12 Tax shortfall 4.15 The second of the essential requirements for the application of section 141B is that there is a tax shortfall. “Tax shortfall” is defined in section 3(1) of the TAA as the tax effect of a taxpayer’s tax position for the return period and the correct tax position for that period when the taxpayer’s tax position results in too little tax being payable or a benefit being overstated to the advantage of the taxpayer or another person. The definition states: “Tax shortfall”, for a return period, means the difference between the tax effect of– (a) A taxpayer’s tax position for the return period; and (b) The correct tax position for that period,– when the taxpayer’s tax position results in too little tax paid or payable by the taxpayer or another person or overstates a tax benefit, credit, or advantage of any type or description whatever by or benefiting (as the case may be) the taxpayer or another person: 4.16 The tax position with which the taxpayer’s tax position is compared is the “correct tax position”. “Correct tax position” is also defined in section 3(1) of the TAA: “Correct tax position” means the correct tax position established under one or more tax laws: 4.17 In each case, therefore, the “correct tax position” in accordance with the tax laws and the “taxpayer’s tax position” are compared for a return period and if, for that return period, the tax effect of the difference results in too little tax being payable or a benefit being overstated for a return period, the difference is the tax shortfall for that period. 4.18 In short, the taxpayer’s tax shortfall will be established by a comparison of the tax liability as set out in the taxpayer’s return and the correct liability. Tax shortfall threshold 4.19 The third of the preliminary requirements to be established is that the tax shortfall must exceed the threshold amounts referred in section 141B(2)(b). In relation to tax position taken before 1 April 2003, the tax shortfall must exceed both: (i) $10,000; and (ii) The lesser of $200,000 and one percent of the taxpayer's total tax figure for the relevant return period. Total tax figure 4.20 “Total tax figure” is defined in section 141B(3): 141B(3) For the purposes of this section, a taxpayer’s total tax figure is - (a) The amount of tax paid or payable by the taxpayer in respect of the return period for which the taxpayer takes the taxpayer’s tax position before, in the case of income tax, any group offset election or subvention payment; or 13 (b) Where the taxpayer has no tax to pay in respect of the return period - (i) Except in the case of GST, an amount equal to the product of- (A) The net loss of a taxpayer in respect of the return period, ascertained in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994, are to be used in this subsection as if they had a positive value; and (B) The basic rate of income tax for companies in the relevant return period; or (ii) In the case of GST, the refund of tax to which the taxpayer is entitled for the return period, - that is shown as tax paid or payable, or as net losses of the taxpayer, or a refund to which the taxpayer is entitled, in a tax return provided by the taxpayer for the return period. \[emphasis added\] 4.21 Although the term “total tax figure” may suggest that the total tax figure is the correct tax figure for the relevant return period, the wording of section 141B(3)(a) (set out above), implies that the “total tax figure” is the figure of tax paid or payable according to the taxpayer’s return. This contrasts with the view that the use of “payable” might suggest that that figure is correct because it is the correct tax which is “payable”. 4.22 Bearing in mind that section 141B(6) broadly provides that a tax position is taken when the taxpayer provides the return, it could be that the return may show a figure for tax payable but the tax is not yet due until, for example, the terminal tax date. However, the figure remains payable according to the return. 4.23 This latter view is consistent with the concluding words of subsection 141B(3)(b) (set out again below) which qualify the whole provision. These concluding words apply to cover all possible shortfalls dealt with in section 141B, i.e., whether there is tax to pay, a loss, or a GST refund and they provide that the “total tax figure”: ... that is shown as tax paid or payable, or as net losses of the taxpayer, or as a refund to which the taxpayer is entitled, in a tax return provided by the taxpayer for the return period. \[emphasis added\] 4.24 The word “entitled” is used in both the concluding words of section 141B(3) and also in subsection (3)(ii) (set out above). In the context of the provision, the “entitlement” appears to refer to the figure or amount shown “in the tax return provided by the taxpayer for the return period”. 4.25 It is the Commissioner’s view that the total tax figure for the relevant return period, as required to establish a taxpayer’s tax shortfall under section 141B(2), is the figure shown as tax paid or payable, the net loss of the taxpayer multiplied by the basic rate of income tax or their GST refund entitlement, that the taxpayer has provided in the tax return for the period. 14 Returns by partnerships 4.26 Section 141B(8) applies where there are returns completed by a partnership or groups of persons. 141B(8) For the purpose of determining whether the resulting tax shortfall is in excess of the amounts specified in subsection (2)(b),— (a) A tax return provided by— (i) A partnership; or (ii) Any other group of persons that derive or incur amounts jointly or that are assessed together,— is to be treated as if it were a tax return of every taxpayer who is a partner in the partnership or person in such group; and (b) The tax rate in a return period applying to a partnership is deemed to be the same as the basic rate of income tax for companies for the relevant period. 4.27 The effect of section 141B(8) is that, in establishing whether a partnership or other like entity has exceeded the threshold set by section 141B(2)(b), the shortfall incurred by the partnership is considered against the partnership's income, treating the partnership as a separate entity. The company tax rate is to be used in any threshold calculations in accordance with section 141B(8)(b). The preliminary requirements are satisfied 4.28 Assuming that the preliminary requirements of section 141B(1) are satisfied, it is then appropriate to consider whether there has been an “unacceptable interpretation” in accordance with section 141B. What is an unacceptable interpretation? 4.29 Section 141B(1) defines an “unacceptable interpretation”: 141B(1) In relation to a tax position taken by a taxpayer, an unacceptable interpretation - (a) Is an interpretation or an interpretation of an application of a tax law; and (b) Viewed objectively, that interpretation or application fails to meet the standard of being about as likely as not to be correct. 4.30 An unacceptable interpretation under section 141B requires both of the above limbs to be satisfied. Under (a), for there to be an unacceptable interpretation, there must firstly be either an “interpretation” of a tax law or “an interpretation of an application of a tax law” and under (b), that interpretation or interpretation of an application of a tax law, when viewed objectively, must not satisfy the required standard of “being about as likely as not to be correct”. It is appropriate, therefore, to consider what is an interpretation of a tax law and what is an interpretation of an application of a tax law. 15 Interpretation of a tax law 4.31 The word “interpretation” is not defined in the Act. It is, therefore, necessary to consider other sources to ascertain its meaning. 4.32 The Oxford Companion to Law, by David M Walker, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1980 defines “interpretation or construction” as: The process of determining the meaning of a text, such as that of a statute, or deed or will, in the circumstances which are under consideration. 4.33 The New Shorter Oxford Dictionary on Historical Principles defines “interpretation” as follows: interpretation n 1 The action of explaining the meaning of something; spec. the proper explanation or signification of something ... 2 An explanation given; a way of explaining; (a) construction put upon an action etc. ... and the word “interpret” is given a similar meaning: interpret 1 Explain the meaning of... b Explain to oneself, understand. ... 2 Give a particular explanation of; explain or construe (an action etc.) in a specified manner. ... 3 Give the meaning or explanation of something; ... 4.34 The above definitions indicate that “interpretation” involves the formulation of an understanding or explanation of something, and that a person must have turned his or her mind in some way to that “something” before formulating such understanding or explanation. The meaning of interpretation as applied by the Courts 4.35 Prior to Case U47, the courts had not considered the meaning of “interpretation” in the context of the Act. The meaning of the term has, however, been considered in other contexts which may provide guidance for the present application. Wylie J in Shotter v Westpac Banking Corporation \[1988\] 2 NZLR 316 (HC) considered the term as it appeared in section 6(2)(a) of the Contractual Mistakes Act 1977. Section 6(2(a) of the Contractual Mistakes Act prevents relief under section 7 of that Act, if the mistake, made by a party to a contract, was a mistake in the “interpretation” of that contract. 4.36 Section 6(2)(a) of the Contractual Mistakes Act states: (2) For the purposes of an application for relief under section 7 of this Act in respect of any contract, - (a) A mistake, in relation to that contract, does not include a mistake in its interpretation. ... 4.37 The case of Shotter concerned a company which borrowed $100,000 from a bank. The loan was secured by a mortgage in favour of the bank. The bank also required Mr Shotter to personally guarantee the loan, as well as other liabilities the company had established with the bank. Mr Shotter, who was not a director or employee of this company, was of the belief that his personal guarantee was limited to the $100,000 loan. When the bank established that 16 the company did not have the resources to meet its outstanding liabilities, it turned to Mr Shotter to meet those liabilities. 4.38 Mr Shotter issued proceedings against the bank attacking the validity of the guarantee. Amongst other things, Mr Shotter claimed that in entering the guarantee, he was influenced by a material mistake, namely, that he was of the mistaken belief that the guarantee related only to one singular advance (the $100,000 loan). As such, Mr Shotter argued that he was entitled to relief under section 7 of the Contractual Mistakes Act. 4.39 The High Court held that Mr Shotter was not entitled to rely on section 7 of the Contractual Mistakes Act because, under section 6(2)(a), a contractual mistake does not include a mistake made in the interpretation of a contract. Mr Shotter’s mistake was caused by his interpretation of the guarantee and, despite the Court’s recognition that it was highly unlikely that he had read the document, Mr Shotter was, therefore, unable to obtain any relief that was available under the Contractual Mistakes Act. 4.40 In reaching this conclusion, Wylie J defined the term “interpretation”: I think it is clear, ...that the mistake of Mr Shotter was in misunderstanding what the guarantee document said as to the extent of his liability in the sense of what debts of \[the company\] were being guaranteed. Was that misunderstanding a mistake as to its “interpretation”? I think it was. It is true that to the lawyer “interpretation” is commonly understood to mean reaching of a conclusion as to the meaning of a document after careful study and analysis of the words used in accordance with the established rules of construction. There was nothing of the sort here. It is not even suggested that Mr Shotter read the document or any material part of it. Can an understanding of the meaning of a document in those circumstances be described as an “interpretation”? First I do not think “interpretation” in s 6(2)(a) is used in the technical lawyer’s sense I have described. In my view it must be equally applicable to the situation of a layman who, taking the risk of advising himself as to the meaning of a document simply reads and thinks he understands it. It must be equally applicable to the layman who only reads a part of the document because he thinks he need not trouble himself with some of the more wordy clauses or the “fine print”. It would seem strange to me if it were otherwise. Why should the prudent person who takes proper if mistaken advice, lose the benefit of the Act, while the foolish person who takes the risk on himself be protected? If I am correct up to this point what then of the layman who makes no attempt to read the document, but simply signs on the basis of a general description of the document, e.g. as in this case that it is a guarantee? I think that a signatory in that situation who assumes, because it is a guarantee and that it is for a particular purpose - in this case the raising of a specific loan - his liability thereunder must therefore be limited to that specific loan, is placing his own interpretation on the document however ill-formed and baseless it may be. (p 330) \[emphasis added.\] 4.41 From Wylie J’s comments, it can be concluded that the word “interpretation” has been given a wide meaning. It is irrelevant whether a person has actually read the document. If a person has some general knowledge of what the document is about and has signed that document, that person has interpreted that document in accordance with section 6(2)(a) of the Contractual Mistakes Act. 17 4.42 The High Court in Shivas v Bank of New Zealand \[1990\] 2 NZLR 327 took the same approach as Wylie J in Shotter. In Shivas, an accountant mistook the contents of his client’s guarantee to the bank. Despite the court assuming that the accountant had not read the guarantee, Tipping J held that he had made a mistake in the interpretation of the document. Tipping J stated at pages 361- 362: In so far as \[the accountant\] may have failed to notice when signing the guarantee that one year’s interest and costs were added to the primary limit, I am of the opinion that this represents a mistake in the interpretation of the contract. If he had read it and misunderstood it then it would clearly have been a mistake in interpretation. I cannot see that he can be in a better position through having formed an erroneous impression as a result of not having read the document at all. In this respect I follow the approach to the question of interpretation as discussed by Wylie J in Shotter’s case ... ... In agreement with Wylie J I would equate a failure to read or properly to read a contractual document with a misunderstanding of its effect having read it or after having had it erroneously explained. \[emphasis added.\] 4.43 Therefore, it appears that an “interpretation” can mean something wider than a careful consideration of a particular provision or document, to reach a conclusion as to its meaning, or operation and effect. An interpretation, in relation to the Contractual Mistakes Act, seems to also encompass brief readings, or even not reading at all, whereby the person assumes the meaning of a provision or document or places his or her own interpretation on it. 4.44 Shotter and Shivas both concerned situations where the signatories had not even turned their minds to the specific details or contents clearly spelt out in the contracts. They had not read them. In both cases, however, the signatories still reached certain conclusions as to the meaning of those contracts because they had some general understanding of what those contracts were about. 4.45 On the basis of Shotter and Shivas, in order for a party to have interpreted (or misinterpreted) a contract, it is enough if they have a general understanding of the contract. It is not necessary for the party to have turned their mind to the specific details of the contract. In other words, a party does not need to read a contract in order to fall within the ambits of section 6(2)(a) of the Contractual Mistakes Act. 4.46 The above cases are consistent with the decision of the TRA in Case U47. However, one question that could be raised in relation to the tax legislation, is whether a taxpayer merely has to have a general knowledge of the existence of a general body of tax laws which may or may not apply to that taxpayer’s situation, or whether that taxpayer has to actively turn his or her mind to a specific tax law. At first glance, this appears to be answered by the reference to “a tax law” in the phrase “interpretation or an interpretation of an application of a tax law”. The reference is not in a general sense to “tax laws”. The reference to “a tax law” indicates that a taxpayer must turn his or her mind to a specific tax law and reach a conclusion as to the meaning of that tax law. In Case U47, Barber DCJ said: 18 36. I agree with counsel for the defendant that whenever a person turns his or her mind to a tax law such as the application or non-application of the GST Act or its provisions, whether or not actually reading the statute in question an interpretation occurs. (pp 9,417-9,418) 4.47 He continued: 44. ... it is not necessary that he specifically identify the section number or actually read the section at issue. It is merely necessary that he turns his mind to the general purport of the relevant section with a general awareness of its existence even if having an erroneous view as to its contents and effects. (p 9,420) 4.48 To summarise the above authorities, the term “interpretation” encompasses more than the technical study and analysis of words of a document to understand its meaning. An interpretation involves the reaching of a conclusion on the meaning of a document or tax law. The taxpayer need not have specifically identified the section. It is sufficient that the taxpayer turned his or her mind to the general purport of the relevant legislation and came to a conclusion as to the law. Interpretation of an application of a tax law 4.49 Section 141B(1) also provides for “unacceptable interpretation” when there has been “an interpretation of an application” of a tax law. The question is what is the meaning of “an interpretation of an application”? 4.50 Some explanation for the wording of the section can be found in the legislative history of the provision. An earlier version of section 141B(1)(a) of the Act was applicable prior to the 1 April 1997. This original version of the provision included the words: ... an interpretation that ... involves the interpretation or application of that tax law 4.51 The 1997 amendment that introduced the phrase: ... an interpretation of an application sought to simplify the provision, but not change the meaning of it. It is, therefore, the Commissioner’s view that section 141B(1), as applicable before the 2003 amendment, refers to an interpretation of a tax law and an application of a tax law. The following discussion will be based on this assumption. 4.52 “Application” is not defined in the Act. The New Shorter Oxford Dictionary on Historical Principles gives the following definition: application ... 2 ... use, employment; a specific use or purpose to which something is put... 3 The bringing of a general or figurative statement, a theory, principle, etc., to bear upon a matter; applicability in a particular case, relevance; the bringing of something to bear practically in a matter, practical operation. ... 4.53 To what, however, is the tax law to be applied? The above definition refers to “specific use”, “particular case” and “in a matter”. Each of these phrases suggests that “application” is used with reference to a particular factual situation. Therefore, it is the Commissioner’s view that, for the present issue, it may be inferred that the tax law is being applied to the facts. This is consistent with the application of section 141B by Barber DCJ in Case U47. 19 An unacceptable interpretation or interpretation of an application - conclusion 4.54 Based on the above analysis, it is the Commissioner’s view that an “unacceptable interpretation” is when the taxpayer applies their understanding of the tax law to a particular factual scenario. It is not necessary for the taxpayer to have read or even identified the particular tax law. The requirement is that the taxpayer has turned his or her mind to a tax law and determined the legal effect of that tax law. It is then a further requirement that, when viewed objectively, the application of that interpretation is about as likely as not to be correct. Section 141B(1)(a) refers to both an “interpretation or an interpretation of an application of that tax law”. The two parts, although set out as alternatives, are each a necessary part of the other for the establishment of a tax position. An interpretation requires an application of the tax law and an application requires an interpretation of a tax law. For there to be an “unacceptable interpretation”, both the interpretation and the application of the tax law require that they be applied to the taxpayer’s particular factual scenario. Can a mistake of fact lead to an unacceptable interpretation? 4.55 The question arises as to whether a tax shortfall caused by a simple mistake of fact which led to, for example, the wrong law being applied, is an unacceptable interpretation. The taxpayer may have applied the law correctly to the facts as he or she believed them to be but, when the true facts are considered, the end result is that of an incorrect tax position. An interpretation of a tax law is necessary 4.56 It is the Commissioner’s view that section 141B does not apply to tax shortfalls caused solely by mistakes of fact. Section 141B is concerned with the application of the tax laws rather than the facts to which they are applied. Both the scheme and purpose of the legislation and the wording of section 141B support this view. For example, section 141B(7) provides that: 141B(7) The matters that must be considered in determining whether the tax position taken by a taxpayer involves an unacceptable interpretation of a tax law include— (a) The actual or potential application to the tax position of all the tax laws that are relevant (including specific or general anti-avoidance provisions); and (b) Decisions of a court or a Taxation Review Authority on the interpretation of tax laws that are relevant (unless the decision was issued up to one month before the taxpayer takes the taxpayer's tax position). 4.57 There are no references in section 141B(7) to the determination of facts or the correctness of the facts in determining whether there has been an unacceptable interpretation. It may also be significant that section 141B(7) refers to the actual or potential application to the “tax position of all the tax laws that are relevant” and the definition of “tax position” in section 3(1) refers to a position 20 or approach with regard to tax possible under one or more tax laws. There is no reference to factual mistakes. 4.58 It is appropriate to consider section 141A which sets out the shortfall penalty provision for not taking reasonable care. 141A. Not taking reasonable care— (1) A taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty if the taxpayer does not take reasonable care in taking a taxpayer's tax position (referred to as “not taking reasonable care”) and the taking of that tax position by that taxpayer results in a tax shortfall. (2) The penalty payable for not taking reasonable care is 20% of the resulting tax shortfall. (3) A taxpayer who, in taking a taxpayer's tax position, has used an acceptable interpretation of the tax law is also a taxpayer who has taken reasonable care in taking the taxpayer's tax position. 4.59 Both section 141A and 141B, therefore, provide for a penalty of 20% of the resulting tax shortfall, the former “for not taking reasonable care”, the latter when section 141B(2) applies and a taxpayer’s tax position involves “an unacceptable interpretation of the tax law”. This might be seen as suggesting offences which were different but which were of equal culpability. 4.60 The question could be posed as to the application of section 141A, relating to lack of reasonable care, when it is considered that the taxpayer, had they not relied on incorrect facts, would have made an acceptable interpretation. As a mere mistake of fact does not give rise to an unacceptable interpretation, it would seem, that if the taxpayer relies on incorrect facts, there might be liability under section 141A if there was a lack of reasonable care in ascertaining those facts. 4.61 The effect of section 141A(3) must be considered in this context. (3) A taxpayer who, in taking a taxpayer's tax position, has used an acceptable interpretation of the tax law is also a taxpayer who has taken reasonable care in taking the taxpayer's tax position. 4.62 It is considered that section 141A(3) was intended to reinforce the objective nature of the test for unacceptable interpretation under section 141B. It will be remembered that the test under section 141B is an objective one and is not dependant on the efforts of the taxpayer or their advisers. It is, therefore, the Commissioner’s view that section 141A(3) was enacted in order to prevent the imposition of a shortfall penalty under section 141A where a taxpayer had made an acceptable, albeit incorrect, interpretation which led to a tax shortfall and where that acceptable interpretation had been reached with a lack of reasonable care. This fits with the scheme of the Act that it is not necessary to consider the efforts of a taxpayer in arriving at an interpretation. The interpretation of section 141B(1) and Case U47 4.63 Judge Barber, in Case U47 considered the relationship between errors of fact and law: 21 45. ... Certainly ... there has been an interpretation “of an application of” a tax law. This is because the staff member took an interpretation that a requirement to hold a tax invoice did not apply to the transaction in question for the purposes of claiming the GST input credit deduction. (p 9,420) 4.64 In setting out his reasons for the decision of the TRA, Judge Barber seemed to be of the view that an error of fact could lead to an unacceptable interpretation as he stated that the test in section 141B was to compare the interpretation with that based on the land being a secondhand good. 46. ... It is the correct position on the basis of the land being a “secondhand good” which must be determined for the purposes of the s 141B test, because in this case the property constituted secondhand goods. (p 9,420) 4.65 Nevertheless, His Honour then goes on to consider the interpretation taken by the taxpayer’s accountant on behalf of the taxpayer. 51. The disputant emphasized that he merely made a mistake about a material fact i.e. he assumed that the vendor was GST registered. However, he thought that no invoice was needed in that situation because he thought the agreement became the necessary invoice, and that is an unacceptable interpretation. His mistake of law may have been based on a mistake of fact but there was still an unacceptable interpretation of the tax law. \[emphasis added\] 4.66 From paragraph 51 of the report of the TRA decision, it would seem that Judge Barber was considering the correctness or otherwise of the application of the law to the facts as the accountant believed them to be. It was only the mistake of fact that led the accountant to consider the tax invoice point at all. The issue of whether or not the agreement for sale and purchase constituted a tax invoice is irrelevant to the shortfall based on the true facts. Although an agreement for sale and purchase would not normally meet the legislative requirements for a “tax invoice”, it was the accountant’s failure to realise that the definition of “input tax” and the effect of section 20(3)(a)(ia) GST Act applied to the transaction and limited the input tax deduction that led to the shortfall. With respect, Judge Barber seems to have determined whether the interpretation was acceptable based on the facts as the taxpayer believed them to be, i.e. that there was a taxable supply where a tax invoice was required to claim an input tax deduction 4.67 There appears, therefore, to be some uncertainty as to the law in New Zealand and it may be helpful to consider other jurisdictions. Australia has a similar shortfall regime regarding the “reasonably arguable” application of a law. Acceptable interpretation / “reasonably arguable” position – the Australian view 4.68 Section 222C of the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (AITAA) deals with whether the correctness of the treatment of the application of a law is “reasonably arguable” and provides: For the purposes of this Part: (a) the correctness of the treatment of the application of a law; or 22 (b) another matter; is reasonably arguable if, having regard to the relevant authorities and the matter in relation to which the law is applied or the other matter, it would be concluded that what is argued for is about as likely as not to be correct. 4.69 Section 226K AITAA imposes a penalty where a position is taken that is not “reasonably arguable”. Section 226K provides: Subject to this Part, if: (a) a taxpayer has a tax shortfall for a year ; and (b) the shortfall or part of it was caused by the taxpayer , in a taxation statement, treating an income tax law as applying in relation to a matter or identical matters in a particular way; and (c) the shortfall or part, as the case may be, so caused exceeded whichever is the higher of: (i) $10,000; or (ii) 1% of the taxpayer's return tax for that year; and (d) when the statement was made, it was not reasonably arguable that the way in which the application of the law was treated was correct; the taxpayer is liable to pay, by way of penalty, additional tax equal to 25% of the amount of the shortfall or part. 4.70 When section 141B of the New Zealand legislation was initially drafted, it also used the phrase “reasonably arguable”, consistent with the Australian provision. The Commentary to the Taxpayer Compliance, Penalties, and Disputes Resolution Bill recommended that “reasonably arguable” be changed to “unacceptable interpretation” in the New Zealand legislation. The reason the Commentary cites for recommending this change was that the threshold level of a “reasonably arguable position” did not meet the higher requisite threshold of being a position that was “about as likely as not to be the correct tax position”. The Australian provision, however, despite retaining the criteria of a “reasonably arguable position”, specifically provides for this same test. Therefore, the difference in the terminology between the Australian and New Zealand provisions (“unacceptable interpretation” as opposed to “reasonably arguable”) is not indicative of differences in the application or meaning of the two sections. 4.71 The earlier version of section 141B(1)(a) of the Act, prior to 1 April 1997, more closely followed the Australian provision. For convenient reference, the earlier version of section 141B(1) is set out again below: For the purposes of this Part, an unacceptable interpretation of a tax law is, in relation to a tax position taken be a taxpayer, an interpretation that - (a) Involves the interpretation or application of that tax law; and (b) Fails to meet the standard of being, viewed objectively, about as likely as not to be correct. 4.72 As stated above, section 141B, as amended in 1997, was not intended to change the meaning of the section. On this basis, commentaries that have considered section 222C(1) AITAA will be useful to help ascertain the meaning of “interpretation or interpretation of the application of a tax law” in the context of section 141B(1). 23 4.73 Section 222C AITAA uses the phrase “the treatment of the application of a law” when defining the term “reasonably arguable”. Section 141B uses a similar phrase. When defining the term “unacceptable interpretation”, section 141B(1) uses the phrase “an interpretation or an interpretation of an application of a tax law”. The utilisation of such similar terminology suggests a similar approach in both jurisdictions and strengthens the view that discussion and commentary on the Australian legislation may assist in the application of the New Zealand provisions. 4.74 An Australian Administrative Appeals Tribunal case that made some reference to “reasonably arguable position” was Ryvitch v FCT 2002 ATC 2188. The taxpayer in this case had initially appealed to the Federal Court regarding the deductibility of losses which depended on the existence of a partnership. The Federal Court held that the existence of the partnership was arguable at the time the taxpayer claimed the deductions. On that basis, the taxpayer had not been reckless and the issue of penalties was remitted to the Commissioner for reconsideration. The Commissioner reduced the penalties to 25% under section 226G for failure to take reasonable care. The taxpayer argued that her returns were not wrong because of carelessness or an omission to take into account relevant facts or a failure to address a relevant issue but rather that she had misunderstood the relevant facts. Although the Administrative Appeals Tribunal further reduced the quantum of additional tax from 25% to 15% of the shortfall, it was stated that: At the hearing, reference was made to s. 226K... It seems clear that the question before the Federal Court of whether the development was carried on as a partnership or by \[the company\] in its own right was a question of fact and did not involve a conclusion of law. Consequently, it is difficult to see that s. 226K has any relevance to the matter of additional tax. (pp 2,193–2,194) 4.75 The Explanatory Memorandum to the Taxation Laws Amendment (Self- Assessment) Bill 1992 (Australia) supports the view that where the taxpayer misunderstands the facts, this is not in itself a breach of the “reasonably arguable” position requirement. The memorandum states: What is a reasonably arguable position? A position taken by a taxpayer will be reasonably arguable if, on an objective analysis of the law and the application to the relevant facts, it would be concluded that the taxpayer’s position was about as likely as not to be correct. ... Honest errors of fact or calculation will not attract section 226K, which requires a taxpayer to positively treat an income tax law as applying in a particular way. 4.76 The Australian Taxation Office issued a ruling TR 94/5. This contains some useful and more detailed discussion on errors of fact. The ruling states at paragraph 9: (d) ... the reasonably arguable test only applies to tax shortfalls caused by a taxpayer treating an income tax law as applying in a particular way. A taxpayer treats an income tax law as applying in a particular way where the taxpayer concludes that, on the basis of the facts and the way the law applies to those facts, a particular consequence follows (for example, an amount of expenditure incurred is 24 deductible). Subject to the other preconditions of section 226K, the reasonably arguable test is designed to encourage taxpayers to ensure that the conclusions they reach are sound ones. However, in some cases, a taxpayer’s conclusions on a particular matter may have been based on incorrect primary facts which the taxpayer did not know and could not reasonably be expected to have known were not the proper facts, such as where a taxpayer relies on a bank to provide details of the amount of interest earned on a deposit. In other cases, the statements in a taxpayer’s return may not represent conclusions of the taxpayer, but might reflect errors in calculation or transposition errors. As a broad rule, where a tax shortfall was caused by an error of fact or calculation section 226K will not apply since the taxpayer will not have treated an income tax law as applying in relation to a matter in a particular way. In this context, errors of fact are errors of primary fact and not wrong conclusions of fact which a taxpayer may make which bear on the correct application of a tax law, such as whether the taxpayer is carrying on a business. Whether the statements in a taxpayer’s return represent conclusions of the taxpayer or were caused by errors of fact or calculation should be determined on the basis of all the available evidence; \[emphasis added\] 4.77 It, therefore, appears that the Australian view is that a tax shortfall caused by a mistake of fact that the taxpayer relies on and could not have known was incorrect, and to which the taxpayer applies the correct tax law for those facts, has taken a reasonably arguable position. In contrast, if a tax shortfall is caused by the taxpayer making an incorrect conclusion of fact, albeit that the correct tax law is applied to that conclusion, the taxpayer’s position does not pass the reasonably arguable test. Mistakes of Fact 4.78 A tax shortfall, caused by a factual mistake not involving an interpretation or application of the law, is not within section 141B. Section 141B requires that there is an interpretation or application of a tax law. If the tax shortfall is caused by a mistake of fact, as opposed to a conclusion or inference involving the application or interpretation of the law, section 141B cannot apply. Examples to illustrate this are as follows: Example 1 A taxpayer, who manufactures widgets, receives invoices for widget components. The taxpayer infers from this that the invoices record the purchase of goods for use in the taxpayer’s business. He has forgotten that these particular widget components related to his private hobby activity. The taxpayer claims an income tax deduction for these. The tax shortfall is caused by a mistake of fact and does not involve an application of a tax law. Example 2 A staff member fraudulently charged his personal expenses for widget components to the business. The fact that the taxpayer mistakenly claimed an input tax deduction, believing that these were widget components used in his taxable activity, would not constitute an unacceptable interpretation. The mistake again related to the facts. It was not a mistaken application of a tax law. 25 4.79 In contrast to Examples 1 and 2, the following example illustrates a mistake in the interpretation or application of a tax law for which the taxpayer may be liable for a shortfall penalty for unacceptable interpretation. Example 3 A taxpayer claims an income tax deduction for the cost of the widgets, including the GST component paid on the widgets. This is an unacceptable interpretation of section ED 4(2) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Section ED 4(2) states that no deduction shall be allowed for any amount of GST input tax charged, levied or calculated in relation to the supply of goods and services to that person. Therefore, in this last example, the taxpayer is liable for a shortfall penalty for unacceptable interpretation, under section 141B, provided the other requirements of section 141B are met. 4.80 This approach is consistent with the quotation from the ATO set out above, in which the ATO refers to the situation of a taxpayer making an error of fact and distinguishes this from a situation where there is a tax shortfall as a result of a wrong inference from those facts involving the application of a tax law. Use of tax agent/advisor 4.81 A tax agent may, however, take an interpretation on behalf of a taxpayer (or advise a taxpayer as to the tax law before the taxpayer takes the tax position). How does this impact upon the potential liability for a shortfall penalty under section 141B? 4.82 In Case U47 Barber DCJ stated: 42. ... that while the Tax Administration Act 1994 does not give definitive guidance as to whether or not an unacceptable interpretation under section 141B by a tax agent, but adopted by a taxpayer, can be imputed to that taxpayer, the wording of section 141B(1) gives a strong indication that this is intended by the Legislature. That subsection (1) makes no direct reference to the taxpayer’s interpretation but states “In relation to a tax position taken by a taxpayer, an unacceptable interpretation \[is\]...”. This leaves the scope as to who initially makes the interpretation rather wide. It must be the taxpayer who takes the tax position and, by inference, that will include any associated interpretation by an agent. (p 9,419) \[emphasis added\] 4.83 Barber DCJ referred to the general principle of agency law as he continued: 42. ... the fact that a taxpayer has requested, received and followed the advice of an agent with regard to an interpretation of a tax law, or its application, must mean that the taxpayer has taken an “interpretation” as required under section 141B in line with that taken by the agent in terms of the general principle of agency law. It is not necessary for a taxpayer to have read a tax law but, merely, that the taxpayer has turned his or her mind to the law. It seems to me that the mere fact of a taxpayer referring a matter to a tax agent may often be sufficient to indicate that a taxpayer has turned his or her mind to the tax law in question or to its application. It follows that because I find that the disputant has followed the advice of a tax agent (which advice has led to the making of an unacceptable interpretation), that does not prevent the disputant from being liable for any shortfall penalty payable under s 141B. That unacceptable interpretation becomes the disputant's interpretation, for the 26 purposes of s 141B, by virtue of the disputant's agency arrangement with its Accountant. \[emphasis added\] 4.84 When applying the law to the facts before him in Case U47, Barber DCJ found that the taxpayer’s agent had made an interpretation of the relevant tax laws, or at least an interpretation of the “application” of them. The interpretation was incorrect and this “unacceptable interpretation” was imputed to the taxpayer who, accordingly, was held to have taken the relevant tax position. Under the law of agency, the taxpayer is deemed to have taken a tax position based on an unacceptable interpretation, if his or her agent has made an incorrect interpretation of the relevant tax laws or an interpretation of the “application” of them. 4.85 Another possibility is that the taxpayer may complete his or her own return, but adopt the adviser’s interpretation in doing so. Under the Act, in either case, the primary responsibility for tax obligations and liabilities always remains with the taxpayer. A “tax position” is a position or approach taken under one or more tax laws, and it is about the tax position taken by the taxpayer, in relation to his or her tax return, or other matters. The involvement of an agent does not derogate from the taxpayer’s overall responsibility for the tax position taken. 4.86 In summary, if a taxpayer has followed the advice of a tax adviser in preparing a tax return, or a tax adviser has prepared the tax return, the taxpayer will be taken to have adopted the interpretation of the tax adviser. Summary of meaning of “unacceptable interpretation” • An “interpretation” involves the formulation of an understanding or explanation by a person of something. • A person must have turned his or her mind to the document (or tax law) before an interpretation of it can be said to be given. However, it is not necessary for that person to have actually read the document (or tax law) in issue. A turning of the mind to the general purport of a section or a tax law in general and adopting a view, as to its meaning, or operation and effect, will suffice as an interpretation. • Section 141B relates to the understanding and application of a tax law by the taxpayer to a set of facts. • A mistake of fact is not an application of a law (nor an interpretation of a tax law). A mistake of fact is a mistake as to what is thought to be a known fact. Mistakes of fact would cover transposition or addition errors, and what would generally be simple factual errors. Mistakes of fact may also dictate the appropriate tax law to apply. Example 4 A taxpayer gets the wrong depreciation rate when looking up the depreciation rates. The taxpayer knows the relevant asset class but accidentally selects the 27 depreciation rate for the asset class listed next to the relevant one. Although the taxpayer would claim depreciation at the wrong rate as a result of this error, there would be no interpretation or application of the law by the taxpayer leading to the shortfall. Example 5 If a taxpayer omits income because of a bank statement error or because a cheque was banked into the wrong account, there would be no interpretation or application of a tax law by the taxpayer as a result of this error. Example 6 The taxpayer has a transaction with an associated person and, for some reason, the taxpayer was unaware of the relationship. If the transaction is one which requires the interpretation of tax laws, the interpretation of the taxpayer, on the basis that the transaction was not with an associated person, would not be an unacceptable interpretation. The application of the appropriate tax law was based on a mistake of fact. • A taxpayer’s mistake of law may have been based on a mistake of fact but, on the facts, there may also be an unacceptable interpretation. • Where there is a tax shortfall caused by a mistaken fact, but there was no interpretation or application of a tax law, the taxpayer might, depending on the circumstances and facts, still be liable under section 141A for failing to take reasonable care. • For the purposes of section 141B, a tax agent’s interpretation will be imputed to the taxpayer where the tax position is taken on the taxpayer’s behalf by the agent who completes the taxpayer’s tax return. The interpretation taken will be that of the taxpayer and will not prevent the taxpayer from being liable for a shortfall penalty under section 141B if an unacceptable interpretation has been made. A taxpayer may also adopt an adviser’s interpretation in completing his or her own return. • The non-application of a tax law will be an “interpretation or an interpretation of an application of a tax law” if a taxpayer turned his or her mind to whether or not that tax law applied to a particular factual situation. Example 7 A taxpayer may conclude that the registration requirements in section 51 of the GST Act do not apply to his or her particular fact situation. If he or she is wrong, this would be an “unacceptable interpretation”. Summary – shortfall penalties for tax positions taken before 1 April 2003 based on an unacceptable interpretation 4.87 A taxpayer will be liable for a shortfall penalty if: • the taxpayer has taken a tax position (defined section 3(1) of the TAA); • based on an unacceptable interpretation of a tax law; • as a result of which the taxpayer has a tax shortfall (defined section 3(1) of the TAA); and 28 • the tax shortfall exceeds threshold amounts referred to in section 141B(2)(b). 4.88 The shortfall penalty payable is 20% of the resulting tax shortfall pursuant to section 141B(4), however, sections 141F to K provide conditions under which the Commissioner may reduce or increase penalties. These sections provide no maximum amount for a shortfall penalty imposed for an unacceptable interpretation. 5. SECTION 141B(1)(b) AND THE MEANING OF “ABOUT AS LIKELY AS NOT TO BE CORRECT” 5.1 If there is an interpretation of a tax law or an interpretation of an application of a tax law under section 141B(1)(a), section 141B(1) states that an interpretation is unacceptable, if when: (b) Viewed objectively, that interpretation or application fails to meet the standard of being about as likely as not to be correct. 5.2 No statutory guidance is given as to how the phrase, “about as likely as not to be correct”, is to be interpreted. However, there are a number of points or inferences that can be drawn from the actual words used and the context of the phrase itself. 5.3 Firstly, the test is an objective one. Accordingly, the taxpayer’s efforts or diligence in reaching an interpretation are not relevant for the purposes of satisfying the requirements of section 141B(1)(b). 5.4 The second point to note is the use of the words “as likely as not” in the phrase “as likely as not to be correct”. In Case U47, Barber DCJ considered the meaning of this phrase and said: 37. ... the words “as likely as not” indicate an even balance of 50/50. There would need to be an about equal chance of an interpretation being likely to be correct as it is to be incorrect. It follows that where one of two interpretations does not have about a 50% chance of being correct in the view of a Court, the taxpayer will have failed to meet the required standard under limb (b). Corresponding percentages would apply where there are three or more equally likely interpretations i.e. a 33% chance of being correct where there are three interpretations, a 25% chance of being correct where there are four interpretations, and so on. (p 9,418) 5.5 Barber DCJ continued: 37. ... the word “about”, which precedes the above phrase must be taken into account as it makes the test less stringent and provides some latitude in applying the test. 5.6 The word “about” is not defined in the Act. The ordinary meaning, as given in The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles, is: A adv. 1 Around the outside; on or towards every side; all around. ... 4 Near in number, scale, degree, etc. ... 5 On any side; somewhere near. ... 5.7 In Case U47, Barber DCJ discussed the use of the word “about”. He said: 29 37. ... I accept that the word “about” in the phrase “about as likely as not to be correct” allows for the standard to be met if the interpretation is close to or around 50% likely to be correct. It follows that where a Court subsequently holds an interpretation to be incorrect, the test in section 141B may potentially be satisfied if it is close to being 50% correct. Perhaps that may be the case where a Court finds two possible interpretations attractive, but prefers one to the other. (p 9,418) 5.8 The Australian view on standard of “about as likely as not to be correct” accords with Barber DCJ’s approach in Case U47. In the decision of the Australian Federal Court in Walstern Pty Ltd v FC v T \[2003\] ATC 5076, Hill J discussed the standard of the very similar phrase “about as likely as not correct”, as follows: It is not necessary that the decision maker form the view that the taxpayer's argument in an objective sense is more likely to be right than wrong. That this is so follows from the fact that tax has already been short paid, that is to say the premise against which the question is raised for decision is that the taxpayer's argument has already been found to be wrong. Nor can it be necessary that the decision maker form the view that it is just as likely that the taxpayer's argument is correct as the argument which the decision maker considers to be the correct argument for the decision maker has already formed the view that the taxpayer's argument is wrong. The standard is not as high as that. The word ‘about’ indicates the need for balancing the two arguments, with the consequence that there must be room for it to be argued which of the two positions is correct so that on balance the taxpayer's argument can objectively be said to be one that while wrong could be argued on rational grounds to be right. ... ... the view advanced by the taxpayer must be one where objectively it would be concluded that having regard to the material included within the definition of ‘authority’ a reasoned argument can be made which argument when contrasted with the argument which is accepted as correct is about as likely as not correct. That is to say the two arguments, namely, that which is advanced by the taxpayer and that which reflects the correct view will be finely balanced. The case must thus be one where reasonable minds could differ as to which view, that of the taxpayer or that ultimately adopted by the Commissioner was correct. There must, in other words, be room for a real and rational difference of opinion between the two views such that while the taxpayer's view is ultimately seen to be wrong it is nevertheless ‘about’' as likely to be correct as the correct view. A question of judgment is involved. (p 5,095) \[emphasis added\] 5.9 It is the Commissioner’s view that an interpretation will be “as likely as not to be correct” if, when viewed objectively, that interpretation has about an equal chance (or about a 50% chance) of being likely to be correct as it is to be incorrect. The use of the word “about” makes the test less stringent, but the objective interpretation still needs to be close to or around 50% likely to be correct. Section 141B(7) 5.10 Section 141B(7) defines the matters that must be considered in determining whether or not the taxpayer has made an unacceptable interpretation of a tax law in the tax position taken. 30 141B(7) The matters that must be considered in determining whether the tax position taken by a taxpayer involves an unacceptable interpretation of a tax law include - (a) The actual or potential application to the tax position of all the tax laws that are relevant (including specific or general anti-avoidance provisions); and (b) Decisions of a court or a Taxation Review Authority on the interpretation of tax laws that are relevant (unless the decision was issued up to one month before the taxpayer takes the taxpayer’s tax position). 5.11 Barber DCJ stated in Case U47 that: 39. Section 141B(7) uses the imperative word “must”. Accordingly, the matters referred to in paras (a) and (b) of section 141B(7) must be taken into account for the purposes of ascertaining whether an interpretation taken is acceptable. This supports the objective nature of the test in section 141B(1)(b). Under section 141B(7) it is not simply the tax law (or laws) of which the taxpayer is aware that needs to be taken into account but, rather, that which is actually applicable which must be taken into account to ascertain whether the interpretation taken by the taxpayer is “about as likely as not to be correct” in terms of s 141B(1). (p 9,418) \[emphasis added\] 5.12 Barber DCJ summarised his view: 41. ... that factors to be taken into account for the purposes of ascertaining on an objective basis whether a taxpayer has taken an interpretation “about as likely as not to be correct” are all tax laws relevant to the facts in question, all Court or Tribunal decisions issued up to one month before the taxpayer takes the taxpayer’s tax position, and (in the absence of such case law) relevant extrinsic materials. Section 141B(7), in effect, affirms and endorses the criminal maxim that ignorance of the law is no excuse. (p 9,419) \[emphasis added\] 5.13 Accordingly, all tax laws that are applicable must be taken into account to ascertain whether the interpretation taken by the taxpayer is “about as likely as not to be correct”. Additionally, all case law issued up to one month before the taxpayer’s tax position is taken, must be considered and, as subsection 141B(7) is not exhaustive in the list of factors it requires to be taken into account, where there is no relevant case law, it may be appropriate to consider extrinsic materials. Subsection 141B(7) also highlights the objective standard; ignorance of the law is no excuse. 5.14 It is the Commissioner’s view that an acceptable interpretation by a taxpayer will only be able to be established where either: (1) that interpretation is in fact correct or (2) where incorrect but, viewed objectively, the interpretation was “about as likely as not to be correct” (being close to or around 50% likely to be correct). Summary of the “about as likely as not to be correct” standard 5.15 The standard required under section 141B(1)(b) incorporates the following: 31 • The standard is to be judged objectively. • There must be, at least, about an equal chance of an interpretation being likely to be correct as it is to be incorrect. The use of the word “about” makes the test less stringent but the interpretation still needs to be close to or around 50% likely to be correct. • For the application of section 141B(7), in determining whether an unacceptable interpretation has been taken in arriving at a tax position, matters that must be considered include all Court or Tribunal decisions issued up to one month before the tax position has been taken, and (in the absence of such case law) relevant extrinsic materials. 6. CHANGES RELEVANT TO A TAXPAYER’S TAX POSITION TAKEN ON OR AFTER 1 APRIL 2003 6.1 As a result of the amendments enacted by the Taxation (Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003, for tax positions taken on or after 1 April 2003, section 141B no longer refers to an unacceptable “interpretation or interpretation of an application of a tax law”. The amended section 141B requires that a person has taken an “unacceptable tax position”. There is generally continuity of the application of section 141B to tax positions that are unacceptable because, when viewed objectively, those tax positions do not meet the standard of being about as likely as not to be correct. Accordingly, the earlier discussion on section 141B, prior to this amendment, remains applicable, except in respect of the changes discussed in this Part 6 of the Statement. 6.2 Sections 141B(1) and (1B) provide these main changes. However, for convenience, the section 141B is set out in full below: 141B UNACCEPTABLE TAX POSITION (1) A taxpayer takes an unacceptable tax position if, viewed objectively, the tax position fails to meet the standard of being about as likely as not to be correct. (1B) A taxpayer does not take an unacceptable tax position merely by making a mistake in the calculation or recording of numbers in a return (2) A taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty if the taxpayer takes an unacceptable tax position and the tax shortfall arising from the taxpayer's tax position is more than both— (a) $20,000; and (b) the lesser of $250,000 and 1% of the taxpayer's total tax figure for the relevant return period. (3) For the purposes of this section, a taxpayer's total tax figure is— (a) The amount of tax paid or payable by the taxpayer in respect of the return period for which the taxpayer takes the taxpayer's tax position before\[\[, in the case of income tax, any group offset election or subvention payment; or (b) Where the taxpayer has no tax to pay in respect of the return period— 32 (i) Except in the case of GST, an amount equal to the product of— (A) The net loss of a taxpayer in respect of the return period, ascertained in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994, are to be used in this subsection as if they had a positive value; and (B) The basic rate of income tax for companies in the relevant return period; or (ii) In the case of GST, the refund of tax to which the taxpayer is entitled for the return period,— that is shown as tax paid or payable, or as net losses of the taxpayer, or as a refund to which the taxpayer is entitled, in a tax return provided . . . by the taxpayer for the return period. (4) Where subsection (2) applies, the shortfall penalty payable is 20% of the resulting tax shortfall. (5) For the purposes of this section, the question whether any interpretation of a tax law is acceptable or unacceptable shall be determined as at the time at which the taxpayer takes the taxpayer's tax position. \[Effective 21 June 2005, section 141B(5) states: (5) For the purposes of this section, the question whether any tax position is acceptable or unacceptable shall be determined as at the time at which the taxpayer takes the taxpayer's tax position.\] (6) For tax positions involving an interpretation of a tax law or laws that have been taken into account in a tax return, the time the taxpayer takes the taxpayer's tax position is when the taxpayer provides the return containing the taxpayer's tax position. If the taxpayer does not provide a tax return for a return period, the taxpayer takes the taxpayer's tax position on the due date for providing the tax return. \[Effective 21 June 2005, section 141B(6) states: (6) The time at which a taxpayer takes a tax position for a return period is - (a) the time at which the taxpayer provides the return containing the taxpayer's tax position, if the taxpayer provides a tax return for the return period: (b) the due date for providing the tax return for the return period, if the taxpayer does not provide a tax return for the return period.\] (7) The matters that must be considered in determining whether the taxpayer has taken an unacceptable tax position include— (a) The actual or potential application to the tax position of all the tax laws that are relevant (including specific or general anti-avoidance provisions); and (b) Decisions of a court or a Taxation Review Authority on the interpretation of tax laws that are relevant (unless the decision was issued up to one month before the taxpayer takes the taxpayer's tax position). (8) For the purpose of determining whether the resulting tax shortfall is in excess of the amounts specified in subsection (2)(b),— (a) A tax return provided by— (i) A partnership; or 33 (ii) Any other group of persons that derive or incur amounts jointly or that are assessed together,— is to be treated as if it were a tax return of every taxpayer who is a partner in the partnership or person in such group; and (b) The tax rate in a return period applying to a partnership is deemed to be the same as the basic rate of income tax for companies for the relevant period. (9) The amounts or the percentage specified in subsection (2) may be varied from time to time by the Governor-General by Order in Council. \[emphasis added\] 6.3 Therefore, under the revised section 141B, there is no longer a requirement for the taxpayer to have made an interpretation or an interpretation of an application of a tax law, when taking their tax position. The requirement is merely that the taxpayer takes a tax position that is unacceptable if, when viewed objectively, the tax position fails to meet the standard of being about as likely as not to be correct. There is no longer a requirement that the taxpayer has turned his or her mind to a tax law. The requirement is merely that a tax position has been taken, which does not meet the required standard. Tax position 6.4 The definition of “tax position” remains substantially unchanged from that applicable to tax positions taken before 1 April 2003. The text change is confined to first two lines. “With regard to tax possible under one or more tax laws” has been replaced by “with regard to tax under one or more tax laws”. “Including without limitation” has been replaced by “including without limitation a position or approach with regard to”. The first two lines of the definition applicable before 1 April 2003 are: “Tax position” means a position or approach with regard to tax possible under one or more tax laws, including without limitation — 6.5 The full definition for application on or after 1 April 2003 is set out again below: “Tax position” means a position or approach with regard to tax under one or more tax laws, including without limitation a position or approach with regard to— (a) A liability for an amount of tax, or the payment of an amount of tax: (b) An obligation to deduct or withhold an amount of tax, or the deduction or withholding of an amount of tax: (c) A right to a tax refund, or to claim or not to claim a tax refund: (d) A right to a credit of tax, or to claim or not to claim a credit of tax: (e) The provision of a tax return, or the non-provision of a tax return: (f) The derivation of an amount of gross income or exempt income or a capital gain, or the inclusion or non-inclusion of an amount in gross income: (g) The incurring of an amount of expenditure or loss, or the allowing or disallowing as a deduction of an amount of expenditure or loss: (h) The availability of net losses, or the offsetting or use of net losses: 34 (i) The attaching of a credit of tax, or the receipt of or lack of entitlement to receive a credit of tax: (j) The balance of a tax account of any type or description, or a debit or credit to such a tax account: (k) The estimation of the provisional tax payable. (l) Whether the taxpayer must request an income statement or respond to an income statement issued by the Commissioner: (m) The application of section 33A(1): (n) A right to a rebate: 6.6 Unacceptable interpretations of the law fall within section 141B. Tax shortfalls which are not related to interpretations of the tax laws are also covered by section 141B. Making a mistake in the calculation or recording of numbers in a return 6.7 Section 141B(1B) provides: (1B) A taxpayer does not take an unacceptable tax position merely by making a mistake in the calculation or recording of numbers in a return. 6.8 As there is currently no case authority on the interpretation of this section, a view on what is considered a mistake in the “recording of numbers in a return” will taken, based on an analysis of the text and consideration of the purpose of the provision. 6.9 If the taxpayer has merely made a mistake in the calculation or recording of numbers in a return, section 141B(1B) provides that that is not an unacceptable tax position. It is considered that the meaning of a “mistake in a calculation in a return” is clear, therefore, the following discussion will focus on the meaning of a “mistake in the recording of numbers in a return”. Meaning of return 6.10 Section 141B(1B) merely refers to “a return”, but as section 141B is applicable to the taxpayer’s tax position, it is appropriate to consider the definition of “taxpayer’s tax position”. This is defined as: “Taxpayer's tax position” means— (a) . . . a tax position taken by a taxpayer in or in respect of— (i) A tax return; or (ii) An income statement; or (iii) A due date: (b) Repealed. 6.11 In the context of section 141B(1B), it is a “tax return” that is relevant. Therefore, in section 141B(1B), it is considered that the “return” refers to a “tax return”. “Tax return” is defined in section 3(1) of the Act: “Tax return” means a form or document that a taxpayer is required by a tax law— (a) To complete; and 35 (b) To provide to the Commissioner,— whether in electronic or written form and whether provided in respect of a period or not; and also includes a tax form issued by another taxpayer that the taxpayer provides to the Commissioner: 6.12 As a “tax return” means a form or document that a taxpayer is required by a tax law to complete and to provide to the Commissioner, it is considered that a mistake in the “recording of numbers in a return” refers to a mistake in the recording of numbers in a form or document that a taxpayer is required by a tax law to complete and to provide to the Commissioner. 6.13 Generally, working papers are not required to be provided to the Commissioner and, therefore, are not part of the “return”. However, it is considered that, in some situations, where numbers are unintentionally mis- recorded in the working papers, the mistake is carried through into the tax return and the result is a tax shortfall, this is a mistake of the recording of numbers within the section 141B(1B) exclusion and, as such, the taxpayer has not taken an unacceptable tax position. However, in such a circumstance, pursuant to section 141A(4), the taxpayer may still be liable for a tax shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care. Meaning of mistake 6.14 Following the enactment of section 141B(1B), commentary on the section was included in the Tax Information Bulletin (“TIB”) Vol. 15, No 5 (May 2003), in an item entitled “Tax compliance, standards and penalties”. The item explains what was intended by the enactment, as follows: New sections 141A(4) and 141B(1B) clarify that a taxpayer has not taken an unacceptable tax position if a tax shortfall is the result of calculation mistake or by mis-recording numbers in a return. It was never intended that the unacceptable tax position penalty apply to calculation or processing mistakes. Rather, this penalty applies when a tax shortfall arises because a tax position is not as likely as not to be correct, whether or not the taxpayer actually interpreted the law. If a mistake is of such a magnitude that the mistake breaches the reasonable care standard that shortfall penalty applies. \[emphasis added\] 6.15 Although “mistake” is not defined in either the Act or in the Income Tax Act 1994, the “Concise Oxford Dictionary” 10th Ed. Revised (2002) provides the following definition: mistake n. a thing which is not correct, an error of judgment 6.16 It is considered that the relevant part of this definition, in the context of section 141B(1B), is merely that something is not correct. This view supports the approach of the above quotation from the TIB item: a mistake in the recording of numbers in a return refers to the mis-recording of numbers or processing errors in a return. This view is also appropriate to the context, as section 141B(1) refers to “making a mistake in the calculation or recording of numbers”. 36 6.17 An “error of judgment” that results in an unacceptable tax position is, effectively, a tax position taken by choice, albeit that it is the incorrect choice. As such it is considered that this meaning of “mistake” is not that intended by the legislation, in this context of providing an exclusion from a shortfall penalty for taking an unacceptable tax position. Therefore, in the following discussion, mistake will be considered to mean merely “a thing which is not correct”, rather than an “error of judgment”. 6.18 Accordingly, it is considered that, in situations where it is clear that figures have been mistakenly transposed in a return, for example 102 instead of 201, for the purpose of section 141B(1B), such an error is a mistake in the recording of a number in a return. In such a situation, it is considered that a taxpayer has not taken an unacceptable tax position. The mistake is unintentional, not an error of judgment and, therefore, it is within the exclusion set out in section 141B(1B). An error of judgment is considered to be a deliberate choice. 6.19 Such a mistake in the calculation or recording of numbers in a return can occur in a number of situations. For example, a number could be correctly recorded in the working papers, but incorrectly transferred into the tax return. Alternatively, the working papers could be incorrect through a mis-recording of numbers or a calculation mistake and these mistakes could be carried through into the return. In this latter situation, section 141B(1B) would apply, as there is still either a mistake in the calculation, or in the recording of numbers and those numbers are contained in a return. In each of the situations, if the result is a tax shortfall, it is considered that section 141B(1B) provides that the taxpayer has not taken an unacceptable tax position. 6.20 For completeness, it is noted that, although in this situation the taxpayer is considered not to have taken an unacceptable tax position, section 141A(4) provides that “a taxpayer who makes a mistake in the calculation or recording of numbers in a return” is not excluded from being liable for a penalty for not taking reasonable care. Section 141A(4) states: (4) Subsection (3) and section 141B(1B) do not exclude a taxpayer who makes a mistake in the calculation or recording of numbers in a return from being liable for a penalty for not taking reasonable care. 6.21 It is noted that section 141A(4) does not provide that a taxpayer who makes a mistake in the calculation or recording of numbers in a return is necessarily liable for a shortfall penalty under section 141A for not taking reasonable care, merely that such penalty is not excluded. Conclusion 6.22 Based on the above discussion, it is concluded that a mistake in the recording of numbers in a return refers to an unintentional mis-recording of numbers in the taxpayer’s tax return. Such a mistake may be, for example, the transposition of numbers (e.g. 102 instead of 201). It is considered that, in the context of section 141B(1B), the intention is to provide an exclusion from a shortfall penalty for taking an unacceptable tax position where the mistake is a 37 result of a calculation error or a mis-recording of numbers in the taxpayer’s tax return. It is considered that a mistake, which is an error of judgment, is not within the ambit of section 141B(1B) exclusion, whereas it is considered that a taxpayer who takes a tax position as a result of an unintentional mis-recording of numbers in a return, has not taken an unacceptable tax position, although the taxpayer may still be liable for not taking reasonable care pursuant to section 141A(4). 6.23 It is considered that where section 141B(1B) refers to a mistake in the recording of numbers in a return, the section is referring to situations where an incorrect number is unintentionally recorded in the tax return; where the right number is recorded in the working papers, but it is transferred incorrectly into the tax return; and where an unintentional mis-recording of a number is made in the working papers, and that mistake is carried through into the tax return. In each of the situations, if the result is a tax shortfall, it is considered that section 141B(1B) provides that the taxpayer has not taken an unacceptable tax position, although the taxpayer may still be liable for not taking reasonable care pursuant to section 141A(4). Monetary threshold increased 6.24 With application to tax positions taken on or after 1 April 2003, section 141B(2) provides that the threshold levels, which the tax shortfall must exceed for a taxpayer to be liable for a tax shortfall penalty for taking an unacceptable tax position, have increased. The current section 141B(2) states: (2) A taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty if the taxpayer takes an unacceptable tax position and the tax shortfall arising from the taxpayer’s tax position is more than both— (a) $20,000; and (b) the lesser of $250,000 and 1% of the taxpayer’s total tax figure for the relevant return period. 6.25 Therefore, as discussed above (refer paragraphs 4.19 – 4.25), to ascertain if the taxpayer’s tax shortfall exceeds the threshold levels, it is necessary to establish the taxpayer’s total tax figure. Section 141B(3) defines “total tax figure” (refer paragraph 3.3). Section 141B(4) then sets out the amount of the shortfall penalty (refer paragraph 3.3). Timing and acceptability of “any interpretation” 6.26 Section 141B(5) provides that the time at which the acceptability or not of any interpretation of a tax law is determined at the time a tax position is taken and as discussed above, section 141B(7) sets out the matters that must be considered in relation to whether an unacceptable tax position has been taken. These two sections were not changed by the Taxation (Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003. Section 141B(5) states: (5) For the purposes of this section, the question whether any interpretation of a tax law is acceptable or unacceptable shall be determined as at the time at which the taxpayer takes the taxpayer's tax position. 38 REDUCTIONS, INCREASES AND A CAP ON THE SHORTFALL PENALTY Overview 6.27 The shortfall penalty for taking an unacceptable tax position is subject to various possible reductions of the shortfall penalty payable. These are provided for under sections 141FB (previous behaviour), 141G (voluntary disclosure), 141H (disclosure of unacceptable tax position) and 141I (temporary shortfall). However, section 141J (limitation of reduction) provides where the taxpayer qualifies for a reduction in shortfall penalty under section 141G or section 141H and also where there is a temporary tax shortfall, the shortfall penalty is reduced only once and that will be by 75%. 6.28 Although the above sections provide for the shortfall penalty to be reduced in a number of situations, the shortfall penalty payable for taking an unacceptable tax position is also subject to 25% increase, under section 141K, if the taxpayer obstructs the Commissioner in determining the correct tax position. 6.29 Section 141JAA, which applies only to tax positions taken on or after 1 April 2003, provides that the shortfall penalty payable by the taxpayer for taking an unacceptable tax position may not be more than $50,000, if the taxpayer voluntarily discloses the tax shortfall or the Commission determines the shortfall within specified time limits, and provided section 141K does not apply. Shortfall penalty reductions 6.30 Section 141FB provides for the tax shortfall penalty of 20%, for taking an unacceptable tax position, to be reduced by 50% to a tax shortfall penalty of 10%, where there has been prior good compliance by the taxpayer. For section 141FB, effective 26 March 2003 until 21 December 2004, this is provided in section 141FB(2), refer paragraph 3.8 above. For section 141FB, effective 21 December 2004, this is provided in section 141FB(2), as set out in paragraph 3.9 above. 6.31 In the case of a penalty for taking an unacceptable tax position in respect of GST, FBT, PAYE or RWT, if the taxpayer has not been liable to pay a tax shortfall penalty relating to the same tax type within the previous two years (not being a penalty reduced for voluntary disclosure), the 50% reduction provided for under section 141FB can apply. For other tax types, there is a four year period of “good behaviour” required. The reduction applies separately for each type of tax such as PAYE, income tax and GST. A penalty imposed in respect of one tax does not mean that the reduction is not available for other tax types. If the taxpayer has made a voluntary disclosure, this does not interrupt the taxpayer’s good behaviour period. Section 141FB applies to a tax position that a taxpayer takes on or after 1 April 2000, unless the taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty before 26 March 2003. 6.32 Section 141G provides for reducing the shortfall penalty for voluntary disclosure of the tax shortfall. The relevant parts of section 141G state: 39 141G. Reduction in penalty for voluntary disclosure of tax shortfall— (1) A shortfall penalty payable by a taxpayer under any of sections 141A to 141EB may be reduced if, in the Commissioner's opinion, the taxpayer makes a full voluntary disclosure to the Commissioner of all the details of the tax shortfall, either— (a) Before the taxpayer is first notified of a pending tax audit or investigation (referred to in this section as “pre-notification disclosure''); or (b) After the taxpayer is notified of a pending tax audit or investigation, but before the Commissioner starts the audit or investigation (referred to in this section as “post-notification disclosure''). ... (3) The level by which the shortfall penalty is reduced— (a) For pre-notification disclosure is 75%: (b) For post-notification disclosure is 40%. (4) A taxpayer is deemed to have been notified of a pending tax audit or investigation, or that the tax audit or investigation has started, if— (a) The taxpayer; or (b) An officer of the taxpayer; or (c) A shareholder of the taxpayer, if the taxpayer is a close company; or (d) A tax adviser acting for the taxpayer; or (e) A partner in partnership with the taxpayer; or (f) A person acting for or on behalf of or as a fiduciary of the taxpayer,— is notified of the pending tax audit or investigation, or that the tax audit or investigation has started. (5) An audit or investigation starts at the earlier of— (a) The end of the first interview an officer of the Department has with the taxpayer or the taxpayer's representative after the taxpayer receives the notice referred to in subsection (4); and (b) The time when— (i) An officer of the Department inspects information (including books or records) of the taxpayer after the taxpayer receives the notice referred to in subsection (4); and (ii) The taxpayer is notified of the inspection. 6.33 Section 141H provides that the shortfall penalty payable by the taxpayer may be reduced if the taxpayer makes adequate disclosure of the taxpayer’s tax position at the time the tax position is taken. Section 141H states: 141H. Reduction for disclosure of unacceptable tax position— (1) A shortfall penalty payable by a taxpayer under section 141B or section 141D maybe reduced if, in the Commissioner's opinion, the taxpayer makes adequate disclosure of the taxpayer's tax position at the time, determined under section 141B(6), the taxpayer takes the taxpayer's tax position. 40 (2) The level by which a shortfall penalty is to be reduced for adequate disclosure is 75%. (3) The Commissioner may from time to time specify— (a) The type of information required for adequate disclosure; and (b) The form in which the information must be provided. 6.34 Where there is a temporary tax shortfall, section 141I provides for reducing the shortfall penalty. The relevant part of the section states: 141I. Reduction where temporary shortfall— (1) A shortfall penalty payable by a taxpayer under any of sections 141A to 141EB must be reduced if and to the extent that the tax shortfall is temporary. (2) The level by which a shortfall penalty is to be reduced for a temporary tax shortfall is 75% of the penalty that applies to all or that part of the tax shortfall that is a temporary tax shortfall. (3) A tax shortfall is a temporary tax shortfall for a return period if the Commissioner is satisfied that— (a) The tax shortfall has been permanently reversed or corrected in an earlier or later return period, so that (disregarding penalties or interest) the taxpayer pays the correct amount of tax or calculates and returns the correct tax liability in respect of the item or matter that gave rise to the tax shortfall; and (b) No tax shortfall will arise in a later return period in respect of a similar item or matter; and (c) No arrangement exists in any return period which has the purpose or effect of creating a further related tax deferral or advantage; and (d) The tax shortfall was permanently reversed or corrected before the taxpayer is first notified of a pending tax audit or investigation. The application of section 141J 6.35 A shortfall penalty payable by the taxpayer, for example, under section 141B (for taking an unacceptable tax position), may qualify to be reduced under sections 141G or 141H (for making a voluntary disclosure in accordance with these provisions), and also under section 141I (if the shortfall penalty is payable in respect of a temporary shortfall). Therefore, it appears that these provisions have the potential to provide for a 75% reduction under section 141G or 141H and also a 75% reduction under section 141I. However, in this situation, section 141J limits the reductions available for the taxpayer. Section 141J provides: 141J. Limitation on reduction of shortfall penalty— If— (a) A taxpayer who is liable to pay a shortfall penalty makes a voluntary disclosure in accordance with section 141G or section 141H; and (b) The shortfall penalty is payable in respect of a temporary tax shortfall,— the shortfall penalty— (c) Is to be reduced only once; and 41 (d) Will be reduced by 75%. \[emphasis added\] 6.36 Accordingly, where a taxpayer may qualify for their shortfall penalty payable under sections 141B to be reduced under more than one of the reduction provisions, section 141J provides that the shortfall penalty will be reduced only once and, as set out in section 141J(d), that reduction will be 75%. 6.37 As section 141J provides for a limitation on some shortfall penalty reductions, this section can only effectively apply after the application of the reduction provisions. Shortfall penalty monetary cap 6.38 Section 141JAA provides that “a shortfall penalty payable by a taxpayer ... for taking an unacceptable tax position, may not be more than $50,000”, provided the other conditions of the section are met. The section states: (1) Despite section 141J, a shortfall penalty payable by a taxpayer for not taking reasonable care, or for taking an unacceptable tax position, may not be more than $50,000 if the taxpayer voluntarily discloses the shortfall, or the Commissioner determines the shortfall, no later than the date that is the later of— ... 6.39 It is noted that, unlike sections 141FB, 141G, 141H and 141I, section 141JAA does not actually “reduce” the penalty. It merely provides that the penalty may not be more than $50,000. The only way in which it can be determined that the penalty would otherwise be more than $50,000 is to work through the sections needed to calculate the shortfall penalty payable. Therefore, it is necessary to consider section 141B, under which the penalty originates, and then apply the reduction provisions, as modified by section 141J. 6.40 It is also noted that although section 141JAA refers to “a shortfall penalty payable by the taxpayer ... for taking an unacceptable tax position”, the section does not specifically refer to section 141B; the provision under which this shortfall penalty originates. 6.41 This contrasts with the terminology used in the reduction provisions, which specifically refers to the shortfall penalty payable under the relevant originating section. (For the present discussion, the originating sections are sections 141A to 141EB, but, as noted above, section 141JAA is applicable only to shortfall penalties that originate from section 141A and 141B.) 6.42 It is considered that this difference in the terminology supports the view that the shortfall penalty payable by the taxpayer, to which section 141JAA applies, is that payable under the originating provision, but reduced by the applicable reduction provisions. Accordingly, it would be not be appropriate for section 141JAA to refer to the penalty payable under section 141B, when the penalty that originated under that provision may have been reduced by the application of the reduction provisions. 42 6.43 Although the use of “despite” at the beginning of section 141JAA could indicate that section 141JAA is to be applied either “after applying” section 141J or “to the exclusion of” section 141J, it is considered that, in the context of the whole of section 141, section 141JAA should not be applied to the exclusion of section 141J, but after section 141J (in situations where the application of section 141J is appropriate). Therefore, it would follow that section 141JAA should also be applied after the reduction provisions. 6.44 The alpha numeric order of the particular provisions also supports the view that section 141JAA should be applied after the application of the reduction provisions. Although not conclusive in itself, it is considered that, had it been intended that the capping provision of section 141JAA be applied before the reduction sections, the capping provision would have been inserted in a location before the reduction provisions. 6.45 Accordingly, it is considered that it is only by applying the reduction provisions first, that the “shortfall penalty payable”, to which section 141JAA refers, can be determined. The application of section 141JAA can then provide a cap to the shortfall penalty, if the time requirements of section 141JAA are met. 6.46 A final point to consider, in this respect, is the reason for setting the cap for these penalties at $50,000 under section 141JAA. The discussion document “\[2001\] Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review” states: 8.35 A monetary cap on the shortfall penalty for lack of reasonable care will be introduced. Such a cap would ensure that the penalty for such breaches is not out of step with other monetary penalties imposed under the Tax Administration Act. In addition, a cap is likely to reduce compliance and administrative costs as taxpayers will have less incentive to dispute the imposition of a penalty they consider unfair. 8.36 The cap will be set at $50,000 per tax position, which equates to the maximum criminal penalty imposed under the Income Tax Act. Taxpayers who deliberately attempt to abuse the existence of this cap will risk incurring the uncapped gross carelessness penalty (set at 40 percent of the shortfall). To ensure that taxpayers still have an incentive to take reasonable care over very significant tax positions, the cap will be limited to those shortfalls identified through voluntary disclosure or Inland Revenue audit within two months of filing the return. \[emphasis added\] 6.47 Accordingly, if section 141JAA was applied before the other reduction provisions, the correspondence with the maximum criminal penalty would be defeated. Section 141JAA applies after the reduction provisions 6.48 It is considered that the shortfall penalties payable by the taxpayer for taking an unacceptable tax position under section 141B, are reduced, as applicable by the reduction provisions, before the application of section 141JAA. It is also considered that section 141JAA is applied after the application of section 141J, if the taxpayer is eligible for deductions under sections 141G or 141H 43 and also section 141I. Accordingly, under the reduction provisions, the shortfall penalty payable by the taxpayer for not taking reasonable care or for taking an unacceptable tax position is to be reduced only once and that is by 75%. Then, if section 141JAA is also applicable, the resultant shortfall penalty payable for taking an unacceptable tax position may not be more than $50,000 if the taxpayer either voluntarily discloses the shortfall or the Commissioner determines the shortfall within the given time periods. 6.49 This view also means that the intended correspondence of the capped shortfall penalty under section 141JAA with the maximum criminal penalty is maintained. 6.50 Therefore, it is the Commissioner’s view that the section 141JAA cap of $50,000, on the shortfall penalty payable by a taxpayer for taking an unacceptable tax position is only applicable after all other relevant reductions have been made, including the limiting provision of section 141J. 6.51 It should be noted that section 141JAA also applies to shortfall penalties under section 141A for not taking reasonable care. This is discussed in the Interpretation Statement IS00053. Section 141JAA provides 6.52 Prima facie, there are two situations when the shortfall penalty for taking an unacceptable tax position may not be more than $50,000. These are: • if the taxpayer voluntarily discloses the shortfall; or • the Commissioner determines the shortfall, provided these events occur within the time constraints set out in section 141JAA (1)(a) and (b). 6.53 “Commissioner” is defined in section 3 as meaning: “Commissioner of Inland Revenue”, or “Commissioner”, means the Commissioner of Inland Revenue appointed or deemed to have been appointed under this Act; and includes any person for the time being authorised to exercise or perform any of the powers, duties, or functions of the Commissioner: 6.54 Accordingly, in the clause “the Commissioner determines the shortfall”, it is considered that “Commissioner” (i.e. the person who determines the shortfall) includes any person for the time being authorised to exercise or perform any of the powers, duties or functions of the Commissioner. 6.55 Before going on to consider the meaning of “determines” in this context, it is helpful to consider what it is that must be determined, i.e. “the shortfall”. What is “the shortfall”? 6.56 In the context of section 141JAA, it is considered that “the shortfall”, that the Commissioner determines, refers to “the tax shortfall”, as it is only in respect 44 of a tax shortfall that the shortfall penalties, referred to in section 141JAA, apply. “Tax shortfall” is defined in section 3 of the Act as follows: “Tax shortfall”, for a return period, means the difference between the tax effect of— (a) A taxpayer's tax position for the return period; and (b) The correct tax position for that period,— when the taxpayer's tax position results in too little tax paid or payable by the taxpayer or another person or overstates a tax benefit, credit, or advantage of any type or description whatever by or benefiting (as the case may be) the taxpayer or another person: 6.57 A tax shortfall indicates that there is a difference between the correct tax position and the taxpayer’s tax position. Therefore, it is considered that if “the Commissioner determines the shortfall”; the Commissioner determines the difference between the correct tax position and the taxpayer’s tax position. As the difference is between two amounts, it is considered that section 141JAA requires the Commissioner to determine the amount of the tax shortfall. 6.58 It follows that for section 141JAA to apply, which only applies if “a shortfall penalty is payable by a taxpayer for not taking reasonable care or for taking an unacceptable tax position”, the amount of the tax shortfall must be disclosed by the taxpayer or determined by the Commissioner. Ordinary meaning of determines 6.59 As “determines” is not defined in section 3 of the Act or section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, it is appropriate to consider the ordinary meaning of the word. 6.60 The “Shorter Oxford Dictionary” 5th Ed (2002) provides the following relevant definition: determine: verb trans 4 settle or decide ( a dispute, controversy, etc., or a sentence, conclusion, issue, etc.) as a judge or arbiter 6.61 Using this definition, it appears that, in the context of section 141JAA, when “the Commissioner determines the shortfall”, the Commissioner makes a decision about the shortfall or decides the shortfall. Typically, the Commissioner would decide the shortfall as a result of an audit, but the means by which “the Commissioner determines the shortfall” are not defined in the legislation. Interpretation of “determines” by the courts 6.62 The meaning of “determines” was discussed by the Supreme Court of Victoria in City of Heidelberg v McPherson \[1964\] VR 783. The relevant section in that case used the words “... where any council determines that the execution of any works of the construction of a private street is necessary”. Although the provision is different, it is helpful to note that the Court described the meaning of “determines” as “decides or forms the opinion” (p 785). 45 6.63 In Muir v Inland Revenue Commissioners \[1966\] 3 All ER 38, the English Court of Appeal considered the meaning of the phrase: An appeal, once determined by the commissioners, shall be final, and neither the determination of the commissioners nor the assessment made thereon shall be altered, except ... (s. 50 (2) Income Tax Act 1952) 6.64 The court held that: It is plain that there the words “determined” and “determination” are equivalent to: decided and decision ... (p 48) 6.65 Although referring to the word in the past tense, this view mirrors that of the Australian court in the City of Heidelberg case: to determine is to decide. This meaning is consistent with the ordinary meaning of “determine”, i.e. “settle or decide as a judge or arbiter”. In each case, something is decided by the party who is determining it. 6.66 To consider the application of this meaning in the context of the legislation, it is appropriate to consider some of the background to the introduction of section 141JAA. Background to the introduction of section 141JAA 6.67 Section 141JAA was inserted in the Act by the enactment of the Taxation (Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003. 6.68 As part of the preliminary consultation process prior to enactment of the Taxation (Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003, a discussion document, “Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review (August 2001) was issued for comment. Under Chapter 8 of the document, “Two further issues relating to shortfall penalties”, the document outlined the following background and proposed reform: Additional issue: A cap on the penalty for lack of reasonable care Background 8.33 Where a tax shortfall is large, the corresponding shortfall penalty is also large. In most cases this is appropriate – but the Government is concerned about the application of the lack of reasonable care penalty to very large errors which are speedily identified and correct. For example, a business taxpayer under calculated their GST outputs by $45 million and, because no systems were in place to identify this shortfall, the under-calculation results in unpaid GST of $5 million. Inland Revenue identities the shortfall and determines a lack of reasonable care: the penalty is $1 million. 8.34 Given the nature of the breach, the Government considered the size of the penalty in such cases is excessive. 46 Proposed reform 8.35 A monetary cap on the shortfall penalty for lack of reasonable care will be introduced. Such a cap would ensure that the penalty for such breaches is not out of step with other monetary penalties imposed under the Tax Administration Act. In addition, a cap is likely to reduce compliance and administrative costs as taxpayers will have less incentive to dispute the imposition of a penalty they consider unfair. 8.36 The cap will be set at $50,000 per tax position, which equates to the maximum criminal penalty imposed under the Income Tax Act. Taxpayers who deliberately attempt to abuse the existence of this cap will risk incurring the uncapped gross carelessness penalty (set at 40 percent of the shortfall). To ensure that taxpayers still have an incentive to take reasonable care over very significant tax positions, the cap will be limited to those shortfalls identified through voluntary disclosure or Inland Revenue audit within two months of filing the return. \[emphasis added\] 6.69 From the discussion document, it appears that the intention of the proposed reform was that the cap would be limited to tax shortfalls identified through voluntary disclosure or Inland Revenue audit, within the required time limit. Timing of “determines” 6.70 It is noted that no reference was made in the proposal for the legislation requiring either a NOPA to be issued or for an agreed adjustment to be obtained, before the $50,000 monetary cap be applied to the shortfall penalty payable by the taxpayer. Further, a NOPA is the first step in the disputes resolution process and the imposition of the penalty will not necessarily be a matter which proceeds under the disputes resolution process. Therefore, it is not be appropriate to equate the word “determines” with “has issued a NOPA”. 6.71 For similar reasons, “the Commissioner determines” cannot relate to the decision of Adjudication (or other assessing officer), at the end of the disputes resolution process, as the time limits in the disputes resolution process for the various documents are such that this process could not be completed within the time set out in section 141JAA. It is also inappropriate to require an adjustment to be agreed by the taxpayer within the time limits as the taxpayer has a statutory right to dispute or challenge their assessment. Further, section 141JAA refers to “determines” in the context of the situation where “the Commissioner determines the tax shortfall”. Therefore, on the legislation, it appears that once the Commissioner (or one of his authorised officers) decides that there is a relevant tax shortfall within the time limits set out in the section, the cap applies. 6.72 This view is supported by the fact that the legislation provides for no particular process by which the Commissioner communicates the fact to the taxpayer that a shortfall is “determined” or decided within the terms of section 141JAA. The legislation merely requires either the voluntary disclosure of a shortfall by the taxpayer within the time limits, for which a penalty in excess of $50,000 is payable by the taxpayer for taking an unacceptable tax position, or the 47 Commissioner decides that there is such a shortfall within the time limits, is sufficient for the application of the section. Conclusion 6.73 Section 141JAA was enacted with the intention of rewarding the taxpayer who voluntarily discloses a shortfall within the given time limits or for whom the Commissioner decides that there is a relevant shortfall, within the given time limits. This latter case may occur, for example, in an audit where an investigator identifies a relevant tax shortfall. The essence is that, for the monetary cap to apply, the relevant tax shortfall is either disclosed by the taxpayer within the time limits or a person, authorised by the Commissioner, decides that there is a relevant tax shortfall, within the time limits. The section does not require the Commissioner to issue a NOPA in respect of the tax shortfall or obtain an agreed adjustment within the given time limits. Accordingly, it is considered that the taxpayer should benefit from the monetary cap as soon as the Commissioner (as defined in section 3) decides the amount of the shortfall, if the time requirements of section 141JAA are met and section 141K does not apply. Related Standard Practice Statements 6.74 The following related Standard Practice Statements may also assist in the interpretation and application of the above adjustment provisions to the shortfall penalty for taking an unacceptable tax position: • INV-231 Temporary Shortfall – permanent reversal (published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 11, No 8 (September 1999)); • INV-251 Voluntary Disclosures (published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 14, No 4 (April 2002)); • INV-260 Notification of a Pending Audit or Investigation (published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 2 (February 2000)); and • INV-295 Reduction of Shortfall Penalties for Previous Behaviour (published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 16, No 3 (April 2004)). Summary - changes relevant to a taxpayer’s tax position taken on or after 1 April 2003 • To take an unacceptable tax position, a taxpayer is required to take a tax position that when viewed objectively fails to meet the standard of being about as likely as not to be correct. Section 141B(1) • Although the making of an “interpretation or an interpretation of an application of a tax law” is no longer required for the application of section 141B, an unacceptable interpretation of the law can give rise to an unacceptable tax position. Section 141B(6) • The threshold levels which a tax shortfall must exceed to qualify as an unacceptable tax position have increased. Section 141B(2) 48 • Penalties of 20% may be reduced to 10% as a result of a taxpayer’s prior good compliance. Sections 141FB(2) and (3) • Subject to certain conditions, the shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable or taking an unacceptable tax position is capped at $50,000. Section 141JAA(1). 49
\[Interpretation statement IS0056 issued by Adjudication & Rulings in April 2003\] TAX TREATMENT OF PAYMENTS RECEIVED BY PETROL RETAILERS IN RETURN FOR TRADE TIES In Public Information Bulletin 178 (February 1989), in an item entitled “Petrol Retailers—Inducement Payments Paid by Oil Companies” the Commissioner outlined his views regarding the general position on the income tax treatment of payments received by petrol retailers in return for trade ties. In particular, the item stated that lump sum payments made in return for trade ties would not be assessable. The Court of Appeal in Birkdale Service Station v CIR (2000) 19 NZTC 15,981 has reiterated that for income tax purposes the method of payment does not determine whether an amount received by a petrol retailer is capital or revenue. Accordingly, the Commissioner advises that the item in PIB 178 (referred to above) is withdrawn, as it is not consistent with the approach the Court of Appeal has set out for determining whether a lump sum amount is capital or income. Taxpayers and agents should refer to the commentary below for general assistance concerning the proper character of trade tie payments received by petrol retailers. Birkdale Service Station v CIR (2000) 19 NZTC 15,981 The relevant taxpayers in the Birkdale case were five retail service station proprietors and one used vehicle dealer and the case considered whether lump sum trade tie inducement (or compensation) payments made to the taxpayers by an oil company were capital or income. While the precise nature of the commitments differed, each case involved a written contract stipulating that certain payments, called inducement or compensation payments, would be made by the oil company in consideration for the retailers entering into an exclusive supply (trade tie) agreement. The Commissioner assessed the payments as income under section 65(2)(a), section 65(2)(e) and section 65(2)(l) of the Income Tax Act 1976 (the present equivalent sections are CD 3, CD 4 and CD5 of the Income Tax Act 1994). The taxpayers indicated that while there were differences in the specific provisions contained in the different contracts between the oil company and each of them, those factual differences did not produce a requirement to distinguish between them. The broad facts of each case were that the retailers entered into a series of interrelated agreements; including a standard inducement agreement, a retail supply agreement and an equipment loan contract, in return for inducement payments. In each case there were two separate inducement payments, the first being for an initial agreement, and then a second payment for an agreement negotiated following the expiry of the first. However, in one case the trade tie was secured by a 15 year lease of the premises and land to the oil company, and a sub-lease back to the retailer. In that case, at any time during the 15 year term the oil company had the right to call upon the retailer to enter into a redevelopment of the site, and if the retailer did not within a short time negotiate satisfactory terms with the oil company, the oil company 1 could pay the retailer the value of the site improvements and take a 20 year lease at ground rent, again with a corresponding sublease back to the retailer. There was also a restrictive covenant preventing the retailer and its shareholders from trading in competition with the outlet from other premises within a 10 kilometre radius of the premises during the lease term. The correct approach The judgment of the Court of Appeal was delivered by Blanchard J, and began by stating that the High Court (Birkdale Service Station v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,493) followed the correct approach (at p. 15,987): Laurenson J in the High Court adopted the correct approach in order to determine whether the lump sum payments were capital or income. It was that followed by the Privy Council in Wattie and to be found in the following passage from the advice of the Privy Council delivered by Lord Pearce in BP Australia v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia \[1966\] AC 224 at p 264: The solution to the problem is not to be found by any rigid test or description. It has to be derived from many aspects of the whole set of circumstances some of which may point in one direction, some in the other. One consideration may point so clearly that it dominates other and vaguer indications in the contrary direction. It is a commonsense appreciation of all the guiding features which must provide the ultimate answer. Although the categories of capital and income expenditure are distinct and easily ascertainable in obvious cases that lie far from the boundary, the line of distinction is often hard to draw in border line cases; and conflicting considerations may produce a situation where the answer turns on questions of emphasis and degree. That answer: “depends on what the expenditure is calculated to effect from a practical and business point of view rather than on the juristic classification of the legal rights, if any, secured employed or exhausted in the process”: per Dixon J in Hallstroms Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1946) 72 CLR 634, 648. The Court of Appeal then noted that in applying the above approach, the background to the transaction was of “considerable importance”. In the context of the actual case, the Court recognised that there were no multi-brand retailers in New Zealand at the time of the relevant agreements, and that the contractual freedom of the retailers was thus in practical terms limited to their ability to make a choice between four wholesalers and to negotiate the term and amount. Further, the Court noted that the businesses of the retailers were described by one witness as “marginal” and that if they were minded to continue to operate their business in the deregulated environment they had in reality no choice but to tie themselves to one of the four major wholesalers (at p. 15,988). Other trade tie cases discussed in Birkdale The appellants referred the Court to three cases in particular where lump sum payments made in return for trade ties had been characterised as capital. The cases were: Commrs of IR v Coia 1959 SC 89, Dickenson v FCT (1958) 98 CLR 460 and C of IR v Dunlops (Wanganui) Ltd \[1970\] NZLR 1125. These cases were briefly discussed in the judgment of Blanchard J. In Coia the retailer gave up being a multi-brand outlet, and accepted a payment in return for a 10 year tie with an oil company. In the leading judgment Lord Clyde 2 observed that the retailer had expended the monies on capital outlays. However, he also stated that the payment was made in return for a trade tie, the acceptance of which required the retailer to give up his unrestricted freedom to trade as he wished and required him to accept petrol at the oil company’s posted prices. Lord Patrick concurred, stating that the retailer had given up a valuable asset of a capital nature in ceasing to be a multi-brand retailer and accepting the payment in return for a trade tie of 10 years. In Dickenson the taxpayer accepted payment in return for a 10 year trade tie with an oil company, having been a multi-brand retailer prior to entering into the tie. The oil company’s rights were also secured by a 10 year lease and sub-lease (similar to the arrangement in the case of one of the retailers in Birkdale). The majority of the High Court of Australia found that the payments were of a capital nature. Dixon CJ said that: The appellant’s business constituted a profit-yielding organisation of a definite structure under his control and he received the money as part of an inducement to change a feature in it. The feature to be changed was the use of a plurality of petrols and oils, and this was replaced by a restriction to the purchase and sale of the products of one company. (p. 474) The Chief Justice added that there was nothing recurrent in the nature of the payment. It was not a normal or natural incident of carrying on such a business and it did not represent a purpose for which such a business was carried on. In addition, Kitto J stated that the payment seemed to be made in return for a substantial and enduring detraction from pre-existing rights, and the restriction took a substantial piece out of the ordinary scope of business activities in which the taxpayer would otherwise have been engaged: But a lump sum payment for a restriction of a garage and its proprietor to one brand of petroleum products for a period of ten years, effectuated by means of a lease and sub-lease of the premises as well as by personal covenants, seems in the nature of a sale price for a substantial and enduring detraction from pre-existing rights. The restriction does not strike my mind as an obligation undertaken incidentally to the carrying on of the business. Rather it does take a substantial piece out of the ordinary scope of business activities to which otherwise the appellant might apply himself and for which he might use his premises....(p. 492) The Dunlops case was a decision of the New Zealand Court of Appeal. In this case the taxpayer had, until 1961, sold all available brands of petrol. In that year an oil company offered a lump sum payment if the company would sell that company’s petrol only. North P concluded that the payment had been made in consideration of the retailer giving up a part of its business and confining itself to a more limited field. The other members of the Court agreed. Following the discussion of these cases in Birkdale, Blanchard J stated that: The question of whether the payment for an asset is received as capital or income turns in our view upon the nature of the asset in the hands of the seller. Is it sold as a capital asset or is the seller disposing of it in the carrying on of the operations of a business or in pursuance of a particular venture? Are the retailers in their particular circumstances to be seen as having disposed of a part of their businesses, as the retailers did in Coia, Dickenson and Dunlops, or did they accept the sums of compensation as an incident of the carrying on of their businesses without any change of a structural nature having occurred? In other words, the question is what the retailers’ acceptance of Mobil’s payments effected from a practical and business point of view, to adapt Dixon J’s words in Hallstroms. 3 (p. 15,991) Relevant factors to consider In the Birkdale case the Court of Appeal considered the following factors to be relevant in determining what the trade tie payments effected from a practical and business point of view: 1. the fact that little was surrendered by the retailers, 2. the length of the trade ties, and 3. the proper accounting treatment. 1. Little was surrendered by the retailers In this regard the Court stated: ...the appellant’s apparent freedom to contract as they wished for purchases of motor spirits was illusory. In reality, each had no choice, if it wished to remain in business, other than to accept a tie to one of the four oil companies. It was merely a matter of choosing for which one of them the retailer would become an “agent” and negotiating the period of the tie, the amount of the payment to be received upfront and the applicable conditions. The details of the arrangements were not likely to vary much at all as between the oil companies, for the reasons already stated. There is no doubt that Mobil imposed quite severe restrictions and controls, including the right of first refusal. But the effect of these on the pre-existing business structure had to be measured against the situation in which the retailers found themselves upon deregulation of the industry. Importantly in this case therefore, the retailers in reality had no choice but to tie themselves to one of four oil companies. This point “readily distinguished the present case from the three cited to us by the appellant, \[being\] Coia, Dickenson and Dunlops” (at p. 15,992) all of which involved the retailers giving up the ability to continue as a multi-brand retailer. The Court found that in addition to not giving up any significant freedom, the structure of the business of the appellants had hardly changed, stating: Therefore, in accepting the trade tie payments, the appellants were not giving up a significant freedom. In addition, the other features of the structure of the business had hardly changed. There was no alteration in the ownership of the land or the chattels employed in the conduct of the business, nor in their nature. ... The manner of conducting the business of the retailer may have changed because of the contractual requirements imposed by Mobil on service station operations. But that involved the way in which the revenues were to be derived rather than an alteration in the structure from which they were derived. (at p. 15,992) The degree of structural alteration the Court considered significant enough to render the transaction an affair of capital can be seen in the judgment relating to the Kenlock 2 arrangement. In this regard, the Court stated: 4 ... Two factors, both singly and even more powerfully in combination, convince us that Kenlock 2 is different from the other arrangements. They are, first, that Mobil obtained security for its tie by means of a 15 year lease with a sublease to Kenlock on a back-to-back basis and, secondly, that the term for which Kenlock became committed to Mobil was potentially very substantially longer than 15 years.... There was also a restrictive covenant preventing Kenlock and its shareholders from trading in competition with the outlet from other premises within a 10 kilometre radius of the premises during the lease term. Even though the choices realistically open to Kenlock Motors were no greater than for the other retailers, or for itself when it entered into Kenlock 1, on accepting such terms of Kenlock 2, particularly by the granting of a long term interest in its land and buildings, we consider that Kenlock Motors was altering its business structure in such a material way that the payment it received in exchange has to be regarded as of a capital nature. (at p. 15,995) 2. The length of the trade ties None of the initial ties in the Birkdale case were longer than five years. The Court noted the weight given to the length of the ties in the judgments in Regent Oil v Strick (Inspector of Taxes) \[1966\] AC 295, and cited a passage from BP Australia v C of T \[1966\] AC 224 (adapting the words to the position of a recipient rather than a payer): Length of time, though theoretically not a deciding factor, does in practice shed a light on the nature of the advantage \[granted\]. The longer the duration of the agreements, the greater the indication that a structural solution was being sought. Blanchard J additionally said: The length of the trade ties also distinguishes the present case from the three cited to us by counsel for the appellants. In the present case, in no instance was the initial tie for a period of more than five years and in two cases it was as short as three years. Although, in theory, at the end of that period the retailer could switch to another wholesaler, the best that could actually be hoped for was the renegotiation of a further package either with Mobil or possibly with one of the other oil companies. (p. 15,993) 3. The proper accounting treatment The Court noted that the evidence showed that proper accounting treatment showed the payments should be taken into the revenue account of the retailer. Although it was stated that such a requirement was not determinative, the Court stated it did provide a minor degree of support for the view that the payments were revenue in nature. Conclusion In the Birkdale case, the background and commercial context of the transactions pointed towards a conclusion that the payments were received in the ordinary course of business. The lack of structural alterations to the business structure of the retailers (in all but the case where the tie was secured by a long term interest in the land and buildings of a retailer and accompanied by restrictive trading covenants) additionally supported the conclusion that the payments were revenue, and the length of the ties was insufficient to change this result. 5 In finding the payments to be of a revenue nature, the Court stated: In the end, the decision in this case comes down to the impression created by the combination of circumstances, including the length, and thus potential for recurrence in the short and medium term, of each tie, and the insignificant nature of the supposed freedom given up by the appellants.(p. 15,994) Tax treatment of payments made to petrol retailers in return for trade ties The decision in Birkdale reinforces the point that, in considering the character of a payment or receipt a conventional capital/revenue analysis should be undertaken. As was stated by the Privy Council in Wattie (1998) 18 NZTC 13,991 (and reiterated in Birkdale), the correct characterisation of a particular transaction depends upon what the transaction was calculated to effect, from a practical and business point of view. The nature of the asset in the hands of the seller is the primary consideration. Is the asset sold as a capital asset or is it sold in the carrying on of the operations of a business or in pursuance of a particular venture? The relevant consideration is therefore the nature of the payment and what is provided in return. In considering the background to the transaction in Birkdale and the recurrent nature of the agreements, the Court of Appeal discussed the argument that the receipt of a trade tie was an ordinary incident of business: The recurrent nature of each transaction is obvious and there is much force in the Commissioner’s argument that the receipt of payments in return for a trade tie ought therefore to be seen as an incident of the motor spirits retailing business... It may not be going too far, on the evidence, to say that by the time the second ties were entered into by the retailers in this case ties to wholesalers were a universal experience in New Zealand. Certainly they were common. And it is worth noting that repetition of a tie involved no change at all to the business structure, other than in relation to length of term in instances where that was different from the retailer’s first tie with Mobil. In short, the further tie and any longer period have to be considered in that context. (p. 15,993) A combination of circumstances, including the length of each tie and the insignificant nature of the supposed freedom given up by the appellants, led to the payments in Birkdale (in all cases except where the tie was secured by the long term interest in land and buildings) being revenue in nature as they were ordinary incidents of business in the commercial environment of one brand motor spirits retailing. In its focus upon the background of each transaction the Court of Appeal in Birkdale distinguished the Coia, Dickenson and Dunlops cases, making some general observations regarding the treatment of trade ties in the current commercial environment as it applies to petrol retailers. Of particular note in this emphasis upon the commercial reality of petrol retailing is the recognition that there is no multi-brand trading. In addition, the relative lack of competition between the four main oil companies also appears to have contributed to the Court’s view that the retailers were not giving up any significant freedoms in return for accepting a trade tie. The outcome in the Birkdale case suggests that the ability to enter into an exclusive supply contract is in fact a revenue “asset” in the hands of the retailer. Of note in particular is that the Court of Appeal did not consider the significant restrictions placed upon the retailers to effect any “structural” alterations to the retailers’ 6 businesses. Unless other factors are strongly indicative of a capital character, in particular significant structural alterations effected to the business (rather than its trading operations), the case suggests the Court will find such payments to be received in the ordinary course of business. Factors to consider in analysing whether a payment received by a petrol retailer in return for a trade tie is capital or revenue in nature In determining the tax treatment of payments received by petrol retailers in return for trade ties, each case will necessarily depend on its facts (rather than merely the nature of the payment). The relevant question in any case is what is the payment for, i.e. what is provided in return for the payment? Primarily, the context of commercial operations in the petrol industry means payments received in return for entering into a trade tie will be received in the ordinary course of business (and therefore will be revenue in nature), unless other factors are strongly indicative of a capital character. These factors include: • Whether the retailers have given up anything significant in return for the tie, and in particular, whether they have made structural alterations to their overall business operations. \[Note that in Birkdale the Court considered the retailers in question had no choice but to accept a trade tie with one of the four oil companies, and this was noted by the Court in the course of its finding that the retailers (except for Kenlock 2 who entered into the lease/sub-lease agreement) had not given up anything significant in return for the tie, nor had they made any significant structural alterations to their businesses.\] • The length of the trade ties, which will be relevant in considering the significance of any structural alterations (as the length of the trade tie can indicate the nature of the advantage gained). • The correct accounting treatment, while not decisive in itself, can provide support for a particular characterisation of a receipt where this is indicated by the other factors above. In the context of an agreement in the nature of a trade tie, it is the Commissioner’s view that the presence or absence of a dedicated use to which a receipt must be put is not necessarily determinative of the character of the receipt, because it is the totality of the circumstances in which the payment is received which need to be taken into account in determining the nature of that receipt in the hands of a petrol retailer. The Birkdale case makes it clear that it is not the “lump sum” nature of the payment that determines its tax consequences, as is stated in PIB 178. The nature of the payment in the hands of the recipient will be determined by what is provided in return, rather than the form of payment. In the current context of commercial operations, some retailers have little choice but to accept a tie to one of four oil companies. This appears to be an important point of difference between the cases heard prior to the issue of PIB 178 and the Birkdale case, as the earlier cases 7 8 concerned trade ties where the industry context was such that these arrangements were not the norm.
\[Interpretation statement IS0060 issued by Adjudication & Rulings in August 2004\] SHORTFALL PENALTY FOR GROSS CARELESSNESS 1. SUMMARY 1.1 All legislative references in this statement are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. 1.2 This statement provides a detailed interpretative explanation of the shortfall penalty imposed by the Commissioner under section 141C on taxpayers who are grossly careless in carrying out their tax obligations. Where a taxpayer is grossly careless, the result may be that too little tax is paid or payable or a tax benefit, credit, or advantage is overstated. This interpretation statement deals with some interpretative issues relating to the section. The main features of this statement are: • “Gross carelessness” is defined in section 141C(3) to mean doing or not doing something in a way that, in all the circumstances, suggests or implies complete or a high level of disregard for the consequences. • The test for gross carelessness is objective and is based on what a reasonable person would foresee as being conduct which creates a high risk of a tax shortfall occurring. • Gross carelessness involves recklessness but, unlike evasion, does not require an element of mens rea or intent to breach a tax obligation. • The statement provides guidance as to how the gross carelessness standard is applied to various situations. 2. BACKGROUND 2.1 Following a review of the compliance and penalties legislation, the Tax Administration Amendment Act (No 2) 1996 introduced new rules. The review noted that the legislation was unfair to the majority of taxpayers who comply with the law and entailed unnecessary costs to affected taxpayers. It also noted that the legal processes and requirements were unclear and that the rules did not fit in with the self-assessment environment. As part of the ensuing reforms, additional tax and penal tax were replaced with various new civil penalties including late filing and payment penalties and shortfall penalties, etc. 2.2 The purpose of the new regime, as set out in section 139, is to encourage voluntary compliance and to impose consistent and impartial penalties which reflect the seriousness of the breach of tax obligations. 2.3 The penalties regime is again being reviewed and a discussion document Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review was released in 1 August 2001. To date, some amendments have been made as a result of this review. Those amendments include reductions in the rate of some shortfall penalties on the basis of previous behaviour (section 141FB) and the amendment to the shortfall penalty imposed under section 141B to being one which applies when a taxpayer takes an unacceptable tax position. The amendments that have already been passed have prompted the withdrawal of various shortfall penalty Standard Practice Statements in relation to tax positions taken on or after 1 April 2003. 2.4 This interpretation statement provides an explanation of some interpretative aspects of one of the shortfall penalties – the shortfall penalty for gross carelessness covered by section 141C. The statement applies, except as otherwise specified, in respect of tax positions taken in the 1997-98 and subsequent income years and gross carelessness in relation to goods and services tax (“GST”) on or after 1 April 1997, these being the dates from which section 141C applied following the enactment of the penalties regime. Given that the focus of this statement is on what constitutes “gross carelessness”, the definition of which in section 141C(3) has not been amended under the current review, this statement will cover much of the same ground as the now withdrawn Standard Practice Statement INV-210 Shortfall penalties – gross carelessness. It will, however, reflect recent amendments to the legislation as well as incorporating case law issued since the standard practice statement was issued. The principles outlined in this statement are consistent with those outlined in the withdrawn Standard Practice Statement. 3. ISSUES 3.1 The issue addressed by this statement is the Commissioner’s interpretation of section 141C with particular emphasis on the meaning of the standard of “gross carelessness”. 4. LEGISLATION 4.1 Section 141C imposes a shortfall penalty for gross carelessness: (1) A taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty if the taxpayer is grossly careless in taking a taxpayer’s tax position (referred to as “gross carelessness”). (2) The penalty payable for gross carelessness is 40% of the resulting tax shortfall. (3) For the purposes of this Part, gross carelessness means doing or not doing something in a way that, in all the circumstances, suggests or implies complete or a high level of disregard for the consequences. (4) A taxpayer who takes an acceptable tax position is also a taxpayer who has not been grossly careless in taking the taxpayer’s tax position. 2 4.2 Section 3(1) contains various definitions: In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,– ... “Acceptable tax position” means a tax position that is not an unacceptable tax position: ... “Correct tax position” means the correct tax position established under one or more tax laws: ... “Shortfall penalty” means a penalty imposed under any of sections 141A to 141K for taking an incorrect tax position or for doing or failing to do anything specified or described in those sections: ... “Tax position” means a position or approach with regard to tax under one or more tax laws, including without limitation a position or approach with regard to– (a) A liability for an amount of tax, or the payment of an amount of tax: (b) An obligation to deduct or withhold an amount of tax, or the deduction or withholding of an amount of tax: (c) A right to a tax refund, or to claim or not to claim a tax refund: (d) A right to a credit of tax, or to claim or not to claim a credit of tax: (e) The provision of a tax return, or the non-provision of a tax return: (f) The derivation of an amount of gross income or exempt income or a capital gain, or the inclusion or non-inclusion of an amount in gross income: (g) The incurring of an amount of expenditure or loss, or the allowing or disallowing as a deduction of an amount of expenditure or loss: (h) The availability of net losses, or the offsetting or use of net losses: (i) The attaching of a credit of tax, or the receipt of or lack of entitlement to receive a credit of tax: (j) The balance of a tax account of any type or description, or a debit or credit to such a tax account: (k) The estimation of the provisional tax payable: (l) Whether the taxpayer must request an income statement or respond to an income statement issued by the Commissioner: (m) The application of section 33A(1): (n) A right to a rebate: ... “Tax shortfall”, for a return period, means the difference between the tax effect of– (a) A taxpayer’s tax position for the return period; and (b) The correct tax position for that period,– when the taxpayer’s tax position results in too little tax paid or payable by the taxpayer or another person or overstates a tax benefit, credit, or advantage of any type or description whatever by or benefiting (as the case may be) the taxpayer or another person: 3 ... “Taxpayer’s tax position” means– (a) A tax position taken by a taxpayer in or in respect of– (i) A tax return; or (ii) An income statement; or (iii) A due date: (b) Repealed. ... “Unacceptable tax position” is defined in section 141B. 5. SHORTFALL PENALTY FOR GROSS CARELESSNESS INTRODUCTION 5.1 Section 141C(1) imposes a shortfall penalty on a taxpayer who is grossly careless in taking a taxpayer’s tax position, with application to tax obligations in relation to periods commencing on or after 1 April 1997. The behaviour standard covered by this section is referred to as “gross carelessness”: A taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty if the taxpayer is grossly careless in taking a taxpayer’s tax position (referred to as “gross carelessness”). 5.2 “Gross carelessness” is defined in section 141C(3) as follows: For the purposes of this Part, gross carelessness means doing or not doing something in a way that, in all the circumstances, suggests or implies complete or a high level of disregard for the consequences. 5.3 For the shortfall penalty to apply, a “taxpayer’s tax position” must have been taken which results in a “tax shortfall”. “Taxpayer’s tax position” is defined in section 3(1) to mean a “tax position” taken by a taxpayer in or in respect of a tax return, an income statement or a due date. The term “tax position” is defined in section 3(1) to mean a position or approach with regard to tax under one or more tax laws. The definition includes a non-exhaustive list of tax laws, a position or approach to which would constitute a tax position e.g. a liability for an amount of tax; a right to a rebate; etc. The term “tax shortfall” is defined in section 3(1) to mean the difference between the taxpayer’s tax position for the return period and the correct tax position, as established under one or more tax laws (definition of “correct tax position” in section 3(1)), where the taxpayer’s tax position results in too little tax paid or payable, or overstates a tax benefit etc. 5.4 With effect from 26 March 2003, in relation to tax positions taken on or after 1 April 2003, a taxpayer who takes an acceptable tax position is deemed not to have been grossly careless (section 141C(4)) (previously, for the proviso to apply, the taxpayer was required to have used an “acceptable interpretation” in taking the taxpayer’s tax position.). An “acceptable tax position” is defined in section 3(1) to mean a tax position that is not an “unacceptable tax position” i.e. the tax position, viewed objectively, fails to meet the standard of being 4 about as likely as not to be correct (definition of “unacceptable tax position” in section 3(1); section 141B(1)). Clearly, to be an acceptable tax position, it is not necessary for the tax position to be correct – if it were, there would be no tax shortfall on which a shortfall penalty could be imposed. Rather, an acceptable tax position will also include tax positions which, although incorrect, are sufficiently “close” to being correct that a shortfall penalty should not be imposed i.e. borderline cases. 5.5 The shortfall penalty for gross carelessness is 40% of the resulting tax shortfall (section 141C(2)). This is subject to various reductions potentially available under sections 141FB (previous behaviour), 141G (voluntary disclosure), 141I (temporary shortfall) and 141J (limitation of reduction). The penalty is also subject to a 25% increase under section 141K if the taxpayer obstructs the Commissioner in determining the correct tax position. The following related Standard Practice Statements may assist in the interpretation and application of these adjustment provisions: • INV-231 Temporary Shortfall - permanent reversal (published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 11, No 8 (September 1999)); • INV-251 Voluntary Disclosures (published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 14, No 4 (April 2002)); • INV-260 Notification of a Pending Audit or Investigation (published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 2 (February 2000)); • INV-295 Reduction of Shortfall Penalties for Previous Behaviour (published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 16, No 3 (April 2004)); 5.6 The manner in which gross carelessness shortfall penalties are assessed is governed by section 94A. In challenging the imposition of the penalty, the onus of proof rests with the taxpayer to show that he or she was not grossly careless (limb (b) of section 149A(2)). The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities (section 149A(1)). 5.7 The gross carelessness shortfall penalty provisions do not apply to certain non- filing taxpayers (section 141JA) but, from 1 April 2004, they will apply to PAYE intermediaries (section 141JB). 5.8 This interpretation statement will focus on the concept of what constitutes “gross carelessness” pursuant to section 141C(3). As noted above, however, in a given situation it would first be necessary to show that a taxpayer had taken a taxpayer’s tax position which had resulted in a tax shortfall. GROSS CARELESSNESS 5.9 As noted, “gross carelessness” is defined in section 141C(3) to mean: For the purposes of this Part, gross carelessness means doing or not doing something in a way that, in all the circumstances, suggests or implies complete or a high level of disregard for the consequences. 5.10 In Case W4 (2003) 21 NZTC 11,034 at paragraph 44, Barber DJ held that the definition of “gross carelessness”: 5 ... refers to a high level of disregard for the consequences and is characterised by conduct which creates a high risk of a tax shortfall occurring where this risk and its consequences would have been foreseen by a reasonable person in the circumstances. 5.11 Case W4 concerned a taxpayer who, along with the company he owned, was involved in land development and speculative building transactions. The taxpayer had been responsible for the preparation of his own and the company’s GST returns for a number of years. In late 1997, he purchased a property and claimed an input tax deduction on it in his return for the taxable period ended 31 December 1997. On 20 May 1998, the taxpayer entered into an agreement to sell the property, with settlement occurring in November 1998. No output tax on the sale was returned in the taxable period ended 30 November 1998. The omission was discovered during an audit of the taxpayer’s affairs and the taxpayer subsequently signed an agreed adjustment in relation to the amount he had actually received from the sale which was $20,000 less than what had been agreed when the agreement for sale and purchase was originally entered into. In August 2000, the Commissioner issued a Notice of Proposed Adjustment in which the $20,000 was included as output tax in the taxable period ended 30 November 1998 and a shortfall penalty was proposed for gross carelessness of $4,846.06 (being 40% of the tax fraction of the net proceeds received from the sale). A shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care was proposed in the alternative. Following the issue of an adjudication report, assessments were issued incorporating the proposed adjustment to the output tax and the shortfall penalty for gross carelessness. 5.12 In the hearing before the Taxation Review Authority, the Commissioner contended that the taxpayer had been reckless in not returning the output tax on the sale of the property in either the correct taxable period or some later taxable period. The Commissioner noted that the taxpayer had failed to have an adequate system in place to ensure that the output tax was returned and contended that, having claimed an input tax credit when the property was purchased, the taxpayer should have been aware of the need to return the output tax when it was sold a short time later, particularly given his long experience in GST matters and the past assistance and previous warnings given to him by the Inland Revenue Department. The taxpayer contended that he had tried to comply with his GST obligations but that human error, rather than a systems failure, had caused the failure to return the output tax. This human error, he contended, was caused by extenuating circumstances related to the pressure and stress he was under at the time. 5.13 At paragraph 48 of Case W4, Barber DJ stated that gross carelessness “must be something similar to recklessness”, noting that the degree of negligence under section 141C will be of a greater magnitude than that required for the imposition of a shortfall penalty under section 141A for not taking reasonable care. At paragraph 46, he held that “gross carelessness” was a relative term and whether or not it is present will depend upon the circumstances in each case. 6 5.14 Barber DJ went on to consider case law on the concept of “recklessness”. Citing R v Caldwell \[1981\] All ER 961 and R v Howe \[1982\] 1 NZLR 618, he held at paragraph 49 that a person who fails to give any thought to the consequences of his or her behaviour or to an obvious or serious risk has acted recklessly. 5.15 In the joint judgment of the Court of Appeal in Howe at page 623, the determination of whether or not there had been reckless behaviour was described in this way: As to recklessness, there has been a line of cases in England of high authority affirming that this word has no separate legal meaning. And that, although involving more than mere carelessness, it is not limited to deliberate risk- taking but includes failing to give any thought to an obvious and serious risk: R v Caldwell \[1982\] AC 341; \[1981\] 1 All ER 961, R v Lawrence, R v Pigg \[1982\] 2 All ER 591; \[1982\] 1 WLR 762. \[Emphasis added\] 5.16 The scope of conduct encompassed in the concept of recklessness was described by Lord Diplock in Caldwell at page 964 in this way: ... recklessness covers a whole range of states of mind from failing to give any thought at all to whether or not there is any risk of those harmful consequences, to recognising the existence of the risk and nevertheless deciding to ignore it. 5.17 In Australia, the penalty provision relating to “recklessness” was directly equated with that of gross carelessness in Tax Ruling 94/4: Briefly stated, recklessness is gross carelessness – the doing of something which in fact involves a risk, whether the doer realises it or not, and the risk being such, having regard to all the circumstances, that the taking of that risk would be described as “reckless” (Shawinigan Ltd v Vokins & Co Ltd \[1961\] 3 All ER 396). In other words, recklessness involves the running of what a reasonable person would regard as an unjustifiable risk (Reed (Albert E) & Co Ltd v London and Rochester Trading Co Ltd \[1954\] 2 Lloyds Rep 463). 5.18 At paragraph 17 of Tax Ruling 94/4, recklessness is described as follows: A person would be acting recklessly if: (a) the person did an act which created a risk of a particular consequence occurring (e.g. a tax shortfall); (b) a reasonable person who, having regard to the particular circumstances of the person, knew or ought to have known the facts and circumstances surrounding the act would have or ought to have been able to foresee the probable consequences of the act; (c) the risk would have been foreseen by a reasonable person as being great, having regard to the likelihood that the consequences would occur, and the likely extent of those consequences (e.g. the size of the tax shortfall); or (d) when the person did the act, he or she either was indifferent to the possibility of there being any such risk, or recognised that there was such risk involved and had, nonetheless, gone on to do it. That is, the person’s conduct clearly shows disregard of, or indifference to, consequences foreseeable by a reasonable person. 5.19 At paragraph 49 of Case W4, Barber DJ held that the test for gross carelessness was an objective one. That is, the test is based on what a 7 reasonable person would foresee as being conduct which creates a high risk of a tax shortfall occurring. 5.20 At paragraph 45 of Case W4, Barber DJ accepted that the gross carelessness penalty provision does not require an element of mens rea or intent to breach a tax obligation (see also Case W3 (2003) 21 NZTC 11,014 at paragraph 111; Taxpayer Compliance, Penalties, and Disputes Resolution Bill – Commentary on the Bill (September 1995) at page 14; Tax Information Bulletin Vol 8, No 7 (October 1996) at page 18). In this regard, the gross carelessness standard may be distinguished from that of evasion (the shortfall penalty for which is contained in section 141E) which also requires an element of recklessness (Godfrey Allan Ltd v CIR (1980) 8 NZTC 61,548; Case E26 (1981) 5 NZTC 59,154; Case H90 (1986) 8 NZTC 619; Case M17 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,749; Case P13 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,083). 5.21 In Case W4, Barber DJ concluded that the taxpayer had been grossly careless in not returning the output tax on the sale of the property in the correct taxable period. At paragraph 41, he noted that the failure to return the output tax had been a repeated one – first, by failing to return it in his own return in the correct taxable period, then by alleging that it had been returned in the company’s return, then advising that he had taken steps to return it in his March 1999 return, but ultimately not returning the output tax at all. Barber DJ at paragraphs 65 – 69 explained why he doubted the taxpayer’s credibility and stated that he found it hard to believe that the taxpayer had not been grossly careless or that the omission was not done intentionally (at paragraph 73, he stated that the taxpayer was fortunate not to be facing a shortfall penalty for evasion). In particular, while he accepted that the taxpayer had been under some stress at the time, he based his decision that the taxpayer had been grossly careless on the taxpayer’s lengthy experience in GST matters, the fact there had been previous audits which resulted in warnings being given as well as assistance, the short time frame between the purchase and the sale of the property, and the significance of the transactions. 5.22 Case W3 also concerned, among other things, whether or not a gross carelessness shortfall penalty should be imposed on the taxpayer for not returning certain outputs in the return for the taxable period ended 31 March 1998. The outputs not returned related to debts which the taxpayer did not intend to collect because he considered that any attempts to recover them would be futile. At the time, the taxpayer had been under pressure caused by eight charges having been laid for using a document to defraud. Barber DJ held that there was a tax shortfall in the relevant taxable period because the debts had not been written off, as required under limb (c) of section 26(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, and because no credit notes had been issued pursuant to section 25 of that Act. At paragraph 110, Barber DJ held that the pressures that the taxpayer had been under at the time meant that a high level of carelessness or a high level of disregard for the consequences had not been present. At paragraph 112, he agreed with the Commissioner’s alternative argument that the taxpayer had not taken reasonable care and that therefore a shortfall penalty was chargeable under section 141A. 8 5.23 In summary, then, the above discussion indicates that gross carelessness is similar to recklessness but, unlike evasion which also involves recklessness, it does not require an element of mens rea or intent to breach a tax obligation. A number of characteristics of gross carelessness may be identified from the above analysis: • Grossly careless conduct implies a complete or high level of disregard for the consequences; • Grossly careless conduct creates a high risk of a tax shortfall occurring. • The risk involved in, and the consequences of, grossly careless conduct would have been foreseen by a reasonable person in the circumstances. • Failing to give any thought to an obvious and serious risk constitutes gross carelessness. • Gross carelessness involves more than mere inadvertence or lack of reasonable care. • Whether or not gross carelessness is present will depend upon the circumstances in each case. • The test for whether or not gross carelessness is present is objective, being similar to that for “recklessness”. DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN GROSS CARELESSNESS AND NOT TAKING REASONABLE CARE 5.24 As noted, the carelessness involved in gross carelessness, for which the taxpayer would be liable for a shortfall penalty of 40% under section 141C, will be of a greater magnitude to that involved in not taking reasonable care, for which a taxpayer is liable for a 20% shortfall penalty under section 141A. When determining whether a taxpayer’s behaviour in a given situation constitutes a lack of reasonable care or gross carelessness, it will be necessary to make a judgment as to where the “dividing line” between the two standards occurs. While it is not possible to be definitive, it is nevertheless appropriate to consider some guidelines. However, as noted in the summary in the previous paragraph, whether certain behaviour is gross carelessness or merely involves not taking reasonable care will depend upon the circumstances in each case. 5.25 In this regard, gross carelessness, by definition, is conduct which implies a complete or high level of disregard for the consequences and creates a high risk of a tax shortfall occurring; the requisite risk being foreseeable by a reasonable person in the circumstances. In any given situation, therefore, it would need to be determined what constitutes a “high” risk, or a “high” level of disregard for the consequences, as opposed to a risk resulting from a lack of reasonable care. 5.26 For example, in Case W4 Barber DJ held that the taxpayer had been grossly careless. His finding as to gross carelessness was based on a number of facts, namely the repeated failure to return the output tax in question, the taxpayer’s lengthy experience in GST matters, the warnings resulting from and the 9 assistance given in previous tax audits, and the short time frame between the purchase of the property (when an input tax credit was claimed) and its sale. It is not obvious, however, whether any one of these factors in isolation would have been sufficient basis for a finding of gross carelessness as opposed to a lack of reasonable care. In such a situation, it is considered that the fact that the transaction was a significant one involving a large amount of output tax would involve the taxpayer in conduct which would put a reasonable person on alert, especially when coupled with a short time frame between purchase and sale. Any argument that the person was not aware of the high risk involved in his or her behaviour would be weakened by there having been previous audits on similar issues which had resulted in both warnings and assistance being given by Inland Revenue staff. 5.27 The question arises of whether or not the taxpayer would have been held to be grossly careless had the tax shortfall resulted from a transaction which was relatively insignificant because the output tax on the transaction, when viewed in isolation, was relatively small or was one of a number of similar transactions. It could be argued in this situation that a reasonable person may have failed to notice that the output tax on one transaction had not been returned. 5.28 Here, whether or not the taxpayer had been grossly careless would have to be determined by considering the full set of facts. If, for example, the majority of a taxpayer’s transactions were of a similar nature to the one in question, then there is a potential for a large tax shortfall to occur over a period of time through multiple small errors. In such a case, the adequacy of the accounting system would need to be determined. If the taxpayer had been warned previously that his or her accounting system was inadequate to ensure that the correct amount of tax was identified, then a blatant disregard for those warnings would be evidence of an indifference to an obvious risk of a possible tax shortfall occurring. If, however, the taxpayer had made a real attempt to implement suggested system improvements, obtaining further advice where necessary, then it is likely that the taxpayer’s conduct would not be regarded as having created a high risk of a tax shortfall occurring. 5.29 From the above analysis of the facts in Case W4, but bearing in mind the principle that whether or not gross carelessness is present is dependent upon the circumstances in each case, it is relevant to consider the following characteristics in determining whether a reasonable person would have foreseen that his or her conduct created a high risk of a tax shortfall occurring i.e. whether the taxpayer had been grossly careless: • a large tax shortfall (whether resulting from a single transaction or from a number of similar transactions); • a significant transaction, or transactions of a similar nature when viewed together, when compared to the taxpayer’s business or taxable activity; • indifference to an obvious risk of a possible tax shortfall occurring; • a relatively short period of time between the purchase and sale of an item where the purchase triggered a tax effect that the taxpayer recognised; 10 • the taxpayer being experienced in the relevant tax laws; • a failure by the taxpayer to heed previous warnings or to take on board suggestions of tax advisors (whether by the Inland Revenue Department or other professional people) which were aimed at reducing the likelihood of errors occurring. 5.30 Where few or none of the above characteristics are present, then the less likely it will be that the taxpayer has been grossly careless. However, the taxpayer may nevertheless have not taken reasonable care. EXAMPLES The following examples are intended to illustrate the application of the gross carelessness shortfall penalty provision. The focus in these examples is on whether or not the taxpayer has been grossly careless in taking a taxpayer’s tax position and therefore the fact that a taxpayer’s tax position has been taken which has resulted in a shortfall will be present in all the examples. The application or otherwise of the reduction or increase provisions is not addressed in the examples. Example 1 In August 2002, ABC Limited entered into an agreement for sale and purchase for farm land, intending to subdivide it and build houses for sale. In its GST return for the taxable period ended 31 August 2002, it correctly claimed an input tax credit on the full purchase price of $500,000. Because of a newspaper report in October 2002, which detailed the proposed establishment of a sewerage treatment facility a short distance from the land which it considered would adversely affect its ability to sell the residential properties, the company sold the land in December 2002 for $490,000. However, the person usually responsible for the preparation of the returns was on annual leave at the time when the return was due for the taxable period in which the land was supplied, and the staff member who was filling in for him had not realised that output tax on the sale of the property needed to be returned. Consequently, no output tax on the sale was returned in the correct taxable period. Nor was it ever returned, even after the person returned from leave. Should a shortfall penalty for gross carelessness be imposed? The taxpayer must have been aware that the supply of the property had GST consequences because it claimed an input tax credit on its purchase. In this light, given the relatively short period of time between when the property was purchased and when it was sold, a reasonable person would have been aware that output tax was payable on its sale. As well, given the large amount of output tax payable, a reasonable person would not have inadvertently omitted to return it. In this regard, while the staff member who completed the return was temporarily filling in for the usual staff member, a reasonable person would have recognised that there was an obvious and serious risk that a tax shortfall would occur if an inadequately trained person completed the return and would therefore have put in place procedures to ensure that no error was 11 made. The fact that the error was not rectified in a later taxable period when the usual staff member returned from leave also indicates that the company showed a high level of disregard for the accuracy of its return. Hence, it is considered that the company was grossly careless and that the shortfall penalty should be imposed. Example 2 Mr D runs a building recycling operation, buying and selling material and fittings from buildings that have been demolished or refurbished. His suppliers are both registered and unregistered persons for GST purposes. He claims input tax credits on the material purchased from the unregistered persons under the secondhand goods provisions in limb (a)(ia) of section 20(3) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 which allow an input tax deduction only to the extent that payment has been made. When his tax affairs are investigated, it is discovered that he claimed a number of input tax credits on secondhand goods purchased from unregistered persons in the taxable period ended 31 March 2003 based on the full purchase price totalling $36,000 when during that period he had only paid $5,000 of the total amount due. During past investigations, similar mistakes have been identified where the input tax credit claimed was based on the full purchase price rather than on the amount paid during the taxable period in question. Advice was given by the investigator as to how the taxpayer could improve his bookkeeping system so that similar errors would not occur in the future. Despite 12 months having elapsed since this advice was given, the taxpayer had failed to implement the suggested improvements. In relation to the taxable period now being investigated, the taxpayer stated that the mistake was the result of mere inadvertence. The Commissioner proposes to impose a shortfall penalty for gross carelessness on the resulting tax shortfall. In this instance, buying secondhand goods is a regular part of the taxpayer’s business. The fact that recording or calculation errors by the taxpayer in relation to the input tax claimable on secondhand goods have previously been identified on a number of occasions is an indication that a reasonable person, in the same circumstances, would have recognised the obvious and serious risk involved. As such, the errors are not the type of mistakes that occur because of mere inadvertence and which do not suggest or imply complete or a high level of disregard for all the consequences so as to constitute gross carelessness. Rather, in this case, once the nature of the errors had been identified, and it was recognised that such errors could potentially recur on a regular basis, a reasonable person would have ensured that such errors did not recur by following the advice previously given and putting in place an adequate record-keeping system, including checks, to identify goods purchased from unregistered persons. Not to have done so indicates indifference to the serious risk of this type of error recurring and a high level of disregard for the consequences. Therefore, it is considered that the taxpayer has been grossly careless and that a shortfall penalty under section 141C should be imposed. 12 Example 3 XYZ Limited was recently incorporated to invest in property. It intends to purchase properties, renovating them if necessary, and then leasing them out. In its income tax return for the year ended 31 March 2003, during which it was incorporated, it claimed deductions for expenditure of $25,500 that it identified as being “repairs and maintenance”. Upon investigation, the Department determined that $23,000 of this amount had been incurred on one particular property that the company had purchased during the income year. The expenditure included the upgrade of the old water heating system, repapering the entire building, replacing worn carpet, replacing rotten wood, repainting the building, and making extensive repairs to the roof and spouting. The expenditure had been incurred within three months of the purchase of the property and no expenditure incurred at this time had been treated as being of a capital nature. The Commissioner considered that this expenditure was of a capital nature and that therefore no deduction was available except by way of the depreciation regime. He also considered that the complexity of the law on the distinction between capital and revenue expenditure is such that the taxpayer should have obtained professional advice and that to not do so suggests or implies a high level of disregard for the consequences. The Commissioner therefore proposes to impose a shortfall penalty on the tax shortfall for gross carelessness. The taxpayer stated that his bookkeeping system did not distinguish between capital and revenue expenditure because he had thought that all of the disputed expenditure was incurred on repairs and maintenance, not capital items. Presuming that the $23,000 in expenditure was in fact of a capital nature, should the proposed shortfall penalty be imposed? A preliminary matter concerns whether or not it is appropriate to impose a shortfall penalty for gross carelessness in relation to the capital / revenue distinction, given that it is a contentious area of law and section 141C is a care provision rather than one which relates to the accuracy of the tax position taken by the taxpayer. In this regard, it is considered that it is possible for a taxpayer to be grossly careless in taking a tax position no matter how contentious the applicable provisions might be (Taxpayer Compliance, Penalties, and Disputes Resolution Bill – Commentary on the Bill (September 1995) at page 11 outlines the rationale for this with respect to shortfall penalties for not taking reasonable care and it is considered that it equally applies to a gross carelessness shortfall penalty). In such a case, the situation could be such that a reasonable person would understand that there was an even greater need to research the issue or obtain advice etc., something which the taxpayer in this example did not do. As well, the proviso in paragraph 141C(4) – that a gross carelessness shortfall penalty will not be imposed where the taxpayer has taken an acceptable tax position – already provides an exception in borderline cases involving interpretation and/or the accuracy of the position taken. In this regard, on the facts of this example, it is not considered that the proviso would apply. That is, to classify the types of expenditure incurred, involving major restoration 13 14 work and the replacement of assets, as not being of a capital nature would not constitute the taking of an acceptable tax position. Nevertheless, it needs to be determined whether or not the taxpayer was grossly careless in this case. In this regard, the tests in relation to the capital/revenue distinction in relation to property purchases are well established in case law. However, whether expenditure is of a capital or revenue nature requires a level of judgment based on a number of factors and the taxpayer’s relative inexperience counts against him having the required level of judgment. Consequently, the taxpayer should have obtained professional advice. However, it is not considered that to have not done so indicates either a high level of disregard for the consequences, or an indifference to a serious risk that the expenditure would not be deductible, the factors which reflect gross carelessness. It is not evident that the taxpayer was even aware of the serious risk that the expenditure may not be deductible. As well, while the tax shortfall constitutes a large proportion of the expenditure deducted by the taxpayer, this factor in isolation is not sufficient for a conclusion to be drawn that the taxpayer was grossly careless. Therefore, while the taxpayer may not have taken reasonable care in taking the taxpayer’s tax position, and may consequently be liable for a shortfall penalty under section 141A, it is not considered in these circumstances that the taxpayer had had a high level of disregard for the consequences when it filed its return. That is, there would be no gross carelessness on the part of the taxpayer and no shortfall penalty for gross carelessness should be imposed. Had there been earlier warnings from the Department or advice from a tax agent on the interpretative issue that the taxpayer had ignored, then this would have increased the likelihood that the taxpayer would be held to have been grossly careless.
SHORTFALL PENALTY FOR TAKING AN ABUSIVE TAX POSITION 1. SUMMARY 1.1 All legislative references in this statement are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. 1.2 This statement provides an interpretative explanation of the shortfall penalty imposed by the Commissioner under section 141D of the Act on taxpayers who take an abusive tax position. Where a taxpayer takes an abusive tax position, the result may be that too little tax is paid or payable, as tax liabilities are reduced, removed, deferred or postponed, or tax benefits claimed. 1.3 The abusive tax position penalty is 100% of the tax shortfall. “Abusive tax position” is defined in section 141D. For the penalty to apply, the taxpayer must have taken an unacceptable tax position, and either: • under section 141D(7)(b)(i), have entered into an arrangement, where the dominant purpose of the arrangement is of avoiding tax, whether directly or indirectly, or • under section 141D(7)(b)(ii), where there is no arrangement, or no arrangement of the type outlined in section 141D(7)(b)(i), have taken the taxpayer’s tax position with a dominant purpose of avoiding tax, whether directly or indirectly. 2. BACKGROUND 2.1 Following a review of the compliance and penalties legislation, the Tax Administration Amendment Act (No 2) 1996 introduced new rules. The purpose of the new rules, as set out in section 139, is to encourage voluntary compliance and to impose consistent and impartial penalties which reflect the seriousness of the breach of tax obligations. 2.2 The penalties rules have again been reviewed and a discussion document Taxpayer Compliance, Standards and Penalties: a review was released in August 2001. To date, some amendments have been made as a result of this review. Those amendments include – reductions in the rate of some shortfall penalties on the basis of the taxpayer’s previous behaviour (section 141FB), and the amendment to the shortfall penalty imposed under section 141B – to one which applies when a taxpayer takes an unacceptable tax position. Further amendments were made in the Taxation (GST, Trans-Tasman Imputation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003. The amendments that have already been passed have prompted the withdrawal of various shortfall penalty standard practice statements about tax positions taken on or after 1 April 2003. 2.3 This Interpretation Statement provides an explanation of some interpretative aspects of one of the shortfall penalties – the shortfall penalty for taking an abusive tax position covered by section 141D. The statement applies, except 1 as otherwise specified, to tax positions taken on or after 1 April 2003 (although all associated references to the Income Tax Act are to the provisions of the 2004 Act for ease of reference). The now withdrawn Standard Practice Statement INV-215 Shortfall penalties – abusive tax position (published in Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 10, No 3, March 1998) applies to tax positions taken before 1 April 2003. 3. LEGISLATION 3.1 A shortfall penalty for taking an abusive tax position is imposed under section 141D: 141D Abusive tax position (1) The purpose of this section is to penalise those taxpayers who, having taken an unacceptable tax position, have entered into or acted in respect of arrangements or interpreted or applied tax laws with a dominant purpose of taking, or of supporting the taking of, tax positions that reduce or remove tax liabilities or give tax benefits. (2) A taxpayer is liable to pay a shortfall penalty if the taxpayer takes an abusive tax position (referred to as an “abusive tax position”). (3) The penalty payable for taking an abusive tax position is 100% of the resulting tax shortfall. (3B) The penalty payable for taking an abusive tax position is reduced to 20% of the resulting tax shortfall if— (a) The taxpayer is a party to an arrangement to which section 141EB applies and becomes liable to a shortfall penalty for an abusive tax position as a result of that arrangement, irrespective of whether a promoter penalty has been imposed in respect of the arrangement; and (b) The sum of the tax shortfall from the arrangement for the taxpayer and the tax shortfalls from the arrangement for persons with whom the taxpayer is associated under section OD 7 of the Income Tax Act 1994 is less than $50,000; and (c) The taxpayer has independent advice stating that the taxpayer's tax position is not an abusive tax position. (4) This section applies to a taxpayer if the taxpayer has taken an unacceptable tax position and the tax shortfall from the tax position is more than $20,000. (5) Section 141B(6) applies for determining the time when a taxpayer takes an abusive tax position. (6) A taxpayer's tax position may be an abusive tax position if the tax position is an incorrect tax position under, or as a result of, either or both of— (a) A general tax law; or (b) A specific or general anti-avoidance tax law. (7) For the purposes of this Part and section 177C, an “abusive tax position” means a tax position that,— 2 (a) Is an unacceptable tax position at the time at which the tax position is taken; and (b) Viewed objectively, the taxpayer takes— (i) In respect, or as a consequence, of an arrangement that is entered into with a dominant purpose of avoiding tax, whether directly or indirectly; or (ii) Where the tax position does not relate to an arrangement described in subparagraph (i), with a dominant purpose of avoiding tax, whether directly or indirectly. 3.2 The following terms are defined in section 3(1): In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,— ... “Arrangement” – (a) Means a contract, agreement, plan or understanding, whether enforceable or unenforceable, including all steps and transactions by which it is carried into effect: ... “Correct tax position” means the correct tax position established under one or more tax laws: ... “Shortfall penalty” means a penalty imposed under any of sections 141A to 141K for taking an incorrect tax position or for doing or failing to do anything specified or described in those sections: ... “Tax law” means— (a) A provision of the Inland Revenue Acts or an Act that an Inland Revenue Act replaces: (b) An Order in Council or a regulation made under another tax law: (c) A non-disputable decision: (d) In relation to an obligation to provide a tax return or a tax form, also includes a provision of the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992 or a regulation made under that Act or the Accident Insurance Act 1998 or a regulation made under that Act. ... “Tax position” means a position or approach with regard to tax, under one or more tax laws, including without limitation a position or approach with regard to– (a) A liability for an amount of tax, or the payment of an amount of tax: (b) An obligation to deduct or withhold an amount of tax, or the deduction or withholding of an amount of tax: (c) A right to a tax refund, or to claim or not to claim a tax refund: (d) A right to a credit of tax, or to claim or not to claim a credit of tax: 3 (e) The provision of a tax return, or the non-provision of a tax return: (f) The derivation of an amount of gross income or exempt income or a capital gain, or the inclusion or non-inclusion of an amount in gross income: (g) The incurring of an amount of expenditure or loss, or the allowing or disallowing as a deduction of an amount of expenditure or loss: (h) The availability of net losses, or the offsetting or use of net losses: (i) The attaching of a credit of tax, or the receipt of or lack of entitlement to receive a credit of tax: (j) The balance of a tax account of any type or description, or a debit or credit to such a tax account: (k) The estimation of the provisional tax payable: (l) Whether the taxpayer must request an income statement or respond to an income statement issued by the Commissioner: (m) The application of section 33A(1): (n) A right to a rebate: ... “Tax shortfall”, for a return period, means the difference between the tax effect of – (a) A taxpayer’s tax position for the return period; and (b) The correct tax position for that period, – when the taxpayer’s tax position results in too little tax paid or payable by the taxpayer or another person or overstates a tax benefit, credit, or advantage of any type or description whatever by or benefiting (as the case may be) the taxpayer or another person. ... “Taxpayer’s tax position” means— (a) A tax position taken by a taxpayer in or in respect of– (i) A tax return; or (ii) An income statement; or (iii) A due date: 4. SHORTFALL PENALTY FOR TAKING AN ABUSIVE TAX POSITION INTRODUCTION 4.1 Section 141D imposes a shortfall penalty on a taxpayer for taking an “abusive tax position” in the taking of a taxpayer’s tax position, with application to tax obligations for periods commencing on or after 1 April 1997. 4.2 The shortfall penalty for an abusive tax position is 100% of the resulting tax shortfall (section 141D(3)). 4.3 An “abusive tax position” is defined in section 141D(7) as follows: (7) For the purposes of this Part and section 177C, an “abusive tax position” means a tax position that,— 4 (a) Is an unacceptable tax position at the time at which the tax position is taken; and (b) Viewed objectively, the taxpayer takes— (i) In respect, or as a consequence, of an arrangement that is entered into with a dominant purpose of avoiding tax, whether directly or indirectly; or (ii) Where the tax position does not relate to an arrangement described in subparagraph (i), with a dominant purpose of avoiding tax, whether directly or indirectly. 4.4 Under section 141D(7), an “abusive tax position” means a tax position that is an unacceptable tax position which the taxpayer takes, either: • in respect or as a consequence of an arrangement that is entered into with a dominant purpose of avoiding tax (in situations involving an arrangement), or • with a dominant purpose of avoiding tax (in situations not involving an arrangement). 4.5 Before answering the question of whether there is an abusive tax position, in terms of section 141D(7), it should be noted that there are some preliminary requirements that must also be satisfied before the penalty can potentially apply: (1) the taxpayer must have taken a tax position (2) the tax position must be an incorrect tax position under or as a result of a general tax law or a specific or general anti-avoidance tax law (3) the time at which a taxpayer’s tax position has been taken has been determined in accordance with section 141B(6) (4) the taxpayer’s tax position leads to a tax shortfall, and the tax shortfall exceeds $20,000 (5) the taxpayer has taken an unacceptable tax position. 4.6 “Unacceptable tax position” is a separate shortfall penalty and is defined in section 141B(1). A separate Interpretation Statement for the unacceptable tax position shortfall penalty has been published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 17, No 9, November 2005. For tax positions taken before 1 April 2003, the requirement was for an “unacceptable interpretation”, which was defined under the previous version of section 141B(1). For ease of reference, the remainder of this Interpretation Statement will only refer to an “unacceptable tax position”. 4.7 It should also be noted that the penalty for an abusive tax position under section 141D has had minor amendments (with effect from 1 April 2003, 5 except for the introduction of section 141D(3B) which applies with effect from 26 March 2003). The changes to the abusive tax position penalty are: • the link with the section 141B requirement for an “unacceptable tax position” (which was previously an “unacceptable interpretation” in both sections) • an increase in the previous threshold of $10,000 to the current threshold of $20,000, and • the introduction of the section 141D(3B) reduction provision. 4.8 The penalty for taking an abusive tax position is 100% of the resulting tax shortfall (section 141D(3)). This is subject to various reductions potentially available under sections 141FB (previous behaviour), 141G (voluntary disclosure), 141H (reduction for disclosure of unacceptable tax position), 141I (temporary shortfall) and 141J (limitation of reduction). The penalty is also subject to a 25% increase under section 141K if the taxpayer obstructs the Commissioner in determining the correct tax position. The following related standard practice statements may assist in the interpretation and application of these adjustment provisions: • INV-231 Temporary shortfall - permanent reversal (published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 11, No 8, September 1999) • INV-251 Voluntary disclosures (published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 14, No 4, April 2002) • INV-260 Notification of a pending audit or investigation (published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 2, February 2000) • INV-295 Reduction of shortfall penalties for previous behaviour (published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 16, No 3, April 2004) • INV-490 GST returns – correcting minor errors (published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 10, No 6, June 1998) • INV-570 Shortfall penalties – application where returns are amended before due date (published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 11, No 2, February 1999). 4.9 Section 141D(3B) also allows for a reduction of the abusive tax position shortfall penalty to 20% of the resulting tax shortfall if: (a) The taxpayer is a party to an arrangement to which section 141EB applies and becomes liable to a shortfall penalty for an abusive tax position as a result of that arrangement, irrespective of whether a promoter penalty has been imposed in respect of the arrangement; and (b) The sum of the tax shortfall from the arrangement for the taxpayer and the tax shortfalls from the arrangement for persons with whom the taxpayer is associated under section OD 7 of the Income Tax Act 1994 is less than $50,000; and 6 (c) The taxpayer has independent advice stating that the taxpayer's tax position is not an abusive tax position. 4.10 Standard Practice Statement INV-290 (published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 16, No 2, March 2004) describes how the Commissioner will apply the section 141EB Promoter Penalties provision. In discussing the various requirements of section 141EB, the SPS also comments on what the Commissioner considers to be “independent advice” at paragraphs 42 to 45 of that statement. Those comments are also considered relevant as guidance in the application of section 141D(3B)(c). 4.11 Section 94A states that the Commissioner may make or amend an assessment of a civil penalty (which includes the section 141D shortfall penalty in question) in the same way as the Commissioner may make or amend an assessment of the substantive tax. In challenging the imposition of the penalty, the onus of proof rests with the taxpayer to show that they did not take an abusive tax position (section 149A(2)(b)). The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities (section 149A(1)). 4.12 The remainder of this Interpretation Statement will focus on the interpretation and application of the abusive tax position shortfall penalty under section 141D. ABUSIVE TAX POSITION Section 141D(7) 4.13 If all the other requirements for section 141D are satisfied, it is then necessary to determine whether section 141D(7) applies. Section 141D(7) defines an “abusive tax position”, which will apply either under section 141D(7)(b)(i) in situations involving an arrangement, or under section 141D(7)(b)(ii) in situations not involving an arrangement of the type in section 141D(7)(b)(i). Section 141D(7)(b)(i) and section 141D(7)(b)(ii) will be dealt with separately. Dominant purpose of avoiding tax 4.14 It is noted that for the section 141D abusive tax position penalty to apply, either the arrangement or the taxpayer (depending on whether section 141D(7)(b)(i) or section 141D(7)(b)(ii) is applied) must have a dominant purpose of avoiding tax. 4.15 The term “dominant purpose” is not defined in the TAA. The Concise Oxford Dictionary (10th ed, Oxford University Press) defines “dominant” as follows: 1 most important, powerful, or influential. 4.16 The same dictionary defines “purpose” as follows: 1 the reason for which something is done or for which something exists. 4.17 The Court of Appeal case CIR v National Distributors Ltd \[1989\] 3 NZLR 661, while only needing to interpret the word “purpose” in terms of the 7 legislation at issue, noted that where there is more than one purpose present, taxability turns on what was the dominant purpose. In terms of the “dominant purpose”, Richardson J (as he then was) stated the following at page 666 of that decision: Adoption of a dominant purpose test in relation to the particular property purchased allows a sensible focus as a practical matter on what was truly important to the taxpayer at the time of acquisition. \[Emphasis added\] 4.18 At page 667, His Honour also stated the following: In Hunter at p 125 Turner J observed that the motive which inspired the transactions was no doubt that they provided an advantageous method of remitting funds from England to New Zealand, but that in acquiring the stock the taxpayer had done so for the purpose of selling it again. And McCarthy J noted a p 127 that purpose must, naturally, be distinguished from motive or expectations... \[Emphasis added\] 4.19 Therefore, according to the dictionary meaning of the words, and Richardson J’s judgment in National Distributors, it is considered that the “dominant purpose” is the most important or influential reason to the taxpayer at the relevant time. 4.20 This is consistent with how the term was considered by the Full High Court of Australia in FCT v Spotless Services Limited & Anor 96 ATC 5,201 (in the context of the Australian general anti-avoidance provision which focuses on the dominant purpose of the arrangement). The following was stated at page 5,206: Much turns upon the identification, among various purposes, of that which is “dominant”. In its ordinary meaning, dominant indicates that purpose which was the ruling, prevailing, or most influential purpose. In the present case, if the taxpayers took steps which maximised their after-tax return and they did so in a manner indicating the presence of the “dominant purpose” to obtain a “tax benefit”, then the criteria which were to be met before the Commissioner might make determinations under s 177F were satisfied. \[Emphasis added\] The meaning of “avoiding tax” 4.21 The term “avoiding tax” is not defined in the TAA. However, the term “tax avoidance” is defined in section OB 1 of the ITA as follows: Tax avoidance includes— (a) directly or indirectly altering the incidence of any income tax: (b) directly or indirectly relieving a person from liability to pay income tax or from a potential or prospective liability to future income tax: 8 (c) directly or indirectly avoiding, postponing, or reducing any liability to income tax or any potential or prospective liability to future income tax 4.22 The term “tax avoidance” is also defined in the GST Act, for the purposes of the GST Act, as follows: 76(8) For the purpose of this section— ... “Tax avoidance” includes— (a) A reduction in the liability of a registered person to pay tax: (b) A postponement in the liability of a registered person to pay tax: (c) An increase in the entitlement of a registered person to a refund of tax: (d) An earlier entitlement of a registered person to a refund of tax: (e) A reduction in the total consideration payable by a person for a supply of goods and services. 4.23 As noted in the Commentary on the Bill and section 141D(6)(a), the term “avoiding tax” is not limited to the concept of “tax avoidance”. It is considered that section 141D(6) and the Commentary on the Bill show that the term “avoiding tax” should be interpreted widely. Section 141D(6) states: 141D(6) A taxpayer’s tax position may be an abusive tax position if the tax position is an incorrect tax position under, or as a result of, either or both of— (a) A general tax law; or (b) A specific or general anti-avoidance tax law. 4.24 At pages 15 and 16 of the Commentary on the Bill the wide interpretation of the term “avoiding tax” is again stated: The penalty for abusive tax positions will apply not only in situations where a general or specific anti-avoidance provision is invoked, but also where other provisions have been applied. The need for the Commissioner to rely explicitly on an anti-avoidance provision does not necessarily indicate that the tax position is more deserving of a high penalty than an aggressive interpretation intended to avoid tax but which fails under another provision. The concept of “avoiding tax” encompasses the deferral of tax and the claiming of tax credits. 4.25 The abusive tax position penalty can apply in situations where there has been “tax avoidance” (and therefore section BG 1 of the ITA or section 76 of the GST Act are invoked) or where neither of these provisions apply, but there is nevertheless evidence of a dominant purpose of avoiding tax. In practice, in situations where section BG 1 of the ITA or section 76 of the GST Act is successfully invoked, determining whether the requirement of “avoiding tax” 9 is satisfied for the abusive tax position shortfall penalty will usually be resolved by the “tax avoidance” inquiry for the anti-avoidance provisions. 4.26 However, the abusive tax position shortfall penalty is also chargeable in situations where the anti-avoidance provisions do not apply, but the conduct nevertheless shows a dominant purpose of avoiding tax (section 141D(6)(a)). Thus, the term “avoiding tax” is a wider concept than “tax avoidance”, to ensure the penalty applies whether or not the anti-avoidance provisions have been invoked. 4.27 In summary, the term “avoiding tax” includes the concept of “tax avoidance” under the general or specific anti-avoidance provisions, and those situations where tax is avoided or is attempted to be avoided, but the general or specific anti-avoidance provisions are not invoked. The term “dominant purpose of avoiding tax” means that the arrangement’s (section 141D(7)(b)(i)) or the taxpayer’s (section 141D(7)(b)(ii)) most influential and prevailing or ruling purpose is to avoid tax. Factors that may indicate a “dominant purpose of avoiding tax” 4.28 The Commentary on the Bill discussed indicators that may suggest a dominant purpose of avoiding tax at page 15 as follows: Indicators of a dominant purpose of avoiding tax may include artificiality, contrivance, circularity of funding, concealment of information and non- availability of evidence, and spurious interpretations of tax laws. 4.29 The indicators referred to in the Commentary on the Bill can be of assistance in determining whether an arrangement or a taxpayer has a dominant purpose of avoiding tax. The following are some of the factors that may be taken into account when considering whether there is a dominant purpose of avoiding tax. Artificiality and contrivance 4.30 Have the transactions been designed to appear to comply with the legislation? The legal form may not reflect the substance (even though the legal form is effective). 4.31 Consideration will be given to the commercial reality of the arrangement. Are the arrangements or schemes “self-cancelling” (ie, neutral commercial consequences, leaving only tax effects)? 4.32 The importance of the commercial purpose of the transaction as compared to the tax benefit that the relevant taxpayer obtained must be examined. Circularity of funding 4.33 Funding going around in a circle, usually through a tax haven, resulting in income being tax exempt and the related expenditure tax deductible may be considered as an indicator of a tax avoiding arrangement. 10 Concealment of information and non-availability of evidence 4.34 Concealment of information may occur through the use of a tax haven. By going through a tax haven, disclosure protection may result due to the particular tax haven’s secrecy laws. These laws usually do not allow information to be released to tax authorities, thereby providing an obstacle to the gathering of information to establish whether the transaction or arrangement is artificial or contrived. Spurious interpretations 4.35 Spurious interpretation covers situations where a tax position taken has no or very little basis at law or the interpretation made or position taken is frivolous. “Directly” or “indirectly” 4.36 Sections 141D(7)(b)(i) and (ii) refer to a tax position taken with a dominant purpose of avoiding tax “whether directly or indirectly”. It is considered that in some situations the avoiding of tax may be direct and in other situations it may be indirect. 4.37 There is no discussion about the inclusion of the words “directly or indirectly” in the discussion documents relating to the abusive tax position penalty or in the Commentary on the Bill. It appears that the use of the words “directly or indirectly” in limbs (i) and (ii) was to ensure that the abusive tax position penalty applies as widely as possible and maintain consistency with the definition of “tax avoidance” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act. Section 141D(7)(b)(i) – the first limb 4.38 Section 141D(7)(b)(i) applies in situations where there is an arrangement with a dominant purpose of avoiding tax: (7) For the purposes of this Part and section 177C, an “abusive tax position” means a tax position that,— (a) Is an unacceptable tax position at the time at which the tax position is taken; and (b) Viewed objectively, the taxpayer takes— (i) In respect, or as a consequence, of an arrangement that is entered into with a dominant purpose of avoiding tax, whether directly or indirectly; or ... \[Emphasis added\] 4.39 For section 141D(7)(b)(i) to apply, the taxpayer must have taken a tax position that is an unacceptable tax position, and taken it “in respect, or as a consequence, of an arrangement that is entered into with a dominant purpose of avoiding tax...” 11 Whose purpose is to be tested? 4.40 Section 141D(7)(b)(i) does not indicate who or what the “dominant purpose” is to be tested in respect of, and could arguably be about either the dominant purpose of the taxpayer or the dominant purpose of the arrangement. While it could be argued that the test of the “dominant purpose” in section 141D(7)(b)(i) should be as to the dominant purpose of the taxpayer (particularly given the use of the words “entered into”), it is considered that the better view is that the dominant purpose of the arrangement is tested. Grammatical connection 4.41 Section 141D(7)(b)(i) provides for a taxpayer’s tax position, viewed objectively, having been taken “in respect, or as a consequence, of an arrangement that is entered into with a dominant purpose of avoiding tax, whether directly or indirectly”. Therefore, the grammatical connection of the “dominant purpose” in section 141D(7)(b)(i) is not clearly to the arrangement or the taxpayer. The provision merely suggests that the taxpayer’s tax position would need to flow from (in respect of, or as a consequence of) an arrangement which is entered into with a dominant purpose of tax avoidance. However, it is considered that the wording of the provision does not require the taxpayer to have a dominant purpose of tax avoidance for it to apply. 4.42 In support of the proposition that the arrangement’s “dominant purpose” is to be tested in section 141D(7)(b)(i), it is noted that the provision is split into two limbs. The first limb applies in situations involving an arrangement, and the second limb applies in situations not involving an arrangement (or not involving an arrangement of the type in the first limb). Reading the provision in such a way as to link the dominant purpose in the first limb to the taxpayer would make the splitting of the section into two limbs entirely unnecessary. The same result could have been reached by providing in one provision or limb that in all situations it is the dominant purpose of the taxpayer that is to be tested. Case law 4.43 That it is the purpose of the arrangement that is to be tested was also stated by Ronald Young J, in Erris Promotions and others v CIR (2003) 21 NZTC 18,330 at paragraph 374: The second part of the definition requires an abusive tax position to be taken. As has been said, this requires, in addition to an unacceptable interpretation, that at the same time, viewed objectively, the position of the taxpayer must be as a consequence of an arrangement that is entered into which has as its dominant purpose tax avoidance. And so I must consider if the dominant purpose of the joint venture, viewed objectively, was tax avoidance. Here s141D(7)(b)(i) is concerned not with the taxpayers intent or knowledge but with whether their claim for depreciation losses arose as a consequence from a scheme which had as its dominant purpose tax avoidance. \[Emphasis added\] 12 4.44 Such an interpretation is also consistent with the operation of the Income Tax Act 2004 (“the ITA”) general anti-avoidance provision. Section BG 1 of the ITA refers to a “tax avoidance arrangement” being void. The definition of “tax avoidance arrangement” in section OB 1 of the ITA refers to the purpose or effect of the arrangement being tax avoidance. 4.45 In Accent Management Ltd v CIR (2005) 22 NZTC 19,027, Venning J discussed the abusive tax position shortfall penalty. At paragraph 327, His Honour stated that the plaintiffs challenged the Commissioner’s imposition of 100% abusive tax position penalty for the 1998 income year on two principal grounds. The first ground was that the penalties were not validly imposed; and the second that, in the circumstances, the penalties were not appropriate, or if they were appropriate, the penalties ought not to have been imposed at 100% on the basis of an abusive tax position. After concluding that the penalty was validly imposed, Venning J concluded that the plaintiffs had taken an abusive tax position. He referred to the decision of Ronald Young J in Erris Promotions and stated at paragraphs 367 to 370: \[367\] Mr Stewart \[counsel for the plaintiffs\] emphasised the need for the Court to make a finding of dominant purpose. He submitted that Ronald Young J was incorrect in Erris Promotions to suggest the dominant purpose relates to the arrangement itself. He submitted that the better view was it is the purpose of the taxpayer to which the section is directed. \[368\] In Erris Promotions v CIR (2003) 21 NZTC 18,330 Ronald Young J said at para 374: The second part of the definition requires an abusive tax position to be taken. As has been said, this requires, in addition to an unacceptable interpretation, that at the same time, viewed objectively, the position of the taxpayer must be as a consequence of an arrangement that is entered into which has as its dominant purpose tax avoidance. And so I must consider if the dominant purpose of the joint venture, viewed objectively, was tax avoidance. Here s 141D(7)(b)(i) is concerned not with the taxpayers intent or knowledge but with whether their claim for depreciation losses arose as a consequence from a scheme which had as its dominant purpose tax avoidance. \[369\] I agree with Ronald Young J’s approach. The only matter that can be viewed objectively, as the subsection is drawn, is whether the arrangement was entered \[into\] with a dominant purpose of avoiding tax. The purpose of the section “to penalise those taxpayers who ... have entered into ... arrangements ... with a dominant purpose of taking ... tax positions that reduce or remove tax liabilities or give tax benefits” as set out in subsection 141D(1) is not met if the objective test is to be applied only to whether the taxpayer took a tax position in respect or as a consequence of an arrangement. The objective test applies to the assessment of dominant purpose. \[370\] In the present case the plaintiffs may well have had a general interest in investing long-term in a douglas fir forest. But for the reasons set out earlier, viewed objectively the dominant purpose of the arrangement entered in this case was undoubtedly to achieve the taxation benefits of the arrangement, at least for the first years before any corrective legislation was passed. The evidence satisfies me that were it not for those tax benefits the plaintiffs would not have entered into the investment in the Trinity Scheme. The plaintiffs became part of the Trinity Scheme with the dominant purpose of achieving those tax benefits. 13 4.46 Thus, the High Court has considered the dominant purpose in section 141D(7)(b)(i) on two occasions. Ronald Young J in Erris Promotions stated that section 141D(7)(b)(i) is concerned with the arrangement’s dominant purpose and is not concerned with the taxpayer’s purpose. Venning J in Accent Management considered a submission from counsel for the plaintiff that Ronald Young J in Erris Promotions was incorrect to suggest the dominant purpose relates to the arrangement itself, with counsel arguing that it was the purpose of the taxpayer that was relevant. After quoting the paragraph from Erris Promotions in which Ronald Young J stated that section 141D(7)(b)(i) concerns the dominant purpose of the arrangement rather than the taxpayer, Venning J commented that he agreed with Ronald Young J’s approach. Thus, the High Court has confirmed on two occasions that section 141D(7)(b)(i) tests the dominant purpose of the arrangement. Pre-legislative materials 4.47 That it is the purpose of the arrangement that is to be tested (rather than the purpose of the particular taxpayer) in section 141D(7)(b)(i) is further confirmed in the pre-legislative materials that led to the enactment of the provision. In the second discussion document, Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties 2: detailed proposals and draft legislation (April 1995) (the “second discussion document”), draft legislation of what became section 141D was published. In the draft legislation, the words chosen more clearly indicated that it was the arrangement’s dominant purpose that was to be tested. The following is the draft legislation and commentary for what is now section 141D, as it appeared in the second discussion document: Draft Legislation (5) In this section – (a) “Abusive tax position” means a tax position which – (i) At the time the taxpayer takes the taxpayer’s tax position is not a reasonably arguable position; and (ii) Is taken in respect of, or as a consequence of entering into, an abusive arrangement; (b) “Abusive arrangement” means an arrangement that, viewed objectively, has a dominant purpose of avoiding tax, whether directly or indirectly; ... Commentary ... Subsection (5)(b) An abusive arrangement means an arrangement which, viewed objectively, has a dominant purpose of avoiding tax. ... \[Emphasis added\] 14 4.48 As is apparent from the wording, the section as it was published as draft legislation, could only apply in situations in which there was an arrangement. 4.49 However, it was always intended that the penalty could potentially be applicable even where general or specific anti-avoidance provisions were not invoked in respect of the substantive tax issue. The intention that the section was to apply to a wide range of situations, including situations that did not involve an arrangement, is evidenced by a comment at paragraph 7.12 of the second discussion document: It is intended that the penalty for abusive arrangements apply not only in situations where a general or specific anti-avoidance provision is invoked, but also where other provisions have been applied. This recognises that the need to rely on an anti-avoidance provision does not necessarily indicate that the arrangement or tax position in question is inherently more deserving of a high penalty than are abusive interpretations of other provisions of the Acts. 4.50 However, before the legislation was enacted, it was realised that this original intention was at risk, and that (on the wording of the draft legislation) the penalty was potentially applicable only when there was an arrangement. By splitting the provision into two limbs, the scope of the provision was widened and therefore all potential “abusive tax positions” were able to be covered by the section. 4.51 In the Commentary on the Bill that enacted the provision, Taxpayer Compliance, Penalties, and Disputes Resolution Bill: Commentary on the Bill (September 1995), it was stated in the introductory section of the Commentary on the Bill that any significant policy changes (from the draft legislation to the sections as published in the Bill) would be commented on, in the commentary for each section. There was no statement in the commentary that the policy intention behind the abusive tax position provision had changed. 4.52 Therefore, while there were in fact changes made to the provision, which resulted in somewhat ambiguous wording, the original intention of the drafters in relation to an arrangement’s purpose in certain situations did not change. Conclusion on the first limb 4.53 Accordingly, it is considered that the better view is that the dominant purpose of tax avoidance in section 141D(7)(b)(i) relates to the arrangement rather than the purpose of the taxpayer that is taking the tax position in question. Section 141D(7)(b)(i) will be satisfied where a taxpayer has taken their tax position directly or indirectly in respect of or as a consequence of an arrangement that they have personally entered into, and the dominant purpose of the arrangement is tax avoidance. Section 141D(7)(b)(ii) – the second limb 4.54 Section 141D(7)(b)(ii) applies where the taxpayer has a dominant purpose of avoiding tax, either in situations where there is no arrangement, or in situations where it is not shown that the arrangement has a dominant purpose of avoiding tax: 15 (7) For the purposes of this Part and section 177C, an “abusive tax position” means a tax position that,— (a) Is an unacceptable tax position at the time at which the tax position is taken; and (b) Viewed objectively, the taxpayer takes— ... (ii) Where the tax position does not relate to an arrangement described in subparagraph (i), with a dominant purpose of avoiding tax, whether directly or indirectly. \[Emphasis added\] What is the scope of the second limb? 4.55 Section 141D(7)(b)(ii) applies where the tax position in question does not relate to an arrangement described in subparagraph (i). In such cases, the subparagraph will apply where there is an unacceptable tax position, and the taxpayer takes the tax position with a dominant purpose of avoiding tax. The “dominant purpose” of avoiding tax under section 141D(7)(d)(ii) is clearly a test of the taxpayer’s purpose, and will be tested at the time at which the taxpayer’s tax position is taken. 4.56 Section 141D(7)(b)(ii) is potentially applicable when there is no arrangement, or where there is an arrangement, but it cannot be shown that the arrangement itself has a dominant purpose of avoiding tax. In such situations, the provision will apply where the taxpayer has a dominant purpose of avoiding tax. Campbell Investments decision 4.57 The decision in CIR v Campbell Investments & Anor (2004) 21 NZTC 18,559 provides an example of the application of the abusive tax position shortfall penalty to a particular set of facts. In Campbell Investments the taxpayer was a syndicate with a taxable activity of leasing commercial properties. The syndicate members were Mr Montgomery, Mrs Montgomery and a family trust (the trustees of which also included Mr and Mrs Montgomery). The syndicate claimed that it transferred its 2 commercial properties to the syndicate members on 5 October 1997 for consideration of 1 peppercorn. On 22 May 1998 Mr and Mrs Montgomery executed an agreement for sale and purchase between themselves and the trustees of the family trust purporting to sell their interests in the properties, with settlement occurring on the earlier date of 30 January 1998. Payment was effected by way of a mortgage executed in favour of the trustees of the family trust on 30 July 1998. 4.58 The syndicate returned GST on the rentals for the properties for the 2 month period ended 31 January 1998. On 19 August 1998 the syndicate filed an amended return requesting a refund of the GST on the rentals that it claimed it had wrongly returned, as it claimed that the properties had been transferred to the syndicate members on 5 October 1997. The syndicate argued that it was no longer required to return GST on the rentals (and the syndicate members 16 were not GST registered, so also were not required to return GST on the rentals). 4.59 The Commissioner assessed the syndicate for GST output tax for the GST period ending 31 January 1998 on the transfer of the properties that was purported to have occurred on 30 January 1998. The Commissioner also sought to impose a shortfall penalty on the syndicate for taking an abusive tax position. 4.60 In the High Court decision, Wild J held that the 5 October 1997 transaction was not a supply of the property from the syndicate to the syndicate members. His Honour stated that all that occurred on 5 October 1997 was a transfer of legal title in the properties to the beneficial owners for a peppercorn, which was irrelevant to the syndicate’s continuing taxable activity. Further, Wild J held that the agreement for sale and purchase of the properties dated 22 May 1998 was not effective to create a supply of the properties on 30 January 1998. He held that the syndicate supplied the properties to the family trust on 30 July 1998 – the time when payment was made through the execution of the mortgages. 4.61 As a result, Wild J concluded that the syndicate was liable for output tax on the supply of the properties to the trust in the GST period ending 31 July 1998 – not in the period ending 31 January 1998 as assessed. This meant that no tax shortfall from the supply of the properties arose in the January 1998 GST period. However, Wild J held that the amended return for the period ending 31 January 1998 excluding the rentals received by the syndicate did give rise to a tax shortfall. 4.62 While not discussing the application of the abusive tax position penalty in significant detail, Wild J considered that the various steps taken by the parties were an arrangement that had a dominant purpose of avoiding tax. His Honour concluded that the syndicate was liable to account for GST on the rents received as indicated by the original return filed and the continued payment of the rents into the syndicate’s bank account. Wild J stated at paragraph 51 as follows: I regard the Syndicate’s tax position as abusive because it attempted (retrospectively) to give the 5 October 1997 transaction a GST significance it was not intended to have at the time it was entered into and did not have. That is established by the continued payment of rents from the properties into the Syndicate’s bank account... 4.63 Accordingly, Wild J upheld the imposition of the abusive tax position shortfall penalty in relation to the rents. While Wild J did not work through and comment on each of the statutory requirements as set out in this Interpretation Statement, he appears to have been influenced by the arrangement being “artificial and contrived” and involving “spurious interpretations”. 4.64 Wild J further stated (obiter) that the syndicate should have accounted for GST on the supply of the properties to the family trust on 30 July 1998. He noted that this gave rise to a tax shortfall, and in his view, the syndicate took an abusive tax position by not accounting for the supply in its GST return for the 17 period ending 31 July 1998. The position was abusive as the syndicate had attempted to backdate the sale and purchase agreement on 22 May 1998, and had attempted to give the 5 October 1997 transaction GST significance (as a supply of the properties for a peppercorn) when it was not a supply of the properties at all. RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER SHORTFALL PENALTIES 4.65 Determining which of the shortfall penalties applies to a tax shortfall will always depend upon the facts of any given situation. Each of the shortfall penalties is charged as a percentage of the tax shortfall, depending on the seriousness of the breach. 4.66 The not taking reasonable care and unacceptable tax position shortfall penalties are the lowest of the penalties in terms of culpability and are charged at a rate of 20% of the tax shortfall. 4.67 The gross carelessness shortfall penalty is chargeable where a taxpayer is grossly careless in taking their tax position. This will usually be where, objectively, the taxpayer has acted recklessly in taking their tax position and the circumstances suggest a complete or high level of disregard for the consequences of their actions. The penalty for gross carelessness is chargeable at 40% of the tax shortfall. This is higher than the not taking reasonable care and unacceptable tax position shortfall penalties, but less than the penalty for taking an abusive tax position, reflecting the relative levels of culpability. 4.68 The abusive tax position shortfall penalty requires a higher level of culpability. As shown above, the penalty requires the dominant purpose of either the taxpayer or the arrangement to be to avoid tax, which is a higher level of culpability than the recklessness required for the gross carelessness penalty. For a taxpayer charged with the gross carelessness shortfall penalty the circumstances will suggest the taxpayer had a complete or high level of disregard for the consequences, rather than a dominant purpose, or even any purpose, of avoiding tax. The percentage of the tax shortfall chargeable for the abusive tax position penalty reflects the relative seriousness of the breach, at 100% of the tax shortfall. 4.69 The onus of proof for the abusive tax position, gross carelessness, unacceptable tax position, and not taking reasonable care penalties rests with the taxpayer. 4.70 The highest shortfall penalty in terms of culpability and the percentage of the tax shortfall chargeable is the evasion shortfall penalty. An example of a situation where the evasion shortfall penalty would apply is where the taxpayer knows that an obligation to pay tax exists, but evades the assessment of tax by simply not paying that which is known to be owing (section 141E(1)(a)). The penalty will also apply, for example, if the taxpayer knowingly does not make a deduction which is required to be made by a tax law (section 141E(1)(c)). The level of the penalty, at 150% of the resulting tax shortfall, reflects the seriousness of the breach. 18 4.71 For the evasion shortfall penalty the onus of proof rests with the Commissioner. 4.72 The distinction between the dominant purpose of avoiding tax required for the abusive tax position penalty to apply, and knowingly evading tax for the evasion shortfall penalty to apply, goes beyond the difference in the onus of proof. In situations where (for example) the actions of a taxpayer or an arrangement show that the taxpayer’s affairs are structured to reduce or defer a potential or prospective liability to tax and this is done with a dominant purpose to avoid tax, the abusive tax position penalty will apply. In contrast, for the evasion penalty to apply (for example) the taxpayer knows that a liability to tax exists, but knowingly ignores that liability and completely fails to pay the amount of tax the taxpayer knows it is required to pay. CONCLUSION 4.73 The section 141D abusive tax position shortfall penalty can apply whether or not there is an arrangement. For section 141D(7)(b)(i) to apply, there must be an arrangement, and the dominant purpose of that arrangement must be tax avoidance. Section 141D(7)(b)(ii) applies where there is no arrangement, or there is no arrangement of the kind described in section 141D(7)(b)(i) and the dominant purpose of the taxpayer in taking their tax position is tax avoidance. The phrase “dominant purpose of avoiding tax” means that the most influential and prevailing purpose of the arrangement, or the taxpayer (depending on whether section 141D(7)(b)(i) or section 141D(7)(b)(ii) is applied) is to avoid tax. 5. EXAMPLES EXAMPLE 1 The taxpayers are a clothing manufacturing company and the four individuals who are shareholders in that company. Two of those individuals are executive directors and full-time employees of the company and the other two shareholders are the respective wives of those executives. The shares in the company are sold by the individuals to C, a company controlled by W, through a tax loss group of companies also controlled by W. Declarations of trust are completed so that the four shareholders hold the shares on trust for C. The share purchase is funded by a loan from the vendor shareholders to C. The net profit of the taxpayer company is paid as an administration charge to C at six-monthly intervals. Approximately 77.5% of that administration charge is paid to the taxpayers in reduction of the loan secured by the mortgage of shares. The shareholders also operate the company business under a management contract and receive income for doing that. An important part of the deal is that the individual taxpayers have a buy-back option over the taxpayer company’s business. The deal is subsequently extended for a further three 19 years by surrendering the buy-back option for $4.5 million. The business is then reacquired by the taxpayers several years later. Is the abusive tax position shortfall penalty chargeable on these facts, under either of section 141D(7)(b)(i) or (ii)? The transactions involved amount to an arrangement. The activities of the taxpayers and the arrangement entered into by the taxpayers are primarily designed to relieve the taxpayer company and the individual taxpayers from liability to pay income tax or, at least, to reduce or postpone any such liability. The arrangement is a tax avoidance arrangement which is void under section BG 1 of the ITA. In fact, the High Court in Miller and Ors v Commissioner of Inland Revenue; McDougall and Anor v Commissioner of Inland Revenue; Managed Fashions Ltd and Ors v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,219 described a situation such as this as being as “blatant an example of tax avoidance as can be imagined.” The tax positions taken by the taxpayers in entering into the arrangement are not about as likely as not to be correct. The individual taxpayers retained the benefit of all significant elements of their original ownership and management of the company in addition to allowing them the benefit of receiving tax-free revenue less the administration and consulting fees. By filing their individual tax returns each taxpayer has taken an incorrect tax position. Therefore, the taxpayers have each taken an unacceptable tax position, and assuming the $20,000 threshold is met, would satisfy section 141D(4). The next requirement is that either the arrangement or the individual taxpayers have a dominant purpose of avoiding tax. The arrangement entered into by the taxpayers was convoluted and unnecessarily complex. The transactions in the arrangement show that the arrangement had a dominant purpose of avoiding tax. As stated by Baragwanath J in the High Court decision in Miller at page 13,235: Whether the transactions are examined minutely according to their black letter or more broadly in context I am unable to escape the conclusion that they constitute a device the dominant purpose and effect of which is tax avoidance. In my view they clearly infringe s 99 both literally and according to the “propriety test” that I have employed. Therefore, on these facts, the abusive tax position penalty would be chargeable under section 141D(7)(b)(i), as the dominant purpose of the arrangement entered into by the taxpayers was avoiding tax. If the arrangement did not have a dominant purpose of avoiding tax, the abusive tax position shortfall penalty would instead be chargeable under section 141D(7)(b)(ii), as the dominant purpose of the taxpayers in taking their tax positions was avoiding tax. \[This example is based on the facts and decision in Case R25 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,120 and the appeal decision, Miller and Ors v Commissioner of Inland Revenue; McDougall and Anor v Commissioner of Inland Revenue; Managed Fashions Ltd and Ors v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,219.\] 20 EXAMPLE 2 The taxpayer is a shareholder in a loss attributing qualifying company (LAQC). The LAQC is an investor in a mass marketed investment scheme. The investment is made by way of acquiring an interest in a joint venture. The taxpayer, who is on the top marginal tax rate, is interested in the losses the investment scheme would generate and which could be off-set against his other income. The taxpayer is aware that his/her return from the investment would arise from the tax savings the scheme generated, rather than the ultimate profitability of the scheme. The joint venture claims deductions resulting in losses allocated to the investors. For investors on the top marginal tax rate the tax benefits of the losses over the first 3 years exceeds the amount of the original investment made by the taxpayer. The ultimate profitability of the joint venture is highly uncertain. Is the abusive tax position shortfall penalty chargeable on these facts, under either of section 141D(7)(b)(i) or (ii)? The mass marketed investment scheme is a tax avoidance arrangement which is void for tax purposes under section BG 1 of the Income Tax Act. Even if no sales of the joint venture’s product take place, every investor will still obtain a substantial return on their investment due to the tax benefits from the deductions claimed. There is little or no commercial aspect to the scheme that can be substantiated. The dominant purpose of the joint venture arrangement is the avoidance of tax. The taxpayer, in entering into the scheme also has a dominant purpose of avoiding tax. In these circumstances the tax position taken in claiming the deductions is incorrect because of the application of section BG 1. It is not about as likely as not to be correct. Therefore, assuming the tax shortfall exceeds $20,000, both the LAQC and the taxpayer have taken unacceptable tax positions and section 141D(4) will be satisfied. Further, both the LAQC and the taxpayer have taken tax positions as a consequence of the joint venture arrangement that has a dominant purpose of avoiding tax. However, pursuant to section 141FD of the TAA (or section 141FC for tax positions taken between 1 April 1998 and 1 April 2005), the abusive tax position shortfall penalty can only be applied to either the LAQC or the taxpayer. Therefore, on these facts, the abusive tax position shortfall penalty would be chargeable under section 141D(7)(b)(i), as claiming the deductions involved taking a tax position in respect or as a consequence of an arrangement which had a dominant purpose of avoiding tax. If the arrangement did not have a dominant purpose of avoiding tax (yet was still void under section BG 1), the abusive tax position shortfall penalty would instead be chargeable under section 141D(7)(b)(ii). The taxpayer, in claiming the deductions, has taken a tax position with the dominant purpose of avoiding tax. 21 \[The facts in this example are similar to the facts in Accent Management Ltd v CIR (2005) 22 NZTC 19,027 and Erris Promotions and others v CIR (2003) 21 NZTC 18,330 where the High Court held in each case that the arrangement had a dominant purpose of avoiding tax, and therefore section 141D applied.\] 22
