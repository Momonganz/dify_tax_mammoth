Clauses 5, 21, 62, 63, 65, 92, 95, 107, 112, 157 Introduction The proposed changes ensure that interest incurred by most companies is deductible, subject only to the existing thin capitalisation and conduit interest allocation rules. The companies affected are all companies other than qualifying companies and companies that derive certain forms of exempt income (for example, charities and local authorities). The bill proposes applying this clarification from the 2001-02 income year. Two remedial amendments are also being made to overcome any doubt inadvertently created by amendments to the Income Tax Act’s core provisions in 1997. The first amendment is to ensure that the rule that allows companies to deduct interest on borrowings used to capitalise subsidiaries that are at least 66 percent owned is fully effective. The second remedial amendment confirms that interest incurred is generally timed under the accrual rules and is not retimed by any other timing rules in the Act. These remedial amendments are to be backdated to the application of the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996, that is, from the 1997-98 income year. The bill also makes consequential reference changes affecting sections FG 8, FG 9, FH 5, HB 2, HG 9 and LF 7. Overview of submissions Seven submissioners commented on the bill’s interest deductibility provisions. All supported the general thrust to clarify and make certain the rules on the deductibility of interest, acknowledging the compliance cost savings. The most common theme in submissions related to the application dates of the proposals. 4 TIMING APPLICATION Issue: Effective date of core interest deductibility proposal Clause 21 Submission (3 – Rudd Watts & Stone, 7 – Corporate Taxpayer Group, 9 – Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, 8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 4 – New Zealand Law Society) These submissions propose that the core interest deduction proposal: • be made retrospective to the 1996-97 income year, when the thin capitalisation rules became effective (Rudd Watts & Stone and New Zealand Law Society) ; or • be made retrospective to the 1997-98 income year, when the core provisions became effective (Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, and Corporate Taxpayer Group) ; or • should extend to all open year tax returns (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) . Comment Notwithstanding that from a policy perspective it is agreed that interest incurred by companies should be deductible, submissioners wanted to ensure that there would be no dispute about past interest deductions, given the uncertainty surrounding the application of the existing law. This uncertainty has been increased by the two issues papers on interest deductibility circulated by Inland Revenue’s Adjudication and Rulings division. Submissioners have, therefore, proposed that the application of the new rules should be backdated. We accept that there are grounds for backdating the core proposals to increase certainty. Not doing so runs the risk of structures previously thought valid being overturned. Any past date is arbitrary. However, it seems that accepting the suggestion of going back to the start of the 1997-98 income year, when the core provision changes took effect, is appropriate. It would cover the period of four years in which the Commissioner could normally reassess a taxpayer’s position. We believe there is little, if any, fiscal, compliance or administrative cost associated with this retrospectivity. However, the certainty gained by taxpayers appears to be significant. Recommendation That the core interest deductibility rule be made retrospective to the 1997-98 income year, when the core provisions of the Income Tax Act were made effective. 5 Issue: Timing of interest deductions Clauses 62, 63, & 65 Submission (3AW – Rudd Watts & Stone) The proposed rule to ensure that interest expense as timed by the accrual rules is not retimed by any other timing rule (such as the revenue account property rule) should not be retrospective and should not apply to proposals for which commitments have been made, particularly in relation to film expenditure. Comment Following the rewrite of the Act’s core provisions, which took effect from the 1997- 98 income year, it has been arguable that interest associated with a project is a cost of that project and, therefore, is not deductible until the income from the project is realised. As we understand it, general taxpayer practice is to deduct interest as a period expense, in the period in which it is timed by the accrual rules. The proposed amendment in the bill confirms this practice and is, therefore, taxpayer-friendly as it removes any doubt about having to defer the deduction. From a tax policy perspective, interest should be regarded as a periodic expense, not a project cost, as the project's value does not vary merely because it is debt financed rather than equity financed. In any case, as the Government discussion document on interest deductibility points out, it is frequently not possible to trace borrowings and, therefore, interest expense to their end use. Thus rules which would regard interest as a project expense would largely be ineffective. Backdating the change is necessary to ensure that past treatment of the interest as a periodic expense is not overturned. Accordingly, the first part of the submission is not appropriate. The second part of the submission asks that interest that forms part of a film’s cost be excluded from the new rule when commitments have already been entered into. Again, the issue is one of ensuring that when interest has been regarded by taxpayers as a periodic expense, it should not be retrospectively changed. Officials doubt that anyone will be able to offer an assurance that no film-maker has regarded interest as a periodic cost. However, it seems reasonable that when taxpayers have not regarded, or were not intending to regard, interest as a periodic expense, whether in relation to films or any other type of project, that they should be able to choose to defer the deduction if they want to. Among other things, this will ensure that tax returns do not have to be re- opened when interest has been regarded as a project cost. 6 Accordingly, taxpayers should be allowed, as a transitional arrangement, to regard interest as a cost subject to the timing rules in the following circumstances: • if they have filed tax returns on that basis; or • if in respect of unfiled 2000-01 and 2001-02 returns, they file on that basis. There seems to be no point in going through a more formal election basis, or requiring them, say, to have a commitment to file on that basis. Almost all taxpayers will be quite happy to presume that interest is a periodic expense. Those that could be adversely affected would, however, have a choice. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but when taxpayers have filed on the basis that interest is a project cost, not a periodic cost, that position be grandfathered, and when, in respect of unfiled 2000-01 and 2001-02 returns, they file on a project cost basis, this be acceptable. This arrangement would not be confined to film expenditure. 7 DEFINITION OF “COMPANY” Issue: The deriving of tax-exempt income from treasury stock Clause 21 Submission (7 – Corporate Taxpayer Group, 9 – Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, 10 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 4 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand ) Company taxpayers who derive exempt income from the on-sale of treasury stock should not be excluded from using the core interest deductibility rule. Comment Companies are allowed, under the Companies Act 1993, to buy and sell their own shares – when they hold their own shares this is called treasury stock. Tax law makes the sale proceeds exempt income whether the shares are sold at a profit or a loss. The bill proposes that the core interest deductibility rule would not apply when a company derives exempt income other than exempt dividends. The holding of treasury stock, while not being an everyday commercial event, should not, from a tax policy perspective, cause interest deductions to be limited. Therefore we agree with the submission. However, the submission raises wider issues about whether there are other forms of exempt income that should qualify. What, for example, if another company in the group of companies derives the exempt income, or if the exempt income is an ancillary part of a taxable business, such as a horse stud deriving race winnings? From a tax policy perspective, the first question raises significant issues, which we have discussed with the submissioners. The issue is that in a corporate group it is often not possible to trace borrowings to their eventual use. Indeed this is the reason for the proposed core rule. However, the core rule means that one group company can claim the interest deduction while another derives the exempt income. The exempt income limitation on the rule should, therefore, be extended to all group companies when one group company derives exempt income. The second question can be specifically dealt with. When the race prize money is an ancillary part of a wider associated business, say a breeding operation, the core rule should apply; otherwise it should not. We have considered all other income that the Income Tax Act exempts and are not concerned that this other income gives rise to any problems. 8 Recommendation 1.That the submission be accepted; 2.that when prize money is won as an ancillary part of a breeding operation, the core interest deductibility rule should apply; and 3.when a group company derives inappropriate exempt income, the core rule should not apply to any group company. Issue: The timing of deriving gross income Clause 21 Submission (7 – Corporate Taxpayer Group, 9 – Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu) The timing of the derivation of exempt income needs to be made more explicit by stipulating that the deriving of exempt income is “in the year in which the relevant interest deduction is being taken”. Comment Clause 21 stipulates that “a company does not include a qualifying company or a company that derives exempt income, unless all of the exempt income is from dividends”. The submissions are concerned that this wording is too loose. Does the deriving of exempt income in any year result in exclusion, or does the test apply on an annual basis? If the test is not on an annual basis, the submissions suggest that it may be impossible to substantiate that a company will never derive exempt income other than dividends. Trying to tie the incurrence of interest expense to any particular income stream is not feasible. This is a driving force behind the reforms in the bill that remove the need to link the interest expense to the deriving of income. The same tracing problem arises with exempt income. The wording in the bill presumes an on-going flow of exempt income, such as with a local authority, in which case whether the test is applied annually or otherwise, the result is the same. But, if the exempt income stream is variable, then the timing aspect becomes important. Our view is that the wording in the draft bill would apply the test to the income year in question, which is what the submissions want to achieve, rather than being open-ended. Therefore the additional wording proposed by the submissions is unnecessary. 9 Applying the submissions’ argument for the extra wording would mean that other implicit tests in the legislation would need to be qualified by reference to income years. For example, the test of whether an entity is in fact a “company” applies on an income year basis, but the submissions have not proposed additional wording in relation to other tests. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Non-resident companies Clause 21 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The definition of ‘company’ in the new core interest deductibility rule should be qualified to confirm that for a company based outside of New Zealand which undertakes business in New Zealand, interest can only be deducted in relation to its New Zealand business. Comment Many entities operate in New Zealand as branches of overseas companies, those branches being legally part of the overseas companies. For tax purposes, such companies are treated as non-resident companies because they are neither incorporated in New Zealand, have their head offices in New Zealand, nor are controlled from New Zealand. New Zealand taxes non-resident companies on their New Zealand business and allows deductions for expenses, such as interest, only in relation to that business. In changing the interest deductibility rule for companies, we are not intending also to allow non-resident companies to deduct their interest expenses in relation to their non- New Zealand activities. Such a move could have significant fiscal implications. The bill as introduced, however, leaves the issue open to doubt. To remove this doubt we propose to explicitly exclude non-resident companies from using the new core interest deductibility rule by amending the definition of ‘company’ in clause 21. The definition would be amended to exclude non-resident companies except to the extent they incur interest associated with their business in New Zealand run through a fixed establishment in New Zealand or in relation to property they own in New Zealand. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 10 DRAFTING ISSUES Issue: Override of the exempt income prohibition Clause 5 Submission (4 – New Zealand Law Society) Section BD 2(2)(b) (the provision that excludes the deduction of expenditure incurred in deriving exempt income) should be expressly overridden in the same fashion as section BD 2(2)(e) (the provision that allows certain capital expenditure to be deductible). Comment Clause 5 of the bill achieves this so no further change is necessary. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Separate provision for interest rules Clause 21 Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) There should be a separate section for the interest deduction provisions. This would also necessitate a review of the consequential amendments proposed in the bill. Comment Currently, the provisions relating to the deductibility of interest are located in section DD 1 (investment income expenditure). The section also covers property rental expenses and losses incurred on the demolition or destruction of premises. We agree that the interest rules are a sufficiently significant aspect to warrant a section of their own in the Income Tax Act. This issue is, however, more appropriately handled as part of the rewriting of the Act, as a core objective of the rewrite is the better reorganisation of the Act. Legislation resulting from that rewrite is planned for late this year or early next year. Reorganising the Act for the interest provisions as part of this bill would, therefore, be an unnecessary temporary fix causing a series of consequential amendments. 11 Recommendation That the submission be declined, but the concept of a separate interest provision be addressed in the rewrite project. Issue: Renumbering of section DD 1 Clause 21 Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The renumbering of section DD 1 as DD 1(1) should be made explicit in the bill with effect from the date of the new subsection (2). Comment In clause 21, additional provisions are being added to section DD 1. Because section DD 1 currently contains only one subsection, the new provisions are numbered DD 1(2) and DD 1(3), with DD 1 becoming DD 1(1). The renumbering of DD 1 as DD 1(1) occurs automatically during the compilation stage of the legislation process. This is standard practice. It is, therefore, unnecessary for clause 21 to have a separate provision explicitly dealing with this. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 12 INTEREST DEDUCTIONS FOR PARTNERSHIPS Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The issue of interest deductions for partnerships should be addressed as part of the tax work programme project on partnerships. Comment The provisions in the bill cover certain companies only. Extending the proposals beyond companies would require significant work because of concerns about the private/business boundary. The tax policy work programme includes a project on aspects of the tax treatment of partnerships, and interest deductions could be considered in that context as requested. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Research and development 15 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ( R&D) – FRS 13 PROPOSAL Clause 39 Overview The bill introduces into the Act new sections DJ 9A and DJ 9B. The purpose of the new provisions is to reduce the uncertainty taxpayers experience in classifying R&D expenditure as either “revenue” expenditure, which is immediately deductible (provided certain conditions are met), or “capital” expenditure, which is deductible over time or may not be deductible at all. The provisions enable taxpayers to adopt the accounting classification of revenue/capital for tax purposes. Broadly, section DJ 9A provides that R&D costs that are expensed for accounting purposes under Financial Reporting Standard 13 are not expenditure “of a capital nature” for the purposes of the Income Tax Act. This will enable R&D costs that are expensed under FRS 13 to be deductible immediately for tax provided this is allowed under general rules (that is, where there is a nexus with income, and the deduction is not otherwise prohibited). Costs that are automatically expensed under FRS 13 because they are immaterial, however, are not automatically classified as revenue for tax purposes. The criteria in paragraphs 5.3 and 5.4 of FRS 13, which determine whether costs are revenue or capital for accounting, must be applied to such expenditure for tax purposes. There were six submissions on the proposals. Submissions generally supported the introduction of the rules, although there were concerns about certain requirements and implementing the rules by way of a cross-reference in the Income Tax Act to an accounting standard. The Institute of Chartered Accountants noted those aspects of the provisions with which it agreed. However, we have referred in our report only to submissions seeking change. 16 INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN DRAFT LEGISLATION AND EXPLANATORY NOTE Clause 39 Submission (1 – New Zealand Law Society) The explanatory note is inconsistent with the drafting of the new provisions. The explanatory note states that taxpayers will be able to deduct for tax R&D expenditure that they expense for accounting. As currently drafted, the new provision would not have the effect of automatically making this expenditure deductible. All it does is remove the application of the capital prohibition rule to such expenditure. Also, expenditure that is expensed for accounting because it is immaterial is not automatically deductible. Comment Officials agree that the explanatory note is not strictly consistent with the provisions in the bill. That is, R&D expenditure that is expensed for accounting under financial reporting standard 13 (FRS 13) will not be automatically deductible. For example, expenditure that is expensed for accounting because it is immaterial is not automatically deductible. Also, a deduction could be denied if there was not a sufficient nexus with the derivation of income, or if one of the exclusions in section BD 2(2) of the Income Tax Act applied, for example if: • the expenditure was of a private or domestic nature, or • the expenditure was incurred in deriving exempt income, or • the expenditure was incurred in deriving income from employment. Although this more detailed analysis is not set out in the explanatory note, a full explanation of the provisions, including the above matters, is contained in the separate Commentary on the Bill . Recommendation No recommendation is required. 17 REFERENCE IN INCOME TAX ACT TO FRS 13 Clause 39 Issue: Incorporation of FRS 13 into the legislation Submission (1 – New Zealand Law Society, 3 – Rudd Watts & Stone) The approach in the bill of incorporating FRS 13 into the Income Tax Act by cross- reference (rather than reproducing the relevant parts of FRS 13 in the Act) may lead to uncertainty if and when the standard changes. This is because it is unclear whether a court, when interpreting an amended FRS 13, would adopt a “static” or “ambulatory” approach. (Broadly, if the court adopted a “static” approach it would apply the version of FRS 13 that was current when the legislation was enacted. If the court adopted an “ambulatory” approach, it would apply the version of FRS 13 that was current at the time the court was interpreting the provisions.) Incorporation by reference effectively enables the Accounting Standards Review Board (via sections 24 and 28 of the Financial Reporting Act) to amend tax law. It cannot have been Parliament’s intention to give the Board the power, without consultation, to alter the scope of tax law without reference to Parliament. The appropriate parts of FRS 13 should be reproduced in full in the legislation. Comment Officials consider that there are significant advantages in the proposed approach, which adopts the relevant parts of FRS 13 in tax legislation by way of cross-reference to FRS 13 rather than by reproducing the relevant parts in the legislation. If the appropriate parts of FRS 13 were reproduced in the Income Tax Act, a court might interpret the words differently than if it were interpreting FRS 13 itself. This is all the more likely because the relevant paragraphs in FRS 13 are interpreted in the light of an accompanying commentary. As the proposal is intended to clarify the capital/revenue boundary for tax purposes by linking it to the asset recognition criteria used for accounting purposes, departures from the accounting standard should be kept to a minimum. In addition, officials consider that one of the strengths of incorporation by reference is that the tax law can automatically follow accounting practice in the area of R&D without the need to amend the tax legislation. While this would seem to provide the Accounting Standards Review Board with the power to alter the scope of tax law in this area, we understand that amendments to Financial Reporting Standards only take place after extensive consultation. This will allow changes to be monitored in time to allow a government to determine the effect of such changes and Parliament to change the tax law if necessary. 18 This approach of cross-referencing in the Income Tax Act to a financial reporting standard already applies in relation to the trading stock provisions, which refer to FRS 4 (Accounting for Inventories). As far as officials are aware, this has not caused any difficulty. Officials do, however, agree that, if FRS 13 should change, it may be unclear whether the original or new version of the standard applies. As taxpayers generally should be able to track accounting practice in this area, it is appropriate that the provision refer to the latest version of FRS 13. This is the approach adopted in the trading stock rules which refer to FRS 4, or an equivalent standard issued in its place. Recommendation That section DJ 9A be amended to make it clear that the reference to FRS 13 is a reference to the latest version of FRS 13. Issue: Accounting principles should not be imported into the tax law Submission (5 – Rudd Watts & Stone) While it is recognised that compliance costs can sometimes be reduced by aligning accounting and tax principles, it is not desirable to import a reference to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the manner proposed. Accounting standards are prepared without the precision necessary for importing into tax law. Also, accounting standards are prepared for a different purpose than tax legislation – for example, the application of accounting standards generally understates income. There is also an issue of knowledge – not all taxpayers will necessarily have ready access to FRS 13, or be able to be sure that they have the most recent version of it. Comment Officials accept that financial reporting standards and tax legislation are written with different purposes in mind. Financial reporting standards are written to ensure that accountants following the standards provide their stakeholders with a “true and fair view” of the entity’s economic position for the period in question. Tax rules, on the other hand, are written to provide an accurate reflection of taxpayers’ income for an income year. While these purposes are clearly different, certain aspects of financial reporting standards are useful for tax law purposes. For example, the asset-recognition criteria in FRS 13 can be usefully adopted for tax purposes. This is because the tests provide useful guidelines for approximating when a capital asset has been created for tax purposes – an area that is currently very uncertain. 19 However, officials recognise that not all of FRS 13 is useful in this respect. This is why the new rules do not adopt every aspect of FRS 13. For example, the concept of materiality is important for accounting purposes because it ensures that the users of the financial reports are presented only with that information that is likely to influence their decisions or assessments. The accounting concept of materiality is not useful for tax purposes because amounts that are immaterial to a particular entity for accounting purposes may nevertheless be relevant in ascertaining a taxpayer’s income for an income year. This is why the concept of materiality has not been adopted for tax purposes. In relation to the criticism that not all taxpayers will have access to FRS 13, officials point out that the provisions are optional – taxpayers can use the existing law if they prefer. Taxpayers who do not want to use existing law must refer to FRS 13 – in that case the provisions require the application of FRS 13. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 20 OPTION TO USE CURRENT LAW OR NEW RULES Clause 39 Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Section DJ 9A(7) should be repealed. This provision allows taxpayers who apply FRS 13 for accounting to opt out of the new rules for tax by notifying the Commissioner. There should be no requirement for a taxpayer to notify the Commissioner to prevent the provisions from applying. It should be clear that taxpayers can choose whether they apply the current R&D rules or the proposed deduction accounting rules based on FRS 13. (10 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposed provisions should be amended to clarify whether the requirement to give notice under the proposed section DJ 9A(7) is optional or mandatory for taxpayers. If the requirement to give notice is mandatory, the provision should be removed on the basis that it is not necessary. If the provision is still considered necessary, the company tax return should be amended to provide taxpayers with a reminder to meet the opting out requirement. Comment The new R&D rules are intended to be optional. Section DJ 9A(7), as currently drafted, assumes that the new rules are the default and that taxpayers must opt out of them into the general deductibility rules by giving notice to the Commissioner. We agree that notification imposes a compliance cost on taxpayers and propose that section DJ 9A(7) be replaced with a provision that retains the optional status of the new section without the need to notify the Commissioner so that neither the general deductibility rules nor the new rules apply as a default. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted and section DJ 9A(7) be replaced with a provision that acknowledges the optional status of the new section without the need to notify the Commissioner. 21 FOLLOWING FRS 13 IN ITS ENTIRETY Clause 39 Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) If taxpayers choose to use the new R&D rules they should be able to apply FRS 13 for tax purposes with no adjustment. One of the stated benefits of the new provisions was a reduction in compliance costs. To require taxpayers to adjust their R&D accounting calculation for tax purposes compromises many of the stated compliance benefits. Comment The purpose of the new R&D rules was not to mirror the accounting rules. The purpose was instead to clarify the R&D capital/revenue boundary by using the tests that accountants employ to establish whether an asset with sufficiently certain future economic benefits has been created. There are a number of aspects of FRS 13 that are not useful to ascertaining this boundary. For example, paragraph 2.3 of FRS 13 (which allows non-material R&D to be automatically expensed) is not concerned with this issue. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 22 APPLICATION OF PARAGRAPHS 5.14 AND 5.15 OF FRS 13 Clause 39 Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The write-off and write-down provisions in paragraphs 5.14 and 5.15 of FRS 13 should apply for tax purposes. In policy terms, there is no difference between section DJ 9A(2), which allows a deduction for an amount not capitalised under paragraph 5.4, and a provision that would allow a deduction for an amount written-down or written-off under paragraphs 5.14 or 5.15. To deny taxpayers the benefit of these paragraphs also perpetuates the “black hole”. (“Black hole” refers to expenditure that is neither immediately deductible nor deductible over the economic life of the asset to which the expenditure relates.) Comment The problem that the FRS 13 proposal is addressing is a lack of certainty over the capital/revenue boundary. Using the five asset-recognition criteria in FRS 13 as a proxy for that boundary is designed to reduce that uncertainty, and assist taxpayers in determining how much of their R&D expenditure in any income year is deductible for tax purposes. Paragraph 5.4 of FRS-13 limits the amount of development expenditure that can be treated as capital, to the amount of the likely future economic benefit flowing from the expenditure. Because applying paragraph 5.4 can affect the amount of current year expenditure that is treated as capital or revenue, it is logical that it be allowed to be taken into account. Paragraphs 5.14 and 5.15 apply if new information comes to light in subsequent periods, and require expenditure previously treated as capital to be reversed out of the relevant asset value and treated as revenue. The Institute has not suggested that paragraph 5.16 be applied. That paragraph requires expenditure previously written down or written off under paragraph 5.14 or 5.15 to be reinstated if the circumstances that warranted the write-down or write-off change again. If paragraphs 5.14 and 5.15 were to be taken into account, which we do not recommend, paragraph 5.16 would have to be also. Officials do not support allowing these adjustments to be made. Because these paragraphs deal with subsequent periods, they affect the period over which an asset is written down for accounting purposes. If this submission were accepted, it could affect the rate at which an asset created from R&D was depreciated for tax purposes. It was never the intention that the FRS 13 proposal affect depreciation rates on such assets. This goes well beyond the purpose of the FRS-13 proposal, which is to reduce uncertainty over the capital/revenue boundary. 23 In some cases these adjustments could relate to an income year before the depreciation rules become relevant. An example is where the five asset-recognition criteria are satisfied and the relevant expenditure is, therefore, treated as capital. If the asset is not used in the following income year, and information comes to light in that year showing that some or all of that expenditure should be treated as revenue, an adjustment could be made before tax depreciation provisions apply. However, even when tax depreciation rates would not be affected, officials do not support the submission. Reflecting for tax purposes adjustments made for accounting under paragraphs 5.14, 5.15 and 5.16 goes beyond the purpose of the proposal, and significantly increases the complexity of the provisions. The Institute suggests that allowing these adjustments would reduce the “black hole” problem. The “black hole” problem arises where expenditure is on capital account and, therefore, cannot be deducted immediately, and does not give rise to an asset that can be depreciated for tax purposes. While it is possible that applying paragraphs 5.14 and 5.15 could increase the amount of expenditure that is immediately deductible, officials consider that the complexity created by such rules would not justify any limited reduction in the “black hole”. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 24 R&D CARRIED OUT BY OR ON BEHALF OF A TAXPAYER Clause 39 Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Proposed section DJ 9A(3), which limits the application of the new rules to R&D carried out by the taxpayer or by a person on the taxpayer’s behalf, is unnecessary and should be removed. Comment Officials agree with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 25 MATERIALITY Issue: Immaterial expenditure should be immediately deductible Clause 39 Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 10 PricewaterhouseCoopers, 11 – New Zealand Chambers of Commerce) Taxpayers should not, for tax purposes, be required to subject R&D expenditure that has been expensed under FRS 13 because it is immaterial, to the five asset-recognition criteria in FRS 13. Immaterial R&D expenditure should be immediately deducted for tax purposes. One of the stated purposes of the new rules was to reduce compliance costs through taxpayers being able to use their end of year accounts for tax purposes. By ignoring concepts of materiality, taxpayers will be required to review their accounting R&D figure and make adjustments for tax purposes. This will reduce greatly the intended compliance cost savings. The incentive that exists to capitalise for accounting purposes (to maximise profits) will prevent the materiality concept being abused. If this natural tension does not prevent abuse in every case, Inland Revenue has reserved the power under section DJ 9B to prevent expenditure from being claimed as R&D. Comment Under paragraph 2.3 of FRS 13, the five asset-recognition criteria apply only if their application is of material consequence. This means that if an amount of R&D expenditure incurred by a firm is not material, it may all be expensed for accounting purposes. The proposed section DJ 9A(4) states that if a taxpayer wants to make use of the new R&D provisions, the five asset-recognition criteria must be applied to all R&D expenditure whether or not their application is of material consequence. The purpose of the new R&D rules is not to “reduce compliance costs through taxpayers being able to use their end-of-year accounts for tax purposes”. As noted earlier, the purpose of the new rules is to clarify the capital/revenue boundary as it applies to R&D expenditure (which will reduce compliance costs). To do this, it is not considered necessary to import every aspect of FRS 13, including materiality, into the tax law. The aspects of FRS 13 that are useful to clarifying the capital/revenue boundary are the five asset-recognition criteria in paragraph 5.3. The paragraph 2.3 requirement to apply the asset recognition criteria to material items is designed to ensure that the users of the financial report are only presented with useful information. The paragraph is not concerned with determining whether immaterial items expensed are assets that give rise to future economic benefits. 26 Officials acknowledge that allowing taxpayers to expense immaterial items for tax purposes would further reduce compliance costs. However, such an approach gives rise to equity concerns. That is, what is immaterial to one entity may be material to another. If the submissioners’ approach were adopted, it would result in situations where different tax treatments would apply to the same level of R&D expenditure, depending on the size of the entity that carries out the R&D. For example, if a large multi-national corporate carried out an R&D project involving $50,000 of R&D expenditure it is likely that the expenditure would be immaterial for accounting purposes. However, if a small firm carried out the same level of R&D expenditure, it is likely that the expenditure would be material. Under the approach that submissions suggest, the small entity would be required to apply the five asset-recognition criteria to the expenditure, whereas the large entity would not. This may result in the small taxpayer being required to capitalise a portion of the expenditure for tax purposes. What some large entities consider as immaterial R&D can run into significant amounts. Providing an automatic deduction for such expenditure could result in revenue loss. That is, if (as the proposed provisions require) the five asset-recognition criteria were applied to this expenditure, there could be cases where at least a proportion of the expenditure would be required to be capitalised. In addition, determining what is material for accounting purposes involves, to a large extent, the exercise of judgment. The automatic deduction that would apply to immaterial R&D if this proposal were adopted could provide an incentive to label items as immaterial purely to achieve an immediate deduction. The Institute suggests that the incentive to label items as immaterial to gain favourable tax treatment will be controlled by an entity’s desire to capitalise amounts for accounting. The degree to which this natural tension will operate in practice may have been overstated. Many entities may be more driven by the tax deduction than with presenting their stakeholders with a balance sheet that capitalises R&D. The Institute also notes that allowing a deduction for immaterial costs would not be abused because Inland Revenue has reserved the power under section DJ 9B to prevent expenditure from being claimed as R&D. Section DJ 9B does not operate as a tool for use by Inland Revenue in specific avoidance cases. Rather, it gives legislative authority to Government through the Governor-General by Order in Council, to declare certain categories of expenditure not to be R&D for the purpose of the new rules. Any such order would apply to all taxpayers. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 27 Issue: Adjustments for tax purposes where financial reports reflect principles of materiality Clause 39 Submission (1 – New Zealand Law Society, 11 – New Zealand Chambers of Commerce, 5 – ASB Bank Ltd)) The Law Society considers that the provisions, as currently drafted, are unclear as to whether a taxpayer will be able to take advantage of the new rules at all if principles of materiality have been used for financial reporting purposes (even if the tax return is adjusted not to take into account materiality principles). Both the Society and the New Zealand Chambers of Commerce consider that the draft rules should be amended to make it clear that the new rules are only denied to the extent that the requisite adjustments are not made in the tax return. ASB Bank proposes an amendment that would apply if taxpayers who use principles of materiality for financial reporting are unable to use the proposed R&D rules. Comment Officials agree with submissioners that, under the current wording, there is a strong argument that access to the provision is denied if a taxpayer has applied materiality principles for financial reporting purposes. This is inappropriate, and the new rules should be amended to allow access to the provision provided the necessary adjustments are made in the tax return to discount materiality principles. Access to the new rules should be denied only to the extent that the requisite adjustments are not made in the tax return. Recommendation Officials agree with the submissions. The provision should be amended to make it clear that taxpayers who have applied materiality principles to R&D for financial reporting purposes have access to the provision to the extent that the taxpayer makes the necessary adjustments in the tax return to discount materiality principles applicable for accounting. If this recommendation is adopted, the ASB Bank proposal is no longer relevant. 28 SIMPLIFIED RULES FOR SMALL TAXPAYERS Clause 39 Submission (10 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 11 – New Zealand Chambers of Commerce) Small taxpayers, who do not necessarily prepare financial statements in accordance with financial reporting standards, should be allowed to deduct R&D immediately without being required to apply the relevant parts of FRS 13. Without such an exception, businesses that do not prepare financial statements would either not be able to access the new R&D rules or would need to seek expert accounting advice. The trading stock tax rules provide a simplified method for valuing closing stock for small taxpayers (defined as taxpayers with a turnover not exceeding $3 million). This valuation method recognises that certain taxpayers do not prepare financial statements in accordance with financial reporting standards and relaxes the rules accordingly. The new R&D rules should also recognise this and remove the need for small taxpayers to apply FRS 13 to their R&D expenditure. Comment Tax concession To exempt “small taxpayers”, however defined, from the requirement to apply the asset-recognition criteria in paragraph 5.3 of FRS 13 and allow them to deduct all R&D immediately, amounts to a tax concession for small taxpayers. This is because small taxpayers would be able to deduct immediately development costs classified as capital for accounting purposes. Other taxpayers must either argue that such costs are immediately deductible under general provisions, or (where allowed) deduct the costs over time. The purpose of the new rules was not to create a tax concession for small taxpayers. Instead the rules were intended to clarify how the capital/revenue boundary operated in the area of R&D. A favourable tax treatment for small taxpayers could, at the margin, provide a business with a tax incentive to structure itself so as to fall within the definition of ‘small taxpayer’. This is economically inefficient. Complexity Different R&D tax rules depending on the size of a taxpayer would give rise to complexity. It would be necessary to define “small taxpayer”. A definition based on turnover would not be sufficient as a business with a small turnover could undertake an R&D project involving substantial expenditure, and deduct the expenditure without applying the asset-recognition criteria in FRS 13. It would, therefore, be necessary to determine an arbitrary limit for the amount of R&D expenditure a ‘small taxpayer’ could undertake in a year before being required to apply the asset-recognition criteria. 29 Compliance costs Officials recognise that taxpayers that prepare financial statements without applying FRS 13 in full (or at all) will be faced with some additional compliance costs if they want to take advantage of the new R&D rules. It is, however, important to note that these taxpayers will not be required to use the new rules to deduct their R&D expenditure – the FRS 13 rules are optional. Therefore if taxpayers do not want to incur the additional compliance costs associated with applying FRS 13 they can apply general deductibility rules to their R&D. Many taxpayers that are not required to prepare their financial statements in accordance with financial reporting standards will still employ an accountant to prepare the financial statements. For these taxpayers, access to the new R&D rules does not require that they separately seek expert accounting advice. Officials agree that the “small taxpayer” exception in the trading stock rules reduces compliance costs for taxpayers. The trading stock exception does not, however, exempt small taxpayers from the trading stock regime itself. Instead it removes some of the information requirements for small taxpayers by providing a simplified valuation option. The small taxpayer exemption proposed by the submissions would, if enacted, go further than this and exempt small taxpayers from the core R&D rule itself. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 30 INLAND REVENUE’S POLICY STATEMENT ON THE TAX TREATMENT OF SOFTWARE Clause 39 Submission (10 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The new R&D rules apply to software development. The tax treatment of software development is discussed in Inland Revenue’s 1993 policy statement on the tax treatment of computer software. As the position expressed in the statement will be inconsistent with the proposed R&D rules, the policy statement should be withdrawn, and an updated statement issued. Comment In May 1993 Inland Revenue published a policy statement on the tax treatment of computer software (Income Tax Treatment of Computer Software, A Policy Statement from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, 10 May 1993). Essentially, the statement suggested the following tax treatment: Software developed in-house for use in the business – costs of developing the software should be carried forward until the project is completed, whereupon the asset is amortised over, generally, three years. For software developed for sale or licence – the cost of an uncompleted software project is taken into account as trading stock with the deduction for the cost of the goods effectively arising when the first sale or licence occurs. Broadly, the new R&D rules allow an immediate deduction for the cost of developing software that constitutes R&D where such costs are expensed for accounting. Officials agree that a review of the policy statement should be considered and have therefore referred the submission to the Rulings Unit in Inland Revenue. Recommendation Officials see merit in the submission and have referred it to the Rulings Unit of Inland Revenue which issues interpretation statements. Unit trusts: transfer of expenses proposal 33 UNIT TRUSTS – OVERVIEW The bill introduces provisions addressing a number of issues that have arisen for unit trusts under the company tax rules. The amendments concern the transfer of deductible expenses from one unit trust to another unit trust, the continuity of ownership requirement for unit trusts and imputation credit streaming by unit trusts before 1996. Transfer of expenses proposal A qualifying unit trust will be able to elect to transfer deductible expenses it has incurred to another qualifying unit trust if it invests in whole or in part in that second unit trust. The second unit trust will be able to deduct the expenditure so transferred. Continuity proposal Unit holders (shareholders) of a qualifying unit trust can be treated as a “notional single person” for the purpose of the shareholder continuity rules. Provided a unit trust continues to satisfy the new definition of “qualifying unit trust”, it will be able to carry forward losses and imputation tax credits without the need to incur the compliance costs associated with tracking unit-holding changes to ensure continuity has not been breached. The definition of “qualifying unit trust” is relevant to both these proposals. Imputation credit streaming An exposure to an imputation tax credit streaming anti-avoidance rule for unit trusts during the period 1 April 1988 to 31 March 1996 is being removed. The situation arose whereby unit trusts did not attach imputation tax credits on unit repurchases by unit trust managers. Such a repurchase would have given rise to tax-exempt dividends for the managers during the relevant period. The submissions received on the unit trust provisions were, on the whole, positive and welcomed the proposed changes but identified a number of technical issues with the application of these proposed rules. Given that these proposals are concessionary in nature, officials propose that the use of the provisions be closely monitored so that they are not abused. If there is evidence of the provisions not being used as they are intended the legislation will need to be reviewed. 34 BROADENING THE SCOPE OF THE LEGISLATION Clause 31 Issue: Transfers to a 100% owned wholesale unit trust Submission (3 – Rudd Watts & Stone, 4 – New Zealand Law Society) The proposal should be amended to allow expenditure incurred in deriving exempt dividend income to be transferred to the second unit trust where the first unit trust holds 100% of the units in the second unit trust. Comment The present proposal is intended to address the situation where a first unit trust incurs deductible expenditure in relation to investment in a second unit trust but receives gross income in the form of fully imputed dividends from the second unit trust. Hence, there is a problem that the first unit trust has insufficient gross income to deduct the expenditure and therefore fully utilise the imputation credits. Officials consider that different policy considerations apply in the case where the first unit trust receives exempt dividend income from the second unit trust. Expenditure incurred in deriving exempt dividends is not deductible to the first unit trust. The scope of this proposal’s intention does not extend to providing for non-deductible expenditure to be transferred to another entity to deduct. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Application to other entities Clause 31 Submission (1 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 6 – New Zealand Funds Management Ltd, 10 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposal should be broadened to enable transfers of expenditure from a qualifying unit trust, category A group investment fund, superannuation fund or life fund to another such entity in which it invests. 35 Comment Officials are concerned about extending these rules generally because of their concessional nature, since that would allow one entity to transfer expenditure to another. Following discussions with the Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ, we understand it is particularly concerned about investments by superannuation funds and category A group investment funds into qualifying unit trusts. In these cases expenditure incurred by the superannuation fund or group investment fund should be able to be transferred to the qualifying trust it invests in. The policy reason for allowing this is the same as for allowing transfers between two superannuation funds and two qualifying unit trusts. We understand that these are the most common investment scenarios. Furthermore, other submissions argue in principle that there is no reason not to extend this proposal to cover the following scenarios: • a qualifying unit trust investing into a category A group investment fund; • a category A group investment fund investing into another category A group investment fund; and • a superannuation fund investing into a category A group investment fund. The request appears valid and we would be happy to recommend extending the rules to all the scenarios above. We are not resolved at this stage whether to recommend extending the treatment to life companies. Recommendation That the submission be accepted to cover the scenarios outlined above and the proposed rules modified to reflect the broadening of the scope of the rules. Issue: Imputation credits Clause 31 Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of NZ, 1 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 6 – New Zealand Funds Management Ltd) The proposal should be amended to provide that where a first qualifying unit trust transfers expenses to a second qualifying unit trust, a credit arises to the imputation credit account of the second unit trust to prevent a shortfall causing an inability to fully impute dividends. 36 Comment At present, the proposal does not take account that the second unit trust, in reducing the tax it pays by using a deduction transferred to it, reduces the amount of credit to its imputation credit account. This would cause an inability to fully impute the actual income it has to distribute. The amendment proposed by the submission would prevent this shortfall occurring. The issue arises because the first unit trust has surplus imputation credits attached to the dividend it receives from the second unit trust. The solution is to “balance” the credits by taking some from the first unit trust and giving them to the second unit trust. The simplest way to implement this modified proposal is to deem a credit to arise in the second unit trust’s imputation credit account equal to 33% of the amount of the expenditure transferred, and to deem a corresponding debit, equal in amount, to the first unit trust’s account. The credit and debit will arise at the time the expenditure is transferred. This deemed debit may result in the imputation credit account of the first unit trust being in debit at the end of the imputation year. Officials consider that if the deemed debit does result in an imputation debit balance, there be no requirement to pay additional tax. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, but a debit should also arise to the imputation credit of the first unit trust. Issue: Change of investment Clause 31 Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of NZ) Proposed section DI 3C(8) should be amended so that the first unit trust is not required to continue investing in the second unit trust but need only have an investment in some other qualifying unit trust at all times from incurring the expenditure until the second unit trust deducts it. Alternatively, if the submission is not accepted, the remaining balance of unused deductions (carried forward under proposed section DI 3C) should be refunded when the first unit trust disposes of its investment in the second unit trust. 37 Comment The submissioner is concerned that the requirement that the first unit trust must have an investment in the second unit trust throughout the period between incurring the expenditure and the second unit trust deducting it is onerous. Investments are often fluid. It is worth noting that there is no requirement that the expenditure which the first unit trust transfers to the second unit trust must be incurred in deriving income from that particular unit trust. There is no requirement that the expenditure be related in any way to the second unit trust. The submissioner views this as supporting the case for no requirement to continue investing in the particular second unit trust. However, we consider there should be a relationship between the first and second unit trust when the second unit trust deducts the expenditure that is transferred from the first unit trust. Regarding the alternative submission, the submissioner views the unused deductions as representing the amount of excess imputation credits that the proposal is designed to address. Hence, the submissioner views the unused deductions as representing overpayment of tax. However, it is not current tax policy to refund excess imputation tax credits or cash out excess expenditure (losses). Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 38 LEGISLATIVE CERTAINTY Issue: Timing of dividend exemption Clause 10 Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of NZ, 6 – New Zealand Funds Management Ltd) The proposal should be amended by removing the words “in that income year” from proposed new section CF 3(1)(l), in order to ensure the whole amount of the consideration for the transferred expense is excluded from being a dividend. Comment The proposal includes a new section CF 3(1)(k), which is intended to exclude any consideration paid to the first unit trust for the transfer of expenditure from being a dividend. Officials now recommend that this new section be removed from the proposal as unnecessary. (See officials’ submission below.) However, if our recommendation to remove section CF 3(1)(l) is not accepted, our comment on the present submission is as follows. As currently worded, the exclusion appears restricted to the proportion of consideration paid for the transferred expenditure that is deducted in the income year in which the consideration is paid. It was not the intention of the proposal to place such a restriction. The restriction could be eliminated by deleting the words “in that income year” from the new section. Recommendation That the submission be accepted if our submission to remove section CF 3(1)(l) is not accepted. If officials’ submission is accepted this submission will not be relevant. Issue: Removal of the dividend exemption Submission (Matter raised by officials) Clause 10, inserting new section CF 3(1)(l), should be removed from the bill. Comment The proposed new section CF 3(1)(l) would specifically provide that consideration paid to the first unit trust for transferring expenditure is not a dividend to the first unit trust. 39 However, the proposal proceeds on the basis that the second unit trust pays only the value of the tax benefit it derives from deducting the transferred expenditure. This will be an amount determined between the two parties at arm’s length. In this case, there is a value for value transaction. The value that the first unit trust receives is a payment equal to the value that it gives. There is thus no gain to the first unit trust that will be dividend under ordinary tax rules. In discussions with the Institute on this matter, it considered that this provision should remain to provide certainty. In discussions with other submissioners, they were more relaxed in that its inclusion could add to confusion. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Gross income of the first unit trust Clause 31 Submission (3 – Rudd Watts & Stone, 4 – New Zealand Law Society, 6 – New Zealand Funds Management Ltd) There should be specific provision to exclude the amount paid to a first qualifying unit trust for transferring deductible expenditure from gross income of the first unit trust. Comment There is no specific provision in the proposal to exclude the amount paid to the first unit trust for transferring expenditure from being gross income. The bill does include a provision which treats the payment as not being a dividend regarding this issue. However, the proposal proceeds on the basis that the second unit trust pays only for the value of the tax benefit it derives, which will be an amount determined by the parties at arm’s length. In this case, there is a value for value transaction. The value that the first unit trust receives is a payment equal to the value that it gives. There is thus no profit to the first unit trust that will be gross income. Furthermore, the value the first unit trust receives is derived from the “sale” of a tax benefit. This should not be regarded as part of the business or a profit-making scheme of the first unit trust. Hence, sections CD 3 and CD 4 do not apply. In discussion with submissioners on this issue, they have argued that legislative certainty be provided. Officials propose to state clearly in the Tax Information Bulletin that will follow enactment that the benefit received is not gross income or a dividend for tax purposes. 40 The similar rules for transfer of expenditure for superannuation funds do not specifically exclude the consideration for the transfers from gross income. Making a special case for the transfer rules for unit trusts might raise interpretative difficulties with respect to these other transfer rules, for which no specific exclusion was provided. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Deductible expenditure of second unit trust Clause 31 Submission (6 – New Zealand Funds Management Ltd) The proposal should specifically preclude the consideration the second unit trust pays for the transferred expenditure being deductible expenditure. Comment The transfer of expenditure does not result in the second unit trust deriving any gross income. The consideration that the second unit trust pays for the transfer is not expenditure incurred in deriving gross income. Furthermore, we believe that the expenditure concerned would be on capital account and therefore not deductible. Officials propose to state clearly in the Tax Information Bulletin that will follow enactment that the consideration paid for the expenditure transferred is not deductible. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 41 Issue: Cost price and available subscribed capital Clause 31 Submission (1 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand, 10 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposal should include provision to confirm a cost price (and hence available subscribed capital) for units issued by the second qualifying unit trust as consideration to the first qualifying unit trust for transferring expenditure under the proposal. This cost price should be the tax benefit (that is the consideration paid) of the expenses transferred. Comment It is possible that the consideration provided for the expenditure transferred will be an issue to the first unit trust of additional units in the second unit trust. The submissions are concerned that unless there is specific provision confirming a cost price for such an issue, there will not be appropriate available subscribed capital for the units when they are redeemed. Similarly, the first unit trust will not be able to establish a cost price if it on-sells the units. However, if the value of the transferred expenditure is the tax benefit of the expenditure transferred, then this is the value of the consideration the second unit trust receives for issuing the extra units. Consequently, the available subscribed capital of that class of units increases by that amount. Similarly, the value of the transferred expenditure, is the cost price to the first unit trust for the issue of the extra units, should the first unit trust on-sell the units. Hence, there is no need for a specific provision to establish a cost price and available subscribed capital. Furthermore, to establish in legislation a cost price and available subscribed capital would give rise to uncertainty under current legislation in respect of similar situations. For example, a similar issue may arise with a group of companies where consideration is provided in the form of shares for a loss offset between the companies for tax purposes. There would also be precedential issues with such legislation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 42 Issue: Exclusion from gift duty Clause 31 Submission (6 – New Zealand Funds Management Ltd) • There should be specific provision to exclude from the application of gift duty the amount paid to a first qualifying unit trust for transferring deductible expenditure. • There be similar provision to exclude the transfer of expenditure to the second unit trust from the application of gift duty. Comment There is no specific provision to exclude a payment in the form of cash or additional units by the second unit trust to the first unit trust for the amount of the expenditure transferred from the application of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968. Under the Estate and Gift Duties Act, a gift arises only to the extent that the consideration for the disposition is inadequate. The consideration the first unit trust gives is the tax benefit it derives from the transferred expenditure. The proposal has proceeded on the basis that the second unit trust will pay an amount to the first unit trust for the transferred expenditure equal to this tax benefit. This is the value-for- value transaction, and consequently these amounts will not be gifts under the ordinary rules of the Estate and Gift Duties Act. In some cases the consideration paid for the transferred expenditure may be less than 33 percent of the expenditure transferred. This will not result in a gift if there is an arm’s length agreement between the two parties. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 43 TRANSFERABLE EXPENDITURE Issue: Nature of transferable expenditure Clause 31 Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of NZ, 1 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 10 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The restrictions in proposed section DI 3B(1)(b) on what kind of expenditure may be transferred, which are additional to the restrictions in section BD 2, should be removed. ( Institute of Chartered Accountants of NZ ) Alternatively, expenditure should be transferable if either the restrictions in paragraphs (a) or the restrictions in paragraph (b) of proposed section DI 3B(1) are met, but it should not be necessary for the restrictions in both to be met. (Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, PricewaterhouseCoopers) Expenditure that relates to the deriving of exempt income should be able to be transferred and deductible to the second unit trust. (Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc) Comment We consider that the expenditure that should be allowed to be transferred to the second unit trust should be restricted to expenditure that is deductible to the first unit trust under section BD 2. The further restrictions in paragraph (b) of proposed section DI 3B(1) on what kind of expenditure may be transferred are intended to mirror the specific rules applying to transfer of expenditure for superannuation funds. However, as these specific rules apply to superannuation funds, they are permissive. They allow specified types of expenditure to be transferred to the second superannuation fund notwithstanding that section BD 2 might not allow it to be deducted by the first superannuation fund. It may be that, in the present proposal, requiring these specific rules to be met as well as the restrictions in section BD 2 will be more restrictive than section BD 2 by itself. With some exceptions, there seems no reason to impose further restrictions on the kind of expenditure the first unit trust may transfer than that the expenditure must be deductible to it under section BD 2. The first exception is that the first unit trust should not be able to transfer expenditure it incurs in purchasing revenue account property (particularly shares). If the first unit trust ultimately makes a loss on such revenue account property this would allow the first unit trust, in effect to transfer the loss to the second unit trust when it may not be able to do so under ordinary loss transfer rules. The second exception is that there should not be a transfer of expenditure incurred in relation to financial arrangements. An exception is warranted to cover the costs of the direct funding of the investment in 44 second unit trust – for example, if the first unit trust has taken out a loan to invest in the second unit trust, the interest expense could be transferred. The proposal is intended to allow transfer of, for example, management and marketing-type expenses incurred by the first unit trust in relation to its investment in the second unit trust, rather than expenditure and losses incurred by the first unit trust relating to its own trading activities. The Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ has submitted that expenditure that relates to the earning of exempt income should be able to be transferred and deducted. Section BD 2(2)(b) currently prevents the deductibility of such expenditure. Officials recommend that the expenditure relating to the deriving of exempt income should not be made deductible under this proposal. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, except that expenditure on revenue account property and financial arrangements (when the financial arrangement is not part of the direct funding of the investment in the second unit trust) should not be transferable. However, expenditure incurred in deriving exempt income should not. Issue: Information required to transfer expenditure Clause 31 Submissions (3 – Rudd Watts & Stone, 4 – New Zealand Law Society) The first unit trust should not be able to require information from the second unit trust in respect of the second unit trust’s gross income. This information should only be available when the two unit trusts are associated. Comment We are recommending that the restrictions in the proposed section DI 3B(1)(b) be removed (see submission above). If our recommendation is accepted, these submissions will not be relevant. If our recommendation is not accepted we suggest that the first unit trust be able to rely on disclosure from the second unit trust as to whether it has sufficient gross income to deduct the transferred expenditure (see submission below). This would mean that the second unit trust would not agree to receiving expense if it did not have sufficient gross income. Recommendation That the submissions be declined on the basis that they are not relevant if officials’ recommendations are accepted. 45 Issue: Scope to reject transfer of expenditure Clause 31 Submission (1 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc) The proposal should include provision that the second unit trust may reject the transfer of expenditure. Comment The proposal assumes that the first unit trust and the second unit trust will communicate and agree with one another over a contemplated transfer of expenditure. It is true that, as currently drafted, the proposal appears to enable the first unit trust to elect unilaterally to make a transfer, but there is no requirement for the second unit trust to give any consideration for the transfer. The matter is left to the agreement of the parties. Furthermore, if a first unit trust elects to transfer expenditure without the agreement of the second unit trust, there is no requirement that the second unit trust must deduct the transferred expenditure. (If it does not, the expenditure remains deductible to first unit trust under ordinary rules, and the first unit trust is able to transfer it to another “second unit trust”.) We recommend that the legislation reflect the requirement that there be an agreement between the first unit trust and second unit trust to transfer the expenditure. Recommendation That the submission be accepted by requiring an agreement between the two unit trusts. 46 TIMING OF EXPENSE TRANSFER Issue: Expenditure incurred in same year Clause 31 Submissions (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of NZ, 2 – Ernst & Young) Proposed new section DI 3B(4) should be amended so that the transferred expenditure is treated as incurred by the second unit trust in the income year in which it is incurred by the first unit trust, rather than “on the date” it is incurred by the first unit trust. Similar amendments should be made with respect to the transfer of expenditure rules for superannuation funds (present section DI 3(2)) and group investment funds (present section DI 3A(2)). (Ernst & Young) Comment The proposal, as currently worded, treats transferred expenditure as incurred by the second unit trust “on the date” on which it is incurred by the first unit trust. When the first unit trust and second unit trust have different balance dates, the first unit trust, in order to comply strictly with the proposed section, will need to identify the dates on which the expenditure is incurred, and to allocate the expenditure to different income years, depending on whether it was incurred before or after the balance date of the second unit trust. A simple apportionment of annual expenditure will not satisfy the requirements of the section. This will impose unnecessary compliance costs. The solution would be to treat the expenditure as incurred by the second unit trust in the same income year that it is incurred by the first unit trust. This seems practical and does not appear to offer any avoidance opportunities, but this will be monitored in the future. If it is being abused, officials will report to the Government on possible solutions. Similar amendments should be made to the expenditure transfer rules for superannuation funds and group investment funds. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 47 Issue: Time when second unit trust deducts Clause 31 Submission (6 – New Zealand Funds Management Ltd) It is not clear, in proposed section DI 3C(8), what date is referred to by the words “the date on which the expenditure is deducted from the second qualifying unit trust’s gross income”. Hence, this wording should be replaced by “the last day of the income year in which the expenditure is deducted from the second qualifying unit trust’s gross income”. Comment We agree with this submission that the wording is unclear in this respect. The proposed amendment will allow expenditure to be transferred to the second unit trust up until the end of the income year, even though the investment relationship ceased part way through the year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 48 ELECTIONS Issue: Notice of election Clause 31 Submissions (1 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of NZ, 10 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposal should not require the election to be made by notice in writing to the Commissioner. Instead the election should be deemed to be made when the expenditure is actually transferred (that is, deducted by the second unit trust). Alternatively, if the submission is not accepted, the proposal should merely require the written notification to be provided to, and retained by, the manager of the second unit trust. Comment The proposed legislation requires qualifying unit trusts to provide an election in writing to the Commissioner. The present rules concerning transfer of expenditure for superannuation funds, upon which the present proposal is modelled, also require the relevant election to be made by notice in writing to the Commissioner. We agree that it would be in line with a simpler tax system not to require such a notice. Officials consider that a notice is not necessary. The unit trust manager should keep records of any transfers that can be provided to Inland Revenue in the future if required. Also, it is proposed (see page 45) that there be an agreement between the unit trusts for the transfer of expenditure. This agreement will be a record of the transfer. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 49 Issue: Time limit on election Clause 31 Submission (1 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand, 10 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Proposed section DI 3B(3) should be amended to provide that the election must be made by the due date for filing the first unit trust’s tax return, or within such further time as the Commissioner allows . Comment Proposed section DI 3B(3), as currently worded, requires the election to be made within the time that the first unit trust must furnish a return for the income year. The rules allowing transfer of expenditure for superannuation funds, on which the present proposal is modelled, require the election to be within the time within which that fund is required to furnish a return, or within such further time as the Commissioner may allow . Officials consider that there should be no requirement to file an election with Inland Revenue, to be consistent with self-assessment and simplification. The unit trust manager will, however, need to keep records of expense transfers that may be required by Inland Revenue in future audits. Also, it is proposed (see page 45) that there be an agreement between the unit trusts for the transfer of expenditure. This agreement will be a record of the transfer. The Commissioner may need to be given some discretion in respect of expense transfers made after returns are filed. Recommendation That the submission be declined if officials’ recommendation not to require the filing of elections is accepted. 50 DEDUCTION BALANCE FORMULA Issue: Non-resident withholding income Clause 31 Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The reference to non-resident withholding income in the “deduction balance” formula in proposed section DI 3C(1) is not appropriate in the context of unit trusts and should be replaced with a simple rule that refers to the taxable income of the unit trust. Comment In practice, qualifying unit trusts may not derive non-resident withholding income. However, we would prefer to leave the legislation wide enough to cover this possibility. There appears to be no disadvantage to leaving the provision as it is. Recommendation That the submission be declined Issue: Excess imputation credits refunded Clause 31 Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of NZ) Excess imputation credits carried forward as a loss be refunded when the second unit trust is unable to benefit from the transfer of expenditure (or after a qualifying period, for example – four years) Comment The submission views the unused deductions as representing the amount of excess imputation credits that the proposal is designed to address; hence, the unused deductions represent overpayment of tax. It is not current tax policy to refund excess imputation tax credits or cash out excess expenditure (losses). Recommendation That the submission be declined. 51 Issue: Denial of unused expenditure Clause 31 Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of NZ, 6 – New Zealand Funds Management Ltd) If the first unit trust ceases to invest in the second unit trust, the potential tax benefit of the transferred expenditure being carried forward under proposed section DI 3C should revert to the first unit trust. Comment As currently drafted, the proposal does not provide for expenditure carried forward under proposed section DI 3C to revert back to the first unit trust. If the first unit trust ceases to invest in the second unit trust (in which case the unutilised expenditure may no longer be transferred to the second unit trust), or the second unit trust has no ability to utilise the transferred expenditure, the potential tax benefit of the expenditure does not become available to the first unit trust. If the first unit trust carries forward expenditure under proposed DI 3C, it does not deduct the expenditure in the year it was incurred, and the expenditure is not converted into net loss. There is no provision in the proposal to allow the first unit trust to deduct the carried forward expenditure in a later income year. The proposal is not intended to deny the first unit trust the potential tax benefit of deductible expenditure that the second unit trust is unable to utilise. We consider it necessary to include provision that the first unit trust may treat the unutilised expenditure carried forward under section DI 3C as available net loss in the income year in which it ceases to invest in the second unit trust. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Allowing for adjustment Clause 31 Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of NZ) The first unit trust should be entitled to transfer additional expenditure if the taxable income (and hence deduction balance) of the second unit trust is increased. 52 Comment As currently drafted, the proposal would not allow the first unit trust to make a further election after the time it is required to furnish a return for the relevant income year. This means that if a taxation audit increases the taxable income (and hence the deduction balance) of the second unit trust after that time, the first unit trust would be unable to transfer further expenditure with respect to that increase. We recommend that the Commissioner has some discretion in these sorts of cases to amend a return to allow for an expense transfer after a return is filed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Whether the first unit trust should be able to deduct the unutilised transferred expenditure under ordinary rules Clause 31 Submission (6 – New Zealand Funds Management Ltd) The transferred expenditure not deducted by the second unit trust should continue to be treated as incurred by the first unit trust until it is carried forward under new section DI 3C. Comment Under the proposal at present, only the portion of transferred expenditure the second unit trust deducts is treated as not incurred by the first unit trust. The unutilised portion reverts to the first unit trust, which may, but is not obliged to, carry it forward to the next income year as expenditure. As currently worded, the proposal does not prevent the first unit trust, in the original income year, deducting the unutilised expenditure itself, or perhaps transferring it to a different wholesale unit trust in which it invests. This should not cause any problem since, presumably, the second unit trust pays for only the amount of the transferred expenditure it is able to deduct. Hence, in respect of the original income year, there is no need to expressly protect the first unit trust’s entitlement. However, if the first unit trust carries forward the unutilised expenditure to a later income year, it is only able to utilise the carried forward expenditure by passing it back up to the second unit trust under new section DI 3C. The first unit trust will not be able to deduct the carried forward expenditure itself since it is not able to allocate the expenditure to that later year. There is no need to expressly provide that the expenditure carried forward is treated as not incurred by the first unit trust. 53 We recommend that the new section be clarified so that the first unit trust may “carry forward” unutilised expenditure to later income years but not deduct it in later income years. Officials recommend (see page 51) that the unutilised expenditure be treated as a tax loss of the first unit trust. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 54 TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS Clause 31 A number of technical amendments, not raising any policy issues, have been suggested in the submissions. These are presented here in summary form. Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered accountants of NZ) The proposed section DI 3C(3) contains a typographical error. The word “being” should be “been”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (6 – New Zealand Funds Management Ltd) For clarity of interpretation, the expenditure able to be transferred in terms of section DI 3B should be defined as “transferable expenditure”, and this term should then be used where applicable. Comment The proposed provisions are not unclear as they stand, in this respect. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (6 – New Zealand Funds Management Ltd) In proposed section DI 3B(2), the words “any amount of” should be inserted after the words “elect that”. Comment As currently worded, the proposal is clear that the first unit trust may elect to transfer only a portion of its deductible expenditure to the second unit trust. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 55 Submission (6 – New Zealand Funds Management Ltd) For clarity of expression, in proposed section DI 3B(3), the words “under subsection (2)” should be inserted after the word “election”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (6 – New Zealand Funds Management Ltd) For clarity of interpretation, in section DI 3B(4), the first instance of the word “incurred” should be replaced by the words “deemed to be incurred by the second qualifying unit trust under subsection (2)”. Comment The suggested rewording would aid clarity. We suggest a briefer wording by replacing the first instance of “incurred” with “subject to an election under subsection (2)”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in substance. Submission (6 – New Zealand Funds Management Ltd) For clarity of interpretation, in proposed section DI 3C(1), the words “in an income year” should be inserted after the words “unit trust”. Comment The suggested rewording would aid clarity. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 56 Submission (6 – New Zealand Funds Management Ltd) For clarity of interpretation, the proposed section DI 3C(2) should be reworded. Comment Officials agree that the provision could be reworded to aid clarity. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in substance. Unit trusts: unit-holder continuity rule and definition of qualifying unit trust 59 DEFINITION OF “QUALIFYING UNIT TRUST” Clause 178(25) Issue: Temporary holders of greater than 10% in unit trusts with over 100 unit-holders Submission (1 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 10 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The definition of “qualifying unit trust” should be amended to allow for temporary holders of greater than 10% in unit trusts with over 100 unit-holders. Comment Sub paragraphs (a)(iii)(B) and (b)(iv) of the definition currently provide that if a unit trust has more than 100 unit holders but one or more of those unit-holders temporarily has a greater than 10% interest, that unit trust cannot be a qualifying unit trust. This is not the case when the unit trust has fewer than 100 unit-holders, so is inconsistent. The legislation should allow for the percentage of temporary changes to be consistent for unit trusts that have more than 100 unit-holders and those that have fewer. If officials’ recommendation to increase the threshold from 10% to 25% is accepted, we recommend that temporary holdings of greater than 25% be allowed for unit trusts with fewer than and more than 100 unit holders. (See page 61.) Recommendation That the submission be accepted and the temporary change percentage be consistent between unit trusts of fewer than or more than 100 unit holders. Issue: More than one type of investor Clause 178(25) Submission (1 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of NZ, 6 – New Zealand Funds Management Ltd) The definition of “qualifying unit trust” should be amended to allow for a variety of investors in the unit trust concerned. 60 Comment Under sub paragraph (c) (iii) it is unclear whether a unit trust that has a number of different entities in which it invests can qualify as a qualifying unit trust. The legislation should be clarified so that it makes no difference as to whether the unit trust is invested in by one or more of the types of entities listed in this sub paragraph. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Associated person test Clause 178(25) Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of NZ, 6 – New Zealand Funds Management Ltd) The definition of “qualifying unit trust” should exclude the associated person rule. In the alternative, the Institute has suggested that trustees should be able to obtain and rely on disclosure provided from the unit-holders of any associated holdings. Comment The submissioners argue that the need for the trustees to know whether or not the unit-holders are associated will be difficult, if not impossible to administer. The associated person rule should remain in the legislation. Officials, however, consider that the alternative submission should be accepted so that disclosure of associated holdings should be made by the unit-holders to the trustee. The trustee should be able to rely on such disclosures. This will reduce compliance costs associated with the trustee determining whether unit-holders are associated. The New Zealand Funds Management Ltd on the disclosure proposal has indicated that it will be difficult to obtain such disclosures and will increase the compliance costs of trustees in obtaining such disclosures from existing and new unit-holders. Officials consider that the recommendation to increase the investment threshold from 10 percent to 25 percent (see submission below) should mean that a trustee will need to obtain such a disclosure only in situations where a unit-holder’s interest is significant in relation to the threshold. Maintaining the associated person rule will ensure that the proposed definition of “qualifying unit trust” applies to widely held unit trusts. Recommendation That the submission to remove the associated persons test from the definition be declined. The alternative solution should be accepted. 61 Issue: Non-qualifying unit trusts or high net worth individual members of qualifying unit trusts Clause 178(25) Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of NZ, 6 – New Zealand Funds Management Ltd) The definition needs to be widened to cater for “qualifying unit trusts” that may have non-qualifying unit trusts or high net worth individuals as members. Comment The industry advises that raising the investment threshold from 10% to 25% will widen the application of the legislation for non-qualifying unit trusts and high net worth individuals. That is, these investors can hold up to 25% in the unit trust, and that unit trust will consequentially meet the definition of “qualifying unit trust”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted and the investment threshold be raised from 10% to 25%. Issue: Clarification changes Clause 178(25) Submission 1. (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of NZ, 6 – New Zealand Funds Management Ltd) Sub-paragraph (c)(ii) of the definition of qualifying unit trust should be amended by the addition of the word “otherwise” between “being” and “a qualifying unit trust”. 2. (6 – New Zealand Funds Management Ltd) The words “in the unit trust” should be inserted for clarity in paragraphs (a)(iii)B and (b)(vi) after the word “less”. 62 Comment The suggested changes clarify the legislation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clearing houses that dispose and acquire on behalf of unit trust investors Clause 178(25) Submission (6 – New Zealand Funds Management Limited) The definition should provide for the situation where it is an entity other than the unit trust manager who operates as the clearing house in acquiring or disposing of units for investors. Comment We understand it is normal practice for trust deeds to provide that the party to acquire or dispose of units from investors can be the manager, trustee on a party nominated by either the manager or trustee. The legislation should allow for this practice. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 63 SPECIAL CORPORATE ENTITY STATUS Clause 179 Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of NZ) The issue of continuity of “shareholding” for unit trusts should be resolved by amending the definition of “special corporate entity” to include qualifying unit trusts. Comment The new unit holder continuity rule uses the definition of “notional single person” in the Income Tax Act. This submission suggests that the continuity issue for unit trusts is better resolved with reference to the existing “special corporate entity” definition, which would reduce the complexity of the rule. We do not agree. The concept of special corporate entity is used primarily in relation to entities that do not define their ownership with reference to shares or units held. Examples include statutory bodies and life insurance funds that have not issued shares. The unit trust entity does not fit well with these entities. The use of notional single person is not more complex. In particular, it would appear to operate better for unit trusts that alternate between the ordinary continuity rules and the new special unit-holder continuity rules, as will occur from time to time. The “special corporate entity” definition does not contemplate entities that fall in and out of the definition from time to time. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 64 LOOK-THROUGH RULES Clause 179 Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of NZ) If the proposed new section OD 5(4A) proceeds as drafted, it is necessary to ensure that the rules in sections OD 3(3)(d) and OD 4(3)(d) do not apply. Comment Sections OD 3(3)(d) and OD 4(3)(d) are “look-through” rules that require the tracing of a company’s shareholding back to its ultimate natural person shareholders. This rule should not apply so that it is necessary to look behind the deemed notional single person. We do not consider that under current legislation the look-through rules will apply to look behind the notional single person. This is because the provision, which deems there to be a notional single person, also stipulates that the notional single person is not a company. Since sections OD 3(3)(d) and OD 4(3)(d) apply only to look-through a company they cannot apply to the notional single person. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 65 SECTION OD 5(4A) APPLICATION CRITERIA Clause 179 Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of NZ) The bracketed modifiers in section OD 5 (4A), “other than a company, and separate and distinct from those persons who are unit-holders in their capacities other than as unit-holders in the qualifying unit trusts” should be removed and replaced with: “not being a company”. Comment The modifier is intended to make it clear that the notional single person is unique to the particular qualifying unit trust. The legislation needs to be clarified to achieve this objective. In clarifying we need to look to the ordinary continuity rules and, in particular, other scenarios under these rules where the concept of notional single person has been used. Recommendation That the submission to remove the current modifier be accepted but the legislation should reflect the unique notional single person concept. 66 DROP-IN/DROP-OUT PROVISION Clause 179 Submission (1 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ, 10 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of NZ) The rules need to specify that a qualifying unit trust will not breach the shareholder continuity rules whenever it changes to the new rule or ceases to use it. Comment We believe there is an issue that needs to be addressed in respect of a unit trust choosing to use the new continuity rules once they are introduced. If this is not addressed, imputation credits and losses arising before the 2001-2002 income year may be lost. The legislation needs to ensure that the balance of imputation credits and losses will remain and be available when the qualifying unit trust becomes a notional single person from the application date of the new rules (the 2001-2002 income year). The legislation could also be made clearer in respect of a unit trust that goes in and out of the new rule. It is intended that the new rules will operate as a layer of the existing rules, so that if the unit trust ceases to use the new rule it will go to the next “layer” to use the existing continuity rules. We recommend that the legislation be made clearer to reflect this. This will mean that there will be no need to put in any other special transitional rules to cover the ongoing situation of unit trusts going into the new rule and coming out of it. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part with respect to the application date of the new rule. However, for the ongoing operation of the new rule the current legislation should be clarified. 67 SECTION OD 5(4A) CONCESSIONAL TREATMENT Clause 179 Submission (1 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand 10 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposed wording of new section OD 5(4A) should be amended to clarify that the notional single person is a concessionary rule for qualifying unit trusts. Comment Section OD 5(4A) implies that if the definition of a qualifying unit trust is met, all unit holders in that qualifying trust must be treated as a notional single person. The legislation should make it clear that even if the criteria to apply the new unit- holder continuity test are met, the unit trust may still choose to use it or not. It should be clear in all cases when the concept of notional single person is used that the rule is optional and not mandatory. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 68 REFERENCE TO UNITS Clause 179 Submission (6 – New Zealand Funds Management Ltd) The proposed section OD 5(4A) should refer to “units” in a qualifying unit trust rather than “shares”. Comment Section HE 1, which deals with unit trusts, deems the interest of a unit holder to be shares in a company for the purposes of the Income Tax Act. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 69 PROHIBITION OF GROUP LOSS OFFSETS Clause 97 Submission (2 – Ernst and Young, 10 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 1 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 6 – New Zealand Funds Management Ltd) The proposed new section GC 4A should be removed and the proposed section OD 5(4A) reworded to allow for qualifying unit trusts to make loss offsets with other companies/unit trusts, where the ordinary group loss offset rules are met. New Zealand Fund Management Ltd, however, supported the proposal, as it ensures that the loss offset provisions are not used for improper purposes. Comment The legislation, as drafted, does not allow qualifying unit trusts to group their losses for tax purposes with other unit trusts or companies that own more than 66% of the units in the qualifying unit trust. Qualifying unit trusts should not be placed in a position that makes them worse off than they would be under the ordinary grouping rules. The legislation should be amended to allow for group loss offset by qualifying unit trusts where the ordinary grouping rules are satisfied. In this regard, the notional single person concession is not relevant. Section GC 4A should be removed. As a result of the ordinary grouping rules applying, the loss offset provisions will not be used for improper purposes. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 70 SECTION GC 22A – A NEW IMPUTATION ANTI-STREAMING RULE Clause 100 Submission (1 – Investment Savings and Insurance Association of NZ Inc, 8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of NZ, 6 – New Zealand Funds Management Ltd, 10 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposed section GC 22A should not proceed as it is superfluous, and is more narrowly worded than the already comprehensive anti-streaming rules in section GC 22. The Institute of Chartered Accountants also submits in the alternative that if GC 22A proceeds, the meaning of “higher credit value” is clarified. Comment There are already comprehensive imputation anti-streaming provisions in section GC 22. In particular, section GC 22(1)(b) covers the same ground as proposed section GC 22A. There is no reason to duplicate the operation of the rules in GC 22, which will apply to qualifying unit trusts in the present form. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Unit trusts: imputation credit streaming 73 UNIT TRUSTS: IMPUTATION CREDIT STREAMING Clauses 105 and 235 Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of NZ) A provision should be included in section MZ and the Income Tax Act 1976 equivalent that provides that allocation debit rules in section ME 8(4) not apply when the failure to file a ratio change declaration arises in connection with the dividends paid that are subject to section GZ 2 or section 394ZGA. Comment The issue concerns ratio change declarations. In the scenarios covered by the legislation, some dividends were imputed at zero cents in the dollar and others at 33c in the dollar. In this case the unit trust manager should have advised of a change in the ratio. In many cases this did not occur. There should be no adverse allocation debit consequences in circumstances where section GZ 2 or section 394ZGA applies. If this were the case the proposed solution would not be sufficient in many of the cases where the solution is needed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Transfers of overpaid tax TRANSFERS OF OVERPAID TAX OVERVIEW Proposed amendment The bill introduces new sections MZ 5 and MZ 6 into the Income Tax Act 1994. Corresponding amendments are made to the Income Tax Act 1976. The amendments require the Commissioner, at the request of a taxpayer, to transfer overpaid tax that is refundable to the taxpayer to a period in which there is no outstanding liability for tax. The amendments apply retrospectively and will enable certain taxpayers who have requested a transfer of excess tax to a nil period to receive use-of-money interest on the excess tax. The amendment is a pragmatic solution to a difficult issue. Before 1997-98, use-of- money interest was payable only until the terminal tax date of the year in which the excess tax was paid. The Commissioner would often, at the taxpayer’s request, roll forward excess tax to future periods, regardless of whether there was a liability, so that taxpayers could, in effect, obtain use-of-money interest on excess tax retained by the Commissioner beyond that date. In late 1999, Crown Law advised the Commissioner that he has no power to roll-forward excess tax to future periods in which there is no outstanding liability for tax. The inability to transfer excess tax to a nil period has given rise to a different issue in relation to the 1997-98 and following years. The Commissioner cannot transfer excess tax to satisfy an underpayment of provisional tax in certain circumstances. This means that a taxpayer can be paid use-of-money interest at 5.74% on the excess, and simultaneously be charged use-of-money interest at 12.62% on the deficiency. This is clearly inequitable. In relation to tax paid in past income years, the amendment will apply only where • before 21 April 2001, a taxpayer either requested the Commissioner in writing to transfer the excess to a future period, or received written notification from the Commissioner that evidences an oral request to transfer, or • the excess arises on an assessment or reassessment on or after 21 February 2001. The amendment is restricted in this way so that taxpayers who overpaid tax in previous years and had the excess refunded, cannot now request a transfer and receive use-of-money interest for the period up to the date of refund. 77 A cut-off date of 21 April applies because this was the date on which the proposed amendment was first discussed with the Institute of Chartered Accountants. The 21 February date was selected because, if this had also been 21 April, taxpayers who were assessed immediately before that date (on, say, 20 April) would have had insufficient time to request a transfer in writing and would therefore have been unable to bring themselves within either category. In relation to excess tax arising in the current year, the amendment provides that taxpayers need simply request the Commissioner to transfer the excess. Submissions Three submissions have been made on the amendments, all of which support the proposed changes. The Institute of Chartered Accountants notes that the amendments represent a pragmatic and sensible solution to a problem of legislative uncertainty. Two of the submissions have made recommendations on the detail of the proposed provisions. 78 LINK WITH USE-OF-MONEY INTEREST RULES Clauses 161, 169A, 235A and 235B Issue: Additional provision linking amendments with use-of-money interest rules Submission (KPMG) There should be an express provision stating that the tax rolled forward is overpaid tax for the purposes of the use-of-money interest rules. Comment KPMG argues that, for the avoidance of doubt, there should be an express provision ensuring that the tax overpaid and rolled forward to a subsequent income year qualifies as “overpaid tax” for the purposes of the use-of-money interest rules. Officials agree. Recommendation That the submission be accepted and the provisions in the bill be amended to provide that the tax rolled forward is overpaid tax for the purposes of the use-of-money interest rules. Issue: Publication of effect of amendments in Tax Information Bulletin Submission (Institute of Chartered Accountants of NZ) The proposed amendments take a reasonably minimalist approach in that the full intended consequences for use-of-money interest of the amendments are not specified in the legislation. The effect of the amendments and their intended application, therefore, need to be clearly specified for taxpayers and Inland Revenue staff in a Tax Information Bulletin . Comment Officials have recommended above that the provisions in the bill be amended to provide an express link with the use-of-money interest rules. This should reduce the concerns of the Institute about minimalist legislation. 79 However, as is usual, Inland Revenue will issue a detailed discussion of the amendments in a Tax Information Bulletin published after enactment of the legislation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 80 REQUESTS FOR TRANSFER Clauses 169A and 235B Issue 1: Taxpayer who satisfies criteria to contact Inland Revenue following enactment Officials’ submission Section MZ 5(1) and 409A(1) should apply only where a taxpayer who satisfies the criteria in subsections (1)(a) to (c) contacts Inland Revenue following enactment of the legislation. Comment The amendment is intended to apply only when taxpayers initiate contact with Inland Revenue and identify themselves to the Commissioner as coming within the scope of the amendment. Arguably, sections MZ 5(1) and 409A(1) require the Commissioner to search through all files to identify taxpayers who satisfy the criteria in paragraphs (a) to (c). This is not intended and is wasteful of Inland Revenue’s resources. The provisions should be amended so that they apply only when taxpayers who satisfy the criteria contact Inland Revenue following enactment of the bill. Recommendation That sections MZ 5(1) and 409A(1) be amended so that they apply only when taxpayers who satisfy the criteria in paragraphs (a) to (c) contact Inland Revenue following enactment of the bill. Issue 2: Additional circumstance in which provision should apply Submission (Institute of Chartered Accountants of NZ) In relation to excess tax paid in past years, the Commissioner is required to transfer the excess tax to a nil period where the taxpayer has requested the transfer in writing, or where the taxpayer has received notification in writing from the Commissioner evidencing a transfer request. The amendment should also apply where “the Commissioner’s records show that a taxpayer has requested a transfer”. 81 Comment The proposal reflected in the amendments was developed with the aim of providing some relief to taxpayers who had requested transfers of excess tax, without significantly increasing administration costs. The amendments are intended to apply only when taxpayers can identify themselves to the Commissioner as coming within the scope of the amendments and they hold evidence in writing to or from the Commissioner that a request has been made. This prevents the Commissioner having to search through all taxpayer files to determine whether certain taxpayers come within the specified criteria, or to field queries from taxpayers who do not know whether they satisfy the criteria. The Institute proposes that the amendment be extended to include the circumstance where the Commissioner has noted on a taxpayer’s file that the taxpayer has requested a transfer. This is so that taxpayers who have made oral requests which have been declined orally can obtain use-of-money interest when Inland Revenue has recorded the request on the taxpayer’s file. The Institute considers that taxpayers would only contact the Commissioner when they had made an oral request previously, and when there was a significant amount of money involved. Their view is that few requests will be made, and that this will not create significant additional work for Inland Revenue. Clearly, only those who have made oral requests previously will call Inland Revenue. However, they may do so when there is less than a significant amount at stake. Officials have no reason to consider that there will be few requests. Fielding calls from taxpayers and tax practitioners ringing to check whether Inland Revenue has made a record of a taxpayer request could impose significant administrative costs on Inland Revenue, diverting resources away from other business. Inland Revenue may or may not have recorded a request in a particular case. This is therefore a completely arbitrary basis upon which to allow use-of-money interest to be paid. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue 3: Provision should apply where no request because of earlier refusal Submission (KPMG) The legislation should apply in relation to excess tax that a taxpayer did not request to be transferred because of Inland Revenue’s refusal to transfer an earlier overpayment of that taxpayer 82 Comment KPMG argues that taxpayers who have had their request for roll forward of overpaid tax denied by Inland Revenue in respect of an earlier year are unlikely to have sought to roll forward overpaid tax that arose in a subsequent year. Therefore where the taxpayer met the criteria in relation to one overpayment, they should be entitled to roll forward subsequent overpayments even though they have not requested a transfer of the subsequent overpayment. Officials do not support the proposed extension of the legislation. The amendment applies only where a taxpayer or their agent requests a transfer of overpaid tax. A request may not have been made for several reasons – for example, because an earlier request by a taxpayer was denied, or because the tax agent representing the taxpayer had made a request in relation to another taxpayer which was denied. It is no fairer, and probably is more arbitrary, to distinguish between taxpayers on the basis of the reason for their not requesting a transfer than to distinguish between taxpayers on the basis of whether or not they requested a transfer in relation to the excess tax at issue. Recommendation Officials recommend that the submission be declined. 83 ROLL- FORWARD OF TAX THROUGH SUBSEQUENT YEARS Clauses 169A and 235B Submission (KPMG) It should be clear that overpaid tax is to be rolled forward to all subsequent years where the excess tax exceeds the tax liability in those years. Comment KPMG argues that it should be clear that overpayment of tax is to be rolled forward to all subsequent years where there is a net overpayment so that taxpayers receive use- of-money interest for the intervening periods until refund, rather than just one year’s worth of interest. This is the intent of the legislation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted and the provisions be amended to clarify that the excess tax is to be rolled forward through all subsequent years in which the excess tax exceeds the tax liability until the tax is refunded (or credited against a tax liability). Submission (KPMG) Interest should be payable to taxpayers who requested a transfer and were refused and who subsequently applied the overpayment of tax to satisfy a tax liability in a later tax year. Comment KPMG is concerned about the effect of the opening words of section MZ 5(1) and (2), which state that “To the extent that tax paid in excess by or on behalf of a taxpayer is refundable and has not been applied to satisfy a tax liability or other amount due ...”. They argue that the words in bold may result in a taxpayer losing any entitlement to interest where the taxpayer requested but was denied a roll-forward of the overpaid tax (still satisfying the criteria in subsection (1)) and applied the excess in satisfaction of a liability at some future date. For example, if the Commissioner determined in May 1998 that tax was overpaid for the 1995 year, and the Commissioner would not roll that excess through the intervening years, the taxpayer therefore used the excess to satisfy a provisional tax liability on 7 July. KPMG asks for the legislation to be clarified to ensure that there is interest payable in the period up until the time the overpayment is used to offset another tax liability. This is the intent of the legislation. 84 Recommendation That the submission be accepted and the legislation be clarified to ensure that there is use of money interest payable on the excess tax in the period up until the time it is used to offset another tax liability. Other changes to Income Tax Act 1994 87 ATTRIBUTION RULE Issue: The attribution rule and double tax Clause 162 Submission (Institute of Chartered Accounts of New Zealand, New Zealand Law Society, Rudd Watts & Stone) Amounts attributed by a company should be made exempt from tax, as opposed to being made fully imputed dividends. Rudd Watts and Stone suggest, as an alternative, that the imputation credit could be increased to 64% (being the rate necessary to fully pay the tax at a marginal rate of 39%) or could be deemed to be available subscribed capital (i.e. generally tax-free when returned to the shareholder). Comment The submissioners point out that the attribution rule could still cause tax to be paid in excess of a marginal rate of 39% when an amount attributed from a company intermediary is then subsequently distributed as a dividend to a shareholder whose marginal tax rate is 39%. This is correct. It is a result of ensuring that the attribution rule would not have any accounting impact. The attribution rule, as currently presented, applies for income tax purposes only with the amount attributed being left in the intermediary to be dealt with for accounting purposes in the ordinary course of events. When the intermediary is a company, the amount attributed can be paid out as a dividend, with imputation credits. If the dividend is then paid to the high-income individual (over $60,000 of income) who provided the services, or to any other shareholder whose marginal tax rate is 39%, the effective tax rate is 48%. Clearly this is undesirable. However, this problem only arises if the shareholder has a marginal rate of 39%, if the shareholders' marginal rate is 33% or less there is no problem. The submissioners recommend that the amount attributed be made exempt from income tax. We believe this approach would be difficult to implement as dividend streaming rules would be necessary so as to identify the dividend. The dividend would, in some cases, also flow through intermediate companies and special rules may be needed to cater for its exempt status. In addition, by the time this bill is enacted, a significant number of 2000-01 tax returns will have been filed. It does not seem practicable to significantly change the mechanism retrospectively. However, most companies involved are likely to be qualifying companies and rules already exist for qualifying companies in that their dividends are ordinarily exempt to the extent they cannot be fully imputed. Therefore, qualifying companies can be excluded from the deemed imputation credit rule. This is likely to considerably reduce the problem raised by the submitters. There is still an issue if the 2001 tax 88 return has been filed, but this is of a considerably smaller magnitude, and the qualifying company exempt dividend delivery mechanism is clearly understood. Furthermore, in other cases: • the attribution rule seems likely to apply infrequently anyway, as when it could apply, the income is often being taken as salary; • when it does apply, it is likely that any company intermediary will not pay a dividend to the high income earner – why voluntarily pay out income that will be subject to 39%? • when it does apply, it is likely that any company intermediary will not pay a dividend to the high income earner – because a number, probably most, of these companies will be owned by a trust. This leaves a probably very small set of high-income earners potentially subject to a tax rate of higher than 39%. In practice it seems that this will only happen by mistake and, even then, the circumstances have to be exactly right. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but the issue be substantially addressed by not providing the notional imputation credit to companies that are qualifying companies. Issue: Technical issue where the intermediary (person B) is a trust Clause: N/A as not in the bill Submission (Matter raised by officials) When an intermediary (referred to in the legislation as person B) is a trust and some of its income is paid to the service provider (person C) as beneficiary income, the rule in section GC 14D(7) which reduces beneficiary income should not reduce any beneficiary income provided to the service provider (person C). Comment This change to correct a mistake is necessary because any reduction in the beneficiary income of the service provider has the effect of reducing the amount to be attributed. The reduction should instead be applied to any other trust beneficiaries only. In this way, the full amount to be attributed is taxable income of the service provider. 89 Given that some 2001 tax returns will have been filed it seems inappropriate to require them to be refiled. Therefore we suggest the amendment should apply to tax returns for the 2001-02 and subsequent income years. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 90 DEFINITION OF “ASSOCIATED PERSONS” Clause 178 Submission (9 – New Zealand Law Society) The submissioner considers that the new definition of “associated persons”, inserted by clause 178 of the bill, is too vague as the shorthand form adopted lacks precision. The proposed wording states that: “Associated persons, and other expressions about the association of persons with each other, have the meanings set out in sections OD 7 and OD 8.” Comment Clause 178 replaces the existing definition of “associated person” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 with a new definition of “associated persons” that contains a general cross-reference to the substantive associated persons definitions in sections OD 7 and OD 8. The existing definition of “associated person” in section OB 1 contains a number of errors. In particular, the lists of operative provisions in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of the definition, to which the specific associated persons definitions in section OD 8 apply, are either incorrect or incomplete in various respects. (The substantive definitions in section OD 8 do correctly list the operative provisions to which they apply.) These existing deficiencies are addressed in the amendment by simplifying the section OB 1 definition to provide that “associated persons”, and other “expressions concerning the association of persons with each other”, have the meanings given in sections OD 7 and OD 8. The amendment will make future maintenance of the section OB 1 definition of “associated persons” unnecessary, while still achieving the cross-referencing function (it has no other function) of the existing definition. (Most users of the Act would currently refer directly to the substantive associated persons definitions in section OD 7 and OD 8.) The language that the submission is concerned about – “and other expressions about the association of persons with each other” – is the same wording used in the existing definition of “associated person”. The wording is meant to include slightly different ways of referring to associated persons such as “persons associated with each other” or “associated person”. Therefore, as the proposed wording of the new definition of “associated persons” has not been changed from the existing definition of “associated person”, officials do not agree with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 91 M INOR REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS TO INCOME TAX ACT 1994 Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment is required to renumber new section EO 6 (enacted by section 13 of the Taxation (Beneficiary Income of Minors, Services-Related Payments and Remedial Matters) Act 2001) as section EO 7. Comment A new section EO 6 was introduced in the Taxation (Beneficiary Income of Minors, Services-Related Payments and Remedial Matters) Bill, with a view to it being renumbered as section EO 7 once the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill was enacted. The Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill proposed a section EO 6 for the attribution rule. Unfortunately, the renumbering was overlooked. Officials recommend that section EO 6, as enacted by the Taxation (Beneficiary Income of Minors, Services-Related Payments and Remedial Matters) Act 2001, be renumbered. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Taxpayer assessment 95 TAXPAYER ASSESSMENT – OVERVIEW OF SUBMISSIONS Introduction The bill proposes changes to recognise that the tax system is administered on the basis that taxpayers make the initial assessment of their tax liabilities. It is now less appropriate to write legislation on the basis that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue performs all the functions of assessment. Assessments are in practice made by taxpayers, with Inland Revenue automatically processing their returns in the first instance. Reform of the tax administration rules over recent years has proceeded on the basis that tax is essentially self-assessed and that the system should encourage voluntary compliance. Although not involving significant policy change, the introduction of self-assessment will add to and enhance other improvements being made to simplify tax administration. As well as aligning the law with practice, the changes in this bill will facilitate the continuing development of policy and legislation in areas such as the review of compliance and penalties legislation, the review of the tax disputes procedures and the rewrite of the Income Tax Act. The bill proposes to replace the Commissioner's general power of assessment in section 92 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) with a specific requirement that taxpayers assess their tax liability each year. Taxpayers will also, under an amended section 33 of the TAA, be required to furnish a notice of self-assessment with their return. The Commissioner will retain specific powers of assessment to amend a taxpayer's assessment or make an assessment if a taxpayer fails to self-assess. A large part of the bill is devoted to making consequential amendments to ensure taxpayers can make assessments by: • modifying language that presupposes that assessments are made only by the Commissioner; and • replacing various discretions of the Commissioner with objective rules in areas affecting the calculation of a taxpayer's tax liability for an income year. These changes will allow taxpayers to make the initial assessment of their tax liability each year. The Commissioner’s functions that operate once the initial assessment is made are retained, thereby retaining the administrative flexibility already provided for in the legislation. Other features of the bill are that: • It removes references to the Commissioner making determinations of various amounts such as of losses and foreign tax credits. These amounts will be implicitly determined as part of making an assessment (either by the taxpayer at first instance or by the Commissioner). 96 • The two-month period for taxpayers to issue proposed adjustments to their returns will now apply from the date of taxpayer assessment (the filing of the return) rather than from the date of Commissioner assessment. • Section EC 1, relating to adjustments for incorrect accounting practices, will be replaced with a specific rule to ensure that amounts of income and expenditure are recognised once, rather than leaving open the possibility that such amounts might not ever be taxed or deducted properly. Overview of submissions Five submissions on the taxpayer assessment amendments have been made. Two submissions expressly support the principle of legislating for taxpayer assessment. None of the submissions are opposed to legislating for taxpayer assessment. Submissions are generally focused on suggesting possible technical improvements to the bill. In particular, the submission from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand agrees in principle with the main changes for: • replacing the Commissioner’s general power to make assessments with a requirement for taxpayers to make the initial assessment of their tax liabilities; • removing various determination processes; and • removing “Commissioner discretions” and references to the Commissioner, as necessary for self-assessment. The New Zealand Law Society notes that “while the principles behind such amendments are reasonable, and that the amendments themselves are not likely to adversely affect taxpayers, the sheer number of amendments ... is of concern.” The Society suggests that many of the changes could be dealt with as part of the rewrite of the Income Tax Act 1994. The main recommendations by officials to the Committee following submissions are that amendments should be made to the bill to: • retain the terminology of “adequate rent” in the context of leases; • extend the definition of “notice of proposed adjustment” to include a notice of assessment issued by a taxpayer; • remove from the bill the changes proposed to section EG 17, relating to transfers of depreciable property between associated persons; and • improve the clarity of the extent of a taxpayer’s obligations in respect of making the first assessment of their tax liability and their filing obligations. 97 TRANSFER OF DEPRECIABLE PROPERTY BETWEEN ASSOCIATED PERSONS Clause 58 Submission (10 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 67W – Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu) The Commissioner should give guidance to taxpayers by way of an item in the Tax Information Bulletin on the application of the new criteria in section EG 17(2), which allows transfers of depreciable property between associated persons to be based on the transferee’s cost price if certain criteria are satisfied. The reference to “sales” in the phrase “arm’s length sales” is too restrictive. Although both “normal commercial practice” and “arm’s length” have commonly understood meanings, the meaning and scope of these terms is sufficiently uncertain not to provide the objectivity required for self-assessment. Referring to the bona fides of a transaction is more certain and should be used instead. The proposed section EG 17(2)(b) provides that one of the criteria for transferring property at the cost to the purchaser is that the cost of the property to the taxpayer is the market value of the property on the date of acquisition. Although it is implicit in the proposed amendment, this provision should be clarified by adding that the transferor must receive market value. Comment Submissions highlight a number of technical complexities in relation to the rules proposed to replace the Commissioner’s discretion in section EG 17(2). Officials note that section EG 17(2) in effect provides an anti-avoidance rule and that other Commissioner discretions in anti-avoidance rules have been retained. Given the technical difficulties that have been raised and the need for consistency with the approach elsewhere in the bill, we recommend that the changes proposed to section EG 17 be removed from the bill. Recommendation That officials’ submission be accepted. 98 MARKET VALUE Issue: The meaning of market value Clauses: various including 47, 49, 58, 60, 61, 64, 66, 67, 75, 78, 82, 88, 101, 102 Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 10 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The term “market value” implies a requirement that independent valuations be sought. “Market price” does not and should be used as an alternative. Comment The bill replaces various references to “value” as determined by the Commissioner with the more objective term “market value”. References to “market value” are also inserted in other appropriate instances to better reflect the concept of self-assessment. In general terms “market value” includes a market price, and alternatively, in the absence of a market price, an arm’s length price. Thus, in most circumstances, having the market price for something is sufficient to determine the market value without requiring the use of other independent valuation services. “Market value” is a flexible concept and has not been legislatively defined so it bears its natural meaning. It is a term already extensively used in the tax legislation with its meaning determined according to the surrounding (commercial) circumstances. For example, in contrast to using “market price”, “market value” more naturally allows for the inclusion of a discount given for trading in certain quantities or under pricing structures that recognise market segmentation (such as retail, trade and wholesale). The term “market value” is used widely in (tax and non-tax) legislation and has also been considered by the courts, particularly in respect of the general principles in Hatrick v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1963\] NZLR 641. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 99 Issue: Leases for inadequate rent Clause 103 Submission (10 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposal to replace “adequate rent” with “market rent” should not proceed. Amendments can be made to section GD 10 to remove the Commissioner’s discretion and make it capable of being self-assessed without removing the reference to “adequate rent”. The submission notes that while the focus of the provision seems to be on transactions between relatives involving income splitting, the actual drafting of section GD 10 has given it a potentially much wider application. In particular, the provision can apply to any lease of property by a company to any other person (whether or not associated). Section GD 10 can, therefore, apply in wholly arm’s length situations where there is no attempt to split income and have it taxed at a lower rate. The current terminology of “adequate rent” provides flexibility, thereby ensuring that the application of section GD 10 to a lease by a company does not give an inappropriate result in arm’s length cases where there is no tax benefit. The proposed change to “market rent” could provide less flexibility because factors such as other transactions between the parties, the commercial purpose and effect of the transaction, and the relationship between the parties will not be able to be considered. However, these other factors could be relevant in determining an “adequate rent”. The submission refers to the example of a mining company that has caused damage to a farmer’s land. As part of the settlement between the parties, the company buys the land from the farmer and leases it back to him for 30 years for a low yearly rental. There is no tax benefit in this situation. To the extent that there is a reduction in gross income to the mining company, there is also a lesser tax deduction to the farmer. Therefore there is no reduction in net tax collected. Under the existing GD 10 it is possible that, in the light of the relationship between the parties and the surrounding circumstances, the rent is “adequate”. However, the rent could not be described as a “market rent”. Comment Section GD 10 increases the amount of rent received for a property by a lessor for tax purposes when the actual rent is less than an “adequate rent”. The section applies when property owned by any person, persons, or partnership is leased: • to a relative of any of those persons or of any member of the partnership; or • to a related company; or • by a company to a person. 100 Section GD 10 has a tax avoidance focus. It is directed against income splitting, especially in a family situation, whereby income from leasing property is shifted to persons on lower tax rates than the owner of the leased property. Officials agree with the submissioner that it is not appropriate to apply a market rent in situations such as that in the submissioner’s example, where there is no possible tax benefit because the lessor and lessee are on the same tax rate. Officials agree that the existing term “adequate rent” provides more flexibility than “market rent” and allows other factors such as other transactions and the surrounding circumstances to be taken into account. Such factors could probably not be taken into account in determining a market rent. In situations where there is a difference in tax rates between the lessor and lessee – for example, between earning adults and minors, and therefore an opportunity to derive a tax benefit, officials consider that an adequate rent would be equivalent to the market rent for the purpose of section GD 10. However, in situations where the lessor and lessee are on the same tax rate, and therefore have no opportunity to derive a tax benefit, officials consider that an adequate rent will not necessarily be the same as the market rent. Officials are, therefore, in favour of retaining the terminology of “adequate rent” in section GD 10 in order to prevent the section applying in situations where it would not be appropriate – where there is no opportunity to derive a tax benefit between the lessor and lessee. The provision itself can still be placed on a self-assessment footing by removing the Commissioner references while retaining the term “adequate rent”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 101 AMENDING EXCEPTIONS TO TIME BAR Clause 206 Submission (10 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The submissioner acknowledges that the proposed amendments to the Commissioner’s time bar for amending income tax assessments in section 108 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, made by clause 206 of the bill, accommodate self- assessment. However, the submissioner raises a new issue concerning one of the exceptions to the income tax assessment time bar. This exception is contained in section 108(2)(b) and provides that the time bar may not apply if a return for an income year does not mention gross income which is of a particular nature or was derived from a particular source, and in respect of which a tax return is required to be provided. The submissioner wants the words in section 108(2)(b) “in respect of which a tax return is required to be provided” to be replaced by “which is required to be disclosed in the return required by the Commissioner under section 33”. Comment Section 108(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that the Commissioner may not increase an income tax assessment more than four years after it was made. This time bar on amending assessments is subject to two main exceptions. Under section 108(2), the Commissioner may increase an assessment if the Commissioner is of the opinion that a tax return provided by a taxpayer: • is fraudulent or wilfully misleading; or • does not mention gross income which is of a particular nature or was derived from a particular source, and in respect of which a tax return is required to be provided. The second exception was recently considered by the Privy Council in O’Neal v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (2001) 20 NZTC 17,051, which concerned a J G Russell tax avoidance template. The Privy Council upheld the Commissioner’s application of this exception to allow assessments of participants in this tax avoidance scheme, which were made outside of the time bar, to be increased by the Commissioner. The amendment suggested by the submissioner to the second exception to the time bar should not be considered as part of this bill because it is outside the scope of self- assessment. Clause 206 of the bill is only amending section 108 in order to make it consistent with self-assessment. 102 The issue raised by the submissioner would more properly be considered as part of the post-implementation disputes procedures review. As part of this review, a discussion document will be published which will give an opportunity for submissions to be made under the normal generic tax policy process. The submissioner considers that the Commissioner will no longer require information about particular sources of income to make an assessment, and the return will only be a source of general statistical information. However, officials note that returns will continue to have a very important role in the post-assessment phase of the Commissioner’s activities, namely, as a source of information for audit purposes. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 103 WHETHER ADJUSTMENTS FOR INCORRECT ACCOUNTING PRACTICE SHOULD BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY FROM OTHER ADJUSTMENTS Clause 53 Issue: The extent adjustments for incorrect accounting practices should be allowed – section EC 1 Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 10 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The circumstances in which taxpayers can make adjustments for incorrect accounting practices should not be narrowed so as to preclude making adjustments which, although valid, would not come within the proposed section EC 1. In particular, taxpayers will not be able to make adjustments in the current income year for incorrect accounting practices in previous income years or spread income arising from such adjustments over four income years. Comment The proposed changes to section EC 1 are designed to better target the provision and clarify how amounts of income and expenditure should be recognised, so they are recognised once, rather than leaving open the possibility that such amounts may not ever be taxed or deducted properly. As canvassed in the 1998 discussion document Legislating for self-assessment of tax liability , the Court of Appeal’s decision in Hutchinson Bros Ltd v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,374 restricted the scope of the rule in section EC 1. The decision limited the application of the rule to circumstances already covered by the Commissioner’s general power to make amending assessments in section EC 1 before the four-year time bar. In the light of the Court of Appeal decision, despite the rule in section EC 1 originally being intended to permit the Commissioner to make particular assessments beyond the four-year time bar, the bill proposal confirms the four-year time bar limit as appropriate for a system including taxpayer assessment. The bill takes the decision in Hutchinson into account, providing clear rules for the treatment of amounts of income and expenditure, when a taxpayer changes from a cash accounting method to an accrual method or vice versa. These rules are designed to assist taxpayers to determine the correct treatment of such amounts when they change their accounting practices and make assessments accordingly. Officials note that the discussion document Legislating for self-assessment of tax liability invited submissions on the situations to which the section should apply. Submissions received in response referred to hire purchase reserves and warranty provision reserves, neither of which represent changes in accounting practice but rather recognise costs under ordinary accounting principles – this does not alter the 104 ordinary requirement to account for costs correctly when making a taxpayer assessment. Officials consider it would not be appropriate to continue to provide for current period adjustments to be made in relation to incorrect accounting practices in either previous incomes years or be spread over a period of up to four years. To do so would be inconsistent with many of the changes made to the tax system, including tax rates and the rules for making adjustments. For example, officials consider the purpose of providing a spreading rule was to give practical relief from the more progressive and higher tax rates that existed in 1971, when the predecessor to section EC 1 was introduced. Also, officials note that there have been many significant changes to the tax administration rules, including the dispute procedures, which provide a general process for making adjustments. In this regard and in the context of the above, officials consider it would not be appropriate to provide an exception in relation to changes in accounting practices, particularly as making agreed adjustments is specifically provided for in the Tax Administration Act 1994. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Proposed definition of “cash accounting method” – section EC 1 Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The proposed new section EC 1(3) should be amended by changing the words “cash receipts or outgoings” to “cash receipts and outgoings”. Comment Officials agree that making this change would clarify the relationship between “accrual accounting method” and “cash accounting method” as defined in section EC 1. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 105 RESIDUAL DISCRETIONS MAINTAINED BY COMMISSIONER Clauses: various Issue: Allowing taxpayers to self-assess remaining Commissioner discretions Submission (10 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Although a large number of Commissioner discretions are being removed by substituting objective tests, a number of residual Commissioner discretions remain. The submissioner considers that retaining the Commissioner’s powers on certain matters still leaves a “gap” in the logic of the self-assessment process. This is because taxpayers will not have the power to determine all matters essential to assessing their liability under the Income Tax Act 1994. The submission notes that this “gap” in the self-assessment process leaves taxpayers in the position of either being pragmatic and “second guessing” what the Commissioner might think (“the current practice”) or being technically correct and formally asking the Commissioner to determine these issues annually (thereby burdening the Commissioner with an unwanted obligation). Accordingly, the submissioner recommends an amendment along the following lines: “Where any matter affecting the assessment of the taxpayer’s liability is subject to the opinion of the Commissioner on a particular matter, the taxpayer is entitled to determine the matter for the purposes of issuing an assessment under section 33 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 but not so as to exclude the Commissioner’s powers to make an assessment or issue a notice of proposed adjustment.” Comment The bill removes a very large number of Commissioner discretions from provisions to place them on an objective basis. The provisions which have been amended to remove Commissioner discretions are mainly those which affect the calculation of a taxpayer’s tax liability for an income year and would otherwise, at least in a technical sense, be obstacles to taxpayers self-assessing. Thus the removal of these discretions are a necessary consequential amendment for self-assessment. Other discretions have been retained either because this is administratively necessary (as explained in the following paragraph) or because their removal is not seen as strictly necessary for placing the legislation on a self-assessment basis. Some discretions in this latter category are likely in the future to be removed as part of other tax policy projects, particularly the rewrite of the Income Tax Act. 106 Examples of discretions that should be retained are those that relate to procedural matters such as the requirement to obtain the Commissioner’s approval to a balance date change, or to maintaining the revenue base such as a number of anti-avoidance provisions. If taxpayers were able to change their balance dates at will significant tax deferral advantages could be obtained. The 1998 discussion document Legislating for self-assessment for tax liability stated that it was necessary to retain the Commissioner discretions in anti-avoidance provisions to reconstruct transactions. Avoidance arrangements often involve multiple transactions between a number of taxpayers. It is, therefore, appropriate to retain the Commissioner’s discretion to recharacterise an avoidance arrangement. The suggested amendment would allow taxpayers to exercise such Commissioner discretions themselves subject to the Commissioner’s powers to amend assessments. Officials do not agree with the suggested amendment because it would undermine the administrative necessity of many of the remaining discretions and pose a risk to the revenue base. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Retention of Commissioner discretion in section LB 2(5) Clause 147 Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Clause 147(2) and (3) of the bill amends section LB 2(5) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Section LB 2(5) is an anti-avoidance provision which disallows an imputation credit if the Commissioner is satisfied that insufficient tax has been paid by the company that issued the imputation credit. The submissioner queries the retention of the Commissioner discretions in section LB 2(5). It also considers that a further change may be needed given that the process of the Commissioner disallowing the credit has been altered – the submissioner suggests that this amendment would involve omitting the words “by the Commissioner” from section LB 2(5)(b). 107 Comment As indicated above, certain Commissioner discretions have been retained in anti- avoidance provisions such as section LB 2(5) because they are necessary to protect the revenue base and are not a legislative obstacle to taxpayer assessment. The only change that is being made to section LB 2(5) is to recognise that it is the Income Tax Act itself which disallows the imputation credit rather than the Commissioner. The Act disallows the credit if the Commissioner is satisfied that it would be inappropriate for a taxpayer to be allowed a credit because the company issuing the imputation credit has not paid sufficient income tax. The submissioner’s recommendation for a further amendment to remove the reference to “by the Commissioner” from section LB 2(5)(b) is unnecessary because those words are already being removed by the schedule in clause 183 of the bill containing various common self-assessment amendments. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 108 REMOVING COMMISSIONER DISCRETIONS Clauses: various Issue: Drafting of amendment to section DF 2 Submission (10 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The replacement wording for section DF 2 contained in clause 22 is not easy to read and interpret, and gives alternative wording. Comment Section DF 2 deals with the deductibility of employers’ contributions to employees’ benefit funds. Clause 22 of the bill replaces the existing wording in order to place it on a self-assessment footing. Officials do not consider that the replacement wording suggested by the submissioner would make the provision easier to read and interpret. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Section DL 1(11) – cost of timber determinations Clause 43 Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) In the proposed amendment to section DL 1(11) contained in clause 43 of the bill, the use of the word “determine” may need to be reconsidered since it has the connotations of “determinations”, which have been altered significantly with the formalisation of the self-assessment. Consideration to using a similar word, such as “ascertain”, should be investigated. Comment The use of “determine” is based on the existing wording, and officials consider that it remains the best word to use in section DL 1(11), which relates to cost of timber determinations. The self-assessment legislative exercise will result in a number of existing determinations, such as loss and foreign tax credit determinations, being dispensed with. However, this should not mean that the word “determine” cannot continue to be used elsewhere in the Act where appropriate. 109 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Drafting of section DN 1(8)(c) amendment Clause 47 Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) In clause 47(6)(a) of the bill, a further portion of section DN 1(8)(c) needs to be omitted for the provision to read sensibly. In particular, the words “so as to preclude” should be removed. Comment Officials do not agree that the words “so as to preclude” should be removed from section DN 1(8)(c), as amended by clause 47(6)(a), because such omission would mean that the provision would no longer read properly. The wording the submission suggests be removed is set out in italics below in the relevant portion of section DN 1(8)(c), as amended by the bill: “Subsection (7) shall not apply so as to preclude , so long as that asset continues to be used for that purpose, such deductions by way of depreciation in respect of that asset...” Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Drafting of section HF 1(4) Clause 110 Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) In clause 110 of the bill, the replacement words in section HF 1(4) should begin with a capital letter, as they are the start of the subsection. 110 Comment Officials agree that the replacement wording for section HF 1(4), contained in clause 110(2)(a), should begin with a capital letter. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Section KC 1 – low income rebate Clause 136 Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Clause 136 of the bill applies to the version of section KC 1(1) that applies from the 1999-2000 income year rather than the version that applies only for the 1998-99 income year. Comment Clause 136 of the bill applies only to the current version of section KC 1. This is made clear by the application date of clause 136, which is the 2002-03 and subsequent income years. As such, there is only one version of section KC 1, which will apply in relation to self-assessment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Location of new section KD A1 Clause 141 Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Clause 141 of the bill, by introducing a new section KD A1 of the Income Tax Act, does not follow the standard alphanumeric style. The provision would be better labelled section KD 1AA, which would still appear before the current section KD 1A, the intended location for this new provision. 111 Comment Clause 141 inserts a new provision which provides that despite self-assessment, family support and family plus tax credits are calculated by the Commissioner. Officials note that the intended location for this new provision is at the very beginning of subpart KD – before section KD 1, rather than before, as the submission suggests, section KD 1A. Therefore the proposed numbering of the provision to be inserted by clause 141 – section KD A1 – is the correct numbering as it ensures that this provision will be the first provision in subpart KD. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Use of “reflected” terminology Clauses 149 and 150 Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) In clauses 149(1) and 150(4) of the bill, use of the word “reflected” may not be entirely clear. It would be more appropriate to use text such as “included” or “applied”. Comment Clauses 149 and 150 amend sections LC 3 and LC 4 respectively of the Income Tax Act 1994, which relate to foreign tax credits and controlled foreign company foreign tax credits. The amendments are consequential to the decision to remove the separate determinations for these credits. Accordingly, the existing references to the date of the notice determining the credit are replaced by references to “the date of the notice of assessment in which the credit for foreign tax is reflected”. Officials consider that it is more appropriate to use the term “reflected” in this context than “included” or “applied”, as suggested by the submission. This is because the notice of taxpayer assessment will include the following information: taxable income, income tax liability and, if applicable, net loss, terminal tax or refund due. Although credits are taken into account in ascertaining the amount of terminal tax or refund due, they are not directly included in the notice of assessment. Therefore the use of the word “reflected” in clauses 149 and 150 is more accurate and indicates that credits are taken into account in ascertaining the amounts of terminal tax or refund due for the purpose of a notice of assessment. 112 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Identifying definition to which amendment is made Clause 183 Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) In clause 183(1) of the bill, the particular definition being amended in section EP 1(11), namely “annual income tax balance date”, should be identified. Comment Officials agree that it would be consistent with the rest of clause 183, which contains a schedule of consequential amendments related to self-assessment, for the particular definition in section EP 1(11), namely “annual income tax balance date”, to be identified. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Certain rights of challenge not conferred Clause 216 Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) In clause 216(1) of the bill, a reference to section 183B is included in section 138E(1)(e)(iv) of the Tax Administration Act, yet by clause 216(2) the section 183B reference is omitted. The reference to section 183B in clause 216(1) should be omitted, given that clause 216(1) applied from the 2002-03 income year and clause 216(2) from 1 April 2002. Comment The application dates for subclauses (1) and (2) of clause 216 are different in the case of a taxpayer with a non-standard balance date. The earliest balance date for the 2002-03 income year would be 1 October 2002, while the latest balance date for that income year would be 30 September 2003. Therefore the application dates for subclauses (1) and (2) of clause 216 are not necessarily the same. The retention of 113 separate references to clause 183B in clause 216(1) and (2) is, therefore, appropriate. The 1 April 2002 application date for the repeal of the section 183B reference in section 138E(1)(e)(iv) is also consistent with the application date for the repeal of section 183B itself, and the separate reference to it in clause 216(2) allows readers to more easily track this amendment. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Replacing alteration references Clause 226 Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) In clause 226(2), the change to section 176(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is not to replace “altered” by “amended”, but rather replace “alterations” by “amendments”. Comment The proposed amendment to section 176(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 by clause 226(2) of the bill, which involves replacing “altered” by “amended”, is correct. A separate amendment to section 176(1) is made by clause 224, which involves replacing “alterations in” with “amendments to”. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 114 SCOPE OF THE BILL Issue: Taxpayer assessment as part of the Rewrite of the Income Tax Act Clauses: various Submission (4 – New Zealand Law Society) Changes to the Commissioner’s discretions would be better able to be considered as part of the rewrite of the Income Tax Act. Comment In respect of the changes contained in the bill, the Law Society agrees with legislating for self-assessment, noting in its submission that “the principles behind such amendments are reasonable” and “that the amendments themselves are not likely to affect taxpayers”. The objection expressed is only to the number of amendments in the bill, which in the Society’s view should be added to the rewrite of the Income Tax Act. Legislating for self-assessment requires the removal of the outdated language of Commissioner assessment, placing the legislation on a footing that reflects modern administrative practices based on self-assessment. The nature of the changes necessary to achieve this are fundamental and wide-ranging in scope and as such are an important aspect of progressing wider reform, including the rewrite of the Income Tax Act. Legislating for self-assessment in this bill will allow the rewrite to be progressed to best effect. The purpose and scope of the rewrite of the Income Tax Act is quite distinct from that of self-assessment. This is reflected in the main changes for self-assessment being made in the Tax Administration Act, which in turn give rise to the need to make consequential amendments to other related legislation. Although the Income Tax Act is the largest piece of legislation requiring consequential amendment as a result of the central self-assessment changes in the Tax Administration Act, other Acts, such as the Child Support Act, also require consequential amendment for the same reason. The reason for the large number of consequential changes is the widespread use of wording that if not amended would, at least in a technical sense, impede taxpayers in making their own assessments. These changes proposed by this bill are integral to legislating for taxpayer assessment. Tax legislation can be written either on the basis of recognising taxpayer assessment together with the Commissioner’s assessment function as proposed in the bill, or on the basis of Commissioner-only assessment as in the current legislation. As such, there is limited middle ground which would allow self-assessment to be addressed as part of the rewrite of the Income Tax Act as submitted by the Law Society. In addition, officials consider that combining the legislation for self-assessment with the rewrite of the Income Tax Act would unduly complicate what are each in their own right highly complex legislative projects. 115 In addition to the consultative process stemming from the 1998 discussion document, early draft legislation on self-assessment was sent to the Law Society for comment. Officials note that this is the first suggestion from the Society that changes to the Commissioner’s discretions to cater for self-assessment should be incorporated into the project for the rewrite of the Income Tax Act. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: GST and self-assessment Clause: n/a Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Section 27 of the GST Act should be put on an explicit self-assessment basis. Comment Legislating more explicitly for self-assessment of GST would involve a number of complex policy issues that are currently being considered as part of the forthcoming post-implementation review of the disputes procedures. Officials consider that given the significance of some of the policy issues involved with GST, full consultation in accordance with the generic tax policy process is desirable. In addition, the GST legislation already closely approximates self-assessment. In most cases, taxpayers’ self-assessed GST returns are treated both as a matter of law and in practice as being conclusive and correct, unless the Commissioner makes an assessment or a challenge is initiated by either party. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 116 MINOR AMENDMENTS Issue: Definition of “notice of proposed adjustment” Clause 185 Submission (3 – Rudd Watts & Stone) The definition of “notice of proposed adjustment” in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 needs to include a notice issued by a taxpayer under proposed section 89DA. Comment New section 89DA, inserted by clause 198 of the bill, will allow a taxpayer to issue a notice of proposed adjustment to the Commissioner in respect of an income tax assessment made by the taxpayer. Officials agree with the submissioner that the definition of “notice of proposed adjustment” in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act should include a notice issued by a taxpayer in respect of their own assessment under the new section 89DA. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Default assessments Clause: n/a Submission (10 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Section 106 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows the Commissioner to make a default assessment if a taxpayer fails to furnish a return or the Commissioner is “not satisfied with the return made by any person”. The submissioner considers that because it is arguable that the return and the notice of assessment referred to in section 33 are separate documents, section 106 should possibly refer to the Commissioner not being satisfied with either document. 117 Comment Officials do not consider that this amendment is necessary. This is because new section 33, inserted by clause 187 of the bill, ensures that the notice of the taxpayer assessment is part of the return. In particular, new section 33(2) will read: “A return must contain a notice of the assessment required to be made under section 92”. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: A purpose provision in relation to taxpayer assessment Clause: n/a Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) A purpose or interpretation provision should be added to the Tax Administration Act. Comment The bill already includes an amendment to a general provision in the Tax Administration Act (section 15B) that provides a summary of the main obligations of taxpayers. This amendment proposed by the bill makes it clear that if required to do so, taxpayers must make an assessment of their taxes. Elsewhere in the legislation the respective obligations of the taxpayer and the Commissioner are provided for in context and in more detail. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 118 Issue: A return as a “notice of self-assessment” Clauses 187 and 202 Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) • For the purpose of the provision requiring taxpayers to make an assessment, a return should be referred to as a “notice of self-assessment”. • The provision requiring tax returns to be made should refer to “notice of self- assessment” instead of “notice of assessment”. Comment “Assessment” is defined in the bill as either Commissioner or taxpayer assessment. There is no separate term “self-assessment”. The fact that the notice of assessment will be part of the taxpayer’s return will remove any scope for confusion. It will be clear in the design of the return form that the notice is of the taxpayer’s self- assessment. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Section 80H Clause 194 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Amendments to sections 80G(2) and 80H (dealing with personal tax summaries/income statements) are required to better reflect that a return of income must contain a notice of assessment under the new section 33 proposed by the bill. Comment Changes are required to improve the way assessments and notices of assessments are provided for in relation to personal tax summaries/income statements. The suggested changes would make the current bill proposals clearer, in particular, by referring to the notice of assessment explicitly in relation to the treatment of personal tax summaries/income statements that taxpayers accept as being correct in which case no further action is required. 119 Section 80G(2) should be amended along the following lines (new text italicised): “... an income statement issued to a person ... is deemed to be a return of income furnished by the person under section 33 and to contain a notice of assessment signed by the person.” Similarly, the changes proposed by the bill in relation to section 80H, regarding assessments deemed to have been made in respect of these personal tax summaries/income statements, could be provided for more clearly along the lines of: “An assessment required to be made under section 92 is treated as having been made by the person in respect of an income statement deemed to be a return of income under section 80G(2).” Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Definition of “assessment” in relation to the Tax Administration Act Clause: n/a Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Specific reference to the definition of “assessment” should be included in section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) to emphasise the importance of self- assessment. Comment The proposed Income Tax Act definition of “assessment” applies in the TAA by virtue of section 3(2) of the latter. It is clear, therefore, that the same definition applies for both Acts. Furthermore, the importance of taxpayers making their own assessment is emphasised by other changes introduced in the bill such as adding a reference to taxpayers having to make assessments to provisions that already set out taxpayers’ main obligations (for example, section 15B of the TAA). Recommendation That the submission be declined. 120 Issue: How time limits apply to an assessment that includes losses Clauses: various Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The legislation should take into account time limits in circumstances where losses have been incurred. Comment The time limits in the legislation apply to an assessment that includes losses in the same way as they apply to an assessment that does not include losses. As the submission notes from the Commentary on the Bill, losses will be available to taxpayers to include in their annual assessments. The time limits that apply in respect of taxpayer losses will continue to apply under self-assessment, as they do now. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The two-month period for taxpayers to propose adjustments to their self-assessments Clause: n/a Submission (8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 10 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) More time should be provided for taxpayers to propose adjustments to their own self- assessment than the existing two months. PricewaterhouseCoopers submits that this two-month period should be extended to 12 months. Comment Officials note that the bill recognises the current two-month period is important for taxpayers, particularly as it allows a self-assessment to be adjusted in a way that limits exposure to penalties. Taxpayers already have this general ability available to them, but the period applies from the date they receive a (generally) computer generated notice of assessment from the Commissioner that corresponds to their return, rather than from the date of filing the return, as at present. 121 There are a number of wider issues related to the two-month period that link to the general design and operation of the disputes procedures, which are being considered as part of the post-implementation disputes procedures review. As part of this review, a discussion document will be published which will give an opportunity for submissions to be made according to the generic tax policy process. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Whether taxpayers should be able to fix a date of self-assessment Clause: n/a Submission (10 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Taxpayers should have the ability to fix a specific date of assessment on their notice of assessment if that date is not later than the date on which the notice of assessment must be furnished to the Commissioner. The submissioner notes that the definition of “response period” turns on the date of issue of a notice of assessment. Allowing taxpayers to fix a date on their notice of assessment would avoid unnecessary uncertainty about the date of issue. Comment The submissioner notes that the date an assessment is issued is central to the definition of the two-month response period in the disputes procedures. Officials consider the submission has merit because the date from which this two-month period begins should be certain. However, we consider that a timeframe should be provided for determining the earliest date that can appear on a taxpayer’s notice of assessment. (The precise timeframe can be determined by the Commissioner administratively, in consultation with interested parties.) We note that making this change would entail minor drafting consequential amendments. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 122 Issue: Section 89C Clause 196 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The bill amendments incorrectly change “...the Commissioner may issue a taxpayer with an assessment of tax...” to refer to a notice of assessment. Instead the bill should change section 89C to refer to the Commissioner making an assessment. Comment Section 89C provides the circumstances in which the Commissioner can make an assessment without first issuing a notice of proposed adjustment. Instead of referring to the notice of assessment, the changes being made to section 89C should refer to the ability to make an assessment. The opening words of section 89C should be amended along the following lines: “The Commissioner must issue a notice of proposed adjustment before the Commissioner makes an assessment , unless...”. In respect of the other related changes proposed for section 89C, the amendments should refer to an assessment being made rather than, as proposed by the bill, the notice of assessment being issued. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: New section 89D(2) Clause 197 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The proposed new section 89D should be amended to ensure that new section 33(2) does not apply. Comment New section 89D(2) provides that a taxpayer that has not furnished a return of income may dispute an assessment made by the Commissioner only by furnishing the return of income. 123 Taxpayers are obliged to furnish annual returns of income under section 33. New section 33(2) will provide that a return must contain a notice of the taxpayer assessment required to be made under new section 92. New section 33(2) caters adequately for the normal self-assessment situation. However, for the purpose of new section 89D(2) it is necessary to “switch off” section 33(2). When the Commissioner makes the first assessment, instead of the taxpayer, the notice of assessment required under section 33(2) to be included in a return of income is not needed. This should be clarified in the context of new section 89D for taxpayers proposing adjustments to assessments made by the Commissioner. The Commissioner may, for example, make the first assessment when the Commissioner makes an assessment after completing some calculations for some taxpayers, such as those who receive rebates of income tax under Part KD of the Income Tax Act. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: New section 89DA Clause: 198 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The words used in the proposed section 89DA should reflect the terminology already used in section 89D(1). Comment New section 89DA allows taxpayers to file notices of proposed adjustment in respect of their own assessments. Officials consider that wording along the following lines should be added to the end of subsection (1): “... if the Commissioner has not previously issued a notice of proposed adjustment to the taxpayer in respect of the assessment, whether or not in breach of section 89C.” The new wording above mirrors that contained in the corresponding provision in section 89D(1). These words prevent competing disputes procedures being invoked in respect of the same assessment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 124 Issue: New section 92 Clause 202 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Amendments should be made to clarify that when the Commissioner, instead of the taxpayer, makes the first assessment, the taxpayer does not make an assessment. Comment The requirement for taxpayers to make an assessment is being established only in relation to making the first assessment. In circumstances where taxpayers do not or are not required to make an assessment, the Commissioner may make an assessment in place of the taxpayer. A tie-breaker provision is necessary to prevent the possibility of there being competing initial assessments for the same period. The assessment rules in section 92 should more clearly provide that when the Commissioner makes an assessment for an income year in respect of a taxpayer before the taxpayer does so, then section 92 ceases to apply to the taxpayer for that income year. Examples of when the Commissioner may make an assessment include when taxpayers default (section 106, TAA), a special assessment (section 44, TAA), or when the Commissioner calculates certain rebates of income tax for taxpayers (Part KD, ITA). The wording of the tie-breaker provision in section 92 could be along the following lines: “This section does not apply to a taxpayer for an income year if the Commissioner has made an assessment in respect of the taxpayer for the income year.” Thus, if the Commissioner has made the initial assessment in respect of a taxpayer for an income year there can be no taxpayer assessment for that income year, and if the taxpayer does not agree with the Commissioner assessment the taxpayer may dispute that assessment. The taxpayer will continue to have an obligation to file all relevant returns. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 125 Issue: What happens when the Commissioner calculates rebates of income tax Clauses 187, 141, 196 and 202 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The bill should more clearly provide that taxpayers’ obligations in respect of making assessments are limited by the extent calculations are made by the Commissioner in relation to rebates of income tax under Part KD (family tax credits) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Comment In the circumstances where the Commissioner calculates the amount of a rebate of income tax under Part KD of the Income Tax Act 1994, taxpayers will not be able to assess their tax liability. The Commissioner will make the initial assessment for the taxpayers involved. These taxpayers cannot complete the notice of assessment required under the new section 33 to be contained on the return. This should be clarified further in the bill, consistent with the approach already taken in new section KD A1 proposed by the bill. Officials note that further consequential amendments are necessary to reflect that the Commissioner will make assessments that include a rebate of income tax to be calculated by the Commissioner under Part KD. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Minor amendment to new section 33(1) Clause 187 Submission (Matter raised by officials) It is sufficient to refer to a “ return of income” rather than to “return or returns of income” in the context of taxpayers furnishing their self-assessed returns to the Commissioner. Comment The wording of the new section 33(1) proposed by the bill uses terms carried over from the current section 33. However, officials consider that referring to “a return of income or returns of income” in the new section 33(1) would not fit comfortably with new section 33(2), which assumes a single annual return of income. Referring to more than one return in this context is also unnecessary given sections 79 and 80 of 126 the TAA, which provide for the furnishing of any other returns required by the Commissioner. Accordingly, the words “or returns of income” should be omitted from new section 33(1). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Minor amendment to section 177(4) Clause: n/a Submission (Matter raised by officials) In existing section 177(4), the words “issue an amended assessment” should be replaced by “amend an assessment” for consistency with the terminology used elsewhere in the bill. Comment The amendments in the bill distinguish between making an assessment and providing a notice of that assessment. Officials consider language that refers to the “issuing of an assessment” should be amended so that the legislation refers to either making an assessment or providing a notice of that assessment. As the Commissioner’s general power to assess is being removed, it is important that the legislation is clear where it confirms the Commissioner may make an assessment. In this case it is appropriate to provide that the Commissioner may make an amending assessment to give effect to providing hardship relief under section 177. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 127 MINOR ASSOCIATED AMENDMENTS TO THE CHILD SUPPORT ACT Issue: Amendment to the definition of “taxable income” Clause 240 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The definition of “taxable income” in section 29(1) of the Child Support Act should be amended to ensure the application of the definition does not change. Comment Instead of the current amendment proposed in clause 240(1)(a), officials consider the words proposed to replace "the Commissioner has not assessed a liable parent's taxable income for an income year and no income statement has been issued" should be "a liable parent's taxable income for an income year has not been assessed". These words provide a better translation into a self-assessment environment. In particular, these words allow the provision to operate, as it does now, in relation to taxpayers who are required to file a return but who do not. With this proposed change the definition of “taxable income” in section 29(1) of the Child Support Act 1991 would read (with changes italicised): “ Taxable income has the same meaning provided in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 and— (a) If a liable parent’s taxable income for an income year has not been assessed, the taxable income for the income year may be determined on the income and any other particulars known to the Commissioner; and ...” Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Application of assessment Clause 242 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The changes proposed to section 38(6) of the Child Support Act 1991 should be amended to include reference to the Income Tax Act 1976. 128 Comment Assessments made before the 1995-1996 income years may still be relevant in some cases for child support purposes. Officials consider that clause 242(3) should include a reference to “the Income Tax Act 1976 or” before the words “the Tax Administration Act 1994”. With this proposed change, section 38(6) of the Child Support Act 1991 would read (with changes italicised): “Where— (a)Notice of an assessment (including an amended assessment) of a person taxable income has been given under the Income Tax Act 1976 or the Tax Administration Act 1994 ; and (b)The notice was dated,— the assessment is to be taken, for the purposes of this section, to have been made on the date of the notice. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Changes to GST Act (except for changes included after introduction of the bill) 131 GST ON TOKENS, STAMPS AND VOUCHERS Issue: Amendment to section 5(11G) of the GST Act Submission (Matter raised by officials) A minor drafting change should be made to section 5(11G) to clarify that paragraphs (a) and (b) operate disjunctively and not conjunctively. The change should apply from 10 October 2000. Comment Section 5(11G) was redrafted in the Taxation (Beneficial Income of Minors, Services- Related Payment and Remedial Matters) Act 2001 to ensure that the words “not practical” did not unreasonably prevent taxpayers from accounting for GST at the time of redemption when a voucher was used to acquire goods and services. The amendment clarified that if the issuer of a voucher and the person supplying the goods and services in exchange for the voucher are not the same person, the issuer may elect to recognise GST at the time of redemption rather than at the time the voucher was issued (which is the standard rule). The intended application of the section requires there to be an agreement between the issuer and the supplier to this effect or that the issuer is party to such an agreement. However, no such agreement is required if the issuer of the voucher and the supplier of the goods and services are the same person. Further clarification is desirable to ensure that section 5(11G) paragraph (a) (the not practical test), and paragraph (b) (the requirement to have an agreement if a third party is involved) are disjunctive and not conjunctive. The clarification can be easily achieved if the last opening word to the paragraph “if” were deleted and an “if” placed at the beginning of both paragraphs (a) and (b) and therefore are effective where no third party is involved. The change should apply from 10 October 2000, the date when the original amendments concerning the accounting for GST for vouchers (as contained in the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000) and subsequent amendments (as contained in the Taxation (Beneficial Income of Minors, Services-Related Payment and Remedial Matters) Act 2001) came into effect. Officials recommend this retrospective date as the proposed amendment clarifies the interpretation of the legislation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 132 GST ON SUPPLIES TO VISITING FOREIGN-BASED PLEASURE CRAFT Issue: Definition of ‘consumable stores’ Clause 228 Submission (10 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 8 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The submissioners agree with the proposed change to the GST Act, allowing final provisioning of consumable stores supplied to a departing foreign-based pleasure craft to be zero-rated. However, they consider that the proposed definition of consumable stores should not exclude spare parts and that the exclusion of spare parts from the definition is based on unfounded concerns. Comment The current legislation uses the term “stores for consumption” in relation to commercial ships. “Stores for consumption” (or consumable stores) is not specifically defined in this context but is an internationally recognised term reflected in the International Convention on the Simplification and Harmonization of Customs Procedures (Kyoto convention) carried over into the Protocol of Amendment 1999, by which New Zealand is bound. Consumable stores are those goods intended for consumption by passengers and crew (such as food) and goods necessary for the operation of a vessel, including fuel and lubricants but excluding spare parts and equipment. The definition proposed in the bill is consistent with the term used in the context of commercial ships, which excludes spare parts and equipment. Officials consider that it is not appropriate that spare parts are zero-rated as there is a greater risk (than in relation to final provisions) that the goods will be on-sold to residents and/or consumed in New Zealand. However, in response to a submission made by the Boating Industry Association officials are recommending that specific maritime goods that may be required by foreign-based pleasure boats such as tenders, spare sails and life jackets, should be zero-rated. Officials note that other goods such as those required by boats that are not stores for consumption can be entered for export and exported by the supplier at a zero-rate upon departure of the vessel. This requires the purchaser to satisfy the supplier that the goods are to be taken outside New Zealand (exported). The supplier must keep sufficient evidence, which proves the goods have left New Zealand. The supplier must deliver the goods entered for export to the boat on the day of departure from New Zealand. 133 Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Zero-rating of particular detachable maritime goods to foreign- based pleasure craft Submission (39 – Boating Industries Association of New Zealand) The Boating Industry Association supports the proposed change in the bill to zero-rate consumable stores to foreign-based pleasure craft. It considers that it is important that fuel and food supplied just prior to departure is zero-rated for GST to facilitate the continued visits of large foreign-based pleasure craft to New Zealand. There is, however, an issue surrounding the application of the zero-rating provisions to goods supplied to boats such as spare sails, tenders, life jackets and spare anchors. The submissioner argues that a change to the legislation allowing this is needed to assist the growth of the number of foreign-based pleasure craft visiting New Zealand. Comment Currently, the GST legislation allows goods that become part of a temporary import to be zero-rated on the basis that the goods will be taken out of New Zealand, and are much like exports. Goods that are loose or detachable are not zero-rated because of the risk that they may be consumed in New Zealand and/or that they may be onsold to a resident. Sails, tenders, life jackets, and spare anchors are considered to be loose or detachable and are currently not zero-rated. This is creating difficulties for the boating industry and is resulting in anomalies – for example, a furling mainsail is zero-rated but a standard main or staysail is sold standard rated. In the case of the goods in question being built or provided specifically for the particular yacht, the risk of the goods being consumed in New Zealand or being on- sold to a resident is relatively low. It is therefore appropriate to zero-rate these supplies. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 134 Issue: Removal of definition of ‘consumable stores’ Submission (Raised by officials) That the proposed definition of ‘consumable stores’ which defines goods supplied for consumption by the passengers and crew to include food, fuel and lubricants but exclude spare parts, be removed from the bill. Comment “Stores for consumption” (consumable stores) is currently used in the context of zero- rating supplies to commercial vessels and is an internationally recognised term, which does not include spare parts. In light of the submission made by the boating industry, it is proposed to zero-rate specific spare parts required by foreign-based boats, which will alleviate the boating industry’s concerns. Officials therefore consider that including a separate definition is unnecessary. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Time limit required for departure Submission (10 – PricewaterhouseCoopers ) The submissioner considers that there is a risk that a pleasure craft will be supplied with zero-rated goods and stay for, say, 18 months after the supply. The submissioner suggests that there should be a time limit imposed outside which zero-rating is not possible. Comment Officials agree that the intention is to ensure that zero-rated goods are consumed outside New Zealand. The proposed clause and existing rules meet those concerns. A supplier (provedore) must be satisfied that the boat is departing before zero-rating can be applied to the consumable stores required for the duration of the voyage. Provedores are specialist suppliers equipped to handle the needs of departing boats. Provedores are generally licensed as customs controlled areas under customs legislation. The stores must be bought for use outside New Zealand and the boat must be going to a destination outside New Zealand. 135 Customs may allow entry of foreign-based pleasure craft under what is termed a “temporary import entry” (TIE). This is issued for a period of no longer than 12 months. Zero-rating will only be available to those pleasure craft that are in New Zealand with a TIE. The TIE will be used as a way of limiting the number of boats entitled to the stores on departure in that it excludes New Zealand based yachts. The fact that the TIE is issued for a limited time combined with the requirements in the bill that the boat must be going to a destination outside New Zealand and the stores must be bought for consumption outside New Zealand adequately addresses the concern expressed by the submissioner. These requirements minimise the risk that the stores will be consumed in New Zealand. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Changes to other Acts 139 AMENDMENTS TO STAMP AND CHEQUE DUTIES ACT 1971 Issue: Drafting issue New clause Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment to section 86I(b) of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 is required to clarify a change made to this section in the Taxation (Beneficiary Income of Minors, Services-Related Payments and Remedial Matters) Act 2001. The change was to include AIL within the compliance and penalty rules and was intended to apply to payments of interest on and after the date of royal assent (27 March 2001). Comment While the intent of the original amendment was that it should apply to payments of interest made on and after the date of Royal assent, this did not in fact occur. The original amendment was, in fact, passed with application on but not after the date of Royal assent. The original amendment also did not state that it specifically applied to the payments of interest from that date. It is important also that this is clarified as in both cases taxpayers have been applying the law as it should be rather than as it currently is. Recommendation That an amendment be made to section 86I(b) of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 to clarify that the inclusion of AIL within the compliance and penalty rules applies to payments of interest made on and after the 27 March 2001. 140 MINOR REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS TO TAXATION (BENEFICIARY INCOME OF MINORS, SERVICES-RELATED PAYMENTS AND REMEDIAL MATTERS) ACT 2001 Issue: Correction Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 66(1)(c) of the Taxation (Beneficiary Income of Minors, Services-Related Payments and Remedial Matters) Act 2001 should be amended to correctly refer to paragraph (b). Comment Section 66(1)(c) of the Taxation (Beneficiary Income of Minors, Services-Related Payments and Remedial Matters) Act 2001 amends section 21B(3) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Officials recommend that section 66(1)(c) be amended to correctly refer to paragraph (b) instead of paragraph (c). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Correction Submission (Matter raised by officials) The first reference to subsection (1) in section 64 of the Taxation (Beneficiary Income of Minors, Services-Related Payments and Remedial Matters) Act 2001 should be a reference to subsection (2). Comment Section 64 of that Act enacts part of the tax simplification initiative to move the return of GST on fringe benefits from GST returns to FBT returns. The subsection reference should be to subsection (2) and is an inadvertent error. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 141 MINOR REMEDIAL AMENDMENT TO CHILD SUPPORT ACT 1991 Submission (Matter raised by officials) That the reference to the fourth proviso to section NC 6(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994 in section 30(5) of the Child Support Act 1991 be corrected. Comment Three definitions in section 30(5) of the Child Support Act 1991 incorrectly refer to the fourth proviso to section NC 6(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994. The correct reference is section NC 6(1D) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Officials recommend that these references be corrected from 1 April 1999, the date from which the new section NC 6(1D) came into force. Recommendation That the submission be accepted.
Taxation (Annual Rates, Taxpayer Assessment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill Supplementary Report No. 1 to the Officials’ Report to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on Submissions on the Bill Research and Development – Small Taxpayers and Materiality 13 August 2001 Prepared by the Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department and the Treasury 2 Clause 39 BACKGROUND The main focus of the oral research and development (R&D) submissions to the Finance and Expenditure Committee was on the issue of materiality. Very broadly, for accounting purposes, an amount is material if its disclosure in the financial reports is likely to influence the decisions or assessments of the users of that report. As the proposal is currently drafted, taxpayers may take advantage of the new R&D rules if they apply the asset-recognition criteria in financial reporting standard 13 (FRS 13) to all items of R&D expenditure – whether the expenditure is material or immaterial. For financial reporting purposes, paragraph 2.3 of FRS 13 states that a taxpayer is not required to apply the standard to immaterial items of expenditure. Under the proposed tax rules, therefore, if taxpayers have not applied FRS 13 to immaterial items for financial reporting purposes, they will be required to adjust their financial reports for tax purposes. Several oral submissions suggested that this requirement to make an adjustment would give rise to significant additional compliance for taxpayers and favoured an approach that would allow taxpayers to treat immaterial expenditure for tax purposes in the same way as it is treated for accounting purposes. This would have the effect of allowing an immediate deduction for all immaterial R&D expenditure. The Committee did not appear to accept this suggestion. It was concerned that a rule that did not require adjustments to take into account immaterial expenditure would unfairly favour large firms over small firms. This is because, under such a rule, a large firm could automatically deduct large amounts of R&D on the grounds that the expenditure is immaterial to that firm. Small firms with similar levels of R&D would, however, be required to apply the asset-recognition criteria because, in relation to the firm, such expenditure would be material. The Committee was, however, concerned that, where possible, the FRS 13 proposal should minimise compliance costs for small firms with less sophisticated accounting systems and less access to professional accounting advice. The Committee therefore instructed officials to undertake some further consultation with the New Zealand Chambers of Commerce (the Chambers), who had suggested two methods that could relieve compliance costs for small taxpayers. FURTHER CONSULTATION Chambers’ main proposal As instructed, officials have undertaken further consultation with the Chambers. Consistent with its written submission, Chambers’ main suggestion is that “small taxpayers” should be permitted to deduct all R&D expenditure, whether the expenditure is material or immaterial, without the requirement of applying FRS 13. The Chambers propose that “small taxpayer” should be defined as a taxpayer with turnover of less than $3 million (the same as the definition in the trading stock tax rules). Without this exception, it is argued, businesses that do not prepare financial statements would either not be able to access the new R&D rules or would need to seek expert, and expensive, accounting advice. 3 The Chambers consider that there is good precedent for such an approach. The trading stock tax rules provide a simplified method for valuing closing stock for “small taxpayers”. This approach recognises that certain small taxpayers do not prepare financial statements in accordance with financial reporting standards and relaxes the rules accordingly. Comment Consistent with officials’ main report to the Committee on submissions, we are still of the view that to allow a blanket exemption for “small taxpayers” from the R&D rule, thereby allowing an immediate deduction for all R&D, is not good policy. It amounts to a tax concession for all small businesses meeting the definition and would provide a taxpayer with a tax incentive to structure itself to fall within the definition of “small taxpayer”. In addition, we consider that the exemption from the trading stock rules is different to that being proposed for the R&D rules. The trading stock exemption does not exempt small taxpayers from the trading stock regime itself. Instead it removes some of the information requirements for small taxpayers by providing a simplified valuation option. The “small taxpayer” exemption proposed by the Chambers would, if enacted, go further than this and exempt all small taxpayers from the core R&D rule. Chambers’ secondary proposal The Chambers has suggested, as an alternative, that small taxpayers should be able to immediately deduct R&D that is immaterial to them without being required to apply FRS 13. Comment Even though the Chambers gave no detail of a proposal, we assume they are thinking in terms of a rule with at least two conditions: • the firm’s total R&D expenditure for a year must be below a low de-minimis threshold; and • the firm must have treated its total R&D expenditure for a year as immaterial for financial reporting purposes. Such a rule would mean that qualifying taxpayers could effectively deduct immediately their R&D even though a portion of that R&D may be capital. This provides a limited tax concession for such taxpayers because, under general tax principles, capital expenditure should be amortised over the economic life of the asset to which it relates. At the margin, this rule may induce qualifying taxpayers to recharacterise other capital expenditure as R&D (up to the threshold). However, the extent of any recharacterisation is likely to be minimal, as any de-minimis threshold would be set at a very low level. 4 Compliance costs The problem raised by the Chambers relates to small businesses that do not apply accounting standards. A small taxpayer with an unsophisticated accounting system may find it difficult to apply FRS 13 to such expenditure. The information may not be readily accessible, and it is likely that professional advice would need to be obtained. This can be both time-consuming and costly. Any such rule would, therefore, be set at a low level. Taxpayers would of course not have to apply the FRS 13 proposal, which has been designed to assist them. If they consider that its complexity outweighs its benefits, they are entitled to apply existing law. Equity It could be argued that effectively confining this rule to small taxpayers is inequitable. However, the proposal is designed to reduce compliance costs for those taxpayers who do not apply the accounting standards. As noted above, small taxpayers would incur proportionately greater compliance costs when making materiality adjustments. In addition, the type of rule we are thinking of would strictly be open to taxpayers of all sizes. Revenue implications Given that the de-minimis threshold would be set at a very low level and the majority of qualifying expenditure is likely to be being deducted anyway, the revenue implications of this proposal would be negligible. Setting a de-minimis threshold Officials have looked at the potential number of taxpayers that could be assisted by such a rule, depending on where the threshold is set. We have used information gleaned from the IR 10 tax return to provide the data. On the IR 10 there is a non-compulsory box where taxpayers can fill out how much they have expended on R&D in the year. Because this is not compulsory and because anecdotal evidence suggests that much R&D is not characterised as such for tax purposes, we assume that these figures have understated the position, possibly by a large margin. It was found that in excess of 6,000 companies, partnerships, trusts and individuals indicated that they spent between $1 and $10,000 on R&D in a year. It is estimated that such expenditure would be immaterial for about 4,000 of those taxpayers. In other words, the indication is that at least 4,000 taxpayers could benefit if the maximum threshold was set at $10,000. We also found that if the maximum thresholds were set at $20,000 or, even $30,000, there would only be a very small (300 and 400 respectively) increase in the number of taxpayers benefiting. The appropriate threshold for such a rule could, therefore, be $10,000. Fixed assets Expenditure on fixed assets used in the R&D process should not qualify under any such exception. Such assets represent the capital of the firm and should be written off over their economic life under the depreciation rules. 5 There do not appear to be any compliance cost reasons for including fixed assets within a de- minimis rule. Small taxpayers would generally already be depreciating other fixed assets. The Chambers agree that any exception to the FRS 13 proposal should not include fixed assets. Immaterial for accounting purposes Any exception should also contain a requirement that the taxpayer has treated the total R&D expenditure as immaterial for accounting purposes. Generally Accepted Accounting Practice may allow taxpayers to capitalise immaterial amounts if there is a probable future economic benefit and the costs or benefits can be reliably measured. There is no apparent policy reason for allowing taxpayers to expense immaterial amounts that they have capitalised for accounting. Complexity While officials consider that the rule could be drafted relatively simply, it is acknowledged that any addition to the legislation inevitably leads to greater complexity. Whether this additional complexity is warranted depends to a large degree on how many taxpayers would benefit, and the ability of those taxpayers to cope with the complexity. Taxpayers are less concerned with complexity where it leads to a tax benefit. Pressure for future changes to a de-minimis rule The Committee should be aware that there is a risk that the enactment of an exemption, however limited, provides the opportunity for interested groups to lobby in the future for both the threshold to be raised and to allow larger taxpayers to benefit. This could result in the original rationale for the exemption (reducing compliance costs for taxpayers that do not apply accounting standards) being undermined. Further, there is a precedent risk in that it could lead to lobbying for exemptions from other tax rules for taxpayers within the relevant threshold. RECOMMENDATION Officials recommend that, on balance, the bill should be amended to introduce a limited low compliance rule. Such a rule would remove the requirement for a taxpayer to apply FRS 13 to their R&D expenditure provided that their total R&D expenditure for the year does not exceed $10,000 and they have treated that expenditure as immaterial for accounting purposes. This exception would provide compliance cost savings for, potentially, quite a large number of taxpayers. Although there are risks associated with recharacterisation of expenses, and the rule would introduce more complexity into the R&D tax rules, officials do not consider these to be significant. The risk associated with future pressure in the threshold, thereby undermining the only real rationale for the rule, could be more significant.
Taxation (Annual Rates, Taxpayer Assessment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill Supplementary Report No. 2 to the Officials’ Report to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on submissions on the proposed retrospective GST legislation to be included in the bill 27 August 2001 Prepared by the Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department and the Treasury 2 BACKGROUND Policy intent The proposed changes, currently before members of the Finance and Expenditure Committee, reflect the unambiguous policy intent of GST when it was introduced in 1986: to tax all consumption that takes place in New Zealand. This includes expenditure incurred by tourists visiting New Zealand. The policy intent is evident from papers provided to the Committee and has not been questioned by submissioners. Wilson & Horton v Commissioner of Inland Revenue The Wilson & Horton decision, 1 of 15 September 1995, concerned the zero-rating of advertising services that were supplied to a non-resident in relation to a newspaper published in New Zealand. The Court of Appeal held that the zero-rating provisions were directed to the contractual arrangements between the supplier and the recipient. Any benefits that accrued in New Zealand arising from the advertising were disregarded because of the indirect relationship that the benefits had with the contract between Wilson & Horton and the non- resident. One interpretation of the decision suggests that in circumstances when services are supplied to a non-resident who is outside New Zealand at the time of supply, those services may be zero- rated, regardless of any benefits that may be enjoyed in New Zealand. In a number of situations this interpretation potentially allowed some services that were contracted for by non-residents outside New Zealand to be zero-rated, even though the services were consumed in New Zealand. An example of this was the tuition of overseas students in New Zealand. In this situation the education services would be zero-rated because the contract was between the New Zealand school or tertiary institution and the non-resident parent of the student (as illustrated in the annex). Another example involves the selling of holiday packages to overseas tour wholesalers (also illustrated in the annex). 1999 legislative amendments The Taxation (Remedial Matters) Act 1999 introduced new section 11(2A), now re-numbered as section 11A(2), which excludes from the zero-rating provisions services that are supplied to a non-resident if another person receives the performance of the services in New Zealand. The amendment applies to services from the date of introduction of that Act – 20 May 1999. 1 Wilson & Horton v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1995) 17 NZTC 12,325 3 Proposed legislation to be included in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Taxpayer Assessment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill As announced on 14 May 2001, the proposed legislation will extend the application of section 11A(2) of the GST Act to a supply made by a registered person after 1 October 1986 if the person has sought, after 15 September 1995 (the date of the Court of Appeal decision in Wilson & Horton ), to adjust on any basis, or to have the Commissioner adjust, the GST treatment of the supply. The proposed legislation will not apply if, as a result of the person having sought the adjustment, the Commissioner has, on or before 14 May 2001, to the extent of the adjustment sought, paid a refund to the person or made an offset against, or reduction in, a tax liability. In addition, supplies of services made before 20 May 1999 to which section 11A(2) would otherwise apply will be treated as zero-rated if: • the registered person seeking to adjust the GST treatment of the supply proves to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the person who received the performance of the services in New Zealand (or a person who is associated with that person) has received a payment from the registered person equal to the amount of the adjustment sought; and • the registered person has written evidence of the payment to the person. OVERVIEW OF SUBMISSIONS Opposition to proposed amendment The Committee has received close to sixty submissions opposing the proposed amendment and recommending that it should not proceed. Many submissioners describe the proposed amendment as “immoral”, “iniquitous”, “a constitutional outrage” or “an abuse of power”. Submissioners are generally concerned with retrospective legislation that impacts negatively on taxpayers and therefore how it might impact on investor confidence in New Zealand. They are also concerned that the proposed amendment will adversely affect confidence in the tax system. Submissioners note the impact the proposed amendment would have on different groups of taxpayers who are in similar situations and consider the outcome to be unfair and unjust. They recommend that all affected taxpayers be treated equally through alternative savings provisions. Savings provisions A number of submissioners suggest alternative savings provisions to preserve existing disputes that taxpayers have with Inland Revenue. They consider that the savings provision for those who have received refunds is too narrow and unfairly favours this group against those who may have experienced delays in resolving the matter with Inland Revenue. 4 Application of clause 228A(7) Submissioners have not generally commented on the wording of the draft legislation. The exception is with regard to clause 228A(7), which requires taxpayers to pay an equivalent amount to the GST refund sought to the tourist or foreign student who received the services in New Zealand, in order to have the transaction zero-rated. Many submissioners consider that the clause is unworkable. GST treatment of warranties Submissioners raise concerns with the application of the recent Court of Appeal decision in Suzuki New Zealand v Commissioner of Inland Revenue 2 (in favour of the Commissioner) and its impact on the treatment of warranty agreements provided by offshore manufacturers. Submissioners consider that the situation in the Suzuki case is comparable to that addressed by the proposed legislation and that it would be appropriate for the Government to introduce retrospective legislation in this instance also. 2 (2001) 20 NZTC 17,096 5 GST RETROSPECTIVE LEGISLATION – ZERO-RATING Clause 228A Issue: Opposition to the proposed retrospective amendment Submissions (12W – Silver Fern Holidays, 13 – New Zealand Law Society, 14W – Thomas Cook (New Zealand) Ltd, 15W – Polson Higgs & Co, 16W – Vodafone New Zealand Ltd, 17W – Northpower, 18W – Nissan New Zealand Ltd, 19W – Fyers Wickham Ltd, 20 – Bradbury & Muir on behalf of Kiwi English Academy of Learning, 21 – Bradbury & Muir on behalf of ID Tours; Travel Arrangements; Pan Pacific; Tourmasters; General Travel; Inbound Tour Services, 22W – Southern Capital Ltd, 23 – ITS South Pacific, 24W – Retail Merchants Association of New Zealand Inc, 25W – Malley & Co, 26W – Elms Hotel, 27W – Polson Higgs & Co, 28 – ATS Pacific, 29 – Mitchell Corp New Zealand, 30 – Kevin R Sarjeant, 31 – Contract Pacific Ltd, 32 – Tourism Holdings Ltd, 33W – University of Otago, 34W – Kent Wooldridge, 35W – Next Electronic Servicing Ltd, 36 – Southern World Vacations (New Zealand) Ltd, 37 – Vacations Pacific, 38W – Kingdom Tours, 39 – Vacations Pacific Ltd, 40W – Tourism Industry Association New Zealand, 41W – Pacific Delight Ltd, 42W – University of Waikato, 43W – Stamford, 44W – ASB Bank, 45W – Kirra Tours, 46W – Farm to Farm New Zealand Tours, 47 – Travel Arrangements South Pacific Limited, 48W – Rest New Zealand Tours, 49W – Datacom Group, 50 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 51W – Bayfield High School Board of Trustees, 52W – Royal & Sunalliance, 53 – Landmark Travel, 54 – General Travel New Zealand Ltd, 55W – Tourlink New Zealand Ltd, 56W – ID Tours New Zealand Ltd, 57 – Tourmasters South Pacific Ltd, 58W – Nationwide Rental Cars, 59 – Pan Pacific, 60W – Genesis, 61W – Viking Pacific, 62 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand , 63W – KPMG, 65W – Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu on behalf of the Inbound Tour Operators Council, 67W – KPMG, 68W – Motor Industry Association Inc, 69 – Ernst & Young, 69A – Ernst & Young, 70W – PDL Holdings Ltd, 71W – Terry Baucher, 72W – Brown Wooley Graham, 73W – Richmond Ltd, 74W – Peter Holl & Associates, 75W – Montana Wines Limited) Submissioners oppose the proposed change and submit that it should not proceed. This is because they consider that retrospective legislation is not justified, and rarely can be, as it affects things which have occurred in the past. The submissioners consider that if people are to have confidence in the laws passed by Parliament, they need to be certain as to the effects of those laws on their actions. A number of comments are made to the effect that the proposed amendments are “immoral” and “unjust”. Many submissioners assert that the legislation invalidates rightful claims by inbound tour operators and denies them the legal right to have their disputes with Inland Revenue considered. They state that in so doing the amendment breaches moral, ethical and legal codes. Some consider that the legislation is an arbitrary way to deny claims. Other submissioners consider the proposed amendments an “abuse of power” by the Government that is “tantamount to thievery” and as such would be “a constitutional outrage”. One submissioner compares the Government to “an African dictatorship”. 6 Specifically, submissioners list the following concerns about the proposed amendment as the reasons why it should not proceed: • (14W – Thomas Cook (New Zealand) Ltd, 16W – Vodafone New Zealand Ltd, 40W – Tourism Industry Association New Zealand, 65W – Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, 63W – KPMG, 69 – Ernst & Young) Retrospective legislation should only be considered when it is absolutely necessary, or the circumstances are extraordinary and there has been some form of manifest error in the legislation. The proposed amendment does not “clarify” the legislation in relation to the treatment of services supplied contractually to a non-resident but received in New Zealand. Rather, it is a policy change which invalidates legitimate claims. • (22W – Southern Capital Ltd, 23 – Inbound Tourist Services South Pacific Ltd, 25W – Malley & Co, 56W – Elms Hotel Ltd, 27W – Polson Higgs & Co, 28 – ATS Pacific, 29 – Mitchell Corp New Zealand Ltd, 30 – Kevin R Sarjeant, 31 – Contract Pacific Ltd, 32 – Tourism Holdings Limited, 26 – Southern World Vacations (New Zealand) Ltd, 37 – Vacations Pacific Ltd, 41W – Pacific Delight, 42W – The University of Waikato, 46W – Farm to Farm New Zealand Tours) The Wilson & Horton decision allowed inbound tour operators to zero-rate their services and activities. Many submissioners consider that the Wilson & Horton decision held that the services and activities of inbound tourist operators should be zero-rated. • (16W – Vodafone New Zealand Ltd, 17W – Northpower, 18W – Nissan New Zealand Ltd, 22W – Southern Capital Ltd, 24W – Retail Merchants Association of New Zealand Inc, 32 – Tourism Holdings Ltd, 35W – Next Electronic Servicing Ltd, 43W – Stamford, 44W – ASB Bank, 45W – Kirra Tours, 49W – Datacom Group, 52W – Royal & Sunalliance, 55W – Tourlink New Zealand Ltd, 59 – Pan Pacific, 60W – Genesis, 69 – Ernst & Young, 70 – PDL Holdings Ltd, 73W – Richmond Ltd, 74W – Peter Holl & Associates) The Government should not introduce retrospective legislation on the grounds of fiscal risk alone. The revenue risk quoted in the Minister of Finance and Revenue’s press release, 14 May 2001, is overstated as it does not take into account any income tax implications. • (65W – Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu) Retrospective legislation should only be enacted in exceptional circumstances and the amendments must be made in a timely fashion. This is not the case here. • (17W – Northpower, 16W – Vodafone New Zealand Ltd, 18W – Nissan New Zealand Ltd, 22W – Southern Capital Ltd, 24W – Retail Merchants Association of New Zealand Inc, 35W – Next Electronic Servicing Ltd, 43W – Stamford, 44W – ASB Bank, 45W – Kirra Tours, 49W – Datacom Group, 52W – Royal & Sunalliance, 55W – Tourlink New Zealand Ltd, 60W – Genesis, 61W – Viking Pacific, 70W – PDL Holdings Ltd, 73W – Richmond Ltd, 74W – Peter Holl & Associates, 75W – Montana Wines Limited) 7 Retrospective legislation reduces the level of business certainty in taxation matters. One submissioner notes that retrospective legislation makes it difficult for businesses to effectively plan for the taxation effects on new products and investments. • (15W – Polson Higgs & Co, 17W – Northpower, 18W – Nissan New Zealand Ltd, 22W – Southern Capital Ltd, 24W – Retail Merchants Association of New Zealand Inc, 33W – The University of Otago, 32 – Tourism Holdings Ltd, 35W – Next Electronic Servicing Ltd, 41W – Pacific Delight Ltd, 43W – Stamford, 44W – ASB Bank, 45W – Kirra Tours, 49W – Datacom Group, 52W – Royal & Sunalliance, 55W – Tourlink New Zealand Ltd, 59 – Pan Pacific, 60W – Genesis, 62 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 70W – PDL Holdings Ltd, 74W – Peter Holl & Associates, 75W – Montana Wines Limited) Retrospective legislation potentially reduces the level of confidence business has in the integrity of the taxation system. • (16W – Vodafone New Zealand Ltd, 22W – Southern Capital Ltd, 25W – Malley & Co, 29 – Mitchell Corp New Zealand, 32 – Tourism Holdings Ltd, 34W – Kent Wooldridge, 35W – Next Electronic Services Ltd, 36 – Southern World Vacations New Zealand Ltd, 37 – Vacations Pacific Ltd, 40W – Tourism Industry Association of New Zealand, 41W – Pacific Delight Ltd, 46W – Farm to Farm New Zealand Tours, 55W – Tourlink New Zealand Ltd, 58W – Nationwide Rental Cars Ltd, 61W – Viking Pacific Holdings Ltd, 62 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 70W – PDL Holdings Ltd, 75W – Montana Wines Limited) Retrospective legislation is damaging to business confidence in the way that international and domestic investors view New Zealand and the New Zealand Government. Retrospective legislation significantly reduces international investor willingness to do future business and make further investments in New Zealand. It creates doubt as investors cannot be sure that the law at the time a transaction is entered into will not be changed to suit the current wishes of the Government at a later date. Certainty in the law is paramount in enabling foreign investors to have confidence in the New Zealand economy and confidence that taxpayers are entitled to rely on Court of Appeal decisions. • (18W – Nissan New Zealand Ltd, 24W – Retail Merchants Association of New Zealand Inc, 43W – Stamford, 44W – ASB Bank, 49W – Datacom Group, 55W – Tourlink New Zealand Ltd, 59 – Pan Pacific, 60W – Genesis, 61W – Viking Holdings Ltd, 69 – Ernst & Young, 70W – PDL Holdings Ltd, 74W – Peter Holl & Associates) The proposed retrospective changes will discourage full and frank disclosure by taxpayers to the Inland Revenue and, in the opinion of some submissioners, may harm self-assessment by taxpayers. 8 Comment Officials’ comments in response to the submissions are: • Officials agree that retrospective legislation should only be considered in exceptional circumstances. As submissioners note, it is desirable both to avoid retrospective legislation from a constitutional perspective and to maintain investor confidence in New Zealand, its government and its tax system. In most cases educational institutions and inbound tourist operators expected GST to be payable when they entered into the transactions in question. This is clear from the Ernst & Young submission. Returns were filed and GST was paid on that basis. The best evidence that people entered into transactions on the basis that no GST would be charged on supplies is that they filed GST returns on such a basis. In terms of PricewaterhouseCoopers’ submission, these are the taxpayers that “acted bona fide on the basis that the supply was zero-rated”. The proposal is not to change the law in those cases. Those who have zero-rated their supplies will be able to rely upon unchanged law in any dispute with Inland Revenue. In addition, any taxpayer that has already received a refund (whether or not Inland Revenue considers that they remain entitled to it) will be able to continue to rely on existing law. • Officials also agree that any retrospective amendments should be made on a timely basis. In this case, the proposed amendments are a reaction to events after the legislation in 1999 was passed and so, in that respect, are timely. • The proposed amendment clarifies the policy intent and the correct legal position as noted by the Solicitor-General in the most recent advice received by Inland Revenue on the issues. • Officials do not, therefore, accept the comment that the Wilson & Horton decision clearly allows inbound tourist operators or education providers to zero-rate their supplies. The Court of Appeal’s decision needs to be read according to the facts, which concerned the treatment of advertising services. • The proposed amendment is intended to reflect the policy intent of the legislation as is clear from background papers on the issues. While submissioners are concerned that it takes away an absolute right to refunds, Inland Revenue considers that the supplies in question by the inbound tourist operators were liable to GST. • The proposed amendment has rightly taken account of the fiscal risk and has also taken account of the correct policy intent. The Government’s decision to introduce the legislation was, therefore, not based solely on fiscal risk. • Comments that the revenue risk has been overstated are incorrect. The estimated revenue risk was based on GST amounts that were known to be in dispute between Inland Revenue and taxpayers. The estimated revenue risk was given a range of between $150 - $200 million, which was considered to adequately reflect any income tax implications. 9 • While some submissioners may consider that the amendments will affect full and frank disclosure, officials note that full and frank disclosure by taxpayers is a legal requirement under the Tax Administration Act 1994. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Policy underlying proposed amendment is incorrect Submissions (13 – New Zealand Law Society, 15W – Polson Higgs & Co, 20 – Bradbury & Muir on behalf of Kiwi English Academy of Learning, 21 – Bradbury & Muir on behalf of ID Tours New Zealand Ltd; Travel Arrangements South Pacific; Pan Pacific Travel Corporation Ltd; Tourmasters South Pacific Ltd; General Travel New Zealand Ltd; Inbound Tour Services South Pacific Ltd), 27W – Polson Higgs & Co, 28 – ATS Pacific Ltd, 31 – Contract Pacific Ltd, 33W – The University of Otago 36 – Southern World Vacations (New Zealand) Ltd, 42W – The University of Waikato, 51W – Bayfield High School Board of Trustees, 62 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Submissioners consider that the legislation should not proceed because accepted industry practice by tax practitioners, educational institutions and inbound tourist operators is that the services in question are zero-rated. This view was reached with the consent of the Government and Inland Revenue, as indicated by the two years that were spent debating the technical issues. Several submissioners consider that the time delay in implementing the 1999 legislation and the current retrospective amendment indicates tacit approval for the claims. Some note that the retrospective legislation confirms that their claims are valid and that the Government is only concerned about cancelling a debt that is owed to them. Some question the true intent of the legislation, suggesting that it does not clarify the legislation because the previous 1999 amendments did not address prior periods. They claim that officials should have been aware that refund claims were going to be made for the period before 20 May 1999. Comment Officials and Government were considering the policy issues well before 1999. The delay in legislating in 1999 was caused by other priorities on the tax policy work programme and cannot be construed as tacit approval for zero-rating. In not recommending in 1999 to address earlier periods, officials took into account a number of factors, including the need for open consultation and the revenue risk (which has now been shown to have been underestimated). Again, this recommendation cannot be regarded as tacit approval for zero-rating. The policy with regard to the supplies in question has been clear since the introduction of GST in 1986. The Wilson & Horton decision raised the question of whether the correct policy was reflected in the wording of the legislation. Advice received from the Solicitor- General states that, subject to the facts of the arrangement, it would not be correct for services supplied by the inbound tourist operators to be zero-rated. 10 Therefore the purpose of the proposed amendment is to ensure that it reflects, and indeed clarifies, the policy when GST was introduced in 1986. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Inconsistent application of proposed amendment Submissions (14W – Thomas Cook (New Zealand) Ltd, 16W – Vodafone New Zealand Ltd, 18W – Nissan New Zealand Ltd, 19W – Fyers Wickham Ltd, 20 – Bradbury & Muir on behalf of Kiwi English Academy of Learning, 21 – Bradbury & Muir on behalf of ID Tours New Zealand Ltd; Travel Arrangements South Pacific; Pan Pacific Travel Corporation Ltd; Tourmasters South Pacific Ltd; General Travel New Zealand Ltd; Inbound Tour Services South Pacific Ltd, 23 – Inbound Tour Services South Pacific Ltd, 24W – Retail Merchants Association of New Zealand Inc, 32 – Tourism Holdings Ltd, 35W – Next Electronic Servicing Ltd, 40W – Tourism Industry Association of New Zealand, 43W – Stamford, 44W – ASB Bank, 45W – Kirra Tours, 51W – Bayfield High School Board of Trustees, 52W – Royal & Sunalliance, 55W – Tourlink New Zealand Ltd, 57 – Tourmasters South Pacific Ltd, 59 – Pan Pacific, 61W – Viking Pacific Holdings Ltd, 70W – PDL Holdings Ltd, 72 – Brown Woolley Graham, 73W – Richmond Ltd, 74W – Peter Holl & Associates) The proposed legislation has different effects on taxpayers that are in similar circumstances. Many submissioners emphasise that some taxpayers have already received refunds and are not required to pay the refund back. Submissioners also note that the proposed amendment is silent for those that did not pay GST in the first instance. Submissioners are concerned that the legislation applies only to those that seek to adjust earlier returns and therefore two parallel laws are created. Comment While it is not desirable that taxpayers in potentially the same situation be treated differently, addressing the issues raised by submissioners may result in less desirable outcomes, such as taxpayers who have been allowed their refund claims being required to repay those refunds. That is why the proposed amendment provides a savings provision for these taxpayers. Officials do not recommend “levelling the playing field” by rewording the savings provision to require repayment of any refunds already paid. Officials’ comments in relation to the four classes of taxpayer, as identified in the legal opinion from Chen & Palmer (attached to the Ernst & Young submission), are: • Inbound tourist operators who paid GST on supplies to non-residents up until 20 May 1999 and applied for a refund before 15 September 1995 (the date of the Wilson & Horton decision) 11 The amendment will not affect taxpayers in this category. To the best of our knowledge there are no taxpayers in this group. Not applying the legislative change to pre-1995 refund requests ensures that the legislation is backdated only to the extent necessary. • Inbound tourist operators who paid GST on supplies to non-residents before 20 May 1999, applied for a refund after 15 September 1995 and who have received a GST refund. The amendment will not affect taxpayers in this category. This is for two reasons. First, because of the way in which GST is designed, it is not uncommon for taxpayers to seek to adjust an earlier return. In practice, therefore, this category can be seen as similar to those who zero-rated supplies. Secondly, those who received refunds may be said to have an expectation that this money could be spent, and the Government considers it unnecessary to alter any such expectation by retrospective legislation. As at 20 July 2001, approximately 50 refunds had been paid to three inbound tourist operators and 47 educational institutions. The three refunds to inbound tourist operators may be reviewed and investigated further. • Inbound tourist operators who zero-rated their supplies to non-residents before 20 May 1999 (primarily because of the Wilson & Horton decision by the New Zealand Court of Appeal in 1995, which they consider made it clear that inbound tourist operators could zero-rate their supplies). The amendment will not affect taxpayers in this category. Those who zero-rated supplies may be considered to have a rational and legitimate expectation that they could argue that such supplies are zero-rated. The Government considers that any such expectation should not be overturned by retrospective legislation. There is a range of zero-rated supplies reported in the GST returns of inbound tourist operators. Officials have compared these returns before and after the 1999 amendments to the GST Act. The ratio of zero-rated supplies to gross supplies before and after 1999 varies in some instances – some inbound tourist operators have increased their zero-rated supplies, in other instances the supplies they have remained the same and in others there has been a decline in zero-rated supplies. Inland Revenue considers that this pattern is inconclusive. Inland Revenue will, however, investigate cases where there has been a significant increase in the level of standard rated supplies following the 1999 amendments. At this stage Inland Revenue is aware of only one such case. Submissioners have indicated that a further two taxpayers have zero-rated from 1998 to 1999. • Inbound tourist operators who paid GST on supplies to non-residents up until 20 May 1999 and for the period before 20 May 1999 applied for a refund after 15 September 1995 (or have not yet applied) but have not yet received a refund. Inbound tourist operators in this category will not receive a GST refund under the proposed GST amendments. There is an obvious tension between taxpayers who have received a refund and those who have not. To a lesser degree there are also tensions between those who zero-rated and those who did not. The amendments are designed to apply according to the expectations of most educational institutions and inbound tourist operators when they entered into the transactions in question. The present claims for refunds suggest that most of these taxpayers expected that GST was payable and returned GST on that basis. 12 This category also includes five schools that have taken disputes to the TRA and one university that has taken a dispute to the High Court. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Proposed amendment is inconsistent with section 6 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Inland Revenue Charter Submissions (15W – Polson Higgs & Co, 20 – Bradbury & Muir on behalf of Kiwi English Academy of Learning, 21 – Bradbury & Muir on behalf of ID Tours New Zealand Ltd; Travel Arrangements South Pacific; Pan Pacific Travel Corporation Ltd; Tourmasters South Pacific Ltd; General Travel New Zealand Ltd; Inbound Tour Services South Pacific Ltd, 27W – Polson Higgs & Co, 33W – The University of Otago, 54 – General Travel New Zealand Ltd, 69 – Ernst & Young) Submissioners consider that the legislation should not proceed because it is inconsistent with section 6 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Inland Revenue charter, in that taxpayers in similar instances will not be treated consistently under the law. Comment This matter is currently subject to litigation. It would be inappropriate to comment further, but officials note that the Minister of Finance and Revenue and the Commissioner of Inland Revenue intend vigorously to dispute the assertion that they have acted outside the law. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Proposed amendment is inconsistent with the Bill of Rights Act 1990 and Legislative Advisory Guidelines Submissions (15W – Polson Higgs & Co, 33W – The University of Otago, 62 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 69 – Ernst & Young) Submissioners consider that the legislation should not proceed as it is inconsistent with the Bill of Rights Act 1990 and Legislative Advisory Guidelines, resulting in taxpayers being denied their right to proceed with active disputes with Inland Revenue at the time the legislation was announced. 13 Comment Advice received from the Attorney General has stated that the proposed amendments are not inconsistent with the Bill of Rights Act 1990. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Inland Revenue administration Submissions (27W – Polson Higgs, 29 – Mitchell Corp New Zealand Ltd, 31 – Contract Pacific Ltd, 36 – Southern World Vacations (New Zealand) Ltd, 37 – Vacations Pacific Ltd, 38W – Kingdom Tours, 51W – Bayfield High School Board of Trustees, 54 – General Travel New Zealand Ltd, 58W – Nationwide Rental Cars Ltd, 65W – Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, 69 – Ernst & Young) Submissioners consider that the amendment should not proceed because Inland Revenue has delayed the settlement of their refund claims on the basis that it was waiting for the Government to announce legislation to remove their claims. Some note that Inland Revenue has been particularly unhelpful, and many state that they have found the experience of dealing with Inland Revenue frustrating. Submissioners note that taxpayers have incurred substantial costs in pressing for their refund claims to be considered. Comment Inland Revenue is required to carefully consider the facts and applicable law in each case, and this can take time. Inland Revenue did not delay the processing of refunds until the announcement of retrospective legislation. The issue of retrospective legislation was first raised in April 2001, whereas refund applications were received, in the case of inbound tourist operators, as early as December 1999. Inland Revenue accepts that this issue has demonstrated a need for some improvements in three areas: systems, communication with taxpayers and consistency in reaching views on the interpretation of the law. Those matters have been reported on separately to the Committee. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 14 Issue: Industry concerns Submissions (12W – Silver Fern Holidays, 14W – Thomas Cook (New Zealand) Ltd, 20 – Bradbury & Muir on behalf of Kiwi English Academy of Learning, 21 – Bradbury & Muir on behalf of 23 – Inbound Tourist Services South Pacific Ltd, 26W – Elms Hotel Ltd, 28 – ATS Pacific Ltd, 29 – Mitchell Corp New Zealand Ltd, 30 – Kevin R Sarjeant, 31 – Contract Pacific Ltd, 31 – Tourism Holdings Ltd, 36 – Southern World Vacations (New Zealand) Ltd, 37 – Vacations Pacific Ltd, 38W – Kingdom Tours, 41W – Pacific Delight Ltd, 46W – Farm to Farm New Zealand Tours, 47 – Travel Arrangements South Pacific Ltd, 53 – Landmark Travel (South Pacific) Ltd, 54 – General Travel New Zealand Ltd, 55W – Tourlink New Zealand Ltd, 56W – ID Tours New Zealand Ltd, 58W – Nationwide Rental Cars Ltd, 69 – Ernst & Young) A large number of submissions have been made by inbound tourist operators who note that the amendment will adversely affect the industry. The issues raised in the submissions are mainly to the effect that the amendment should not proceed as affected inbound tourist operators consider that they have been disadvantaged by having to charge GST on the supply of their services, while some of their competitors have purportedly not returned GST at all. Some note that their competitors have received refunds and that the Government’s proposed legislation exacerbates the competitive disadvantage that they face. Many said that the Government should pay the refund claims on the grounds of levelling the playing field. Some submissioners outline how the GST refund would be used to promote New Zealand tourism and, in one case, retire outstanding debts arising from the Asian economic crisis of the late 1990s. Comment The purpose of the proposed amendment is to ensure that law operates as was intended, and indeed was applied often for many years, by those now seeking refunds. Over a range of tax issues there are always likely to be some taxpayers who take a more aggressive position than others. The Commissioner has a four-year time frame within which to ensure that the law is correctly applied. No specific evidence has been provided that the submissioners were, in fact, operating at a competitive disadvantage as a result of GST. The price for holidays in New Zealand is set by world prices relative to other popular tourist destinations such as Australia or the Pacific Islands. Moreover, inbound tourist operator packages also compete with other New Zealand tour options such as direct payment to the hotel or tour provider. Competitive pressures are more likely to result from changes in the tourist market such as the increased use of direct booking using the Internet and other moves away from traditional intermediation services. The fact that some operators (evidence from submissioners suggest that this may number up to four or five taxpayers) in the industry may have been zero-rating some supplies is unlikely to have had a significant impact on price relative to the larger structural changes in the tourist market. Within the tourism industry there is a range of zero-rated supplies reported in the GST returns of inbound tourist operators. Officials have compared these returns before and after the 1999 amendments to the GST Act. If an inbound tourist operator was zero-rating prior to 1999, then post-1999 transactions would now incur GST. The ratio of zero-rated supplies to gross supplies before and after 1999 varies in some instances – some inbound tourist operators have 15 increased their zero-rated supplies, in other instances the supplies have remained the same and in others there has been a decline in zero-rated supplies. Inland Revenue considers that this pattern is inconclusive. Inland Revenue will, however, investigate cases where there has been a significant increase in the level of standard rated supplies after the 1999 amendments. At this stage Inland Revenue is aware of only one such case. In addition, submissioners indicated that two taxpayers zero-rated supplies from 1998 to 1999. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 16 SAVINGS PROVISION Issue: Alternative savings provision proposals Submissions (13W – New Zealand Law Society, 19W – Fyers Wickham Ltd, 40W – Tourism Industry Association New Zealand, 50 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 51 – Bayfield High School Board of Trustees, 62 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 65W – Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, 69 – Ernst & Young, 69A – Ernst & Young) Submissioners note that retrospective legislation is often accompanied by a comprehensive savings provision allowing for existing disputes to be preserved. Many submissioners recommend that Parliament should not deprive taxpayers of the benefit of judgements obtained under earlier law or prevent the continuation of proceedings. Submissioners consider that the following savings provisions would be appropriate: • (13 – New Zealand Law Society, 40W – Tourism Industry Association New Zealand, 62 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 65W – Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu on behalf of the Inbound Tour Operators Council) Disputes under parts IVA and VIIIA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be excluded from the scope of the proposed amendment. • (50 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Suppliers acting bona fide on the basis that the supply was zero-rated should be excluded from the scope of the proposed amendment. • (19W – Fyers Wickham Ltd) The proposed legislation should only apply from the date that it is enacted. • (51W – Bayfield High School Board of Trustees) Claims submitted by schools up to May 2001 should be excluded from the effect of the amendment. • (50 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Telecommunication supplies should be excluded from the ambit of the proposed legislation. • (69 – Ernst & Young) Refund claims should be allowed for the period between 15 September 1995 and 20 May 1999 but limited to claims filed before 14 May 2001. • (69 – Ernst & Young) Alternatively, refund claims should be allowed if made within four years from the date the claim was filed, again limited to claims filed before 14 May 2001. 17 • (69 – Ernst & Young, 69A – Ernst & Young) Alternatively, refund claims should be allowed if made within two years before 20 May 1999, again limited to claims filed before 14 May 2001. Comment Officials’ comments are: • The potential revenue loss that the proposed amendment is seeking to address arises from refund claims which are being disputed by Inland Revenue. Providing a comprehensive saving provision that preserves claims in dispute would, therefore, defeat the purpose of the amendment. • The application of legislation is limited to those taxpayers who seek to adjust an earlier return. Those that entered into transactions on the expectation that GST was not payable will have filed returns on that basis. In that case the legislation will not apply, and, indeed, will exclude, taxpayers who acted bona fide on the basis that the supply was zero-rated. The proposal, therefore, seems to be the most viable means of meeting the concerns expressed by PricewaterhouseCoopers. • The issues that the proposed legislation is seeking to address relate to schools as much as to others that are affected. There is no sound basis for differentiating between schools and others. • In relation to telecommunication supplies, officials noted in their report to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on submissions on the Taxation (Annual Rates and Remedial Matters) Bill 1999 that telecommunications were not affected by the change to the GST Act proposed in that bill (now the subject of the proposed amendment in this bill). The Committee agreed to this recommendation. Therefore officials do not consider it necessary to address the issue again in the current context. In any event, the proposed amendment has been targeted to those claiming refunds post- Wilson & Horton in part to limit any consequences for telecommunication suppliers. • In relation to the proposed saving provisions raised by Ernst & Young (to allow refund for a limited time period), savings provisions of this nature create their own inequalities of treatment and a potential significant revenue risk. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 18 APPLICATION OF CLAUSE 228A(7) Description of the refund mechanism As outlined in the Government’s announcement on 14 May 2001, it is proposed to provide relief from the retrospective amendment where there is written proof that an equivalent amount to the refund that is being sought from Inland Revenue has been paid to the international student or tourist who received the performance of the services in New Zealand. In these circumstances it is proposed that the legislation treat the transaction (the provision of education or the holiday package) as a zero-rated supply. Issue: Clause 228A(7) is unworkable Submissions (13 – New Zealand Law Society, 15W – Polson Higgs & Co, 16W – Vodafone New Zealand Limited, 20 – Bradbury & Muir on behalf of Kiwi English Academy of Learning, 21 – Bradbury & Muir on behalf of ID Tours New Zealand Ltd, Travel Arrangements South Pacific Ltd, Pan Pacific Travel Corporation Ltd, Tourmasters South Pacific Ltd, General Travel New Zealand Ltd, Inbound Tour Services South Pacific Ltd, 28 – ATS Pacific Ltd, 32 – Tourism Holdings Ltd, 33W – The University of Otago, 36 – Southern World Vacations (New Zealand) Ltd, 47 – Travel Arrangements South Pacific Ltd, 50 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 54 – General Travel New Zealand Ltd, 62 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 69 – Ernst & Young, 72W – Brown Woolley Graham) • The proposed clause 228A(7) is unworkable and the practical requirements are difficult to meet. Submissioners consider it to be “misconceived” and “impractical”. Some consider that the clause does not reflect the reality of the transactions concerned, and they are not prepared to incur the costs associated with tracing the refund to the student or tourist who received the performance of the services in New Zealand. • Clause 228A(7) is contrary to the scheme of the Act as it distinguishes between the recipient under the contract and the person that receives the performance of the services. Clause 228A(7) is an impossible condition designed to give the appearance of fairness, but all the while hiding the inequity of the amendment. To require the refund to be passed back imposes compliance costs and opens up the possibility that New Zealand suppliers may be caught up in civil disputes with overseas parties concerning the application of the words “GST if any”. • Clause 228A(7) should be removed or amended as it imposes regulation on contracts that does not exist elsewhere in the Act, except to the extent that a registered person can gross up the price where there is a mistake in the belief that a supply of a going concern is not, in fact, a going concern. This is not appropriate in the case of an inbound tourist operator and an overseas tourist. The clause presupposes that the operation of GST is similar to a withholding obligation, which is not the case – therefore the windfall argument used by the Minister of Finance and Revenue is not correct. 19 Comment The general view held by submissioners is that subclause 7 is unworkable and would impose significant compliance costs on the industry. It has also been suggested that to allow this provision to proceed would create further inequities in treatment. Submissioners point out, for example, that tourist operators with offshore affiliations could benefit from the measure so as to place domestic inbound tourist operators at a competitive disadvantage. Moreover, the proposed subclause distinguishes between supplies where inbound tourist operators have facilitated holiday packages for tourists and situations where the tourist has purchased hotel accommodation or car rental directly. Other submissioners argue that to the extent that the refund mechanism is widely used it would create a fiscal risk that could be significant. For these reasons the Government has invited the Committee to consider whether this subclause should be included in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Taxpayer Assessment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. Recommendation That the Committee consider whether clause 228A(7) should proceed. If clause 228A(7) is included the Taxation (Annual Rates, Taxpayer Assessment and Miscellaneous Provision) Bill the following submissions should be considered. Issue: Application of refund mechanism in clause 228A(7) (13 – New Zealand Law Society, 15W – Polson Higgs & Co, 20 – Bradbury & Muir on behalf of Kiwi English Academy of Learning, 21 – Bradbury & Muir on behalf of ID Tours New Zealand Ltd, Travel Arrangements South Pacific Ltd, Pan Pacific Travel Corporation Ltd, Tourmasters South Pacific Ltd, General Travel New Zealand Ltd, Inbound Tour Services South Pacific Ltd, 28 – ATS Pacific Ltd, 32 – Tourism Holdings Ltd, 33W – The University of Otago, 36 – Southern World Vacations (New Zealand) Ltd, 47 – Travel Arrangements South Pacific Ltd, 50 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 54 – General Travel New Zealand Ltd, 62 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 69 – Ernst & Young, 72W – Brown Woolley Graham) • Where the New Zealand supplier has refunded, or will refund, the GST amount to any overseas purchaser the supplier should be excluded from the scope of the proposed amendment. • The requirement to pay an equivalent amount to the amount of tax being sought before a refund is received from Inland Revenue should be removed. In other jurisdictions where an “unjust enrichment” operates, it is not a requirement that the supplier prepay the tax before claiming it from the appropriate Revenue authority. • To resolve some of the practical difficulties with the clause, payment should go to parties with whom the supplier has a contract. Failure to do otherwise means that the legislation does not reflect the commercial reality of the transaction. 20 • The requirement to receive written evidence of the payment before the tax is refunded should be removed. Comment Officials’ comments are: • A savings provision as suggested that relies on an assessment that the refund will be passed on is both uncertain (in that the intention could be to pass on the refund years into the future or could be expressed rather than real) and administratively complex (in that each transaction would have to be carefully audited). • Paying the refund back to the person with whom the New Zealand supplier had the contract would not meet the Government’s objective of ensuring that the person who generally bore the cost of the GST, being the person who received the performance of the service in New Zealand, receives the refund. Once the refund has gone offshore it would be impossible, in the absence of a requirement such as that in the bill, to ascertain to whom the refund was ultimately paid. • The requirement to have written evidence that payment has been made to the person that received the performance of the services is necessary to ensure the clause meets the Government’s objectives. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Application of clause 228A(7) – Commissioner discretion Submissions (15W – Polson Higgs & Co, 33W – The University of Otago, 62 – Institute of Chartered Accountants) The reference to the “Commissioner’s satisfaction” should be deleted. It is inconsistent with the remainder of the bill, which seeks to remove such Commissioner discretions from the Income Tax Act 1994. Comment In legislating for self-assessment, many Commissioner discretions have been retained, particularly, where these are needed for enforcement purposes. The discretion is, therefore, not inconsistent with the rest of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 21 Issue: Application of clause 228A(7) to groups and where payment is made by an employer (or similar) on behalf of an employee Submissions (13 – New Zealand Law Society) Clause 228A(7) does not consider the situation where the supplier is part of a group of companies. Clause 228A(7) will therefore impact on the representative member, which is deemed under the GST Act to make all supplies and purchases by the group. As such, the representative member will be required to make the refund on behalf of the member that made the supply. (69 – Ernst & Young) Clause 228A(7) does not consider the situation where the person receiving the services is an employee, or the recipient of a prize under an incentive scheme. In these circumstances payment has been made by the employer or promoter of the incentive scheme. Similar rules in other jurisdictions are satisfied with the payment going to the contractual recipient. Comment The legislation arguably does not allow a refund where the representative member of the group is not the company that made the supply. This issue can be resolved by inserting in paragraph (a), after the words “registered person”, the words “or an associated person of the registered person”. The purpose of the savings provision is to ensure that the refund is paid to the tourist or foreign student (or an associate) who bore the cost of the GST. If the tourist, foreign student or associate received the services for no consideration and the cost is instead borne by an employer or sponsor, the legislation ought to extend to a payment made to an employer or sponsor and thus allow a refund following such payment. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Application of clause 228A(7) – Income tax implications Submission (13 – New Zealand Law Society) Clause 228A(7) should address the necessary corresponding adjustment for income tax purposes. 22 Comment The point raised by the submissioner appears to be that the payment made to the tourist or foreign student would not be liable to income tax, but that in some circumstances at least the payment made by Inland Revenue to the supplier will be subject to income tax. To address this imbalance a provision should be inserted that states that where a payment made to the recipient of the supply (or associate) is not liable to income tax and a refund is made by the Commissioner to the supplier, the refund will also not be liable to income tax. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Application of clause 228A(7) – Gift duty implications Submissions (13 – New Zealand Law Society, 20 – Bradbury & Muir on behalf of Kiwi English Academy of Learning, 21 – Bradbury & Muir on behalf of ID Tours New Zealand Ltd, Travel Arrangements South Pacific Ltd, Pan Pacific Travel Corporation Ltd, Tourmasters South Pacific Ltd, General Travel New Zealand Ltd, Inbound Tour Services South Pacific Ltd, 62 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 69 – Ernst & Young) Suppliers with no contractual obligation to refund GST to the non-resident could be subject to gift duty, and there needs to be a change to the gift duties legislation to deal with this. Comment The refund to the non-resident is an adjustment to the consideration to reflect the GST that is no longer required to be paid because of the application of subclause 7. Regardless of whether or not this is a gift in individual cases, officials note that the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 provides an exemption for gift duty in relation to a single donee receiving gifts of $NZ2,000 or less where these gifts are made as part of the normal expenditure of the donor. This exemption should apply in the current case as it would be part of the normal expenditure of a business such as an inbound tourist operator to make refunds. The cost of the initial supply would need to have been $NZ18,000 or more in order for gift duty to arise – exceeding this threshold in relation to the supplies in question would appear to be a rare event. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 23 GST & WARRANTIES Clause N/A Issue: Suzuki New Zealand v Commissioner of Inland Revenue Submission (16W – Vodafone New Zealand Ltd, 18W – Nissan New Zealand Ltd, 23 – Inbound Tour Services South Pacific Ltd, 24W – Retail Merchants Association of New Zealand Inc, 35W – Next Electronic Servicing Ltd, 43W – Stamford, 44W – ASB Bank, 45W – Kirra Tours, 49W – Datacom Group, 52W – Royal & Sunalliance, 55W – Tourlink New Zealand Ltd, 59 – Pan Pacific, 60W – Genesis, 70W – PDL Holdings Ltd, 73W – Richmond Ltd, 74W – Peter Holl & Associates) The proposed retrospective amendment appears to indicate the Government is willing to selectively overrule Court of Appeal decisions that go against it, such as Wilson & Horton v Commissioner of Inland Revenue , while requiring full compliance with other Court of Appeal cases which go the Government’s way, such as Suzuki New Zealand v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (which concerned the GST treatment of payments made under warranty agreements). (64W – Deloitte Touche Tomatsu, 68W – Motor Industry Association Inc) New legislation should be introduced as part of this bill to zero-rate the supply of goods and services under a warranty as the treatment of warranty payments, as highlighted in Court of Appeal decision Suzuki New Zealand v Commissioner of Inland Revenue , gives rise to almost identical issues to those being considered. Comment The facts presented in, and policy implications of, Wilson & Horton and Suzuki are quite different. The issues in Suzuki concern the taxation of warranty payments, under contracts that involve the making of warranty payments by an offshore manufacturer in respect of goods sold to a New Zealand customer at a price that includes the cost of the warranty. Officials have agreed to work with industry representatives to determine whether the case gives rise to any policy issues that need to be addressed in legislation. As work on the issues has only recently begun, it would be inappropriate to recommend any changes to the current bill in relation to the issues. Recommendation That the submission be declined but note that officials will continue discussions with the industry. 24 GST RETROSPECTIVE LEGISLATION – GENERAL Clause N/A Issue: Reinstatement of section 11(2B) Submission (62 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Accompanying the reforms contained in the Taxation (Remedial Matters) Act 1999 was an amendment defining when a taxpayer was “outside New Zealand”. As clauses 227A and 228A retrospectively apply to the substantive amendments contained in the Taxation (Remedial Matters) Act 1999, the omission of this definition is noted but not considered to be significant. Comment The backdating of this section is not necessary as it concerns the treatment of companies in respect of determining whether they are “outside” New Zealand when certain services are performed. The proposed amendment in this bill concerns the consumption of services in New Zealand by persons other than those making taxable or exempt supplies, so the section is unlikely to be relevant in this context. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Statement on when retrospective legislation may be used Submission (66W – Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu) Officials should be instructed to draft a paper for public comment outlining circumstances where retrospective legislation may be required or considered in relation to taxation matters. Comment There are general guidelines concerning when retrospective legislation is appropriate. In considering the application of legislation the same considerations should apply equally in the field of tax as with any other legislation. Whether particular retrospective measures are justified is a policy issue for Government and Parliament to determine. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 25 ANNEX Illustration of contract and performance of services New ZealandOutside New Zealand Illustration of contract and performance of services New ZealandOutside New Zealand Inbound tourist operator Overseas Tourist Overseas travel wholesaler Performance of services Agreement to perform services Payment Payment School Child Parent Performance of services Agreement to perform services Payment

MINORS AT 33% Introduction The bill proposes a rule to ensure that distributions of beneficiary income from a trust to a child under the age of 16 years are taxed at a final tax rate of 33% (the minor beneficiary rule). In accordance with the generic tax policy process, the Government released a consultative issue paper outlining the proposed rule in June 2000 and officials consulted widely with a number of private sector organisations with particular knowledge in this area. The proposed minor beneficiary rule is necessary to limit the ability of some families to gain a tax advantage by meeting expenses of the children through the use of a trust. Given the specific purpose of the rule, it will only apply when settlements have been made on the trust by a relative or guardian of the minor or by a person associated with a relative or guardian. The bill proposes a number of exceptions to the rule. For example, if the beneficiary income was distributed to a non-resident minor, or to a disabled minor for whom a child disability allowance is paid under the Social Security Act 1964. The proposed rule will apply in respect of income derived from 1 April 2001 or for the equivalent income year. Overview of submissions Eight submissions dealt with the taxation of minor beneficiaries. With one exception, submissions strongly opposed the proposed rule. In particular, it was submitted that the proposed rule breaches fundamental principles of trust law because it results in income being taxed to a different person and at a different tax rate than the person to whom the income legally belongs. The proposed rule was also opposed on the basis that its application is too broad and will apply inequitably to trusts operated for legitimate purposes not engaging in any tax motivated income splitting. One of the most significant specific concerns raised was the appropriate treatment of mixed trusts. These are trusts where settlements by a relative, guardian or associate which were not within any of the exceptions (“tainted settlements”) are managed as one trust along with settlements which were not intended to be caught by the rule (“untainted settlements”). Significant concerns were also expressed in submissions about the extent of the definition of “relative”, on the exceptions for testamentary trusts and the minimum threshold under which beneficiary income is exempted from the rule. Officials provided details of the proposed amendments in respect of mixed trusts to the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand and the New Zealand Law Society and invited these organisations to provide comments. 2 The main recommendations by officials to the Committee following submissions are that amendments should be made to the bill to: • Clarify that all beneficiary income of a minor is subject to the minor beneficiary rule unless all settlements on that trust fit within any of the listed exceptions. However, the rule will not apply to beneficiary income of a minor from a mixed trust if all tainted settlements on the trust were dispositions of property and the total value of those tainted settlements at the date of settlement does not exceed $5,000. If any of the tainted settlements are not dispositions of property, for example, if they are settlements of financial assistance, or if a relative, guardian or their associate has provided services to the trust, then all minor beneficiary income from that mixed trust is subject to the rule. • Extend the exception for settlements under a will or intestacy so that the exception will apply if the minor is alive within 12 months of the date of the settlor’s death or a brother or sister of the minor is alive within 12 months of the date of the settlor’s death. • Increase from $200 to $1,000 the minimum threshold under which beneficiary income from trusts is exempt from the rule. • Extend the definition of “relative” for the purposes of this rule to include settlements made on the trust by a de facto partner of the child’s relation. 3 SUPPORT FOR THE PROPOSED MINOR BENEFICIARY RULE Submission (6 – National Council of Women of New Zealand) Overall, the National Council of Women of New Zealand supports the spirit of the proposed rule. If parents and guardians are placing income-earning assets in a trust, distributing income to children as beneficiary income taxed at a lower marginal rate and using the income to meet family expenses, then this is a clear example of tax avoidance and should be discouraged. 4 OPPOSITION TO THE PROPOSED MINOR BENEFICIARY RULE Submissions (7 – ICANZ, 5 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 3 – New Zealand Law Society, 3 – New Zealand Employers Federation, 4 – Federated Farmers of New Zealand, 1 – HB Thomas) The proposed minor beneficiary rule is strongly opposed. The current rules should be maintained in relation to the taxation of beneficiary income of minors. The rule is opposed for the following reasons: • (ICANZ, PricewaterhouseCoopers) It results in income being taxed to a different person and at a different tax rate than the person to whom the income legally belongs. • (1 – HB Thomas) The proposals are contrary to the Government’s pre-election commitment that there would be no rise in income tax for the 95% of taxpayers earning under $60,000. • (PricewaterhouseCoopers, Federated Farmers of New Zealand, New Zealand Employers’ Federation) The proposals are too broad in their application and will apply inequitably to trusts operated for legitimate purposes not engaging in any tax motivated income splitting. The primary purpose of trusts in a farming context, for example, is asset protection. • (New Zealand Employers’ Federation, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Federated Farmers of New Zealand) The proposed rule results in income being taxed differently depending on its source. Consequently, it is likely to lead to assets being owned directly by the child. • (PricewaterhouseCoopers, New Zealand Law Society) The proposal creates a number of anomalies. Low-income spouses or other adult beneficiaries will continue to be taxable at their marginal tax rate. Consequently it will not achieve an equitable redistribution of the tax burden. • (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Even if the minor’s income could, in substance, be regarded as the income of the parents, this rationale does not justify taxing the minor at 33% if one (or both) of the parents has marginal tax rate less than 33%. 5 • (New Zealand Employers’ Federation) The extent of income being distributed to minors in order to minimise income subject to the 39% tax rate does not appear to be sufficient to justify this measure. • (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Anti-avoidance rules are already in place to deal with situations where beneficiary income derived by minors is not being used directly to benefit the minor, or is being used to provide the basic necessities of life for the minor. Rules therefore exist currently to counter family expenses being funded by distributions to minors. These existing measures should be enhanced if not achieving their objective. Comment The purpose of the proposed minor beneficiary rule is to limit the ability of some families to gain a tax advantage by meeting expenses of the children through the use of a trust. Parents generally meet the expenses of their children from their after-tax income. However, by settling income-earning assets on a trust and distributing the income to the children, these expenses can be met from income taxed at the marginal tax rates of the children. Thus, where the parents’ marginal tax rate is 33% or 39% and that of the children is 19.5%, income that would otherwise be taxable to the parents at the higher rate becomes taxable to the children at the lower rate. Whilst this income is legally that of the child, it is unlikely in these cases that the children are actually determining how the funds are spent. In fact, the income distribution is likely to take the form of payment of school fees or expenses, rather than a cash distribution. The limitation of the rule to minors under 16 years recognises that above that age it is increasingly likely that beneficiary income is not, in fact, used to meet family expenses. For example, Inland Revenue records show that in the 1999 income year, about 3000 children under the age of six received beneficiary income exceeding $21 million in total. This is an average of $7,000 income for each child under the age of six and excludes interest and dividend income distributed by trusts. The Income Tax Act 1994 does include general anti-avoidance provisions to deal with situations where beneficiary income derived by a minor is not being used directly to benefit the minor, or is being used to provide the basic necessities of life. However, in the situation described above, provided that the expenses met are over and above normal parental obligations and that the distributions are genuinely used to benefit the child, these anti-avoidance rules will not apply. Yet, these families are clearly able to obtain a tax advantage not available to families without a trust. Because this tax advantage is only being obtained in a specific situation, it is appropriate that a specific rule be provided to deal with this situation, rather than amending the general anti-avoidance rules. Officials recognise that trusts are used by a wide variety of people for a wide range of reasons. Consequently, the minor beneficiary rule does not apply in all situations in which a minor derives beneficiary income. Rather, its application is limited to those trusts on which a settlement has been made by a relative or guardian of the minor, or a 6 person associated with a relative or guardian. The specific exceptions from the rule and the minimum threshold exemption are aimed at ensuring that the rule does not apply in situations where a tax advantage clearly would not be obtained. Because this rule applies only to income distributed to a minor, the important role of trusts in asset protection will not be affected by this proposal. The point was made in submissions that the rule could result in the minor being taxed at 33%, when the tax rate of the settlor may in fact be lower. Given the purpose of the rule, a case could be made for taxing minor beneficiary income at the settlor’s tax rate (who may or may not be a parent of the beneficiary) rather than at the trustee rate of 33%. It is likely that in many cases the settlor’s marginal tax rate will be 33% or 39% but it could be 19.5% in some cases. However, to use the settlor’s tax rate would involve considerable administrative and compliance costs. For example, trustees would be required to find out the tax rate of the settlor. This information may not be readily available. The applicable tax rate could be either the settlor’s tax rate at the date the settlement was made or the settlor’s current tax rate. It is for these reasons that trustee income is taxed at 33% and not at the settlor’s rate, and the same pragmatism leads to the conclusion that the 33% trustee rate is appropriate for minor beneficiary income. During its hearing of evidence on the bill, the Committee asked officials for information as to whether Inland Revenue had considered taxing children’s beneficiary income at the marginal tax rate of their parents. Officials provided this information in a letter to the Committee of 20 December 2000. The rule will be limited to beneficiary income of minors. It is recognised that, subject to anti-avoidance provisions, income can be allocated to low-income spouses to produce tax benefits. A spouse's income is more likely to be, in substance, income of that spouse. In addition, given changes currently being made to matrimonial property legislation in relation to de facto relationships and the consideration which is currently being given to the appropriate treatment of same-sex relationships throughout the law, it would be inappropriate to deal with tax avoidance involving low-income spouses at this time. The proposal does not apply to income derived directly by a minor. While it is recognised that an asset can be transferred directly to a child, it is less likely that a parent would transfer substantial income-earning assets directly to a child in order to gain the benefits of a lower tax rate. The advantage of settling the asset on a trust is that the child receives only the income from the asset, and not the asset itself, since the child may not handle the asset itself wisely. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 7 THE SCOPE OF THE RULE Issue: Definition of ‘trusts’ subject to the rule Submission (5 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Clarification is required as to precisely which trust relationships will be caught by the minor beneficiary rule. The legislation should expressly state the intention expressed in the issues paper released in June 2000, that the rules will only apply to those trusts for which current law now requires a tax return. In particular, the legislation should clarify that bare trustees and assets in the name of children will not be subject to the proposals. Clarification will also be required on which trusts are required to file a tax return under current law. Comment A trust is a relationship by which an equitable obligation is imposed on a trustee to hold and administer property transferred to them by a settlor for the benefit of nominated beneficiaries. A trust is not a separate legal entity. Consequently, whether a trust tax return is required is dependent on whether such a relationship exists. The common law of trusts contains a number of well-established essential elements which must be met for a trust to exist including the division of legal and beneficial ownership of the trust property between the trustee and the beneficiary. A trust is a relationship which can exist in an infinite variety of situations as the functions performed by trusts constantly evolve in response to changing social and legal requirements. Consequently, it is neither practical nor appropriate for tax legislation to define a trust. The minor beneficiary rule will apply to all trust relationships in which the settlor of the trust is a relative or guardian of the minor or a person associated with a relative or guardian, unless the settlement is specifically provided for in an exception. Officials understand that there is some uncertainty amongst taxpayers as to whether a child’s bank account operated by his or her parents might be considered to be a trust and therefore come within this rule. Whether a bank account will constitute a trust is dependent on the particular nature of the relationship. Consequently, officials consider that it is not appropriate to expressly exclude bank accounts from the application of the minor beneficiary rule. However, in the majority of situations involving a bank account, it is unlikely that there will be any division of legal and beneficial ownership of the trust property – the essential element of a trust relationship. Rather, the income will be earned directly by the child, in which case the minor beneficiary rule will not apply. Given that in the majority of cases the income from a child’s bank account is unlikely to exceed $1,000, a minimum level of $1,000 effectively eliminates any uncertainty as to whether the rule applies to such income. 8 Officials also consider that it is appropriate to deal with any uncertainty relating to bank accounts by clarifying when a bank account will constitute a trust relationship in the Tax Information Bulletin explaining these new rules when they are enacted. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Trusts containing both tainted and untainted settlements Submission (5 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 7 – ICANZ) Under the proposals as introduced, it will be very difficult for trustees to determine whether, or the extent to which, income distributed is derived from property settled by a relative or a guardian of a minor or a person associated with a relative or guardian (“tainted settlements”). Consequently, trustees will incur significant compliance costs. (5 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) These heavy compliance difficulties are a further reason for not proceeding with the proposed rules. However, if it is decided to proceed with the legislation, it should be amended to provide for simple tracing rules, rather than adopting a broad approach where all distributions to minors are taxed at 33%, where any property of the trust includes a ‘tainted’ settlement. (7 – ICANZ) The concept of “property settled” on the trust should be defined and its scope should be clarified. Comment As previously noted, the minor beneficiary rule is not aimed at all situations in which a minor receives beneficiary income, but only those situations where families can gain a tax advantage. Consequently, in order to ensure that the application of the rule was limited in this way, the rule as introduced applies only to income derived from a settlement of property on the trust by a relative or guardian of the minor or an associate of that relative or guardian, unless that settlement of property fits within certain specified exceptions. However, as submissions have highlighted, the legislation as introduced raises a number of issues: • Focussing on income derived from property settled by certain people on the trust creates difficulties in allocating income of the trust to particular settlements of property. These difficulties arise from the fact that: (a)property settled on the trust may have been sold and replaced with different property; 9 (b)there may be property subject to the rule and property which is not accounted for as one trust; and (c)thirdly, these two settlements may have become intermingled. • While section OB 1 defines “settlor” and “settlement”, neither “settled” nor “property settled” are defined in the Act. • The rule as introduced is limited to beneficiary income derived from property and, inappropriately, does not apply to settlements of services by a relative, guardian or their associates. This oversight should be corrected. It is intended that the minor beneficiary rule will apply to all types of settlements on a trust (as defined in section OB 1). In equity each settlement constitutes a new trust. However, in practice two or more settlements under the same trust deed with the same trustees may be managed as one trust with one tax return filed. It is likely that there are some trusts that have been established for many years that contain both settlements intended to be subject to the rule and settlements that are not, and the income from those settlements may have become intermingled in new assets. In such a case it may be very difficult, if not impossible, to determine the extent to which beneficiary income is subject to the rule. The legislation as introduced does not clearly provide how the rule should apply to beneficiary income from such a trust. It is recognised that the current legislation will result in considerable compliance costs for trustees to determine whether or the extent to which, income distributed to a minor should be subject to tax at 33%. Officials have considered a number of options for dealing with mixed trusts, where settlements by a relative, guardian or associate which are not within any of the exceptions (“tainted settlements”) are managed as one trust along with settlements which were not intended to be caught by the rule (“untainted settlements”). The objective is to ensure that an equitable result is reached for beneficiaries of mixed trusts, whilst minimising compliance costs for trustees. Officials have considered whether a simple tracing rule could be introduced to provide guidance on tracing the source of income of distributions. However, given the wide variety of trusts to which such a rule would potentially apply, any tracing rules would necessarily be highly arbitrary and would involve significant ongoing compliance costs. Consequently, officials consider that the legislation should be amended to provide that all beneficiary income of a minor from a trust will be subject to the minor beneficiary rule, unless all settlements on the trust fit within any of (a)-(d): (a)made by a person who is neither a relative nor guardian of the minor, nor a person associated with a relative or guardian; or (b)made under the terms of a will, codicil, intestacy or a court variation of a will, codicil or intestacy if the minor was alive within 12 months of the date of the settlor’s death, or a brother or sister of the minor was alive within 12 months of the date of the settlor’s death; or 10 (c)made by a person as agent of the minor, if the settlor received the property from someone other than a relative, guardian or associated person; or (d)damages or compensation which the settlor was required by a court order to pay to the child.” The legislation should also specifically provide for the current practice that if more than one settlement has been made under the same trust deed and with the same trustees, this may be treated as one trust for the purposes of taxation. Focussing on settlements on the trust, rather than income derived from property settled on the trust this option: • removes the uncertainty created by use of the words “settled” and “property settled”; • deals with the situation where property settled on the trust – for example – shares, has been sold, and replaced with different property, as the focus is on who made each settlement; • includes settlements of services (with the exception of incidental services). The advantage of this option is that it sets out a clear rule for the future. Untainted settlements can be settled in a separate trust from property that is subject to the rule to ensure that the 33% rate will not apply to all beneficiary income. $5,000 exemption provision There is, however, a transitional issue concerning existing mixed trusts which contain both tainted settlements and untainted settlements, as all income distributed from such a trust to a minor will be subject to the rule. Consequently, it is proposed that an exemption provision be provided to ensure that the minor beneficiary rule will not apply to income from a mixed trust if the total value of the tainted settlements does not exceed $5,000. This is aimed at preventing a trust being tainted where it contains both untainted settlements and tainted settlements and the tainted settlement is of only a minor value. An example of such a situation would be one in which $100 has been settled by a parent (tainted) and $10,000 settled as compensation for the child (not tainted). Valuation of settlements Placing a $5,000 value on tainted settlements before all income of the trust is subject to the rule requires a value to be placed on settlements. The value of the settlement should be its value at the date of settlement; otherwise difficulties would arise if a tainted settled asset had later become mingled with an untainted asset, or if the value of the asset fluctuated from year to year. Settlements on a trust which come within paragraph (i) of the definition of “settlor” in section OB1 will generally be able to be valued reasonably easily. Paragraph (i) provides that there will be a settlement when a person has made “any disposition of property to or for the benefit of the trust or on the terms of the trust for less than 11 market value.” It is likely that the majority of settlements on a trust, particularly family trusts, will fit within paragraph (i). Other settlements, however, such as the provision of financial assistance (paragraph ii) and the provision of services to the trust (paragraph iii), will in some cases be very difficult to value. For example, placing a value on a guarantee is not necessarily easy. Consequently, to minimise compliance costs involved in placing a value on such settlements, it is proposed that the $5,000 exemption provision for mixed trusts will apply only if all tainted settlements are dispositions of property within paragraph (i) of the definition of “settlor”. If any of the tainted settlements are not within paragraph (i) – for example, if they are settlements of services, or financial assistance – then all income from that mixed trust is tainted. Consideration was given to a variety of options for taking settlements other than dispositions of property into account in determining whether the $5,000 limit on tainted settlements was exceeded. These options included: • using the fringe benefit tax rate for valuing low interest loans; • using the value underlying the settlement – for example, the value of a loan in the case of a low interest loan, or the amount guaranteed, in the case of a guarantee. It was concluded, however, that the compliance costs which trustees would incur in determining whether the value of such settlements exceeded $5,000 might outweigh the tax benefits of being outside the minor beneficiary rule. Trading trusts The exemption provision for mixed trusts where the value of the tainted settlements does not exceed $5,000 will not apply in respect of trading trusts, where a relative provides services (other than incidental services) to the trust, whether or not for less than market value. Income distributed to a minor from a trading trust was always intended to be within the scope of the minor beneficiary rule. However, an unintended consequence of the $5,000 threshold for tainted settlements would be that some trading trusts would no longer be subject to the rule. Take for example, the situation of a professional who sets up a trust with an initial settlement of $100 (a tainted settlement). He/she then provides services to the trust and is paid a market value salary. Because it is for market value it is not a settlement. Because the only settlement on the trust is the $100 “tainted” settlement it is not a mixed trust. Therefore the threshold exemption provision would not apply, and all income distributed to a minor from the trust would be subject to the rule. However, if there was also an “untainted” settlement on the trust – for example, a settlement by a non-relative – it would be a mixed trust. Because the only tainted settlement is the $100, the threshold exemption provision will apply and any income distributed from this trust to the children will not be subject to the rule. 12 This result is unintentional. To prevent it, the mixed trust exemption does not apply to trading trusts. Recommendation That the proposed rule be amended to provide to provide that all beneficiary income of a minor from a trust will be subject to the minor beneficiary rule, unless all settlements on the trust were either: (a)made by a person who is neither a relative nor guardian of the minor, nor a person associated with a relative or guardian; or (b)made under the terms of a will, codicil, intestacy or a court variation of a will, codicil or intestacy if the minor was alive within 12 months of the date of the settlor’s death, or if a brother or sister of the minor was alive within 12 months of the date of the settlor’s death; or (c)made by a person as agent of the minor, if the settlor received the property from someone other than a relative, guardian or associated person; or (d)damages or compensation which the settlor was required by a court order to pay to the child.” However, when a trust contains both settlements which fit within any of the exceptions (a)-(d) and settlements which are tainted, if all tainted settlements fit within paragraph (i) of the definition of “settlor” in OB1, and if the total value at the date of settlement of all tainted settlements is $5,000 or less, the minor beneficiary rule will not apply to income from that trust. This $5,000 exemption provision for mixed trusts will not apply if a relative or guardian or their associate provides services (other than incidental services) to the trust, whether or not this is for less than market value. The legislation should also specifically provide for the current practice that if more than one settlement has been made under the same trust deed and with the same trustees, this may be treated as one trust for the purposes of taxation. Issue: Structure of sections HH 3A and HH 3B Submission (9 – New Zealand Law Society) Sections HH 3A and HH 3B are not very well integrated and the structure is very confusing. The provisions should be drafted in a clearer way. 13 Comment On the 13 December, during the hearing of evidence, the Finance and Expenditure Committee requested a comment from officials in relation to the concerns of the New Zealand Law Society. In addition, the Chair of the Committee, Mr Mark Peck, asked officials to liase with the New Zealand Law Society on the drafting of these provisions. Following the submission process, officials are recommending that a number of changes be made to the substance of the legislation, which will result in consequent changes to the structure of the legislation. Officials are liasing with the New Zealand Law Society on the structure of this amended legislation, to ensure that the Society’s concerns are met. Recommendation That officials continue to liaise with the New Zealand Law Society in relation to the redrafted legislation to ensure that the Society’s concerns are met. Issue: Definition of a relative Submission (7 – ICANZ, 5 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Given the stated policy of the proposal of preventing trusts being used to meet expenses of the family, the scope of the rule should be narrowed. (7 – ICANZ) The rule should only apply to settlements by a relative within two degrees of relationship. (5 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The rule should apply only where parents or guardians make settlements. Arrangements where the minor’s parents or guardians indirectly fund the property through another person such as a relative or associated person should be dealt with through specifically targeted anti-avoidance provisions. (9 – New Zealand Law Society) The rule should apply only where settlements are made on the trust by a parent of the minor. Comment The purpose of the minor beneficiary rule is to limit the ability of families to gain a tax advantage by meeting the expenses of their family by using a trust. 14 Consequently, the minor beneficiary rule will not apply to all situations in which a minor receives beneficiary income. Rather, it will apply only to beneficiary income of a minor from a trust when a settlement has been made on that trust by a relative or guardian of the minor or an associated person of that relative or minor. The rule adopts the existing definition of “relative” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Under this section individuals are regarded as relatives when they are connected by: • blood relationship (this includes persons within the fourth degree of relationship); • marriage (this includes not only persons married to each other but also those with a blood relationship to their spouse); • adoption. Officials agree that within the fourth degree of relationship is a wide definition of “relative”, encompassing an individual’s great great grandparent. In the majority of situations where a tax advantage may be gained through use of a trust, the settlor is likely to be a parent or guardian of the child. However, it is necessary to go beyond the immediate family, as a grandparent (two degrees of relationship) or an aunt or uncle of a child (three degrees of relationship) may also meet expenses of the child. This would normally be done out of their after-tax income. By distributing this income to children as beneficiary income, these expenses can be met out of income taxed at the child’s tax rate. Also, a parent might request that the grandparents settle assets on a trust of which the children are beneficiaries, instead of giving these assets directly to the parents. Officials consider that the number of settlements made by relatives who are removed by four degrees will be relatively small. However, if the definition of relative were narrowed for the purposes of this rule, it would be possible for some families, to avoid the minor beneficiary rule and gain a tax advantage, by establishing ongoing family trusts, subject only to the rule against perpetuities. Instead of income going to one generation and taxed at their marginal tax rate, it could be distributed to their children, and used to meet family expenses. Officials consider that whilst a relative could be defined in terms of three degrees of relationship without significantly undermining the rule, given that the Income Tax Act already contains two definitions of “relative”, introducing a further definition would result in unnecessary complication. The Income Tax Act defines a relative as within four degrees of relationship for all purposes but the international tax rules. In the international tax rules, a relative is defined as two degrees of relationship. The Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 also defines a relative as within two degrees of relationship. It is necessary to include settlements made by associates of relatives or guardians within the scope of the rule. This ensures that settlements made via a family company, for example, are still subject to the rule. 15 Officials consider that it is not necessary to adopt specific anti-avoidance rules, as a relative who has arranged for someone else to settle the property on his/her behalf will still be a settlor of the trust in terms of the existing definition of a settlor in the Income Tax Act. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Definition of a “relative” Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment should be made to the definition of “relative” in section OB 1 for the purposes of the minor beneficiary rule to ensure that the rule applies to the beneficiary income of a minor when a settlement has been made on the trust by a de facto partner of the child’s relative. Comment The minor beneficiary rule is aimed at restricting the ability of families to gain a tax advantage by meeting the expenses of their family by using a trust. Consequently, the rule will only apply to beneficiary income of a minor from a trust when a settlement has been made on that trust by a relative or guardian of the minor or an associated person of that relative or minor. The rule adopts the existing definition of “relative” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. However, because the connection by marriage does not include de facto couples or same sex couples, the result of adopting this definition is that the minor beneficiary rule will not apply when a settlement has been made on a trust by a de facto or same sex partner of the child’s relative. Consequently, some families will still be able to gain a tax advantage in meeting the expenses of the family from beneficiary income, but other families will not be able to, depending on the structure of that family. Thus currently, the rule would apply if a person settled property on a trust for their spouse’s child, but would not apply if a person settled property on a trust for their de facto partner’s child, or for the child of their partner of the same sex. This result is inequitable and is inconsistent with the policy intent. Officials consider that the definition of “relative” should be extended for the purposes of the minor beneficiary rule to encompass settlements made by the de facto partner of the minor’s relative. A recent amendment to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 provides a precedent for including de facto relationships within the definition of a relative. 16 However, consideration is currently being given to the appropriate treatment of same- sex relationships throughout the law, including tax law. Consequently, officials consider that given that none of the revenue acts currently take account of same-sex relationships, settlements made by a partner in a same-sex relationship should not be included at this stage. Rather, these should be dealt with as part of the wider issue of same sex couples, in order to ensure consistency. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Definition of “associated person” Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment should be made to the definition of “associated person” in section OD 7 to remove paragraph (c) from the definition for the purposes of the minor beneficiary rule. Comment The minor beneficiary rule applies to beneficiary income of a minor from a trust when a settlement has been made on that trust by a relative or guardian of the minor or an associated person of that relative or minor. Associated persons were included primarily to ensure that settlements made by a family company are within the scope of the rule. The definition of an associated person in section OD 7 applies. However, section OD 7(1)(c) includes as associated persons, two persons who are relatives. Given that a relative includes persons within four degrees of relationship, the effect of paragraph (c) is that the minor beneficiary rule will apply when the settlor is removed from the beneficiary by eight degrees of relationship. This was not intended. Relatives who are removed from the beneficiary by more than four degrees of relationship should not be covered by the rule. Consequently, for the purposes of this rule, paragraph (c) of the definition of “associated persons” should be removed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 17 Issue: Definition of “guardian” Submission (7 – ICANZ) To ensure certainty, a definition of “guardian” should be inserted into the provisions relating to the taxation of minor beneficiaries, either by cross-reference to other legislation or preferably by specific definition in the tax law. Comment The minor beneficiary rule applies when a guardian of the minor makes a settlement. The legislation as introduced does not define a guardian. The terms “guardianship” and “guardian” are comprehensively defined in section 3 of the Guardianship Act 1968. It is intended that this meaning will also apply for the purposes of this rule. Officials agree that this intention should be clarified. This should be done by cross- reference to the definition of guardian in section 3 of the Guardianship Act. This is consistent with the approach taken in other legislation, for example the Children, Young Persons and Their Families Act 1989. Under a number of pieces of legislation, however, the chief executive of a government department or the court itself, for example, may be appointed guardian of the child. It is not intended that such a guardian should come within the scope of the minor beneficiary rule. Consequently, such guardians should be specifically excluded from the application of the rule when: • a chief executive has been appointed guardian of the child under section 7(4) of the Adoption Act 1955; • the court (which has declared a child to be in need of care and protection) has appointed the chief executive, an iwi social service, a cultural social service, or the director of a child and family support service to be a guardian of that child under section 110(1)(a)-(d) of the Children Young Persons and their Families Act 1989; • the court has been appointed guardian of the child under section 10B of the Guardianship Act 1968; and • the Public Trustee has been appointed guardian of an infant by an order of the court under Section 53 of the Public Trust Office Act 1957. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. The legislation should be amended to provide that for the purposes of the minor beneficiary rule the definition of “guardian” in section 3 of the Guardianship Act 1968 applies. 18 The legislation should also be amended to provide that a person will not be a guardian for the purposes of the minor beneficiary rule if they have been appointed as guardian under section 7(4) of the Adoption Act 1955, section 110(1)(a)-(d) of the Children Young Persons and Their Families Act 1989, section 10B of the Guardianship Act 1968, or by order of the court under section 53 of the Public Trust Office Act 1957. Issue: Definition of “settlor” Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment is necessary to ensure that a person will not be a settlor if the only settlement they made on the trust consisted of incidental services to the operation of the trust. Comment It is intended that a relative, guardian or associated person will not be a settlor for the purposes of the minor beneficiary rule if the only settlement they made on the trust was the provision of incidental services to the operation of the trust. An example would be if damages for the benefit of the child are settled on a trust and the parent of the child provides free accounting services to the trust. As introduced, the legislation provides that a person will not be a settlor if they provide any services to the trust. This was an oversight. Rather, it should provide that a person will not be a settlor for the purposes of the minor beneficiary rule if the only settlement they made to the trust was of incidental services to the operation of the trust. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Definition of a “minor” Submission ( 4 – Federated Farmers of New Zealand ) For the purposes of this rule a minor should be defined as a person under the age of 15 years. At 15 years, farm children obtain drivers licenses and tend to adopt a mature role in a farming operation. They are likely to commence earning income in their own right. 19 (1 – H B Thomas) The proposed rule is age discriminatory and unfair. Comment The proposed section HH 3A(3) defines a “minor” as a person under the age of 16 years. Officials consider that it is appropriate that the rule should apply to those children under the age of 16 years. From the age of 16 years, individuals are increasingly less dependent on their parents to provide for their needs. Consequently, there is less likelihood that beneficiary income will be used to meet expenses that would otherwise have been met by parents out of their after-tax income. It is from the age of 16 that a person may be in full-time employment, at polytechnic or may be married. While any age has an arbitrary aspect, 16 seems the most appropriate age at which a person can be said to be determining how his or her income is spent. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Definition of a “minor” Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment should be made to the proposed definition of a “minor” in section HH 3A(3) to insert the word “natural” in front of person. Comment It was intended that the rule would only apply to natural persons under the age of 16 years, and not to a company, for example. In order to give effect to this intention, the word “natural” should be added to the definition of a minor in the proposed section HH 3A. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 20 EXCEPTIONS FROM THE RULE Issue: Exception for settlements under a will or intestacy Submission (5 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 7 – ICANZ, 9 – New Zealand Law Society) The proposed section HH 3B(2)(c) provides an exception from the minor beneficiary rule when property has been settled on a trust under the terms of a will, codicil, intestacy or a court variation thereof, if the minor is alive within 12 months of the date of the settlor’s death. The restriction on the exception to minors who are alive within 12 months of the date of the settlor’s death should be removed. It is inappropriate that two minor beneficiaries of a trust created under a will are subject to different tax rates simply because one was alive within 12 months of the death of the settlor, while one was not. (6 – National Council of Women of New Zealand (NCWNZ)) NCWNZ agrees that the proposed rule should not apply where the income is derived from inherited property under the terms of a will, codicil or intestacy. Comment When a person who is meeting the costs of a child dies and settles property under the terms of their will on their child, it is appropriate that the minor beneficiary rule should not apply to this income. It is likely that such a person will be the parent of the child, but in some instances it may be a grandparent or an aunt or uncle of the child who meets expenses of the child. If the settlor is dead, the beneficiary income received by the minor from the trust property is not income the settlor would otherwise have earned him/herself and used to meet the needs of the child, so no tax advantage is gained in meeting the costs of a child by use of a trust. However, in other situations where property is settled on a trust for the benefit of a child under the terms of a will, it is appropriate that the minor beneficiary rule does apply. An unlimited exception for testamentary trusts would enable some families to redirect assets into a trust thereby ensuring that the rule does not apply. This occurs whereby grandparents are requested by parents to place assets (which would otherwise have been left to the parents) in a trust on their death and distribute the income to the children rather than to the parent. An unlimited exception for testamentary trusts would also enable some families to gain a tax advantage by establishing a continuing family trust. The settlor would leave property under the terms of his /her will to a discretionary family trust, with his/her children, grandchildren, great grandchildren and so on as beneficiaries. Instead of income going to one generation and taxed at their marginal tax rate, it could be distributed to their children and used to meet family expenses. 21 Officials consider that the current exception ensures, as accurately as possible, that only the appropriate testamentary trusts are subject to the minor beneficiary rule. The exception for testamentary trusts, by including children alive or conceived at the time of the settlor’s death, ensures that settlements made by a person responsible for meeting the costs of the child are not subject to the rule. It also effectively limits the risk of ongoing family trusts. However, officials recognise the concern raised in submissions that it seems unfair and illogical that one child in a family will not be subject to the rule because they were alive at the time of the settlor’s death, but their younger sibling will be subject to the rule. Consequently, officials consider that the exception should be extended so that it applies if either the minor is alive within 12 months of the date of the settlor’s death, or a brother or sister of the minor is alive within 12 months of the date of the settlor’s death. For the purposes of this rule, brother or sister should include a half-brother or half-sister. Recommendation That the restriction not be removed, but be reduced so that it also applies if a brother or sister, or a half-brother or half-sister of the minor was alive within 12 months of the settlor’s death. Submission (5 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The exception should be extended to situations where a person receives property from a will, codicil or intestacy and subsequently settles this on an inter-vivos trust on behalf of a minor. Comment The minor beneficiary rule will only apply when it is a relative, guardian or their associate who receives property under the terms of a will and settles it on an inter vivos trust for the benefit of a minor. Officials consider that it is appropriate that the rule should apply to beneficiary income in this situation. The source of an asset subsequently settled by a relative, guardian or associate on a trust is irrelevant in determining whether the rule should apply. A parent, for example, who receives property under the terms of a will, can earn income on this asset which will be taxed at his/her marginal tax rate, and which can be used, just like any other income, to meet expenses of the family. By settling this asset on a trust of which the child is a beneficiary, the parent is then able to meet expenses of the family from beneficiary income, and thereby gain a tax advantage. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 22 Submission ( 5 – PricewaterhouseCoopers ) The exception should be extended to situations where property is settled on an inter vivos trust by a settlor in contemplation of his/her death and beneficiary income is distributed to minors from that trust after the settlor has died. Comment The same rationale for excluding some testamentary trusts can also be applied to property settled on an inter vivos trust in contemplation of death where the beneficiary income is distributed after death. However, officials consider that it is not possible to effectively define when a settlement is made in contemplation of death. Extending the exception in this way would add extra complexity to the exception and create difficulty for a trustee in determining whether the exception applies consistently and accurately. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Education trusts Submission (5 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 4 – Federated Farmers of New Zealand (Inc)) Beneficiary income used to fund a minor’s education should be specifically excluded from the minor beneficiary rule. (4 – Federated Farmers) Many farming families use education trusts in order to meet the expenses of a boarding school education for their children. Taxing distributions of beneficiary income to minors at the trustee rate where the trust is for an educational purpose will increase education costs. Comment Officials consider that an exception should not be provided for beneficiary income used to fund a child’s education. Normally, parents meet the costs of their children’s education out of their own after-tax income. Allowing an exception for education trusts provides a tax advantage for parents who meet these costs out of beneficiary income distributed to the child. Furthermore, it would be difficult to define the boundaries of such an exception, as a wide range of costs associated with children could be described as educational, including, for example, many extra-curricular activities. 23 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Minors with special needs Submission (9 – New Zealand Law Society) The Society cannot see any rationale for the exception for a child for whom a child disability allowance is paid. Comment From the initial announcement of this policy, it has been the Government’s stated intention that trusts set up for children with severe disabilities should not be within the scope of this measure. A basis for determining whether a child has a severe disability is eligibility for the child disability allowance under the Social Security Act 1964. This payment is available to caregivers of children who have a physical or mental disability, are in need of constant care and attention because of that disability and are likely to need care for at least 12 months. Consequently, an exception to the rule applies for children in receipt of the child disability allowance. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (5 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The legislation provides an exemption from the minor beneficiary rule for minors for whom a child disability allowance is paid under the Social Security Act 1964. The Government should consider extending this exemption to include minors who are eligible for an allowance, but who, for whatever reason, have not applied for the allowance. The exception should be extended to ensure that the minor beneficiary rule does not apply to any minor who has special needs owing to a physical, mental or emotional condition, and receives beneficiary income from a trust to meet those needs. The Government should conduct a wide review to ensure that the rule will not apply to minors who require additional assistance but who are not eligible for the specific child disability allowance. 24 Comment Officials recognise that some families who would otherwise be entitled to the Child Disability Allowance do not apply for it. However, limiting the exception to children for whom the child disability allowance is paid provides an objective standard against which the exception is based. This is necessary to ensure that the trustees are able to determine whether an exception applies consistently and with minimum compliance costs. Recipients of the allowance are able to provide the trustee with a copy of a letter of entitlement from the Department of Work and Income. Parents of many children face extra costs as a result of the special needs of their child. To provide an exception for all children with some special need would effectively undermine the minor beneficiary rule. The result would be that all families with a trust would be subsidised in meeting whatever extra costs were associated with their children, whereas all other parents would have to meet the additional costs of their child out of their own after-tax income. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Exception for distributions of beneficiary income from the Maori trustee or a Maori authority Submission (9 – New Zealand Law Society) The Society cannot see any rationale for the exception for distributions from the Maori trustee. Comment The Maori Trustee is taxed as a Maori authority except in its capacity as a collection and distribution agent for rents, royalties or interest, in which case the Maori Trustee is taxed as if it were beneficially entitled to the income. The taxation of Maori authorities, including the Maori Trustee, is currently under review. It is appropriate that the taxation of beneficiary income distributed to a minor from the Maori trustee or a Maori authority should be specifically excluded from the minor beneficiary rule pending completion of this review. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 25 Issue: Exception for services rendered by a minor Submission (5 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Beneficiary income of a minor should be excluded from the rule when the trust owns income-producing assets such as a farm or a business and that beneficiary income is in compensation for work or effort performed by those minors on the farm or business. Comment If the beneficiary income received by a child is, in fact, employment income of the child, it should be paid as salary or wages, rather than as a distribution of beneficiary income. It may then appropriately be subject to PAYE and taxed at the marginal tax rate of the minor. A schoolchild who earns a weekly wage of $20 is not required to complete a tax code declaration form, and consequently the employer is not required to deduct PAYE from the child’s wage. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Exception for trusts established in situations of family breakdown Submission (5 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The Government should consider providing an exception for distributions of beneficiary income from a trust used to hold property for the benefit of minors arising from a family breakdown. Comment During the development of the minor beneficiary rule, consideration was given to providing an exception for trusts established in situations of family breakdown. However, an exception has not been provided for two key reasons: (i)such an exception raises the risk of the court process being exploited in order to gain a tax advantage; and (ii)providing an exception is inconsistent with the policy of the minor beneficiary rule. 26 Risk of an increase in court orders and subsequently that the rule would be undermined Such an exception would need to be based on objective criteria in order to prevent the rule being undermined and to enable trustees to apply the exception on a consistent basis. The most appropriate criterion is that of a court order that property be settled on a trust. Under the Matrimonial Property Act 1976 the court has wide powers to make such orders as it considers just in determining shares and in dividing property. The court must, in all proceedings under the matrimonial property legislation, consider the interests of any minor or dependent children of the marriage. These powers include ordering property to be settled on a trust of which the parents and children are beneficiaries. However, if an exception is provided where a trust has been ordered by the court under the Matrimonial Property Act, there is a significant risk that families would be motivated to go through the court process in order to gain the tax advantage. This is a real risk because under the Matrimonial Property Act the court may make orders by consent, provided the discretion is exercised in accordance with the principles of the matrimonial property legislation. Thus either or both spouses may apply to the court for an order that property be settled on a family trust. In addition, the court’s powers are not limited to situations of family breakdown. Orders can also be made by consent in relation to specific property where the parties are living happily together without any contemplation of a separation During the 1980s and early 1990s the courts were considering a significant number of applications for orders placing assets in a family trust, one of the key motivations being an exemption from gift duty. Before 1993, section 75A of the Estate and Gift Duties Act provided an exemption from gift duty for any disposition of property made by any order of the Court under section 25 of the Matrimonial Property Act 1976. The risk of the rule being undermined is increased by the fact that the courts have taken a fairly liberal approach to consent orders vesting matrimonial property in family trusts. In the High Court in Re Roberts \[1993\] NZFLR 731, Gallen J stated that in considering settlements involving children of the marriage, where made by consent orders, the court must be satisfied that the settlement is within the parameters of the Matrimonial Property Act. The fact that the motivation of the trust is to limit tax or duty liabilities will not take a trust outside the scope of the Matrimonial Property Act. Inconsistent with the policy of the minor beneficiary rule The rationale of the minor beneficiary rule is that families should not be able to gain a tax advantage simply because they are able to meet the costs of the family out of distributions of beneficiary income to a minor from a trust, rather than out of their own after-tax income, as is the normal course. 27 There is no policy reason for this tax advantage being available to families that have set up a trust where the parents have separated or divorced, yet not to families where the parents are still together, which would be the result if an exception were provided. Even if gaining a tax advantage was not their motivation for going through the court process, providing an exception in such a situation would still enable parents whose income-earning assets are placed in a court-ordered trust to meet the expenses of the children out of income taxed at the marginal rate of the children. Had it not been for the trust they would have had to meet these same expenses out of the income taxed at their own marginal tax rate. This gives them an advantage over families who have not broken up, and also an advantage over families who have broken up but who have been able to reach an agreement themselves and have voluntarily set up a trust without going through the court process. An exception in this situation can be contrasted with the other exceptions that deal with situations where that income clearly would not otherwise have been earned by the parent or settlor. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Exception for income derived from a group investment fund Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment should be made to the proposed section HH 3B(3) to provide that the exemption from the minor beneficiary rule for income derived by a minor from a group investment fund only applies to income derived directly by the minor from the group investment fund. Comment Section HH 3B(3) currently provides that the minor beneficiary rule does not apply to beneficiary income derived by a minor from a group investment fund. Ordinarily, category B group investment funds and designated group investment funds are taxed as qualifying trusts, and consequently distributions from such a fund to a minor would be subject to the rule. However, given that these group investment funds operate more in the nature of investment entities from which income is earned directly by the child and which are not subject to the rule, it is appropriate that distributions from a group investment fund to a minor are specifically excluded from the rule. 28 The policy intention, however, was that while distributions of beneficiary income from a group investment fund to a minor should not be subject to this rule, the rule should still apply if a family trust invests in a group investment fund and the income earned by this trust from the fund is subsequently distributed to a minor by the family trust. Given that income derived by a trust generally retains its character when distributed as beneficiary income, the current wording may not be sufficient to include such income within the scope of the rule. Therefore the legislation should be amended to make this intention clearer, by providing that the exemption applies only when the income is derived directly by the minor from a group investment fund. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Exception for established fixed trusts Submission (5 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) A grandfathering provision should be introduced to ensure that the minor beneficiary rule does not apply to distributions of beneficiary income to a minor from a fixed trust established before the announcement of the Government’s intention to tax minor beneficiary income at 33%. Otherwise, a minor’s beneficiary income will be subject to the rules in circumstances where tax-motivated income splitting is not present, because there is no discretion or flexibility for fixed trusts to amend the level of distributions. Comment Although discretionary trusts do tend to be favoured for tax-planning purposes, fixed trusts, where each beneficiary’s share in the trust property is precisely defined, can still be used to gain a tax advantage. For example, if the trust deed includes a power of resettlement, once it is no longer advantageous to distribute a particular amount to particular beneficiaries, the assets of the trust can be resettled on another trust. It is therefore appropriate that the minor beneficiary rule apply to fixed trusts as well as discretionary trusts. Whilst many established fixed trusts may not have been motivated by gaining a tax advantage, this will also be the case with some established discretionary trusts. It is not possible in applying the rule to differentiate between those established trusts which were tax motivated and those which were not. Consequently, officials consider that established fixed trusts should not be excluded from the minor beneficiary rule. It is intended that the minimum threshold will exclude from the minor beneficiary rule a significant number of trusts where gaining a tax advantage was not the motivation. 29 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Level of minimum threshold under which beneficiary income is exempt Submission (6 – National Council of Women, 7 – ICANZ, 5 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The legislation provides for a de minimis exemption for beneficiary income of $200 or less. This de minimis level should be increased. (6 – National Council of Women, ICANZ) A more suitable level would be $1,000. (5 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The de minimis exemption should be increased to $10,000. Comment Officials consider that increasing to $1,000 the level of the threshold under which beneficiary income is exempt is consistent with the purpose of the minor beneficiary rule. The rule aims to limit the ability of families to gain a tax advantage by using a trust to meet the expenses of the family. The maximum amount of tax a person would save by distributing $1,000 of income to a minor would be approximately $200 per child. A saving of this amount is unlikely to motivate a taxpayer to establish a trust, given the compliance costs of establishing and managing a trust. By raising the threshold, those trusts that are unlikely to have a tax motivation are removed from the compliance costs imposed by the minor beneficiary rule. However, officials consider that it would be inappropriate to raise the minimum level to $10,000. At this level, the maximum tax saving would be nearly $2,000 per child, which may easily be sufficient to motivate a taxpayer to establish a trust. A further purpose of the exemption is to minimise any uncertainty that exists amongst taxpayers as to whether a child’s bank account operated by his or her parents might be considered to be a trust and therefore come within this rule. In the majority of situations involving a bank account, it is unlikely that there will be any division of legal and beneficial ownership of the trust property – the essential element of a trust relationship. Rather, the income will be earned directly by the child, in which case the minor beneficiary rule will not apply. Given that in the majority of cases the income from a child’s bank account is unlikely to exceed $1,000, increasing the minimum threshold to $1,000 effectively eliminates any uncertainty as to whether the rule applies to such income. 30 Recommendation That the minimum threshold be increased from $200 to $1,000. 31 OPERATIONAL ISSUES Issue: Tax payable by trustee on behalf of the beneficiary Submission (7 – ICANZ) Taxing minor beneficiary income to the trustee, rather than each beneficiary is a cost- effective way of taxing beneficiary income at 33%. However, the legislation should be amended to specifically provide that the tax payable by the trustee is paid on behalf of the beneficiary. Comment For the purposes of the proposed rule, beneficiary income of a minor is taxed as if it was trustee income. However, because this income is for all other purposes beneficiary income, officials agree that the legislation should specifically provide that the tax is paid on behalf of the beneficiary. This enables the trustee to debit the beneficiary’s current account within the trust. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Use-of-money interest on minor beneficiary income Submission (5 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) As a consequence of taxing minor beneficiary income as if it was trustee income, trustees will be liable for use-of-money interest on this income if they underpay their provisional tax. Currently, use-of-money interest is not charged on underpayments of provisional tax where those payments are made by a trustee on behalf of a beneficiary. Consistent with this existing practice, use-of-money interest should not apply to underpayments of provisional tax by trustees in respect of minor beneficiary income. Comment Interest is not charged or paid when a trustee pays provisional tax on behalf of a beneficiary. Only the tax on a trust’s trustee income is subject to use-of-money interest. Use-of-money interest is calculated separately for beneficiaries. Many beneficiaries are “safe-harbour” taxpayers, by whom use-of-money interest is not normally payable. 32 Because minor beneficiary income is taxed as if it was trustee income, and is deemed not to be gross income of the beneficiary, all of the aspects of taxation of trustee income will apply to this minor beneficiary income. That is, it will be taxed at 33%, it will be included in the trustee’s provisional tax calculations along with other trustee income and, consequently, if the trustee underestimates their provisional tax, use-of- money interest will apply. Significant compliance and administrative costs would be incurred if use-of-money interest was not applied to only that portion of the trustee’s provisional tax obligation that related to minor beneficiary income. Trustees would be required to identify what portion of their provisional tax and what portion of the underestimation of provisional tax related to payments of tax on minor beneficiary income and Inland Revenue would be required to apply use-of-money interest only to that other portion. In addition, not applying use-of-money interest to payments of minor beneficiary income would remove the incentive for trustees to estimate their provisional tax liability accurately in relation to minor beneficiary income. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Imposition of penalties and interest on the trustee Submission (5 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Tax penalties and interest should not be imposed on trustees where they have made reasonable efforts to inquire as to the age and status of beneficiaries but have received inaccurate or misleading information. Comment Trustees are subject to the same compliance and penalties legislation that applies to other taxpayers. If the trustee underestimates the amount of tax payable as a result of receiving inaccurate or misleading information from the beneficiary, the trustee will not be liable for any shortfall penalties on that shortfall provided that they took reasonable care in reaching their tax position. In determining whether the trustee took reasonable care, the common law test for negligence (whether a person with ordinary skill and prudence would have foreseen a tax shortfall) is relevant. However, the trustee will still be liable for a late-payment penalty. Currently, a late payment penalty of 5% applies on the failure to meet the due date. This is followed by a monthly incremental penalty of 2% until the date of payment. From 1 April 2001 the incremental penalty will be reduced to 1%. Under proposed amendments to the late payment penalty included in this bill, from 1 April 2002 the initial late payment 33 penalty will be staggered so that a 1% penalty applies on the failure to meet the due date and a further 4% penalty applies if the payment is not made within a week of the due date. Late payment penalties will not be charged if the unpaid tax does not exceed $100. It is appropriate that the late payment penalty should apply if the trustee underestimates the amount of provisional tax payable as a result of receiving the wrong information from the beneficiary, because the late-payment penalty applies to all provisional taxpayers who underestimate their liability, regardless of fault. If the trustee is not a provisional taxpayer, the trustee will generally not be liable to a late payment penalty. If the Commissioner reassesses the amount of tax payable after the original due date for payment, he must then set a new due date for the payment of the increased amount in the notice of reassessment. Consequently, in this situation the trustee will be liable for a late payment penalty only if he/she fails to pay by the new due date. Use-of-money interest will also be payable by the trustee on any underpayment and will be payable by the Commissioner on any overpayment of provisional tax that results from the trustee receiving the incorrect information from a beneficiary. This is appropriate because use-of-money interest is not a penalty. Its purpose is to compensate the Government when tax is unpaid and compensate the taxpayer when tax is overpaid. Interest is imposed in every case where there has been an underpayment of tax. The Commissioner has no discretion to waive interest. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Standard-based shortfall penalties do not apply where the trustee has used reasonable care in reaching his/her tax position. No-fault late payment penalties and use-of-money interest do apply. Issue: Treatment of tax losses Submission (11 – Simpson Grierson Law) Minors will not be able to offset their existing tax losses against their beneficiary income that is subject to the proposed rule. This is retrospective disentitlement and is unjust. Comment The inability of a minor beneficiary to deduct any losses or expenses against his or her beneficiary income is a result of taxing this income as if it was trustee income. As the submission notes, in the development of this policy two options were considered for ensuring that the beneficiary income of minors is taxed at 33%. Option 1 was to tax the beneficiary income as if it was trustee income. Option 2 would continue to tax this income as beneficiary income. Tax would be required to be deducted by the 34 trustee at 33% as agent for the beneficiary, and the minor would include the full amount as income in his or her return with a credit for tax paid at the trustee level. Owing to the significantly greater administrative and compliance costs of Option 2, it was decided that a minor’s beneficiary income would be taxed as if it was trustee income. It is unlikely that a significant number of minors will have tax losses to offset. Minors who do, however, are still able to use their existing tax losses to offset their tax liability that arises on all other income. In addition, taxing as trustee income gives minors the advantage of not having this beneficiary income taken into account in determining whether they have income greater than $60,000 and thus whether the 39% tax rate applies. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Allocation of imputation credits on a minor’s beneficiary income Submission (11 – Simpson Grierson Law) The legislation should be amended to clarify that when a distribution of beneficiary income to a minor includes dividends with imputation credits attached, these imputation credits are allocated to the trustee. The legislation should also be amended to ensure that the fact that these distributions are taxed to the trustee does not adversely affect the allocation of imputation credits to a non-minor beneficiary under section LB 1(3). Comment Officials agree that when a distribution of beneficiary income includes dividends with imputation credits attached, the trustee, who is taxed on this beneficiary income, should also be allocated the imputation credits. This intention can be clarified in the law by providing, for the purposes of determining the allocation of imputation credits, that beneficiary income is to be treated as if it was distributed to the trustee and that the credit is to be allocated to the trustee. As a consequence of such an amendment, the allocation of imputation credits to non-minor beneficiaries under section LB 1(3) will not be adversely affected. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 35 Issue: Mechanism to include beneficiary income of minors Submission (7 – ICANZ) The proposed section HH 3A currently states that the section will apply when a “minor derives beneficiary income”. However, beneficiary income is income that is first derived by a trustee of the trust. The beneficiary does not derive the income – the trustee does. This income may then become beneficiary income if it is paid or applied within six months after the end of the income year or vests in the beneficiary during the income year. It would be more consistent with the scheme of the trust rules to exclude beneficiary income of minors from the definition of beneficiary income in section OB 1. Comment Officials agree that income is first derived by a trustee of the trust and becomes beneficiary income if it is paid or applied to the beneficiary within six months after the end of the income year or vests in the beneficiary during the income year. However, this income is derived by the minor as beneficiary income at the point in time at which it becomes beneficiary income. To refer to the minor deriving beneficiary income is consistent with the scheme of the trust rules. For example, section HH 3(2), which provides that the trustee is liable to tax on a beneficiary’s income, specifically refers to the situation where a beneficiary derives beneficiary income. The proposed rule applies only to that income of a minor that is beneficiary income as defined in section OB 1. Consequently, it would not be appropriate to exclude this income from the definition of “beneficiary income”. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application date of the rule Submission (7 – ICANZ) The legislation as introduced provides that the amendment applies to beneficiary income derived in relation to the 2001-02 and subsequent income years. This wording has created some confusion because beneficiary income can be distributed by the trust up to six months after the end of the trust’s income year. This should be clarified by simply providing the application date is the 2001-02 and subsequent income years. 36 Comment Income earned by the trustee of a trust in an income year will be beneficiary income if it vests in the beneficiary in that income year or is paid or applied to the beneficiary within six months of the trust’s balance date. Thus, as the submission notes, a trust with a 31 March 2001 balance date can pay or apply income of that year up to 30 September 2001, for the trust’s income to be treated as beneficiary income. If this occurs, the beneficiary is taxed in the 2001 income year and not in the 2002 income year, which is the year in which the beneficiary actually receives the income. Officials understand that there has been some uncertainty that the minor beneficiary rule might apply to beneficiary income of the 2000-2001 income year that is distributed within six months after the end of the income year. This is not the intention. Officials consider that the current wording that the rule applies to income derived “in relation to the 2001-02 and subsequent income years” makes this intention clear. Rather, officials consider that this confusion relates to uncertainty as to whether beneficiary income is derived in the same income year as it was earned by the trust. This confusion will be best dealt with by clarifying this point in a Tax Information Bulletin when the legislation is enacted. Recommendation That the submission be declined. P ART II Services-related payments: restrictive covenants and exit inducements 39 SERVICES-RELATED PAYMENTS: RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AND EXIT INDUCEMENTS Introduction The bill proposes that restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments be made taxable. This follows the recommendations in 1998 of the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance to make these payments taxable. As part of the generic tax policy process, the Government released a consultative issues paper proposing changes to the taxation of these payments in June 2000. A restrictive covenant payment is the consideration given for a restriction on a person’s ability to perform services. An exit inducement payment is the consideration given by a prospective employer or contractor to a person to give up a particular status or position. These payments pose a risk to the personal services income tax base because they are non-taxable to the recipient and can be paid in substitution for taxable personal services income (such as salary and wages), and they may be deductible in some cases to the payer. The bill proposes a number of associated amendments, which include: • excluding restrictive covenant payments connected with the sale of a business from the charging provision; • excluding expenditure on restrictive covenants and exit inducements from the rule prohibiting deductions for capital expenditure; and • including restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments to employees within the PAYE rules. The proposed amendments will apply to amounts derived on and after the date of enactment. This will include such amounts derived from arrangements made before the date of enactment. Overview of submissions Six submissions on the restrictive covenant and exit inducement amendments in the bill were made. Three of these submissions were opposed, in principle, to the taxation of these payments. The main technical issue submitted on was the exclusion for restrictive covenant payments connected with the sale of a business. Submissions also expressed significant concerns on the application date, which means that arrangements entered into before the date of enactment are not “grandfathered”, and on whether the operation of the general deductibility provisions in the Income Tax Act would be affected by the amendments. 40 Officials consulted with the makers of two of the most substantial submissions on the proposals, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand and PricewaterhouseCoopers, to discuss aspects of their submissions. The main recommendations by officials to the Committee following submissions are that amendments should be made to the bill to: • Widen the ambit of the sale of business exclusion so it can apply to different forms of business sales. • Remove the use of the GST concepts of “taxable activity” and “going concern”. • Allow the deduction-related amendments to apply to expenditure incurred on restrictive covenant payments before the date of enactment if the payments are derived after the date of enactment and are taxable under the new charging provisions. 41 WHETHER RESTRICTIVE COVENANT AND EXIT INDUCEMENT PAYMENTS SHOULD BE TAXED Issue: General opposition to proposals to tax restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments Submissions (3 – New Zealand Employers’ Federation, 5 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 7 – ICANZ) Three submissions are opposed, in principle, to the taxation of restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments. This opposition arises because such payments are capital receipts under current law and taxing them would result in a shift of the existing capital/revenue boundary. The New Zealand Employers’ Federation considers that the current tax rules for capital and revenue-related payments should be maintained. Where disputes occur the Courts should continue to be the ultimate arbiter of whether payments are of a non- taxable compensatory nature or whether they are income-related and therefore taxable in the hands of the recipients. PricewaterhouseCoopers was opposed to the proposed shifting of the capital/revenue boundary and considered that the amendments should be better directed towards income payments which are “disguised” as capital payments rather than adopting a blanket approach of taxing all services-related payments (other than restrictive covenant payments made on the sale of a business). ICANZ is opposed to the amendments because they “seek to tax capital receipts as if they were revenue”. At the most, the amendments should target only those payments that are substitutes for taxable receipts. Comment Officials do not consider that the amendments to tax restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments should be removed from the bill in light of these submissions. These services-related payments are non-taxable in the hands of recipients, but may be deductible in some cases to the payers. There is a risk to the personal services income tax base resulting from the potential for these non-taxable capital receipts to be substituted for taxable personal services income such as salary and wages. The Government’s position is that it is necessary to shift the current capital/revenue boundary in the case of restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments to protect the personal services income tax base. Officials consider that the proposals to target only payments of an income nature that are disguised as capital receipts would amount to little more than the current law which itself has given rise to the current tax base concern. Such proposals would be too subjective to be effective. They could be circumvented by taxpayers arguing that there had been no reduction in amounts received from the performance of services. It would be very difficult for Inland Revenue to prove that a person would have received 42 an amount in the absence of an arrangement involving a restrictive covenant or exit inducement. Although Inland Revenue can query the amount of any capital receipt, in practice, challenging these payments is problematic because valuation of the underlying rights or property transferred is extremely difficult. It is, therefore, not practicable to distinguish between payments which are not in substitution for taxable income and those that are. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Proposals should be referred to the Tax Review Submission (7 – ICANZ) ICANZ considers that the proposals to tax restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments amount to a fundamental change that should instead be referred to the Tax Review. Comment The Tax Review is more concerned with a high level review of the whole tax system rather than a specific base maintenance measure such as the present. Also, the revenue risk to the personal services income tax base needs to be addressed as soon as practicable. This revenue risk could worsen if consideration of this issue were deferred until it could be considered as part of the work of the Tax Review. The Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance has already considered the tax treatment of restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments and recommended legislation to make these payments taxable. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 43 RESTRICTIVE COVENANT CHARGING PROVISION Issue: Ambit – application to non-individuals Submission (9 – New Zealand Law Society) The charging provision is intended to be targeted at individuals but is capable of affecting undertakings given by other entities such as companies by the use of the wide term “person”. Accordingly, the term “person” should be changed to “individual”. Comment The restrictive covenant charging provision is intended to apply to all persons and not just individuals. Although the main target of the amendment is individuals, it is necessary for the charging provision to apply to all persons because otherwise the charging provision could be readily circumvented. For example, individuals could set up personal services companies and arrange for their companies to provide restrictive covenants to the purchasers of their services, thereby converting what would otherwise be taxable income from services into non-taxable capital receipts. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Ambit – taxing restrictive covenant provider instead of recipient of payment Submission (9 – New Zealand Law Society) The amount derived should remain income of the recipient of the amount, rather than the person who gives the restrictive covenant. Comment It is appropriate that the person who provides the restrictive covenant derives any amount given in consideration for that undertaking. If the legislation targeted only the recipient of the restrictive covenant payment this would open up avoidance opportunities whereby the provider of the restrictive covenant could arrange for an associated person such as a family member who is on a lower marginal tax rate to receive the payment. 44 Clearly, it is within the control of the provider of the restrictive covenant as to who is the recipient of the payment given in consideration for the restrictive covenant by the purchaser. Arguably, that recipient has not derived the payment in his or her own right and instead receives it as agent on behalf of the provider. The legislation puts the issue beyond doubt by providing that the person who gives the restrictive covenant always derives any consideration given for it. Officials do not agree that the example given by the submissioner, involving an employee giving an undertaking to a third party with the payment being received by the employer who pays the amount to the employee, would result in double tax. In the example the employer would seem to have received the amount as agent for the employee and, therefore, it is the employee who has already derived the amount and there is no second layer of taxation when the employer on-pays the amount to the employee. Also, section BD 3(4) of the Income Tax Act 1994 provides that a particular amount of gross income may be allocated only once. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Ambit – targeting only amounts specifically agreed to be paid Submission (9 – New Zealand Law Society) Instead of having the restrictive covenant charging provision based on any amount derived by a person in respect of the restrictive covenant, it should be based on the amount agreed to be paid in respect of the undertaking. Comment Basing the charging provision on the amount specifically agreed to be paid in respect of a restrictive covenant would allow the provision to be readily circumvented. As the submission notes, it could be possible for a restrictive covenant payment to be derived as part of a larger transaction. If the charging provision were dependant on an amount being specifically agreed on, it could be avoided by the parties deliberately choosing not to allocate specifically any part of the total payment under the larger transaction to the restrictive covenant. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 45 Issue: Settlements made in employment disputes Submission (7 – ICANZ) The amendments should contain provision for settlements made in employment disputes and explicitly make them non-taxable. Under a settlement in an employment dispute an employee may agree to accept a termination package in full and final settlement of the dispute. As part of that settlement, the employee may agree not to commence, or, if already commenced, to cease legal proceedings in respect of the dispute. A financial settlement as part of a termination package may be caught by the charging provision because it is an undertaking on behalf of the employee restricting that person’s ability to perform services as an employee for that employer. Comment Officials do not agree that such settlements made in employment disputes would be caught by the charging provision. An employee’s agreement not to commence legal proceedings as part of a termination package does not restrict that person’s ability to perform services as an employee generally. Officials note, in any event, that with the exception of payments for humiliation and injured feelings (made under section 123(c)(i) of the Employment Relations Act 2000), all payments received by an employee as part of a settlement made on termination of an employment relationship would come within the definition of “monetary remuneration”. This definition is drafted in very wide terms and, in particular, includes all compensation for loss of office or employment (other than payments for humiliation and injury to feelings). Given that this bill is not aimed at taxing injury to feelings payments, the amendments do not, therefore, alter the tax treatment of the remaining amounts of any financial settlements made in employment disputes as these are already taxed. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application date Submission (11W – Simpson Grierson) The bill proposes to change the taxation consequences of existing binding contracts entered into, in many cases years ago, where amounts are to be paid in terms of those contracts after the date of enactment. The legislation is therefore unfairly retrospective. 46 The submission refers to the situation where purchasers of restrictive covenants provide consideration in the form of share options. Because the share options do not involve the purchaser in any expenditure, the recipient will be taxable on the value of what is received but the purchaser of the restraint will not obtain a deduction for its opportunity cost. Although it is likely that in future restrictive covenants will not use this type of consideration, existing restrictive covenant contracts will be affected by changing the balance of non-deductibility/non-assessability that underpinned those existing contracts’ pricing. The amendments should therefore apply only to arrangements entered into after the date of enactment. This will remove their present retrospective nature. Comment The restrictive covenant charging provision applies to amounts derived on and after the date of enactment. This will include such amounts derived in respect of arrangements made before the date of enactment. The Government made a decision not to grandfather existing arrangements. Grandfathering would mean that payments made under restrictive covenants entered into before the date of enactment would remain non-taxable in the hands of the recipient. Such agreements could last for many years after the date of enactment. Payments made under such contracts should not remain non-taxable as there is a risk to the personal services income tax base resulting from such payments being substituted for taxable income from services. These amendments have been foreshadowed for a considerable period. Restrictive covenants have been listed as a revenue risk in several recent budgets. In 1998, the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance recommended legislation to make restrictive covenant payments taxable. The issues paper stating the Government’s intention to tax these payments was issued on 30 June 2000. The bill will probably not be enacted until near the end of March 2001. If the amendments applied only to arrangements entered into after the date of enactment, taxpayers would have a significant window of opportunity to enter into long-term restrictive covenant arrangements thereby ensuring a tax-free flow of receipts to the detriment of the personal services income tax base. As the submission itself notes, the issue of restrictive covenants involving share options would probably be a transitional one only as in future restraints will be provided in a form involving the purchaser in making expenditure that would be allowed as a deduction under new section DJ 20. For the reasons set out above, the Government was not in favour of existing arrangements being grandfathered. There is ample precedent for application date provisions to be expressed in terms of applying to amounts derived after the date of enactment. The provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994 are often expressed in terms of applying to amounts derived. Although charging provisions may be expressed to apply to arrangements entered into after the date of enactment this need not always be the case, and often is not. 47 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Placement of charging provisions in the Income Tax Act 1994 Submission (7 – ICANZ) The restrictive covenant and exit inducement charging provisions, proposed to be contained in new subpart CHA, should instead be located at the end of Part C or, alternatively, included in existing subpart CH. Comment New provisions should be located where they best fit the scheme of the Income Tax Act 1994. Officials consider that this is best achieved in the case of the new restrictive covenant and exit inducement charging provisions by locating them in a new subpart (subpart CHA) immediately following subpart CH, which deals with employment- related income. This location better fits the scheme of the Income Tax Act than placing the provisions at the end of Part C following subpart CN (which mainly relates to certain income derived by non-residents). It would also not be appropriate to place the provisions within subpart CH (employment-related income) as the new provisions can also apply to non-employees such as independent contractors and office holders. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 48 EXCLUSION FOR RESTRICTIVE COVENANT PAYMENTS CONNECTED WITH THE SALE OF A BUSINESS New section CHA 1(2) contains a specific exclusion for restrictive covenant payments made in connection with the sale of a business. This exclusion applies only if a number of conditions are satisfied. Submissioners raised a number of issues with the drafting of the exclusion such as the use of GST terminology, not catering for certain forms of business sale, and being unduly restrictive in certain respects. Officials consider that these concerns can be addressed while still preventing the sale of business exclusion being exploited so as to undermine the reform to tax restrictive covenant payments that can be substituted for income from services. Issue: Whether GST concepts should be used Submission (9 – New Zealand Law Society, 10W – Rudd Watts & Stone) The sale of business exclusion should be reworded to remove references to the GST concepts of “taxable activity” and “going concern” and instead simply refer to amounts derived on the sale of a business. Both submissioners were concerned with whether it was intended to use GST time of supply rules for determining the time of the sale of a taxable activity. Even after the 1995 amendments to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act), the going concern concept had caused considerable confusion in the GST arena resulting in substantial litigation. Comment Officials consider that the use of the GST concepts of “taxable activity” and “going concern” in the sale of business exclusion in the restrictive covenant charging provision has resulted in unnecessary confusion. Submissioners are concerned that whether or not a sale of a business is zero-rated for GST purposes (as a sale of a taxable activity as a going concern) could determine whether the sale of business exclusion in the restrictive covenant charging provision is applicable. It was not intended that the sale of business exclusion would employ the zero-rating tests in section 11(1)(m) of the GST Act for the supply of a taxable activity as a going concern. These zero-rating tests require that the supplier and the recipient agree in writing that the supply is of a going concern and that they intend that the supply is of a taxable activity that is capable of being carried on as a going concern by the recipient. Instead, section CHA 1(2) refers only to the “going concern” and “taxable activity” definitions contained in sections 2 and 6 respectively of the GST Act. 49 Officials consider that in order to remove confusion about the application of GST concepts in the sale of business exclusion, the GST concepts of “taxable activity” and “going concern” should be replaced with a simple requirement that the restrictive covenant be connected with the sale of a business. New section CHA 1(3)(a), which provides that, for the purposes of the sale of business exclusion, the sale of a taxable activity as a going concern includes the sale of part of a taxable activity as a going concern, should be amended to provide that the sale of a business includes the sale of part of a business if that part is capable of separate operation. Replacing the GST concepts “taxable activity” and “going concern” with that of the income tax concept of a “sale of a business” addresses a number of the submissioners’ concerns and allows the legislation to be considerably simplified. This can be achieved without allowing the sale of business exclusion to be exploited so as to undermine the reform to tax restrictive covenant payments that can be substituted for income from services. Recommendation That the submissions to remove the GST concepts from the sale of business exclusion and replace them with references to the “sale of a business” be accepted. Issue: Expanding forms of business sale qualifying for exemption Submission (5 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 9 – New Zealand Law Society) The forms of business sale qualifying for the sale of business exclusion from the restrictive covenant charging provision should be expanded. The New Zealand Law Society refers to sale structures involving chains of companies, for example, where the business is being carried on by a subsidiary of a holding company whose shares are being sold, and to sales of businesses that are in trust ownership. PricewaterhouseCoopers refers to the example where a company sells its business but the restrictive covenant is given by its shareholder, the vendor of the business (the company), and the provider of the restrictive covenant (the shareholder) are different persons. Comment The current sale of business exclusion in new section CHA 1(2) caters for two forms of business sale. These are the direct sale by a person of their business and a sale by a person of a company directly owned by them which carries on the business. 50 Officials agree that, subject to certain modifications, the sale of business exclusion from the restrictive covenant charging provision should cater for the forms of business sale referred to in submissions. This can be achieved by making certain minor modifications to the existing provisions. Two amendments are necessary to cater for sale situations involving chains of companies, for example, the sale by a shareholder (who gives the restrictive covenant) of a holding company which owns a subsidiary which carries on the relevant business. First, subsection (3)(b), which provides that the sale of a business includes the sale of all of the shares in a company that is carrying on a business, should be amended so that the company carrying on a business may include another company directly or indirectly wholly owned by the company whose shares are being sold. Secondly, subsection (4), which modifies the application of certain of the conditions in subsection (2) in the case of a sale of shares, and which currently refers to the company whose shares have been sold by person A, will need to be amended to refer to the company in subsection (3)(b) which carries on the relevant business. In relation to the Law Society submission that the sale of business exclusion should also cater for trustee-owned businesses, officials note that this is already the case. In terms of the legislation, there is nothing in section CHA 1(2) that excludes a vendor of a business who is a trustee. Two amendments are necessary to new section CHA 1(2) to cater for the sale of business form submitted on by PricewaterhouseCoopers involving a sale of a business by a company whose shareholder gives a restrictive covenant to the purchaser. First, section CHA 1(2)(a) should be amended to refer to an amount derived by person A in connection with the sale of a business by person A or a person associated with person A. PricewaterhouseCoopers submits that the sale of the business should be allowed to be by any person. Officials consider that the provision would be drafted too widely in this case and the example submitted on would be catered for by allowing the sale of the business to be by an associate of person A. Changing the current reference to person A deriving the amount “as part of the consideration for the sale” to person A deriving the amount “in connection with the sale” is also necessary because the paragraph will provide that the sale can be by an associate of person A as well as by person A itself. (PricewaterhouseCoopers also recommended a change to this “in connection with” terminology but for different reasons that officials do not agree with.) Secondly, section CHA 1(2)(e) should be amended by changing the person A reference to the person referred to in subsection (2)(a) who undertakes the sale of the business. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part. 51 Issue: Requirement that restrictive covenant amount is paid by purchaser to vendor Submission (5 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The requirement in new section CHA 1(2)(c) that the restrictive covenant amount is paid by the purchaser of the business (person B) to the person who gives the restrictive covenant is too restrictive. The requirement does not cover the number of possible permutations of a business sale, for example, the restrictive covenant payment could be sourced from an associate of the purchaser of the business. It is inappropriate for vendors and purchasers to be forced to transact differently in order to bring themselves within the exclusionary criteria for tax purposes. Comment Officials agree that the requirement in new section CHA 1(2)(c) that the purchaser must make the payment to the person who gives the restrictive covenant is unnecessarily restrictive. The other conditions in the sale of business exclusion in section CHA 1(2) are sufficiently robust to prevent the exclusion being exploited. Accordingly, this requirement can be omitted. Recommendation That the submission be accepted by omitting new section CHA 1(2)(c). Issue: Requirement that services not be provided to purchaser after sale of business Submission (5 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 7 – ICANZ, 9 – New Zealand Law Society) The requirement in new section CHA 1(2)(d), which limits the services that the person who gives the restrictive covenant undertaking may provide to the purchaser of the business after its sale, is too restrictive. The provision should be either widened or omitted altogether. Comment New section CHA 1(2)(d) provides that the person who gives the restrictive covenant must not provide any services to the purchaser after the sale of the business, other than services that are incidental to the sale and are temporary in nature. Officials consider that this requirement is crucial to preventing the sale of business exclusion being exploited so as to undermine the reform to tax restrictive covenant payments that can be substituted for income from services. 52 PricewaterhouseCoopers submits that new section CHA 1(2)(d) should not preclude the existence of an “earn out” clause in sale and purchase agreements “which requires the vendor to work in the business for a period of time with a view to transitioning the business to the new owners”. Officials consider that the exception in new section CHA 1(2)(d) applying to services that are incidental to the sale and are temporary in nature already allows such earn out clauses whose focus is to facilitate the transfer of the business to the new owners. This exception should also take account of the other concerns expressed by the submissioner such as the sale price for the business being affected by the profit earned during the transition period and the vendor being a principal participant during the transition period. In particular, the “incidental” reference in the exception relates to the transition period and does not restrict the quantum of services that can be provided during that period. PricewaterhouseCoopers also submits that the exception in new section CHA 1(2)(d) should be widened to allow the purchaser of the business to use the vendor’s services within the business after the sale for an indeterminate period of time. Officials consider that widening the exception in this manner would deny section CHA 1(2)(d) any effect. It would allow the sale of business exclusion to be exploited to undermine the reform. PricewaterhouseCoopers notes that the sale of business exclusion should allow for “genuine” restrictive covenant payments that are not in substitution for a salary. However, it is for the very reason that in practice it is very difficult to distinguish between restrictive covenant payments that are in substitution for taxable income from services and those that are not, that the capital/revenue boundary is being shifted in this particular area to protect the personal services income tax base. The New Zealand Law Society considers that new section CHA 1(2)(d) is too restrictive for two reasons. First, section CHA 1(2)(d) raises the question of whether the GST time of supply rules should be used. This concern has been addressed by the recommendation to remove GST concepts from the sale of business exclusion. Secondly, although limited assistance in the transitioning may have been contemplated by the parties at the outset of the sale, it may subsequently transpire that substantial assistance is in fact required. Accordingly, the Law Society considers that section CHA 1(2)(d) should be drafted on the basis of intention so that it can apply to situations where it was intended at the time of granting the undertaking that only limited services would be provided. Officials are not in favour of such an intention- based test as this would be too subjective in practice. Officials also consider that the Law Society’s concerns are addressed by the current drafting, which allows for substantial assistance to be provided by the vendor so long as it is provided in the context of transitioning the business to the new owner. ICANZ submits that new section CHA 1(2)(d) should be omitted altogether on the basis that an avoidance opportunity does not arise on the sale of a business. As previously noted, officials consider that section CHA 1(2)(d) is crucial to prevent the sale of business exclusion being exploited to undermine the reform to tax restrictive covenant payments that can be substituted for income from services. 53 Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Agreement in writing requirement Submission (9 – New Zealand Law Society) The requirement in new section CHA 1(2)(e) that the vendor and purchaser agree in writing that the transaction is a sale of a taxable activity as a going concern is too restrictive and should be omitted. The requirement gives rise to two problems. First, the parties may not wish to reach an agreement, as it will impact on their GST position. Secondly, the parties may not be New Zealand residents familiar with our GST system. If they fail to insert such a clause, at present merely timing/cash flow implications arise (pay GST on acquisition and obtain a subsequent refund). Having this written requirement for income tax purposes will additionally expose them to a permanent cost. Comment The submissioner’s concerns arise from the present use of GST concepts of “taxable activity” and “going concern” in the sale of business exclusion and would seem to be addressed by the earlier recommendation that these GST concepts be removed and replaced with sale of a business terminology. The written agreement requirement in new section CHA 1(2)(e) reduces the possibility of there being, in practice, a mismatch of tax treatment between the parties to a restrictive covenant agreement. The result of a mismatch would be that no tax is collected on the payment and a deduction is taken by the purchaser of the restrictive covenant. For instance, in the absence of an express agreement the recipient may return the restrictive covenant payment as non-taxable on the basis that the sale of business exclusion applies. However, the purchaser might claim a deduction on the basis that the exclusion does not apply. That is, both parties are interpreting and applying the law differently to the one transaction. This situation could arise despite the requirement in new DJ 20(1) that a deduction is available only for expenditure that is gross income under new section CHA 1. The agreement in writing requirement should prevent such a mismatch occurring. It also provides some evidential support that there has been a bona fide sale of a business. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 54 RESTRICTIVE COVENANT ANTI-AVOIDANCE PROVISION Issue: Whether anti-avoidance rule in new section GC 14F is too extensive Submission (9 – New Zealand Law Society) The anti-avoidance rule is too extensive in that it applies whenever there is an avoidance “effect”, whether or not the parties have intended that effect. Such a broad rule is capable of striking down transactions even though no avoidance was intended. Accordingly, the provision should be either omitted (as any arrangement would be subject to the general anti-avoidance rule in section BG 1) or amended so that it applies only where an arrangement has the “purpose or effect” of avoidance. Comment Officials consider that it is sensible for the anti-avoidance rule in new section GC 14F to apply to an arrangement which simply has an effect (before the application of the anti-avoidance rule) of avoiding the restrictive covenant charging provision. In the case where an arrangement involved a purpose or intention to avoid the charging provision but did not, in fact, have that effect, and the charging provision continued to apply, there would be no reason to apply the anti-avoidance rule. It should not be a requirement before the anti-avoidance rule can apply that the parties must have entered into the transaction with an intention to avoid the restrictive covenant charging provision. The fact that an arrangement has an effect (before the application of the anti-avoidance rule) of avoiding the charging provision should be the main criterion in the application of the anti-avoidance rule. An arrangement that has an effect of avoiding the restrictive covenant charging provision means essentially an arrangement that is contrary to legislative intent. In relation to the comment that any arrangement would be subject to the general anti- avoidance rule in section BG 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, officials consider that specific anti-avoidance provisions such as new section GC 14F are generally easier for taxpayers and Inland Revenue to interpret and apply than the general anti- avoidance provision. Their application is, therefore, more certain. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 55 Issue: Application of anti-avoidance rule to sales of companies Submission (7 – ICANZ) The specific anti-avoidance provision should not be retained because it will minimise the ability of shareholders to receive appropriate value from the sale of their shares. Comment The submission is concerned with the application of the proposed anti-avoidance rule to a specific situation which the rule is designed to address. The situation involves an employee making a restrictive covenant agreement with a wholly-owned company, the shares in which the employee subsequently sells to his or her employer. The submission considers that this situation supports the view that a restrictive covenant of trade is a valuable right that can be validly given and paid for. The existence of a restrictive covenant over employees means that a company is worth more, but the anti-avoidance rule could minimise the ability of shareholders to receive appropriate value from the sale of their shares. Officials consider that the company sale situation involves a non-arm’s-length arrangement whereby an employee enters into a restrictive covenant with his or her own company. If an anti-avoidance rule did not apply, the employee, by subsequently selling the shares in the wholly-owned company to the employer, could transform a payment for a restrictive covenant that substituted for income from services into a payment for shares which may not be taxable under the other provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994. It is necessary, therefore, for a specific anti-avoidance rule to apply to this share sale situation to prevent the restrictive covenant charging provision being avoided with a consequent erosion of the personal exertion income tax base. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Making application of anti-avoidance rule dependent on application of service attribution rules Submission (7 – ICANZ) If the proposed anti-avoidance rule proceeds it should apply only where the service attribution rules in sections GC 14B to GC 14E apply. 56 Comment Officials do not consider that there is any relationship between the proposed anti- avoidance rule and the service attribution rules in sections GC 14B to GC 14E. The application of the former provision should therefore not be dependent on the application of the latter provisions. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 57 EXIT INDUCEMENT CHARGING PROVISION Issue: Specific exclusion for injury to feelings payments Submission (5 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) A specific exclusion should be made to the exit inducement charging provision to provide that injury to feelings payments relating to employment disputes and made under section 123(c)(i) of the Employment Relations Act 2000 are not caught by the charging provision. Comment Officials do not consider that a specific exclusion from the exit inducement charging provision for employment-related injury to feelings payments is necessary because such payments are not caught by the charging provision in the first place. The charging provision will tax any amount derived by a person for a loss of a vocation, position or status, or for leaving a position. The provision does not tax payments for injury to feelings referred to in section 123(c)(i) of the Employment Relations Act 2000 (which is based on former section 40(1)(c)(i) of the Employment Contracts Act 1991). The wording of the draft exit inducement charging provision contained in the issues paper released in June 2000 was specifically amended, in the light of submissions, to ensure that injury to feelings payments were not inadvertently caught by the provision (it never being the intention for such payments to be taxed by this charging provision). This wording change involved replacing the reference to an amount derived “in connection with” a loss with a reference to an amount derived “for” a loss. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Specifying payer of exit inducement Submission (10W – Rudd Watts & Stone) The proposed section CHA 2 should be amended to clarify that exit inducement payments constitute the consideration given by a prospective employer or contractor to a person for giving up a particular status or position. 58 Comment As the submissioner notes, the issues paper released in June 2000 described an exit inducement payment as the consideration given by a prospective employer or contractor to a person to give up a particular status or position. Although this is a correct description of the main target of the charging provision, the decision was made not to identify the payer of the exit inducement in the legislation itself because such specification could result in an unintended narrowing of the provision. Specifying the source of the payment could encourage such payments to be routed through third parties. Also, at the time of derivation of the exit inducement payment the recipient may have begun the new employment or services contract so that the employer or contractor payer could no longer be described as prospective. Therefore, while a reference to a prospective employer or contractor as the source of an exit inducement payment would be an accurate description of the intended policy, such a reference is not necessary to make the charging provision work and could result in an unintended narrowing of the charging provision. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 59 EXPENDITURE INCURRED ON RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AND EXIT INDUCEMENTS Issue: Whether new section DJ 20 affects general deductibility provisions Submission (5 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) There may be certain circumstances where a deduction is available to the payer, irrespective of whether the amount is gross income under either section CHA 1 or section CHA 2. The submissioner asks for confirmation that their analysis of the relationship between the income and deductibility provisions accords with the intention of the proposed provisions. Comment The submissioner sets out an example involving an exit inducement payment made to a non-resident and asks for two questions to be answered. First, is the amount derived by the non-resident still considered to be gross income if it is included within gross income under section BD 1(1) but is subsequently excluded under section BD 1(2)(c) (because it is a foreign-sourced amount and the recipient is a non-resident when it is derived), so that the express relief under new section DJ 20(1) from the capital prohibition rule in section BD 2(2)(e) will be accorded to the payer? Secondly, if the amount is not gross income within the terms of the proposed section DJ 20, do taxpayers default to general principles to determine deductibility? The answer to the first question is “no”. The amount is not gross income for the purposes of qualifying for relief from the prohibition on deductions for capital expenditure under section DJ 20(1). The answer to the second question is “yes”. Although section DJ 20(1) provides a specific relief from the general prohibition for deductions of capital expenditure, it does not constitute a code in relation to whether expenditure on restrictive covenants and exit inducements is expenditure of a capital nature. In particular, the general deductibility rules in section BD 2 are not excluded and still operate normally. Officials can therefore confirm the submissioner’s analysis of the relationship between the income and deductibility provisions. Recommendation That the officials’ response to the submissioner’s questions be noted. 60 Issue: Minor clarification in new section DJ 20(1) Submission (10W – Rudd, Watts & Stone) To ensure that the intent of new section DJ 20(1) is clear on the face of the legislation it should be amended to refer to expenditure incurred by a taxpayer that is gross income of another person. Comment Officials agree with the submissioner that it would be a worthwhile minor clarification of section DJ 20(1) for the provision to refer to “gross income of another person”. Although this is the intent of the provision, the proposed amendment would make this clear on the face of the legislation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Expenditure on services which is of a capital nature Submissions (7 – ICANZ, 9 – New Zealand Law Society) ICANZ considers that the restriction on the deduction allowed under section DJ 20(1) that is contained in subsection (2) is flawed for two reasons. First, because the reforms generally involve shifting from a non-deductible/non-assessable model to a deductible/taxable model, there is no valid reason for restricting deductibility. Secondly, if payments are made for services rendered they will be taxable and subject to the normal rules of deductibility. The New Zealand Law Society considers that the wording of section DJ 20(2) should be amended so that section DJ 20(1) applies only to the percentage extent to which the employee’s monetary remuneration is otherwise deductible. The Law Society also considers that an arbitrary period may need to be stated as to what period is the focus of the enquiry under the provision. Comment The ICANZ submissions do not seem to take into account the policy rationale for new section DJ 20(2), which is to ensure that the deductibility treatment of restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments is not concessionary in comparison with salary and wages. Salary and wages are non-deductible capital expenditure to the extent they relate to work of a capital nature undertaken by recipient employees. If outright relief from the exclusion for capital expenditure was provided under new section DJ 20(1) for restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments, these 61 payments could never be characterised as capital expenditure, even when the work was of a capital nature. Employers could, therefore, prefer to make these payments instead of payments for services if capital works were involved. This rationale – stated in the commentary to the bill – explains why providing for deductibility of restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments in all cases would not be the correct treatment in policy terms. The New Zealand Law Society submission seems to have misconstrued the meaning of section DJ 20(2). The Law Society has difficulty with the wording of the provision because it considers that payments made under sections CHA 1 and CHA 2 are not for services rendered but respectively for restrictions on a person’s ability to perform services or for loss of employment. The focus of new section DJ 20(2) is not on the particular services whose performance is restricted under the restrictive covenant. Instead, the focus is on restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments being substituted for income from services in cases where expenditure on those services would have been of a capital nature because, for example, the services relate to capital works. The provision is anti-avoidance in nature and not expected to have a significant application. However, the provision is necessary to act as a deterrent to employers preferring to make restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments instead of salary and wage payments if capital works are involved. Officials will provide a more detailed explanation of this provision in the Tax Information Bulletin item on these amendments so that it is better understood. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Application date for new section DJ 20 Submission (5 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 10W – Rudd, Watts & Stone) A transitional rule should be enacted to allow taxpayers to deduct expenditure incurred on restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments before the date of enactment of the bill if those payments are subsequently taxed as gross income to another taxpayer under either section CHA 1 or section CHA 2. Comment Clause 8(2) of the bill provides that new section DJ 20 – which contains express relief from the capital prohibition rule for expenditure on restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments – applies to expenditure incurred on and after the date of enactment of the bill. Clause 7(1) of the bill provides that the restrictive covenant and exit inducement charging provisions apply to amounts derived on and after the date of enactment. 62 As the submissions noted, these application date provisions could result in a mismatch in situations where payers incur expenditure on restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments before the date of enactment (and therefore not currently entitled to the relief under section DJ 20) but the payments are derived by recipients after the date of enactment and are gross income under either section CHA 1 or section CHA 2. Therefore payments may be taxable to the payee under either section CHA 1 or section CHA 2 but be non-deductible by the payer. Officials agree with submissioners that this transitional issue should be addressed by amending clause 8(2) of the bill to provide that new section DJ 20 also applies to expenditure incurred on restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments before the date of enactment if those payments are gross income to another person under either section CHA 1 or section CHA 2. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 63 DEDUCTION FOR REFUND OF RESTRICTIVE COVENANT PAYMENT Issue: Application of section DJ 21 Submission (10W – Rudd, Watts & Stone) New section DJ 21 should apply to employees only. The provision is only necessary to provide a deduction in respect of refunds of restrictive covenant payments made by employees because section BD 2(2)(c) – which prohibits a deduction for expenditure incurred in deriving income from employment – would otherwise deny employees such a deduction. However, independent contractors and office holders would be able to claim a deduction for the cost of refunding a restrictive covenant payment under the general deductibility provisions in section BD 2(1)(b)(i) and (ii) without recourse to section DJ 21. It is more appropriate for independent contractors and office holders to claim deductions under the general deductibility provisions and a specific deduction provision such as section DJ 21 is unnecessary for such persons. Comment New section DJ 21(1) allows a deduction to persons who have been taxed on a restrictive covenant payment if they are required to refund part or all of that payment because they do not comply with the terms of the restrictive covenant. Officials agree with the submissioner that it is only necessary for section DJ 21 to apply to employees. Independent contractors and office holders can have recourse to the general deductibility provisions to claim a deduction for the amount of any refund of a restrictive covenant payment that they are required to make because of breach of a term of the restrictive covenant. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Minor amendment to section BD 2(2)(c) Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section BD 2(2)(c) should be amended to include an exception for the deduction allowed to employees under new section DJ 21(1) for a refund of a restrictive covenant payment. 64 Comment Section BD 2(2)(c) in the core provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994 prohibits a deduction for expenditure incurred in deriving income from employment. By virtue of the amendment made by clause 24(2) of the bill to the definition of “extra emolument”, restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments derived by employees constitute income from employment for the purpose of section BD 2(2)(c). It is desirable to amend section BD 2(2)(c) to include an exception for the deduction allowed to employees under new section DJ 21(1). Recommendation That an amendment be made to clarify the relationship between section BD 2(2)(c) and section DJ 21(1). Issue: Restrictions on deductions allowed under new section DJ 21(1) Submissions (7 – ICANZ, 9 – New Zealand Law Society, 10W – Rudd, Watts & Stone) The restrictions contained in subsections (2) and (3) of section DJ 21 on the deduction allowed under subsection (1) for a refund of a restrictive covenant payment should be removed or apply only to employees. Comment Section DJ 21(2) provides that the deduction allowed under subsection (1) is limited to the lesser of the amount that is refunded and the amount that was taxed under the restrictive covenant charging provision. Section DJ 21(3) provides that a deduction is also not allowed under subsection (1) for any payment in respect of punitive or exemplary damages, interest or the legal costs or other expenses of the person who paid the restrictive covenant amount to the person claiming the deduction. It is important to note that the restrictions contained in section DJ 21(2) and (3) only limit the deduction allowed under subsection (1) for any refund of a restrictive covenant payment. Submissioners were concerned that the restrictions may limit the deductions allowed to an independent contractor under the general deductibility provisions in section BD 2(l)(b)(i) and (ii). This view misconstrues the effect of those restrictions because they do not, in fact, affect the operation of the general deductibility provisions. This non-derogation should address most of the concerns expressed by submissioners. Limiting the application of the deduction allowed under section DJ 21(1) to employees, as recommended above, should also help to address submissioners’ concerns because it makes it even clearer that the operation of the general deductibility provisions is not affected by the restrictions contained in section DJ 21(2) and (3). 65 Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Timing of deduction for refund made when restrictive covenant breached Submission (5 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) New section EO 6, which governs the timing of the deduction allowed under section DJ 21, should be amended to allow the defaulting person to claim a deduction in either the income year in which the restrictive covenant payment was returned or the income year in which the payment is refunded. Comment In the light of the recommendation above that the deduction allowed under new section DJ 21(1) should apply only to employees, it is the appropriate income tax treatment that the deduction is allowed only in the income year that the refund is paid, and not in an earlier period if the restrictive covenant payment was returned in that earlier period. This is because employees are taxed on a cash basis under the Income Tax Act. Accordingly, because employees have to return income only in the year that it is paid to them, it is appropriate that a deduction is allowed only in the year that refunds are made by them. This treatment for employees has the advantage of not having to re-open prior year returns. Also, employees are generally not exposed to the provisional tax and use-of- money interest rules because the tax on their employment income (including restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments by virtue of the proposed amendment to the “extra emolument” definition in section OB 1) has been deducted at source. The precedent for re-opening previous year returns in the foreign investor tax credit rules cited by the submissioner applies only to companies which are taxed on an accruals basis and is, therefore, not relevant to employees. Recommendation That the submission be declined. P ART III Other changes to Income Tax Act 1994 69 OVERSEAS STAKE MONEY Submission (Matter raised by officials) The exemption of overseas stake money from income tax should apply retrospectively from the 1995-96 income year. Comment The amendment to section CB 9 of the Income Tax Act exempts stake money won from a horse race, trotting race or dog race held outside New Zealand with effect from the 2001-02 income year. The racing industry has voiced concern regarding the application date of the amendment. It is concerned that there is uncertainty around whether Inland Revenue would require income tax to be paid on overseas stake money won in the recent past. After consultation with the Industry, Inland Revenue has determined that the application date that would alleviate the concerns of the racing industry would be the income year beginning on 1 April 1995. Backdating the amendment would bring the legislation into line with past practice and as this practice is continued there are no revenue or compliance implications. Recommendation That the amendment apply from the 1995-96 income year. 70 TREATING EXCEPTED ARRANGEMENTS AS FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section EH 13 should be amended, with application from 20 May 1999, so that the right to treat certain excepted financial arrangements as financial arrangements applies to all arrangements entered into between the taxpayer’s last balance date and 20 May 1999. Comment When the new accrual rules were introduced, some financial arrangements (such as an interest-free loan) were listed as excepted financial arrangements with retrospective effect. The retrospective effect was considered unfair if taxpayers had entered into these arrangements under the old accrual rules with the expectation that they would be treated as financial arrangements. Section EH 13 was introduced, therefore, to allow these taxpayers to continue treating these arrangements as financial arrangements. It appears, however, that the right of election does not currently apply to arrangements entered into between the taxpayer’s last balance date and the filing date. This is contrary to the policy intention, which allows the right of election to apply to arrangements entered into before 20 May 1999, the date of enactment of the new accrual rules. As this is a minor amendment needed to reflect the original policy intention, it should apply with retrospective effect from 20 May 1999. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 71 TREATY OF WAITANGI FISHERIES COMMISSION Submission (7 – ICANZ) The wording of clause 14 should be clarified to exclude distributions that are not in relation to the allocation of assets but are made in the course of managing the Commission until all of its assets are allocated. Comment Officials consider that the Commission would not be making distributions of assets as part of the normal course of managing the operations of its business. The fisheries assets can only be distributed as part of the fisheries allocation process and not as part of managing the Commission’s operations. Accordingly, we do not see the need for this change. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 72 INTERNATIONAL TAX – REMEDIAL ISSUES Issue: Technical drafting issues Submission (10W – Rudd Watts & Stone) The proposed amendment to section NG 9(1)(b) does not achieve its intended result that conduit relieved non-cash taxable bonus issues are only subject to 15% NRWT. Comment In particular, the submissioner notes that: • The portion of the taxable bonus issue which carries conduit tax relief credits should be excluded from item (e)/. By including the portion of the dividend which is conduit relieved in both item (e) and item (g) of that formula, the amendments actually impose a rate of NRWT in excess of 30%. • The formula in clause 23(2) should be amended to (a x e) + (c x (f + g)) to ensure that the NRWT treatment of bonus issues is the same as the treatment accorded the equivalent cash dividend. • Item ‘g’ in the formula in proposed section NG 9(1)(b) should read: “g is the amount of the dividends, to the extent fully conduit tax relief credited plus the conduit tax relief additional dividends paid in respect of the taxable bonus issue as a result of Part LG.” Officials agree with the submissioner’s comments and, to achieve the desired outcome, have consulted with them on alternative drafting of the amendments. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 73 DEFINITION OF “QUALIFYING PERSON” FOR FAMILY ASSISTANCE – REMEDIAL AMENDMENT Submission (Matter raised by officials) The definition of “qualifying person” in section KD 3 should reflect the changes in the bill to the definition of “qualifying person” in section OB 1. Comment The bill amends the definition of “qualifying person” in section OB1 to ensure that a qualifying person is tax resident in New Zealand before they qualify for family assistance. This change will stop a potential loophole whereby full family assistance could be claimed by a non-resident who had been in New Zealand for a period of 12 months some years ago. The equivalent change should also be made to the definition of “qualifying person” in section KD 3(1) for family tax credit purposes. Amending section KD 3 will also close the loophole with respect to the family tax credit. Recommendation That the definition of “qualifying person” in section KD 3 be amended in the same way as the definition in section OB1. 74 TAX SIMPLIFICATION – MINOR REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS Issue: Income statements for all taxpayers Submission (7 – ICANZ) All taxpayers should receive an income statement for each income year. Comment ICANZ states that automatically issuing an income statement to every taxpayer would: • give them reassurance that they had paid the right amount of tax; • reduce anxiety for those who would have to contact the Inland Revenue Department to confirm their statement; and • decrease administration costs by reducing the number of telephone calls received by the department. ICANZ made the same submission in 1999 to the Finance and Expenditure Committee as part of the committee’s deliberations over the Taxation (Simplification and Other Remedial Matters) Bill. Issuing income statements to all eligible taxpayers would bring many more taxpayers into the system than are currently in it, increasing compliance costs for many and administrative costs for Inland Revenue. The compliance costs include the psychological costs incurred by many people when they receive correspondence from Inland Revenue and must actively consider their tax affairs. In the past Inland Revenue issued around 1.45 million annual IR 5 tax returns, of which 1.2 million were returned. To date around 460,000 income statements have been issued, of which only around 135,000 were requested by taxpayers. About one million taxpayers would have to be contacted by Inland Revenue if this recommendation were implemented. Inland Revenue considers that the newness of the process has resulted in a higher number of contacts by taxpayers than was planned for, but expects the number of contacts to diminish over time as taxpayers become familiar with the new system. This change in behaviour has been evidenced in recent studies. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 75 Issue: Direct crediting of refunds of excess tax Submission (Matter raised by officials) The application date for the new definition of “tax” in section 184A(5) of the Tax Administration Act as implemented by the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000 should be changed to on and after 1 April 2000. Comment The definition of “tax” in section 184A of the Tax Administration Act was replaced to allow refunds for rebates to be paid directly into taxpayers’ bank accounts. That amendment incorrectly applies to the 1999-2000 and subsequent income years and therefore can apply from 1 April 1999 for standard balance taxpayers. However, section 184A was originally inserted into the Tax Administration Act with application on and after 1 April 2000. The change suggested by the submission corrects an oversight and does not amend policy. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 76 MINOR REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section ED 4(3)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1994 should be amended to update its reference to previous section 21(3) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Comment Section ED 4(3)(a) still contains a reference to previous section 21(3). This should be changed to refer to section 21I(1) – (3). Recommendation That the reference to previous section 21(3) in section ED 4(3)(a) be changed to a reference to section 21I(1) – (3). Submission (Matter raised by officials) The definition of “excepted financial arrangement” in section EH 14(d) of the Income Tax Act 1994 should be amended to refer to section EH 12, instead of to EH 10. Comment The definition of excepted financial arrangement in section EH 14(d) refers to an election in accordance with section EH 10 to treat a short-term trade credit as a financial arrangement to which the qualified accruals rules apply. Before the enactment of the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999, this election was contained in section EH 10, but is now contained in section EH 12. Owing to an omission at the time, this section reference was not changed accordingly. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (Matter raised by officials) Paragraph (a) of the definition of “partner” and “partnership” should be repealed. 77 Comment Section OB 1, paragraph (a) of the definition of “partner” and “partnership” contains an incorrect cross-reference to section DZ 4. The correct reference, section DZ 6, applies the definitions of “partner” and “partnership” to shares or an interest in an asset, rather than containing actual definitions of “partner” and “partnership” itself. Officials therefore consider that paragraph (a) should be repealed from the date of the bill’s enactment. Recommendation That paragraph (a) of the definition of “partner” and “partnership” be repealed. P ART IV Changes to Tax Administration Act 1994 81 REMEDIAL CHANGE TO SECTION 25(6) Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment should be made to section 25(6) of the Tax Administration Act to provide clarification that Inland Revenue can require payers of resident withholding tax (RWT) to provide their tax file numbers on RWT Deduction Certificates. Comment As part of changes under the Taxation (Simplification and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1998, section 25(6) was replaced with an amended section. This change removed a paragraph that could require payers of RWT such as banks and other financial institutions to provide their tax file number on a RWT Deduction Certificate along with the required tax file number of the recipient of the interest such as a bank account holder. Owing to this change, there is some confusion over the requirement on payers to provide their tax file number on such certificates. In practice, payers have continued to provide this information. However, some have queried the legislative authority for the information to be required. Payers of RWT often have multiple entities and tax file numbers, and therefore it is important for matching and processing purposes to require the payer to note the appropriate number. For example, this allows more timely processing of refunds or queries from taxpayers as the RWT payer can be quickly identified. Recommendation That section 25(6) be amended to legitimise current practice and clarify that RWT payers are required to provide their tax file numbers on RWT Deduction Certificates that they provide. 82 TAX SIMPLIFICATION FOR BUSINESS Issue: Phased application of the initial late payment penalty Submission (9 – New Zealand Law Society) The reference in clause 28(3) to section 139(2A) should be section 139B(2A). Recommendation That the submission identifies a typographical error and should be accepted. Submission (7 – ICANZ, 9 – New Zealand Law Society) The implementation date of the new staggered application date of the initial late payment penalty should be brought forward to: • 1 July 2001 (Law Society); • 1 April 2001 (ICANZ). Comment The planned application date is 1 April 2002. Considerable systems changes are required to implement this initiative. In order to bring forward the implementation date for this proposal it would be necessary to reprioritise Inland Revenue’s existing commitments to implement other proposals considered more urgent, such as the changes for student loan borrowers, and the introduction of the optional fringe benefit tax multi-rate rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 83 Submission (7 – ICANZ) The initial late payment penalty should be reduced from being a 5% penalty to a 3% penalty, and use-of-money interest should not apply until the whole penalty is applied. Comment The initial late payment penalty is designed to provide a clear incentive to pay tax on the due date. The quantum of the penalty is set so that it is significant enough to create a preference for paying Inland Revenue over trade creditors, and complying taxpayers can see that non-compliance is punished. However, penalties should not exceed the levels necessary to achieve their objectives. The penalty structure proposed in this bill is designed to support the original due date while not overly penalising those who inadvertently pay just a few days late. Reducing the quantum of the second phase of the penalty would undermine the objectives of the penalty. Use-of-money interest is not charged as a penalty but instead compensates the Government for not having the use of the overdue tax payment and to encourage taxpayers to pay the right amount at the right time. Delaying the exposure to interest until the time that the second phase of the initial late payment penalty is imposed may make it simpler for taxpayers to calculate the total amount owed. However, it will remove the incentive on taxpayers who miss the due date not to delay their payment further. It would also prevent the Government from being adequately compensated for the loss in the use of its money. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 139B should be amended to: • prevent the second phase of the initial late payment penalty from applying if taxpayers meet the terms of their instalment arrangement; and • enable taxpayers who are subject to compulsory deductions, whether in one or more payments, to be eligible for cancellation of penalties, as are those with instalment arrangements. As a consequential change to the above, section 183B should be repealed, and amendments made to sections 3(1), 125 and 138E of the Tax Administration Act. Section 183B should be consequentially amended to follow changes that mean instalment arrangements can be for one instalment. 84 Comment If a taxpayer enters into an arrangement to pay a debt or if the Commissioner has exercised powers to have the debt repaid by compulsory deductions, the taxpayer is entitled to have 60% of the initial late payment penalty and incremental late payment penalties cancelled under this section 183B. The arrangement must have been agreed to before the tax was due, and all its terms must be met before this cancellation can take place. The proposals in this bill to cancel incremental penalties make parts of section 183B that address the cancellation of incremental penalties redundant. It was also intended that taxpayers on behalf of whom compulsory deductions are being made should be eligible for the cancellation of penalties, similarly to those who have entered into instalment arrangements. The phasing of the initial late payment penalty would mean that taxpayers would be entitled to a 60% cancellation of each phase of the penalty. Preventing the application of the second phase of the initial late payment penalty would be a simpler alternative that would also create a larger incentive for taxpayers who anticipate not being able to meet a tax payment to enter into an instalment arrangement before the tax is due. The current drafting of the provision anticipates that two or more instalments will be payable under an arrangement. However, some taxpayers enter into arrangements to repay overdue tax in one instalment. It would create inequities if these taxpayers had penalties imposed before they are required to pay the debt. Recommendation That the submission be accepted and the redrafted consequential amendment apply from the same time that the primary changes take effect. Issue: Serious hardship and financial difficulty Submission (Matter raised by officials) The application date for the new definition of “tax” for the purposes of sections 176 and 177 of the Tax Administration Act as amended by the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000 should be changed to on and after 1 April 2001. Comment The types of taxes that are eligible for relief under sections 176 and 177 of the Tax Administration Act were extended from income tax and fringe benefit tax to include all taxes by the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act. 85 At introduction, this proposal was intended to apply to tax payable on or after the 2001-2002 income year. Following submissions it was decided that the extension should apply to all applications for relief made after 1 April 2001. This submission addresses potential confusion over the application date of the new definition to ensure that tax debt incurred before 1 April 2001 can be the subject of relief. The application date for the new definition of “tax” for the purposes of the provisions that provide relief in the case of serious hardship or financial difficulty is for the 2000 – 2001 and subsequent income years. This has the potential to create confusion over whether tax debt incurred before 1 April 2001 can be the subject of relief . The changes suggested by the submission clarify the legislation to ensure that taxpayers with tax debt incurred before 1 April 2001 will be eligible to apply for relief. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Aligning tax payment dates Submission (7 – ICANZ) Tax payment dates should be aligned to the seventh day of the month. If it is decided not to align payment dates, the reasons for not doing so should be reported. Comment ICANZ points out that a number of reviews of compliance costs have made recommendations to investigate the merits of aligning payment dates. It considers that aligning payment dates will reduce the number of dates that taxpayers must remember and separate the time that tax is paid from the time that trade creditors are generally paid. It also points out that not aligning payment dates because of the effect on poorly organised taxpayers penalises well-organised taxpayers. Options to align payments were considered in the discussion document Less Taxing Tax . The response to the proposal was mixed. While the proposal was favoured by large, well organised businesses, small businesses were strongly opposed to aligning payment dates. They were concerned that the effect on cash flow of large consolidated payments would jeopardise the viability of their businesses or impose extra budgeting costs. Other options to reduce the compliance costs caused by multiple payment dates will be outlined in a discussion document planned for release later this year. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 86 SHORTFALL PENALTIES ON REFUNDS Submission (Matter raised by officials) Sections 141E(1)(d), (e) and 141E(3) should be corrected to apply in cases where the taxpayer attempts to obtain a refund or payment of tax. Comment Section 141E(1)(d) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 imposes a shortfall penalty for evasion of 150 percent in cases where taxpayers obtain a refund or payment of tax knowing that that they are not lawfully entitled to it. Section 141E(1)(e) imposes a similar penalty if a taxpayer enables another person to obtain the refund or payment of tax knowing that that they are not lawfully entitled to the refund or payment. However, if, for example, someone attempts to obtain a refund knowing that they are not entitled to it, but the refund is halted by Inland Revenue, a penalty for evasion is not imposed simply because Inland Revenue does not make the refund. The position that a taxpayer may attempt evasion and not be subject a penalty if Inland Revenue detects that evasion represents a significant deficiency in the tax legislation. All taxpayers who knowingly seek to obtain a refund or payment to which they are not lawfully entitled should be subject to the evasion penalty. Taxpayers should not benefit from the department’s actions which result in the refund or payment not being made. The legislation as currently presented does not reflect its underlying intent. Penalties for attempted evasion have always been part of the tax system. Sections 141E(1)(d), (e) and 141E(3) should be corrected to re-establish that in cases where the taxpayer attempts to obtain a refund or payment of tax, an evasion penalty can be imposed. The amendment should apply from 1 April 1997, the date the compliance and penalties legislation took effect, apart from cases where the taxpayer has been advised by the Commissioner that a penalty for evasion cannot be imposed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. P ART V Changes to Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 89 APPROVED ISSUER LEVY Issue: Registered securities held by residents Submissions (9 – New Zealand Law Society, 10W – Rudd Watts & Stone) Approved issuer levy (AIL) should not be payable on interest paid in respect of a registered security, which is held by a New Zealand resident. Comment The submissions note that the proposed amendments require an approved issuer to pay AIL on any interest payments to a non-associated person in respect of a registered security, regardless of whether the payee is a New Zealand resident or non-resident. As a result, an interest payment made to a New Zealand resident holder of a registered security would be subject to AIL as well as resident withholding tax. The intention of the proposed amendments was simply to allow the compliance and penalty rules to apply to late payments of AIL. It was never the intention to subject a resident holder of a registered security to AIL, as a deduction of resident withholding tax is the correct treatment in that case. Officials agree, however, that the current amendments do have the unintended effect of requiring AIL to be paid on interest paid in respect of a registered security, which is held by a New Zealand resident. Officials have consulted with the submissioners on an alternative drafting of the amendments. Both officials and submissioners are now happy that the new amendments will result solely in late payment of AIL being subject to the compliance and penalty rules and not make residents with registered securities liable for AIL. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Mandatory payment of AIL on registered securities Submissions (9 – New Zealand Law Society, 10W- Rudd Watts & Stone) AIL should not be mandatory if a security is registered. Investors should have the choice between having AIL paid or NRWT deducted in respect of interest paid to them on registered securities. 90 Comment The submissioners note that while the intention of AIL was that it was a choice subject to strict conditions, it was a choice nonetheless. They note that the current amendments remove this choice and require AIL to be paid on all registered securities. The intention of the proposed amendments was simply to allow the compliance and penalty rules to apply to late payments of AIL. While it was never the intention to make the payment of AIL obligatory, officials agree that the proposed amendments do have this unintended effect. Officials have consulted with the submissioners on an alternative drafting of the amendments. Both officials and submissioners are now happy that the new amendments will simply result in late payment of AIL being subject to the compliance and penalty rules and not make the payment of AIL obligatory if a security is registered. Recommendation That the submission be accepted Issue: Extension of the $500 annual threshold for six-monthly payments of approved issuer levy Submission (12W – MS and MA Douglas) Even with a $500 annual threshold, the compliance costs for monthly payments of small sums are still extremely high. The submission recommends that either the threshold level be increased to $2500 or the basis on which the threshold is set be based on the value of the registered security. The threshold value recommended is $1.5 million at current interest rates. Comment Both the resident and non-resident withholding tax rules allow six-monthly payments when the expected annual payments are less than $500. As AIL is set at 2% versus 19.5/33/39% for RWT or 10/15/30% for NRWT, the proposed amendments will allow six-monthly payments on a much higher underlying principal than is the case for RWT or NRWT. Thus although the $500 threshold for AIL was set to be consistent with provisions in the RWT and NRWT rules, it is in fact already more generous than the $500 thresholds in those rules. Officials are, therefore, unable to support any extension of the $500 threshold currently proposed in the bill. 91 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Part VI Changes to GST Act 1985 95 MINOR REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS A number of changes are proposed to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to correct minor drafting errors and oversights in the reforms to the GST Act recently enacted by the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000. These changes apply from the date of enactment of the original amendments, to ensure that the policy intent of the changes is achieved. Issue: Vouchers A number of minor remedial amendments are required to rules concerning the treatment of tokens, stamps, and vouchers (vouchers). The legislation in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 allows taxpayers the option to recognise GST on the supply of a voucher either when it is issued or when it is redeemed. In designing the rules officials consulted with retail groups to ensure the efficacy of the rules. The intention was to simplify the treatment of voucher transactions by aligning the treatment of voucher transactions with the general time of supply rule, being the earlier of invoice or payment. However, where the change created significant compliance costs such as in multi-party retail arrangements involving the supply of vouchers, the legislation allowed the option for those taxpayers to maintain those arrangements. Officials have since been informed that some aspects of the legislation in the GST Act are not achieving their policy intent. Officials recommend that the following minor remedial amendments be made to sections 5(11D) – 5(11G) of the GST Act. The amendments will apply from 10 October 2000, the date when the original amendments (as contained in the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions Act) 2000) came into effect. Officials recommend a retrospective date because it is clarifying the original intent and is taxpayer friendly. Submission (Matter raised by officials) Potential double taxation of voucher transactions Comment If a taxpayer elects to recognise GST on the supply of a voucher at the time of redemption, the issue of a voucher is disregarded by the Act. GST is payable when the voucher is redeemed for goods and services. The rules were designed to ensure that GST was only payable once. Concerns have been raised that the wording of the recent amendments may create the situation where, although the issue of a voucher maybe disregarded, a subsequent sale of the voucher by the person to whom the voucher was issued will be treated as a supply and subject to GST. This potential for double taxation was not intended. 96 Recommendation That sections 5(11D) to 5(11G) be amended, with effect from 10 October 2000, to ensure that there are only two alternative points at which the supply in relation to a voucher is recognised – either at the time the voucher is supplied to a customer for the purpose of redemption or at the time the voucher is redeemed for goods and services. Submission (Matter raised by officials) Meaning of the word “redemption”. Comment If a taxpayer elects to recognise GST on the supply of a voucher at the time of redemption, the issue of a voucher is disregarded by the Act. GST is therefore due when the voucher is redeemed for goods and services. The legislation, however, does not qualify the reference to “redemption” with the words “for goods and services”. There is a possible argument, therefore, that the legislation could require GST to be paid again when the participating retailer who supplied the goods and services in exchange for the voucher returns the voucher for reimbursement from the person who issued the voucher (or other person, depending on the arrangement). Recommendation That reference to the word “redemption” in section 5(11G) be clarified, with effect from 10 October 2000, by adding the words “for goods and services”. Submission (Matter raised by officials) Meaning of the words “not practical”. Comment The preferred treatment of transactions involving the supply of vouchers is to recognise GST when the voucher is issued. Consultation with interested parties at the time that the policy was being developed highlighted that it would be difficult for some arrangements involving the retail sale of vouchers to comply with the preferred treatment. These concerns were addressed by allowing taxpayers the option to recognise GST when a voucher was redeemed. However, this option may only be used if it is “not practical” to comply with the preferred treatment. Concerns have been raised regarding the interpretation of the words “not practical” and whether in some cases it could unjustifiably require taxpayers to change longstanding arrangements and account for GST when a voucher is issued. 97 Recommendation Amend section 5(11G), with effect from 10 October 2000, to ensure that the words “not practical” do not unreasonably prevent taxpayers from accounting for GST at the time of redemption when a voucher is redeemed for goods and services. The amendment clarifies that when the issuer of a voucher and the person supplying the goods and services in exchange for the voucher are not the same, the taxpayers may elect to recognise GST at the time of redemption rather than issue. The application of the amendment will still require that there be an agreement between the taxpayers to this effect or that they are party to such an agreement. Issue: Amendment to section 2A of the GST Act Submission (Matter raised by officials) The test for associating a trustee and a settlor of a trust in section 2A of the GST Act should be amended not to apply if the trustee is a charitable or non-profit body. Comment Section 2A of the GST Act contains the definition of “associated persons” which applies for the purposes of various operative provisions in the GST Act. Subsection (1)(g) contains a new test which associates a trustee of a trust and a settlor of the trust. A settlor of a trust is widely defined to include any person who provides anything to a trust for less than market value. The wide ambit of this definition is necessary to prevent the trustee-settlor associated persons test being circumvented. However, the definition of “settlor” could result in a donor to a trust which is a charitable or non- profit body being associated with that body. This could also affect the application of the tripartite test in subsection (1)(i), which associates two persons who are each associated with the same third person. This result was not intended and it is therefore appropriate to amend the trustee-settlor associated persons test so that it does not apply if the trustee is a charitable or non- profit body. This would be consistent with a similar exception applying for charitable and non-profit bodies in the test in subsection (1)(f) which associates a trustee and a beneficiary of a trust. Recommendation That the test associating a trustee and a settlor of a trust in the definition of “associated persons” in section 2A of the GST Act be amended not to apply if the trustee is a charitable or non-profit body. 98 Issue: Amendment to 5(13A) of the GST Act Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 86(7) of the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000 should be retrospectively repealed. Comment Section 86(7) incorrectly amended section 5(13A) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to replace the words “by that registered person’s taxable activity” with the words “by the person in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity”. Section 5(13A) actually contained the words “by that registered person in the course or furtherance of that person’s taxable activity”. The amendment was therefore both incorrect, in that it purported to replace non-existent words, and unnecessary, and should be retrospectively repealed. Recommendation That section 86(7) of the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000 be repealed with effect from 10 October 2000. Issue: Amendment to section 11(1)(f) of the GST Act Submission (Matter raised by officials) The word “or” in section 11(1)(f) should be replaced with “and” and the word “either” should be omitted. Comment Section 11(1)(f) is intended to zero-rate goods that would have been exported but for their death, destruction and so forth under circumstances outside the control of both the exporter and the purchaser – for example, by an “act of God” such as a landslide. The provision currently refers to circumstances “...beyond the control of either the supplier or the recipient...”. This should be retrospectively changed to circumstances “...beyond the control of the supplier and the recipient...”. 99 Recommendation That section 11(1)(f) be retrospectively amended, with effect from 10 October 2000, to remove the word “either” and replace the word “or” with the word “and”. Issue: Amendment to section 21A(2) of the GST Act Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 21A(2) should be amended to ensure that any allocation between taxable and exempt supplies is fair and reasonable. Comment Section 21A sets out the methods for allocating between taxable and other non- taxable uses of goods and services. Section 21A(1) sets out the two general methods of allocation – actual use (direct attribution), and a Commissioner-approved alternative method if the method results in a fair and reasonable allocation. Section 21A(2) allows the use of either the two methods in section 21A(1) or the turnover method for ascertaining the proportion of exempt use of goods or services. This implies an unrestricted ability to use the turnover method to ascertain the proportion of exempt use of goods or services. This was not intended – any method used should give a fair and reasonable result. Section 21A(1) and (2) should therefore be clarified to ensure that the method adopted gives a fair and reasonable result. Recommendation That a new subsection be added to section 21A, with effect from 10 October 2000, to ensure that the method used to allocate between taxable and exempt supplies results in a fair and reasonable allocation. Issue: Amendment to section 21B(3) of the GST Act Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 21B(3) should be amended to apply to all goods and services acquired or produced for which there is no pattern of use as intended, not just replacement goods and services. 100 Comment Section 21B(3) provides that when section 21C(1)(a) is applied to goods and services acquired or produced to replace goods and services without an existing pattern of use, a provisional output tax adjustment must be made on acquisition followed by a recalculation, and adjustment if necessary, after 12 months. Section 21B(3) was intended to apply to all goods and services acquired or produced for which there is no pattern of use – replacement goods and services and new goods and services. A reference to new goods which are not replacement goods and services should, therefore, be inserted in section 21B(3), and the title of section 21B should be changed to reflect the wider scope of the section (Methods of allocation for new and replacement goods and services). There is also inconsistent use of the term “produced” (goods “acquired or produced”) in the section and it should be amended so that “produced” is used throughout the section in conjunction with the term “acquired”. Recommendation That section 21B(3) be amended to refer to all new goods and services and goods and services which are produced, as well as those acquired. Issue: Amendment to section 21E(2)(b) of the GST Act Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 21E(2)(b) should be amended to add the words “of this Act” after the reference to section 12(1). Comment The words “of this Act” should be inserted after the reference to “section 12(1)” in section 21E(2)(b), as there is a reference to another Act in that provision (the Customs and Excise Act 1996). This minor amendment would be consistent with the drafting of the new definition of “input tax” in new section 3A(1)(b). Recommendation That section 21E(2)(b) be amended to add the words “of this Act” after the reference to section 12(1). 101 Issue: Amendment to section 21E(3)(a) of the GST Act Submission (Matter raised by officials) The reference to “section 12(1) of the Custom and Excise Act 1996” in section 21E(3)(a) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 should be replaced by a reference to section 12(1) of the GST Act. Comment Section 21E(3)(a) contains an incorrect reference to “section 12(1) of the Custom and Excise Act 1996”. The reference should instead be to section 12(1) of the GST Act. This amendment could be made by simply repealing in new section 21E(3)(a) the words “of the Customs and Excise Act 1996” with retrospective effect. The current reference is taxpayer unfriendly. Recommendation That the reference to “section 12(1) of the Custom and Excise Act 1996” in section 21E(3)(a) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 be retrospectively replaced by a reference to “section 12(1)”, with effect from 10 October 2000. Issue: Amendments made by section 106 of the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 106(2) and (3) of the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000 should be repealed. Section 42(2)(c) of the GST Act should be amended by replacing “a body (as defined in section 57(1) of this Act)” with “an incorporated body” and omitting “pursuant to any order by the Court”. New section 42(5) (which has not yet come into force) contained in Schedule 1 of the Personal Property Securities Act 1999 should also be amended by replacing “a body” with “an unincorporated body”. Comment Section 106(2) and (3) was intended to amend certain references in section 42 of the GST Act applying to the recovery of tax in respect of unincorporated bodies. These references, however, do not appear in section 42 – they appear in amendments to section 42 made by Schedule 1 of the Personal Property Securities Amendment Act 1999 which have not yet come into force. The purported amendments made by section 106(2) and (3) are therefore ineffective. It is, therefore, necessary to repeal these amendments and instead make the correct amendments to existing section 42(2)(c) of the GST Act. It is also necessary to make a minor amendment to new 102 section 42(5) (which has not yet come into force) contained in Schedule 1 of the Personal Property Securities Act 1999. Recommendations That section 106(2) and (3) be repealed. That section 42(2)(c) of the GST Act be amended by replacing “a body (as defined in section 57(1) of this Act)” with “an unincorporated body” and omitting “pursuant to any order by the Court”. That new section 42(5) contained in Schedule 1 of the Personal Property Securities Act 1999 be amended by replacing “a body” with “an unincorporated body”. The amendments should have effect from 10 October 2000. 103
Taxation (Beneficiary Income of Minors, Services-related Payments and Remedial Matters) Bill Supplement to the Officials’ Report to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on Submissions on the Bill 22 February 2001 Prepared by the Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue and the Treasury CONTENTS Remedial changes to the multi-rate fringe benefit tax rules1 Issue: Additional option for the multi-rate FBT rules2 Issue: Clarification of subsidised transport exception3 Remuneration paid to shareholder-employees4 Issue: Option for next year square-up of liability4 Issue: ICANZ alternative proposal #15 Issue: ICANZ alternative proposal #26 Issue: Drafting issue #17 Issue: Drafting issue #27 Issue: Clarification of major shareholder employee’s cash remuneration8 Issue: Attributed income8 Issue: Low-interest loans provided by life insurers9 Issue: Non-residents and the low-income rebate10 Issue: Clarification of the associates rules11 Issue: Clarification of category (h) benefits12 1 REMEDIAL CHANGES TO THE MULTI-RATE FRINGE BENEFIT TAX RULES The multi-rate fringe benefit tax (FBT) rules were enacted as part of the Taxation (FBT, SSCWT and Remedial Matters) Act 2000. These rules provide employers with an option to use progressive FBT rates based on an employee’s income (including the value of attributed benefits) to determine the FBT that is payable, instead of applying a flat FBT rate of 64% to the value of all benefits provided. As a result of these changes, a number of remedial issues have arisen that the Government has asked to be included in this bill. The Committee has sought comment on the following proposals from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand (ICANZ), New Zealand Law Society, New Zealand Council of Trade Unions (CTU) and the Employers’ Federation: • Clarification of the subsidised transport exception; • Remuneration paid to shareholder-employees; • Clarification of major shareholder-employee’s cash remuneration; • Attribution rule income; and • Low-interest loans provided by life insurers. The CTU has provided a submission in broad support of the proposals. The New Zealand Law Society has provided comments on several technical issues including clarifying when an employer is required to include “attribution rule” income under section GC 14D in the calculation of cash remuneration for a person receiving fringe benefits. The Law Society has also expressed concern at the potential for the proposals to be retrospective in nature should the enactment of the legislation be delayed beyond the time requirement for filing the 2000-01 year final return. ICANZ has expressed concern at the proposal put forward by officials to deal with the issue of remuneration paid to shareholder-employees. This issue concerns employers who file quarterly and annual FBT returns and provide fringe benefits to shareholder- employees or to persons whom the employer is required to attribute income under the “attribution rule”. ICANZ has put forward two alternative options. Officials recommend that the proposed option for employers to pay 49% for these employees and undertake a square-up in the next year is the most workable solution in the short term. This proposal fits well within the current system without the need for significant systems changes by Inland Revenue and employers. Officials consider that the options put forward by ICANZ should be considered further, including consultation with other interested parties, with a view to including any legislation in a subsequent tax bill. 2 The Corporate Taxpayer Group has provided a submission on providing an additional option in the multi-rate rules whereby attributed benefits are all taxed at the top FBT rate, while non-attributed benefits are all taxed at 49% (the same rate as under the full multi-rate calculation). ICANZ has expressed its agreement with this proposal. Officials have also raised several amendments that seek to clarify the application of the multi-rate rules: • Non-residents and the low-income rebate; • Clarification of the associates rules (consultation was undertaken with ICANZ); and • Clarification of category (h) benefits. Issue: Additional option for the multi-rate FBT rules New clause Submission (8W – Corporate Taxpayers Group) A new option should be added to the multi-rate FBT rules whereby an employer can apply a flat 63.93% rate to all attributed benefits and a flat 49% to all non-attributed benefits. From the employers’ perspective this would avoid having to undertake the multi-rate calculations for attributed benefits, while still being able to pool the non- attributed benefits at the lower rate. Comment Officials agree that complexity is involved in undertaking the full multi-rate calculations for attributed benefits. As a result, employers need to weigh the costs of undertaking the calculation against any potential savings in FBT liability. This option would allow employers to gain some of the advantages of the multi-rate calculation while avoiding some of the more complex steps. The proposal would see an employer paying the same amount of FBT for non- attributed benefits as under the full multi-rate calculation, and the highest rate of FBT (equivalent to the 39% personal tax rate) for attributed benefits. While this option would not allow employers with employees on low and middle income levels to take advantage of the progressive FBT rates in the multi-rate calculation, it still allows the benefit of pooling non-attributed benefits at 49%. Officials support this submission as the practical effect would be to tax non-attributed benefits at the same rate as under the multi-rate rules and all attributed benefits at the top rate. 3 The revenue impact of this option depends on the employers who would choose to use it. If employers who would otherwise use the flat 64% option for all benefits choose this option, then the effect could be revenue negative. However, if the option was used by employers who would otherwise use the full multi-rate calculation but wished to avoid the extra steps in the calculation, it could be revenue positive. ICANZ has also been consulted on this option and agrees with the proposal for compliance reasons. As this proposal is a new option and would not be enacted until late March 2001, officials consider that it should apply from the beginning of the 1 April 2001 year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted with application from 1 April 2001. Issue: Clarification of subsidised transport exception Clause 18B Submission (Matter raised by officials) The option under section ND 4, which allows certain fringe benefits in the form of subsidised transport to be pooled, should be amended so that it does not exclude employers who are close companies. Comment Section CI 1(d) deems that fringe benefits in the form of subsidised transport are subject to FBT. This form of benefit is further defined in section OB 1 as applying only to employers who are involved in the business of transportation themselves. In practice, therefore, the exception to pool these benefits at 49% is limited to a small number of employers such as bus and rail companies and airlines. The provision as drafted under section ND 4 excluded any close company from the option to pool these benefits at 49%. Officials now recommend that this exclusion be removed to ensure that some employers who could benefit from this option are not excluded by reason only of their close company status. Recommendation That section ND 4 should be amended so that it applies to all employers, including close companies, who can provide under the Income Tax Act 1994 fringe benefits in the form of subsidised transport. 4 REMUNERATION PAID TO SHAREHOLDER-EMPLOYEES Issue: Option for next year square-up of liability Clause 18C, D, and F Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment is required to the rules for employers providing fringe benefits to shareholder-employees who receive non-deductible salary and wages or a person receiving attribution income to which the employer is a party to ensure that employers have the necessary remuneration information to perform the multi-rate calculation. Comment As the multi-rate FBT rules currently apply, there is a timing conflict regarding when an employer needs to determine the remuneration of its employees, and when the employer can calculate the remuneration paid to shareholder-employees that falls outside of the PAYE system. This timing conflict occurs because employers of shareholder-employees may not know the remuneration of such employees for the year until after the FBT return is due. The same issue applies to amounts under the attribution rule. A clarification is also needed that this rule applies only to an employee deriving amounts under the attribution rule which involve the employer as a party to that amount. To address this issue, officials recommend the following: • that attributed fringe benefits provided or granted to a shareholder-employer or a person receiving attribution income to which the employer is a party to in the year be taxed at 49%; and • employers be subject to the square-up calculation in the subsequent FBT year once they had full information of the remuneration of those concerned in addition to their other FBT obligations. Furthermore that: • if any employers were able to obtain this remuneration in the current year they would be able to file completely in that year (that is, the next year’s square-up is only an option to ensure that any employers who cannot obtain the necessary information are not subject to penalties); or • employers have the option to pay 64% on such benefits if they wish to opt out of this rule completely and complete their remaining FBT obligations under either the flat rate or multi-rate options. 5 All pooled benefits will continue to be calculated in the same year. ICANZ has been consulted on this issue and argues that it should not be implemented. This is because of the compliance problems in calculating tax a year later and because two records systems may be needed as the employer could do both a square-up for the current year and to adjust payments for the previous year for shareholder-employees and persons receiving attribution income. ICANZ does agree however, that if the proposal is accepted, employers should have the option either to file “normally” or undertake the next year square up. Officials consider that this system achieves the goal of managing the square-up process for employers with shareholder-employees and persons receiving attribution income. The deferral of potential tax until the next year gives employers use of that money until the square-up is undertaken as the 49% payment rate will in many cases under tax employers. Officials agree that this proposal needs to be reviewed in the longer term. Furthermore, we recognise that other options exist, such as those suggested by ICANZ to deal with this issue. However, it is not workable to implement these other options by the end of March this year because of Inland Revenue system constraints and the need to provide information to employers and for employers to make their own system changes within that time frame. The officials’ proposal to have a workable solution in place by 1 April to allow employers to meet their FBT obligations fits within the existing FBT framework. We consider that further work should be undertaken to consult on the other longer-term proposals with a view to including any legislation in a subsequent bill, but that this proposal should apply at this time. Recommendation That an amendment be made to the multi-rate rules for employers providing fringe benefits to shareholder-employees or employees receiving attribution income as proposed in the Minister’s letter of 23 November 2000. That an amendment be made to ensure that the above proposal only applies to employers, who do not have the employee’s remuneration details at the time the return is due, are required to undertake the lagged calculation. Issue: ICANZ alternative proposal #1 Submission (7A – ICANZ) Employers should be allowed to pay one-quarter of last year’s total FBT liability on the quarterly payment dates without the need for a “return” and to complete a final square-up when the information was available. 6 Comment ICANZ argues that this proposal has the advantages that it can be applied to all taxpayers, would reduce compliance obligations, and removes double liability of FBT, and employers would pay the liability more accurately. The disadvantages of this proposal would be that employers would still make five payments (four quarterly payments and the final return), and implementing it would require system changes by Inland Revenue. Officials consider that as a longer-term change this proposal has merit, but as it stands the effect on employers would not substantially change. Employers would still make the same number of payments and would still have to calculate what the payment would be. We are also unsure of the extent of any actual compliance savings involved. Furthermore, the required systems changes, the need to inform employers, and effects on employers in terms of changing their own systems at this time could be significant. Such a proposal should be considered for all employers after consultation with interested parties. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: ICANZ alternative proposal #2 Submission (7A – ICANZ) All employers providing fringe benefits to shareholder-employees or person receiving attribution income should be able to file on an income year basis for those employees. Comment ICANZ submits that the advantages of this system are that Inland Revenue would not have to develop new systems and that employers would have to complete only one return and make one payment for these employees. Against this, ICANZ recognises that a number of further law changes would be needed to the multi-rate rules to allow employers to elect retrospectively into the income year rules and overcome the current monetary limit of $100,000 and limitation of the rule to close companies that would exclude many employers. Furthermore, employers would still be required to file for its other employees and for the 2000-01 income year such employers would be subject to use-of-money interest. Officials acknowledge that this proposal has merit as a longer-term initiative. As with the comment for option 1, officials consider that such a change could not be implemented at this time. 7 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Drafting issue #1 Submission (7A – ICANZ) The proposed treatment of employers with shareholder-employees and persons with attribution income should not apply to employers filing on an income year basis as such employers have until their terminal tax date to file their FBT return and as such would have the necessary remuneration information by this date. Comment Officials agree as this proposal was intended to apply only to quarterly and annual FBT filers and therefore the draft amendment should be changed to reflect this. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Drafting issue #2 Clause 18B Submission (7A – New Zealand Law Society) In clause 18B the reference to section ND 3(1) has been partially omitted and should therefore be corrected. Comment Officials agree that the reference should be corrected. Recommendation That the section be amended to correct the section reference. 8 Issue: Clarification of major shareholder employee’s cash remuneration Clause 18E Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment should be made to section ND 7(2) to clarify when interest and dividends should be included in the cash remuneration of a major shareholder- employee for the purpose of the multi-rate FBT rules. Comment A concern has been raised that section ND 7(2) can be interpreted as requiring major- shareholder employees to include interest and dividends from all sources in their calculation of remuneration. The policy intent behind this section was always to limit the calculation of remuneration to the compensation received from the employer concerned whether that remuneration was in the form of salary and wages or substitutes such as interest or dividends. Furthermore, interest or dividends from a related employer should also be taken into account if remuneration such as salary or wages is also received from that related employer. Recommendation That an amendment be made to clarify when interest and dividends are required to be included in the cash remuneration of major-shareholder employees. Issue: Attributed income Clause 18D Submission (Matter raised by officials, 13W – New Zealand Law Society) The definition of “remuneration” used to calculate tax liability under the multi-rate FBT rules should be amended to include any amount distributed under the attribution rules contained in sections GC 14B to GC 14E (attribution income) to which the employer is a party. Comment This submission, to include any amount of “attribution rule” income in calculating the total remuneration of an employee under the multi-rate FBT rules, was raised as part 9 of the Committee’s consideration of the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill last year. At the time, however, the multi-rate fringe benefit changes had not been enacted by Parliament, so no amendments could be made at that time. With both the multi-rate FBT rules and the attribution rule enacted, officials recommend that this change be undertaken as part of the current bill. The New Zealand Law Society has made a submission that the requirement to include attribution rule income should apply only in instances where the employer concerned knows (or should reasonably know) that a distribution has been made subject to the attribution rule. This rule should apply only in the situation where the employer is required to attribute income to an “employee” under the “attribution income” rule. Recommendation That the FBT rules be amended so the total remuneration provided by an employer includes any amount of income attributed under the attribution rules by that employer to an employee. Issue: Low-interest loans provided by life insurers Clause 18A Submission (Matter raised by officials) An addition should be made to section ND 3 to state that subsection (1)(a) does not apply to low-interest loans by life insurers, and instead that such loans be treated as non-attributed or pooled benefits subject to a flat 49% rate. This would clarify the legislation regarding the treatment of low-interest loans from life-insurers to policy holders or their associates. Comment Low-interest loans are treated under the multi-rate FBT rules as attributed benefits. An exception to this rule are low-interest loans provided by life insurers to policy holders which are deemed to be non-attributed benefits and taxed at a flat rate of 49%. This is because the loans are not provided in an “employment relationship”, and as such the life insurer would not have any knowledge of the recipient’s income details. An amendment would clarify any confusion over the treatment of this class of low- interest loan as against all other low-interest loans. 10 Recommendation That section ND 3(1) be amended. Issue: Non-residents and the low-income rebate New clause Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment should be made to section ND 5 to clarify that employers should use the full income rebate available to residents under section KC 1. This is irrespective of the tax residence of any employees concerned. Comment The multi-rate fringe benefit tax rules require employers to calculate the total remuneration of an employee. This total remuneration calculation includes both the cash income received such as salary, wages and extra-emoluments along with the total taxable value of attributed benefits (as defined in the multi-rate rules). The FBT payable for each employee concerned is determined by calculating the “total tax” that would be payable on that remuneration and subtracting a deemed amount of tax payable on that remuneration. This is similar to subtracting the PAYE that would have been paid on the cash component of the remuneration. The concern is that the low-income rebate under section KC 1 is used to determine this deemed tax already payable, and that rebate is determined by reference to the residency of the employee concerned. The intent of the multi-rate calculation under section ND 5 was never to distinguish between resident and non-resident employees as the tax amount determined is a deemed rather than actual tax paid amount. Furthermore, requiring employers to determine the eligibility of each employee to the low-income rebate would add unintended complexity to the rules. Section ND 5 should therefore be amended to state that for all employees receiving attributed fringe benefits, the calculation should include any rebate of tax allowed under section KC 1 as if each employee concerned was a full resident for the purposes of that section. Recommendation That section ND 5 be amended to ensure that the full rebate under KC 1 applies in all circumstances. 11 Issue: Clarification of the associates rules New clause Submission (Matter raised by officials) Currently there is an inconsistency between the general FBT rules and the optional multi-rate FBT rules in how to treat an associate of an employee who receives fringe benefits. Officials therefore submit that this treatment should be clarified to remove any potential inconsistency. Comment Section GC 15 outlines the general FBT rules for associates of employees who receive fringe benefits. In certain circumstances the section deems that either the associate, by virtue of receiving the benefits, is an employee in his/her own right, or that the benefits are deemed to have actually been received by the employee and not the associate. Under the current multi-rate rules, the taxable value of any benefits provided to an associate of a major shareholder employee is required to be added to the total attributed fringe benefits of the major shareholder employee. The intent of this section was that it would apply to all associates, irrespective of whether they were shareholders themselves, unless they had their own genuine employment relationship with the employer. As section GC 15 deems some associates by virtue of receiving fringe benefits to be employees in their own right, such benefits are not taxed on the basis of the remuneration of the shareholder-employee (the principal). ICANZ has made a submission on this issue and agrees that a legislative change is required to ensure the benefits provided to an associate are taxed in the hands of the employee rather than the associate. Officials agree with the submission by ICANZ that an amendment should be made to section GC 15 to achieve this intent. Recommendation That an amendment be made to clarify the treatment of associates under the multi-rate rules who receive attributed fringe benefits. 12 Issue: Clarification of category (h) benefits New clause Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section ND 3(1)(c) should be clarified to ensure that the threshold for fringe benefits to which section CI 1(h) applies is $2,000 or more in total and not $2,000 or more per type of benefit. Comment Section ND 3 outlines, for the purpose of the multi-rate FBT calculations only, the thresholds at which certain fringe benefits defined under section CI 1 must be attributed to the employee receiving them. This means that, if the taxable value of fringe benefits within a prescribed category breaches the threshold, that entire category must be attributed to the employee concerned. The employer then uses this remuneration information for each employee concerned to calculate the FBT payable. The issue requiring amendment concerns section ND 3(1)(c), which requires attribution for a benefit with a taxable value of $2,000 or more per year to which section CI 1(h) applies. Put simply, CI 1(h) covers all “other” fringe benefits that are not covered by any other category. These benefits can sometimes be in the form of very low value benefits such as discounted goods. The underlying policy was that if the entire group of benefits that section CI 1(h) applies to had a combined taxable value of $2,000 to a particular employee, that category of benefits would be required to be attributed. Officials are concerned that the provision may be interpreted to mean that each “type” of benefit that could be subject to section CI 1(h) needs to have a taxable value of $2,000 or more before being required to be attributed. For example, an employer could provide a club membership with a taxable value of $1,500 and discounted goods with a taxable value of $1,000. With an amendment, it can be clarified that these two types of benefit are required to be combined to constitute a total taxable value of $2,500, and thus would be required to be attributed. Recommendation That an amendment be made to the multi-rate FBT rules to ensure that the $2,000 threshold for benefits to which section CI 1(h) applies is interpreted on a full category rather than a per benefit type basis.
FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARD NO. 13 February 1995 ACCOUNTING FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES Issued by the Financial Reporting Standards Board Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand Approved February 1995 by the Accounting Standards Review Board under the Financial Reporting Act 1993 CONTENTS paragraph Introduction .......................................................................1.1 Application ........................................................................2.1 Statement of Purpose.........................................................3.1 Definitions Development.................................................................4.1 Research........................................................................4.2 Research and Development Costs ................................4.8 Financial Reporting Recognition of Research Costs.....................................5.1 Recognition of Development Costs ..............................5.2 Amortisation of Development Costs ............................ 5.10 Review of Development Costs ..................................... 5.13 Reinstatement ............................................................... 5.16 Disclosure ..................................................................... 5.19 Comparison of FRS-13 with International and Australian Accounting Standards............................................ Appendix This Standard replaces SSAP-13: Accounting for Research and Development Activities (1991), although that Statement will continue to apply until the completion of accounting periods which end prior to 30 September 1995. This Standard should be read in the context of the Explanatory Foreword to General Purpose Financial Reporting published by the Council, Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand. The Accounting Standards Review Board (the Board) has approved FRS-13: Accounting for Research and Development Activities, for the purposes of the Financial Reporting Act 1993, to apply to reporting entities, the Crown and all departments, Offices of Parliament and Crown entities (each of which is defined in the Act) other than as expressly exempted by the terms of the Standard. The Board has also approved this Standard to apply to local authorities (as defined in the Act) from 1 July 1998. 1INTRODUCTION COMMENTARY 1.1This Standard deals with accounting for research and development activities in general purpose financial reports. 1.2An entity undertakes a programme of creative work to increase its stock of scientific and technical knowledge and to devise new applications which will contribute to the maintenance of its business and competitive position. The accounting treatment and disclosure of the costs of research and development activities are therefore important for users of financial reports. 1.3An entity may carry out research and development activities under contract for another entity. When the substance of the arrangement is such that the risks and benefits associated with the research and development activities are, or will be, transferred to the other entity, the entity conducting the research and development activities accounts for the costs in accordance with FRS-4: Accounting for Inventories, or FRS-14: Accounting for Construction Contracts. The recipient of the risks and benefits accounts for its costs in accordance with this Standard. 1.4When the substance of the arrangement with the other entity is such that the risks and benefits associated with the research and development activities are not, or will not be, transferred to others, the entity conducting the research and development activities accounts for the costs in accordance with this Standard. Factors which indicate that the risks and benefits of research and development activities are not transferred to others include: (a)the entity conducting the research and development activities is contractually obligated to repay any of the funds provided by the other entity regardless of the outcome of the research and development activities; and (b)even though the contract does not require the entity conducting the research and development activities to repay any of the funds provided by the other entity, repayment could be required at the option of the other entity or the surrounding conditions indicate that repayment is probable. 1.5Financial reporting standards are paragraphs in bold type-face in this Standard. Where appropriate, interpretive commentary paragraphs in plain type-face follow the financial reporting standards. 2APPLICATION STANDARD 2.1This Standard applies to the general purpose financial reports of all entities except where exempted by paragraphs 2.2 and 2.4. 2.2Entities which qualify for exemption in accordance with the Framework for Differential Reporting are not required to comply with section 5 of this Standard. Where this exemption is applied, all research and development costs shall be recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. 2.3The financial reporting standards set out in this Standard shall apply to all financial reports where such application is of material consequence. A statement, fact, or item is material if it is of such a nature or amount that its disclosure, or the method of treating it, given full consideration of the circumstances applying at the time the financial report is completed, is likely to influence the users of the financial report in making decisions or assessments. 2.4This Standard does not apply to the costs of exploration and development of oil, gas and mineral deposits in the extractive industries. However, this Standard does apply to the costs of other research and development activities in such industries. 2.5This Standard applies to general purpose financial reports covering periods ending on or after 30 September 1995. 3STATEMENT OF PURPOSE COMMENTARY 3.1The purpose of this Standard is: (a)to establish criteria for distinguishing research and development activities from other activities; (b)to establish the accounting treatments of research and development costs; and (c)to specify the minimum disclosures of those costs in financial reports. 4DEFINITIONS STANDARD The following terms are used in this Standard with these meanings: 4.1“Development” is the application of research findings or other knowledge to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved materials, devices, products, processes, systems or services prior to the commencement of commercial production or use. 4.2“Research” is original and planned investigation undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding. COMMENTARY 4.3Although the nature of activities encompassed by research and development is generally understood, it may be difficult in practice to identify those activities in particular instances. While the above broad definitions should assist entities in their classification of research and development activities, the appropriate distinction is often dependent on the type of business, its organisation and the type of projects undertaken. 4.4Research and development activity is distinguished from non-research based activity by the presence or absence of an appreciable element of innovation. If the activity departs from routine and breaks new ground it is normally to be included; if it follows an established pattern it is normally to be excluded. 4.5The following are examples of activities that would typically be included in research: (a)research aimed at discovery of new knowledge; (b)searching for applications of new research findings or other knowledge; (c)formulation and design of possible new or improved product or process alternatives; (d)testing in search of product or process alternatives. 4.6The following are examples of activities that would typically be included in development: (a)evaluation of product or process alternatives; (b)design, construction and testing of pre-production prototypes and models; (c)design of tools, jigs, moulds, and dies involving new technology; (d)design construction and operation of a pilot plant that is not of a scale economically feasible for commercial production. 4.7The following are examples of activities that typically would be excluded from research and development: (a)engineering follow-through in an early phase of commercial production; (b)quality control during commercial production, including routine testing of products; (c)trouble-shooting in connection with breakdowns during commercial production; (d)routine, ongoing efforts to refine, enrich or otherwise improve on the qualities of an existing product; (e)adaptation of an existing capability to a particular requirement or customer’s need as part of a continuing commercial activity; (f)seasonal or other periodic design changes to existing products; (g)routine design of tools, jigs, moulds and dies; (h)activities, including design and construction engineering, related to the construction, relocation, rearrangement, or start-up of facilities or equipment other than facilities or equipment whose sole use is for a particular research and development project. STANDARD 4.8“Research and development costs” shall comprise all costs that are directly attributable to research and development activities or that can be allocated on a reasonable basis to such activities. COMMENTARY 4.9Research and development costs include when applicable: (a)the salaries, wages and other related costs of personnel engaged in research and development activities; (b)the costs of materials and services consumed in research and development activities; (c)the depreciation of equipment and facilities to the extent that they are used for research and development activities; (d)overhead costs related to specific research and development activities; (e)other costs related to research and development activities such as amortisation of patents and licences. 4.10 In order to achieve a reasonable degree of comparability between entities and between accounting periods of the same entity, it is desirable to separate research and development costs from other costs and to distinguish between research costs and development costs. 4.11 Costs incurred to maintain production or to promote sales of existing products are excluded from the costs of research and development activities. Thus the costs of routine or periodic minor modifications of existing products, production lines, manufacturing processes and other ongoing operations are excluded. So, too, are the costs of carrying out market research of a routine or promotional nature. 4.12 However, market research activities undertaken prior to the commencement of commercial production to establish the usefulness of a product or the existence of a potential market may be similar to development activities. Thus, the related costs may be treated in the same way as development costs and recognised as an asset when the criteria specified in paragraph 5.3 are met. 5FINANCIAL REPORTING Recognition of Research Costs STANDARD 5.1Research costs shall be recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. Recognition of Development Costs STANDARD 5.2The development costs of a project shall be recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred unless the criteria for asset recognition identified in paragraph 5.3 are met. 5.3The development costs of a project shall be recognised as an asset when all of the following criteria are met: (a)the product or process is clearly defined and the costs attributable to the product or process can be identified separately and measured reliably; (b)the technical feasibility of the product or process can be demonstrated; (c)the entity intends to produce and market, or use, the product or process; (d)the existence of a market for the product or process or its usefulness to the entity, if it is to be used internally, can be demonstrated; and (e)adequate resources exist, or their availability can be demonstrated, to complete the project and market or use the product or process. 5.4The development costs of a project recognised as an asset shall not exceed the amount that is probable of recovery from related future economic benefits, after deducting further development costs, related production costs, and selling and administrative costs directly incurred in marketing the project. COMMENTARY 5.5In the case of development costs, while an asset might exist, the asset recognition criteria may not be met because there is insufficient probability that future economic benefits will be realised as a result of specific development expenditure. In such circumstances, development costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. 5.6In considering recognition of development costs either as an expense or an asset, reference is to be made to the Statement of Concepts for General Purpose Financial Reporting for: •definition of assets; •the essential characteristics of assets; •criteria for recognition of assets; •definition of expenses; and •criteria for recognition of expenses. 5.7Where development costs are incurred in respect of a number of identified products or processes, those development costs are to be allocated to each of the identified products or processes. Once allocated, the treatment of those development costs is to be determined by reference to paragraphs 5.2 and 5.3 on an individual product or process basis. 5.8The economic benefits expected to arise from development activities include revenue from the sale of the product or process, and cost savings or other benefits resulting from the use of the product or process by the entity itself. Estimates of the revenues and cost savings are based on future prices and costs if it is probable that future selling prices will be lower than those prevailing at the end of the period, and those lower selling prices will not be offset fully by additional cost savings. In other cases, estimates of revenues and cost savings are based on prices or conditions prevailing at the end of the period. 5.9The recognition of an asset in accordance with paragraph 5.3 involves an assessment of the uncertainties that inevitably surround development activities. Such uncertainties are taken account of by the exercise of care when making the judgements needed in determining the amount of development costs to be recognised as an asset. The exercise of such judgement should not permit the deliberate understatement of assets. Amortisation of Development Costs STANDARD 5.10 The amount of development costs recognised as an asset shall be amortised and recognised as an expense on a systematic basis so as to reflect the pattern in which the related economic benefits are recognised. COMMENTARY 5.11 The relationship between development costs and the economic benefits that the entity expects to derive can usually be determined only broadly and indirectly because of the nature of the development activities. When amortising development costs on a systematic basis so as to reflect the pattern in which the related economic benefits are recognised, the entity makes reference to: (a)the revenue or other benefits from the sale or use of the product or process; (b)the time period over which the product or process is expected to be sold or used. Amortisation commences when the product or process is available for sale or use. 5.12 Technology and economic obsolescence create uncertainties that restrict the outputs and the time period over which the development costs are to be allocated. Furthermore, it is usually difficult to estimate the further costs and related future economic benefits of a new product or process beyond a short period. When the useful life of the asset cannot be determined reliably, the amortisation period is not normally to exceed five years unless a longer period, not exceeding twenty years from the date of initial recognition, can be justified. The maximum amortisation period of twenty years was chosen because the planning horizon adopted by an entity for its operations is unlikely to exceed twenty years, and projections of the life of an asset beyond the entity’s planning period are not normally sufficiently reliable to permit a longer amortisation period. Review of Development Costs STANDARD 5.13 The development costs of a project recognised as an asset shall be reviewed at the end of each accounting period. 5.14 When the criteria in paragraph 5.3, which previously justified the recognition of the development costs as an asset, no longer apply, the unamortised balance shall be written off and recognised immediately as an expense. 5.15 When the amount of the development costs probable of recovery from related future economic benefits, after deducting further development costs, related production costs, and selling and administrative costs directly incurred in marketing the project, is exceeded by the unamortised balance of such costs, the excess shall be written down and recognised immediately as an expense. Reinstatement STANDARD 5.16 The amount of development costs written off or written down in accordance with paragraphs 5.14 and 5.15 shall be written back when the circumstances and events that led to the write-off or write-down cease to exist, and there is persuasive evidence that the new circumstances and events will persist for the foreseeable future. The amount written back shall be reduced by the amount that would have been recognised as amortisation in accordance with paragraph 5.10 had the write- off or write-down not occurred. The amount written back shall be recognised as a reduction in the amount of development costs recognised as an expense for the period. COMMENTARY 5.17 The circumstances or events that led to the write-off or write-down of development costs in accordance with paragraphs 5.14 and 5.15 may change such that the amount of the write-off or write-down once again qualifies for recognition as an asset. In such a case, the amount is written back. 5.18 The amount of the write-off or write-down that is written back is reduced by the amount of amortisation that would have been recognised as an expense during the period in which the asset was written off or written down. This is necessary when, for example, the entity has recognised revenue or other benefits from the sale or use of the product or process during the period in which the asset was written off or written down. The total carrying amount of the asset is always limited by paragraph 5.4. Disclosure STANDARD 5.19 The financial report shall disclose: (a)the accounting policies adopted for research and development costs; (b)the amount of research and development costs recognised as an expense in the period; (c)the amortisation methods used; (d)the useful lives or amortisation rates used; and (e)a reconciliation of the balance of unamortised development costs at the beginning and end of the period showing: (i) development costs recognised as an asset in accordance with paragraph 5.3; (ii) development costs recognised as an expense in accordance with paragraphs 5.10, 5.14 or 5.15; (iii) development costs allocated to other asset accounts; and (iv) development costs written back in accordance with paragraph 5.16, together with an explanation of the change in circumstances that led to the write-back as an asset in accordance with that paragraph. COMMENTARY 5.20 An entity is to include in its financial report a description of its research and development activities. There is to be disclosure of the circumstances or events that led to the recognition of an expense for the impairment of development costs in accordance with paragraphs 5.14 or 5.15, and the reinstatement of development costs in accordance with paragraph 5.16. APPENDIX Comparison of FRS-13 with International and Australian Accounting Standards This comparison appendix, which was prepared as at 1 February 1995 and deals only with significant matters in the standards, is produced for information purposes only and does not form part of the standards in FRS-13. The International Accounting Standard referred to in this Appendix was promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Committee. The International and Australian accounting standards comparable with FRS-13 are: •IAS-9 (1993): Research and Development Costs ; •AASB 1011 (1987): Accounting for Research and Development Costs ; and •AAS-13 (1983): Accounting for Research and Development Costs. The following summarises the significant matters in the above standards. Recognition of costs as an asset The four standards require generally that research and development costs be expensed as incurred. FRS-13 and IAS-9 require development costs to be recognised as an asset and amortised under specific conditions. Both AASB 1011 and AAS-13 allow research and development costs to be deferred and amortised, depending on the extent of certainty that these costs will be recovered in future reporting periods. FRS-13 and IAS-9 are more specific than the Australian standards in respect of these conditions. Reinstatement of previously expensed costs AASB 1011 and AAS-13 state that when the uncertainties which led to the recognition of development costs as an expense no longer exist, such costs should not be reinstated as an asset. IAS-9 and FRS-13 allows the reinstatement of development costs originally recognised as an asset when the circumstances and events that led to their write-off or write-down no longer exist. Accounting policy FRS-13, IAS-9 and AAS-13 require the accounting policies adopted for the costs of research and development activities to be disclosed. AASB 1011 requires disclosure if material. Government grants AASB 1011 and AAS-13 include requirements for the treatment of government or other grants received in relation to research and development costs. In New Zealand, grants are the subject of a separate financial reporting standard. Amortisation period In IAS-9, developments costs are normally amortised over a period not exceeding five years. In AASB 1011 and AAS-13 the period of amortisation is determined by reference to the expected benefits. In FRS-13, an amortisation period not exceeding five years is indicated unless a longer period not exceeding twenty years can be justified. History Previously issued accounting standards superseded by this Financial Reporting Standard: SSAP-13: Accounting for Research and Development Activities (issued March 1991 and effective for periods beginning on or after 1 July 1991). SSAP-13: Accounting for Research and Development Activities (issued August 1981 and effective for periods beginning on or after 1 October 1981).
September 2001 SIMPLIFICATION REGULATORY IMPACT AND COMPLIANCE COST STATEMENT Statement of the problem and need for action In May of this year the Government released a tax simplification discussion document, More time for business. While aimed primarily at reducing tax- related compliance costs for small businesses, the document also contained a number of simplification initiatives for wage and salary earners, companies, non-residents and banks and other financial institutions. The Government is committed to simplifying the tax system for these taxpayers and proposes to legislate for some of the proposals in More time for business in the taxation bill scheduled for introduction in December 2001. The proposals being legislated for include: • extending the scope of non-filing; • simplifying family assistance; • removing the requirement for filing interim imputation returns; • simplifying non-resident contractors’ withholding tax requirements; • simplifying provisional tax; • reducing resident withholding tax information requirements; and • removing the requirement to make adjustments for small amounts of trading stock. Statement of the public policy objective The key objective of legislating for the tax simplification proposals discussed above is to reduce the stress, uncertainty and risk taxpayers face in meeting their regular tax obligations. Statement of feasible options for achieving the desired objective The necessary measures for implementation of the policy objectives are legislative in nature and will affect the Income Tax Act 1994, the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979. Statement of the net benefits of this proposal Benefits The specific benefits expected to arise from implementation of the tax simplification proposals being legislated for include: • reduced need for taxpayers to interact with Inland Revenue; • extension of non-filing; • reduction of information requirements imposed on taxpayers; • improved calculation of family assistance entitlements; • reduction of resident withholding tax communication costs; • reduction of trading stock valuation requirements; and • reduction of non-resident contractors’ withholding tax compliance requirements. Costs None of the tax simplification proposals being legislated for are expected to impose extra compliance costs on taxpayers, given that their aim and design is to reduce tax-related compliance costs. They are also not expected to have any significant economic implications. The administrative cost to Inland Revenue from implementing the initiatives is not expected to be significant. The fiscal cost of the proposals is expected to be $1.875 million in the 2001 financial year (for the period 1 April 2002 to 1 July 2002) and between $7.5 million and $8.7 million per annum in the period 2002 to 2004. The ongoing cost will be around $3.7 million each year, thereafter. Business compliance cost statement The majority of the proposals being legislated for will reduce compliance costs for businesses. The magnitude of these compliance cost savings is difficult to quantify as they will be both financial and time related. For example, a company will no longer have to file two sets of imputation returns to receive a refund of the credits available in its imputation credit account. Banks and other interest payers will benefit from being able to utilise different media to communicate resident withholding tax information to their customers. Small businesses will benefit from the higher use-of-money interest safe harbour threshold as this will reduce the need for them to estimate income, thereby, providing greater certainty in the calculation of provisional tax. Equally, small businesses will benefit from not having to value small amounts of trading stock and, more importantly, from the reduced risk of penalties applying if they do not value their stock. Consultative programme undertaken The tax simplification proposals being legislated for have received support in submissions on More time for business. This reflects the consultation undertaken with a wide range of interested parties, including the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, when developing these proposals. October 2001 GST AMENDMENTS REGULATORY IMPACT AND COMPLIANCE COST STATEMENT Statement of the problem and need for action Three amendments are required to the Goods and Service Tax Act 1985. • The first amendment concerns the treatment of repair services supplied in respect of these warranty agreements and whether these services should be zero-rated under the GST Act. The amendment addresses concerns the GST Act imposes a double tax impost on the supply of warranted goods in New Zealand. • Two remedial amendments are also required to assist in the clarification of amendments made to the GST that were included in the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000. The remedial amendments address concerns regarding the treatment of default or penalty interest that is charged under an enactment and the timing of “one-off” adjustments for assets with a value of less than $18,000. Statement of public policy objective The first amendment alleviates the current double taxation of certain warranty services and ensures that the GST Act achieves its key objectives of: • Taxing final consumption in New Zealand, and • Not generally being a cost imposed on businesses. The second and third amendments simplify the application of the GST Act and are designed to reduce potential compliance costs arising from amendments made by the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000. Statement of options for achieving the desired objectives Legislation is the only effective means of achieving the desired objectives. Non-legislative options, such as not amending the GST Act and relying on affected parties to vary their supply contracts, have been considered in relation to the first recommended amendment. Given the nature of warranty contracts, which are often standardised and used internationally, these options are not cost effective relative to the size of the New Zealand market. Non-legislative solutions are not viable in relation to the treatment of default or penalty interest that is charged under an enactment and the timing of “one-off” adjustments for assets with a value of less than $18,000. Statement of net benefit of this proposal The amendments will: • remove the GST cost to the non-registered offshore warrantor; • improve the ability of the GST Act to cater for different business arrangements; • remove the inefficiency associated with the double impost of GST in this situation; and • simplify compliance with GST Act in relation to charging default or penalty interest and making adjustments for changes in use for assets with a value of less than $18,000. Business compliance cost statement The zero-rating proposal lowers compliance costs for non-registered offshore warrantors. It potentially results in a small increase in compliance costs for New Zealand repairers who provide services for non-registered offshore warrantors. The proposed remedial amendments should result in a marginal reduction in compliance costs. Consultation The New Zealand Motor Industry Association, Inland Revenue and the Treasury have been consulted. October 2001 MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES – INTERNATIONAL, BLOODSTOCK REGULATORY IMPACT AND COMPLIANCE COST STATEMENT Statement of public policy objective The key objective of the proposed measures is to align the New Zealand tax system with international trend and to improve the equity and efficiency of the tax system. Making bribes non-deductible for taxation purposes would align New Zealand’s approach with the international trend initiated by the OECD. Allowing the existing debt forgiveness rule for family trusts to apply in resettlements recognises that resettlements are often necessary in practice and a consistent set of rules will increase the equity and efficiency of the tax system. Allowing ownership tracing rules to reflect underlying changes in economic ownership caused by a spinout of subsidiary businesses would improve the equity and efficiency of the tax system by reducing compliance costs to taxpayers contemplating a spinout. Simplifying the administration of the GST adjustment on fringe benefits would improve the efficiency of the tax system by reducing compliance and administration costs. Statement of problem and need for action Currently, bribes paid in the conduct of business may be deductible for taxation purposes. This is contrary to the OECD initiative that all other OECD member countries have implemented. New Zealand has an obligation as a member country to make bribes paid in the conduct of business non- deductible for taxation purposes. Existing family trusts that qualify for a natural love and affection concession are discouraged from resettling into a new trust because it may create additional, unintended tax liabilities. The existing shareholder continuity rules would treat a change in holding company caused by a ‘spinout’ of subsidiary businesses as a loss of continuity. Where a substantial amount of ownership was held by the holding company on behalf of small shareholders, the change in holding company could cause a breach of the shareholder continuity rules for the purpose of carrying forward tax losses and credits. The GST adjustment on fringe benefits is currently characterised as GST rather than FBT. This means that two assessment notices, one for the GST adjustment and one for FBT would have to be issued and dealt with. The requirement to handle two separate returns, instead of one, is not cost effective since the assessment is typically for a very small amount. Statement of options for achieving the desired objectives Legislative amendments are required in all cases to achieve the policy outcomes or to provide certainty to taxpayers. Statement of net benefit Benefits The measures proposed will align the New Zealand tax system with the international trend and improve the equity and efficiency of the tax system. The proposal to deny deductibility for bribes paid in business will align New Zealand’s approach with the international trend. The proposed new depreciation rates for broodmares would better reflect the economic depreciation rates and practice in the bloodstock industry. The proposal to recharacterise the GST adjustment on fringe benefits will reduce compliance and administration costs, but it is not possible to quantify these reductions. Costs There are potential revenue risks associated with the proposal relating to the ownership tracing rules if the proposed rule could be abused. These risks could not be quantified. Furthermore, but these revenue risks have been minimised by limiting the availability of the proposed rules to widely held companies that spin out their 100% owned subsidiary businesses. There are no additional compliance or administrative costs arising from the proposals. Statement on business compliance costs The proposal on the ownership tracing rules would allow widely held companies to continue holding ownership interests on behalf of small shareholders after a restructuring process. Without the proposed rules, these companies would be required to trace their ultimate shareholders when determining shareholder continuity for the purpose of carry forward losses and tax credits. This would mean higher compliance costs. The proposal on the GST adjustment on fringe benefits would reduce the compliance costs of taxpayers. It means that taxpayers receive one notice of assessment for FBT and the GST adjustment, instead of receiving two notices. The proposed FBT amendment relating to low-income rebates will reduce compliance costs for employers in not having to apportion the rebate based on the individual periods of residency in New Zealand of their employees. Consultation The proposal to make bribes non-deductible has been discussed with the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand. The Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade have also been involved in the policy development process. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand and the New Zealand Law Society have been consulted on the proposals relating to debt forgiveness rules for family trusts. The proposals relating to the ownership tracing rules have arisen from submissions made by a corporate taxpayer. The proposals would allow it to carry out its planned restructuring program after 1 March 2001. Its legal adviser and tax accountant have been consulted and both have been involved in the policy development process. October 2001 FINANCIAL RELIEF REGULATORY IMPACT AND COMPLIANCE COST STATEMENT Statement of the problem and need for action The Government is committed to the creation of an environment that is conducive to taxpayers meeting their obligations effectively, thereby facilitating the efficient administration of the tax system. This commitment involves ensuring that the current compliance and penalties legislation is clear as to what is expected of taxpayers, in terms of the standards of care and the penalties if they fail to meet these standards and their obligations in general. It also involves ensuring that the application of sanctions is fair and consistent across tax types and taxpayers. Amendments are needed to meet these objectives in relation to debt and hardship. The current rules are both unclear and arbitrary. In relation to transfers of overpaid tax there is currently little legislative guidance, resulting in inconsistent treatment between taxpayers. Amendments are required to clarify the rules and ensure equitable treatment between taxpayers. Statement of the public policy objective The key objective of the debt and hardship legislation review and the review of the rules relating to transfers of overpaid tax is to clarify the rules governing taxpayer obligations and the Commissioner’s powers and to ensure a transparent and equitable treatment of taxpayers. Proposals relating to debt and hardship and transfers of overpaid tax were contained in the discussion document Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review. The other measures in the discussion document will not be included in the December tax bill. This will provide time for more consultation and fine-tuning of the proposals. Statement of feasible options for achieving the desired objective In relation to transfers of excess tax, legislation is the only means of achieving the desired objectives. In relation to debt and hardship the legislation will make clear the broad principle with administrative guidelines providing more detail. The current problems are a consequence of the provisions in the Tax Administration Act. Any solution necessarily involves amendment to the legislation. Statement of the net benefits of this proposal Benefits The specific benefits expected to arise from the proposals include: • A reduction in the incentives for non-compliance with taxpayer obligations to assess liability and return and pay tax on time. • The alignment of the compliance and penalties legislation with the intended policy so that the desired policy outcomes can be achieved. • The clarification of the debt and hardship rules, so that taxpayers genuinely negotiating payment of outstanding debt are not subject to penalties, and taxpayers who would be placed in serious hardship if debt recovery was actioned are entitled to relief. • Clarification of the rules relating to transfers of overpaid tax. There is much uncertainty over the existing rules. Costs None of the proposals are expected to impose significant extra compliance costs on taxpayers. The proposed changes to the debt and hardship rules will have a one-off administrative cost and on-going operating costs. The benefits of these proposals exceed these costs. None of the proposals are expected to have significant revenue implications, and a positive revenue effect is expected from increasing incentives to voluntarily comply with taxpayer obligations. Business compliance cost statement The compliance costs on business are the result of trading off the competing factors of equity and efficiency in the tax system and will arise from having to comply with the relevant legislative requirements. The parties affected will be all taxpayers who are required to meet their obligations, as defined in the Inland Revenue Acts. Businesses (small, medium and large) will be affected by the proposals, as will their tax advisers. The compliance cost effects on businesses are difficult to quantify but I consider that the proposals will have a positive effect. The debt and hardship proposals will reduce compliance costs for businesses, principally in the areas of risk, clarity of treatment and quick resolution of taxpayers’ concerns. Under the proposed debt and hardship provisions, decisions on these issues will be made more quickly, meaning that businesses will be able to make their decisions with greater certainty. This will, for example, reduce the impact of tax debt on cash-flow. Clarification of the compliance and penalties legislation based on the recommendations of various Committees will also reduce compliance costs for businesses, primarily in the area of tax debt write-offs. The compliance cost implications of the proposals will be ongoing but the magnitude of these effects will depend on future policies to complement and or amend their effectiveness. Businesses will receive compliance cost benefits from having a clear set of legislative provisions governing the transfer of overpaid tax. The ability to transfer between certain family members, companies in the same group, shareholder/employees and companies, partners in the same partnership, and family trusts and beneficiaries as at the date of overpayment will reduce the compliance costs associated with meeting tax liabilities where overpayments are available in other accounts. Consultative programme undertaken Consultation has been undertaken externally with the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, and various small tax agents. The areas for reform were identified in the terms of reference for the compliance and penalties legislation post-implementation review as well as the reports of the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance and the Finance and Expenditure Committee in their 1998 and 1999 reports respectively. Submissions received on the discussion document have been considered in making these recommendations. October 2001 MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES – BASE MAINTENANCE, ETC REGULATORY IMPACT AND COMPLIANCE COST STATEMENT Statement of the problems and the need for action Five problems are addressed: Unit trust base maintenance As a result of an unintended interpretation of the Income Tax Act 1994, a unit trust manager may have excess imputation credits when it redeems units with the unit trust in the ordinary course of its business. This is inconsistent with the economic reality of the transaction and provides an unintended windfall gain to the unit trust manager. Unit trust negative dividend issue As a result of the application of the company taxation rules to the normal operation of unit trusts, unit trusts are currently overtaxed due to the loss of the paid-up capital that unit-holders invest in the trust. Conceptually this paid- up capital should be able to be returned tax-free. Unit trust remedial issue Currently, a unit trust’s imputation credit account may be inappropriately debited twice when a debit occurs due to a significant change in the shareholding of the unit trust and a debit is made in respect of dividends received by the unit trust manager in that year. Holiday pay Under current law, there is considerable doubt as to the ability of either the purchaser or the vendor of a business to obtain a deduction for monetary remuneration provisions, such as holiday pay. This is an inappropriate outcome. The monetary remuneration provisions have been or will be incurred and generally have sufficient nexus to assessable income so should be deductible. Partnership pensions There is considerable uncertainty as to whether a pension paid by a partnership to a former partner is deductible. If such a payment is not deductible, this is inconsistent with the tax treatment of pensions paid by an employer to a former employee. These pensions are deductible. Statement of the public policy objective The key objective of the proposed measures is to improve the equity and efficiency of the tax system. Statement of net benefit Benefits The proposal to ensure that unit trust managers do not obtain excess imputation credits will prevent a possible interpretation of the law that is unintended and contrary to policy. This proposal will therefore prevent a potentially significant loss of tax revenue. The negative dividend proposal and the unit trust remedial proposal will ensure equity and efficiency of the tax system by preventing the over-taxation of unit trusts that arises as a result of the application of the company tax rules to unit trusts. The proposal to allow the vendor of a business a deduction for monetary remuneration provisions will reduce compliance costs because the parties to the transaction will be able to achieve an appropriate and certain outcome. The proposal to clarify that pensions paid by a partnership to a former partner are deductible to the partnership, will provide certainty and consistency of treatment for pension payments. Costs The unit trust base maintenance and remedial proposals, and the holiday pay and partnership pensions proposals are not expected to impose any significant administrative, compliance or revenue costs. The negative dividend proposal is likely to result in unit trusts paying less tax. This is because previously they have been paying additional tax so they could fully impute returns to shareholders as a result of the lost available subscribed capital (ASC). There may also be some revenue implications from reducing or removing the debit balance where this arises as a result of something other than the negative dividend issue. It will generally be hard to determine when this is the case, but it appears to give rise to a timing advantage only. Consequently the revenue effects of the proposal are unquantifiable, but are unlikely to be significant. There are also low-level administration costs. Statement of feasible options for achieving the desired objective Legislative amendments are required in all cases to achieve the policy outcomes or to provide certainty to taxpayers. The unit trust base maintenance issue arises as the result of an unintended interpretation of current legislation. This interpretation is the subject of a dispute between Inland Revenue and some unit trust managers and may result in litigation. One option was to await the outcome of any litigation on this issue. However, if Inland Revenue is unsuccessful with it arguments, further applications seeking refunds are likely from unit trust managers. This is estimated to have a revenue cost of approximately $30 million. Consequently, given the revenue at risk the legislation should be amended to reflect the intended policy outcome. The proposed amendment will not apply where Inland Revenue knows a manager has taken a different position prior to the amendment being announced. Statement on business compliance costs Unit trust base maintenance The proposal to ensure that unit trust managers do not obtain excess imputation credits will impose some compliance costs on unit trust managers, as they will have to ensure that they do not include the imputation credits in their annual return. However, the additional compliance costs will be minimal. This is because unit trust managers are already required to track imputation credits received from unit trusts on redemption. Unit trust negative dividend issue The negative dividend proposal also has some compliance costs. The funds that adopt the solution will be required to keep a record of the lost ASC in a supplementary ASC account. This account will need to be filed with Inland Revenue together with a fund’s imputation credit account. If necessary, the fund will also need to convert and transfer imputation credits at the end of the imputation year. This step is not seen as being onerous from a compliance perspective. Funds may also incur some additional compliance costs in calculating ASC that has been lost before the legislation is enacted. Furthermore, funds will be able to elect whether they use the proposed solution. Officials consider that the long-term benefit of this proposal (in paying less tax) will outweigh any compliance costs associated with implementing this system. The industry is fully supportive of this proposal. Unit trust remedial issue This proposal imposes some additional compliance costs on unit trust managers that have suffered a loss of continuity, as it will be necessary to check whether imputation credits received on manager buy-backs have been previously offset by a debit at the time of a shareholding continuity breach. However, the additional compliance costs are relatively minor and are outweighed by the fact that this proposal will prevent double taxation occurring in this situation. Holiday pay The proposed amendment to allow the vendor of a business a deduction for monetary remuneration provisions reduces present compliance costs because the parties to the transaction will be able to achieve a certain and sensible outcome without having to structure the transaction to achieve this outcome. Partnership pensions The proposal to clarify that partnership pensions are deductible will not impose any compliance costs. Consultation Officials have not consulted on the unit trust base maintenance proposal given the risk of further applications seeking a refund on this basis being filed. It will be possible to make submissions on the draft legislation at the select committee stage. This lack of consultation is appropriate under the generic tax policy process given that this is a base maintenance proposal. Representatives of the Investment Savings and Insurance Association and New Zealand Fund Management have been involved in the development of the proposed solution to the negative dividend issue. In addition, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand (ICANZ) and Tower have been briefed on the issue and the proposed solution. The potential solution to the issue of the deductibility of monetary remuneration provisions has been briefly discussed with ICANZ, the New Zealand Law Society and three private sector experts. The partnership pensions issue has been discussed with an industry expert. October 2001 PETROLEUM MINING – BASE MAINTENANCE REGULATORY IMPACT AND COMPLIANCE COST STATEMENT Statement of the public policy objective The proposals contained in the report aim to provide base maintenance to the Income Tax Act 1994 to maintain the Government’s current year fiscal provisions. Statement of the problem and the need for action The petroleum mining taxation legislation taxes the net proceeds from the sale of ownership interests in a controlled petroleum mining entity (CPME). The legislation was designed to prevent investors using a CPME to structure around the tax payable on disposal of petroleum mining assets. Officials have identified that these rules do not achieve their policy objectives. Instead, petroleum miners use them to obtain deductions in excess of 100% of the amount of their capital invested in petroleum mining exploration and development expenditure. Statement of feasible options for achieving the desired objective This most appropriate option is to repeal the legislative rules giving rise to this issue and replace them with rules ensuring that the disposal of ownership interests in a CPME is on capital account. Alternative solutions considered were: • Continuing to tax the disposal of ownership interests in a CPME and amending some provisions relating to deductions. However, this option does not prevent petroleum miners from obtaining deductions in excess of 100% of the amount of their capital invested in petroleum mining exploration and development expenditure. • Treating the disposal of ownership interests in a CPME as a disposal of the underlying assets. However, this option would require complex legislation and would require full consultation under the generic tax policy process, as it involves more than base maintenance. Statement of the net benefits of the proposal Benefits Under the existing legislation there is the potential for the tax base to be eroded by between $85 million and $100 million in the 2001/02 income year, with the potential for further significant erosion in future years. The proposal is designed to prevent this from happening. Costs The proposal is expected to be either cost-neutral or result in a small reduction in compliance and administrative costs. Business compliance cost statement The proposal does not involve an increase in compliance costs. It is expected that it will provide a small measure of simplification to the petroleum mining regime and result in a minor decrease in compliance costs. Consultative programme undertaken Confidential consultation has taken place with two industry experts as contractors to Inland Revenue. This consultation has been subject to the secrecy provisions of the Tax Administration Act 1994.
Page 1 9 April 2001 Special report from the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue GST treatment of tokens, stamps and vouchers – amendments to sections 5(11D) to 5(11I) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 The Taxation (Beneficiary Income of Minors, Services-Related Payments and Remedial Matters) Act 2001 contains amendments that affect sections 5(11D) to 5(11I) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act). The sections apply to transactions involving the supply of tokens, stamps or vouchers. The amendments: • Remove the potential for transactions involving the supply of tokens, stamps or vouchers to be taxed twice. • Clarify that “redemption” does not include redemption of a token, stamp or voucher for money. • Extend the “not practical” requirement to situations where the issuer of a token, stamp or voucher and the supplier of the goods and services are the same person. The amendments apply from 10 October 2000. Reasons for change Sections 5(11D) to 5(11I), enacted in the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000, replaced sections 10(16) to 10(17A) in relation to supplies of tokens, stamps and vouchers. Before the rules were introduced a supply in relation to a token, stamp or voucher was generally recognised, if there was no face value at the time of issue, or, if there was a face value at the time of redemption. Under the new rules the supply of a token, stamp or voucher (regardless of whether it has a face value or not) is recognised at the time the token, stamp or voucher is issued. In relation to tokens, stamps or vouchers with a face value, where it is not practical to recognise the supply on issue GST, may be recognised when the token, stamp or voucher is redeemed for goods and services. The changes removed difficulties with the GST treatment of progressively redeemed tokens, stamps or vouchers and aligned the treatment of tokens, stamps or vouchers with the GST time of supply rules. Page 2 The main difficulty with the new rules was in relation to multi-party arrangements, as illustrated below: A multi-party arrangement involving the supply of vouchers In this illustration, the Industry Association issues a stock of vouchers, with a face value, for consideration to a participating retailer – Retailer One. Retailer One records the purchase of the voucher stock in their accounts. A customer purchases one of the vouchers from Retailer One and some time later presents the voucher as consideration at participating Retailer Two. Retailer Two accepts the voucher as consideration for goods and services and in the process cancels it. Retailer Two seeks reimbursement from the Industry Association in respect of the cancelled voucher. In accounting for GST, the Industry Association and the participating retailers agreed that GST should be accounted for when the voucher was redeemed rather than when it was issued. The difficulties with the application of the new rules were: • The potential for double taxation to occur: Although the rules were designed to ensure that GST was only payable once, the wording of the new rules arguably created the possibility, where GST is recognised at the time of redemption, that GST could be triggered on any subsequent transaction after a token, stamp or voucher was issued. Therefore the sale between Retailer One and the customer could arguably be subject to GST. • The meaning of the word “redemption”: There was also an argument that when participating Retailer Two seeks reimbursement from the Industry Association another imposition of GST could be triggered as the word “redemption” was not limited to the redemption of the voucher for goods and services. • “Not practical”: Another problem was that the “not practical” requirement for adopting the redemption basis did not extend to an issuer of tokens, stamps or vouchers who was also the supplier of the goods and services for which the tokens, stamps or vouchers were redeemed. Industry Association Customer (Consumer) Retailer One Retailer Two Voucher Goods or services Cancelled voucherVoucher Voucher $$ $ Page 3 How the latest amendments work Issue or sale One of the purposes of the amendments was to align the GST treatment of transactions involving the supply of tokens, stamps or vouchers with the general time of supply rule, being the earlier of invoice or payment. Therefore the general rule that is applicable to the supply of a token, stamp or voucher is that GST is recognised when the token, stamp or voucher is issued. The amendments confirm in relation to the general rule that GST should be recognised only when a token, stamp or voucher is issued or sold to a final consumer. The legislation achieves this by excluding from the term “supply” the issue or sale of a token, stamp or voucher to a person who will subsequently issue or sell that token, stamp or voucher. Redemption It has been clarified that redemption of a token, stamp or voucher for money does not give rise to further GST consequences. It has also been clarified that it is the bearer of the voucher who redeems the voucher rather than the supplier of the goods and services. “Not practical” In order to recognise GST on redemption of a token, stamp or voucher with a face value the supplier must establish that it is not practical to return GST when the token, stamp or voucher is issued. This exception to the general rule was included to reduce compliance costs. With regard to the interpretation of the words “not practical” in some cases it was considered that the legislation could unjustifiably require taxpayers to change longstanding arrangements and account for GST when a token, stamp or voucher is issued. The amendment clarifies that when the issuer of a token, stamp or voucher and the person supplying the goods or services in exchange for the voucher are not the same person, they may elect to recognise GST at the time of redemption rather than issue. The application of the amendment still requires that there be an agreement between the taxpayers to this effect but now, in the alternative, requires that they are party to such an agreement. The amendment also allows the redemption basis when the issuer and the supplier are the same person, provided it is impractical for the taxpayer to account for GST when the token, stamp or voucher is issued. The following situations are examples of where the “not practical” requirement is likely to have been met: • The supplier of the voucher and supplier of the goods and services are different persons and are parties to an agreement: A member of a franchise chain of foods stores sells a gift voucher to a customer. The voucher is redeemable at any of the franchise stores throughout New Zealand. Neither the customer nor Page 4 the store selling the voucher has control over where the voucher is redeemed. The franchise stores are all party to an agreement to use the redemption method. • The supplier of the voucher and the supplier of the goods and services are branches of the same company: A department store sells a gift certificate to a customer. At the time of sale the department store cannot tell whether the voucher will be redeemed at its store or a related branch. The store and its affiliated branch are legally the same person but have separate accounting systems. • The supplier of the voucher is the same person as the supplier of the goods and services but the vouchers are regularly used as part payment for goods and services: A fashion retailer sells gift vouchers to customers. The vouchers can only be redeemed with that particular fashion retailer as it is the only store of its kind. The vouchers are regularly used in conjunction with cash to purchase clothing of a greater value than the face value of the voucher. Variations of these examples may also meet the requirements where it is “not practical” to recognise GST at the time when a token, stamp or voucher is issued. Nil consideration Some tokens, stamps or vouchers such as those that received in the mail will allow consumers to receive goods and services to a specified value. These vouchers have been excluded from the scope of sections 5(11D) to 5(11I). If a token, stamp or voucher is issued for no consideration, no GST consequences will arise on the issue of that token, stamp or voucher. When the token, stamp or voucher is redeemed the general GST provisions will apply.

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Charities report received

Finance Minister Michael Cullen today congratulated the charities working party on the quality and prompt delivery of their report.

"They were given an extremely tight timetable as they were appointed in late November and had all the disruptions of the Christmas break to deal with yet still made their 28 February deadline.

"The ball is now in the government's court. We will give careful consideration to their recommendations and will come back with a formal response in mid-April," he said.

The working party's principal task was to design a registration, reporting and monitoring regime for the charitable sector, including how it should be administered and by which agency.

"The need for reform is clear.

"Currently there is no reliable information base and no simple means for members of the public to check the bona fides of organisations claiming charitable status and the regulatory framework is so fragmented that charities can find themselves having to deal on a regular basis with at least five different government agencies," Dr Cullen said.

The working party was chaired by the former CEO of Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu, Sid Ashton. Other members are: Frank Claridge, Treasurer of the Royal New Zealand Foundation for the Blind, Gordon Copeland, Chair of the Inter Church Working Party on taxation, Pat Hanley, Manager of the Non Governmental Organisation of Aotearoa, Judith Timpany, Chair of Philanthropy New Zealand, Hemi-Rua Rapata, Chairman of the Federation of Maori Authorities, and Pat Webster, former Executive Director of the Council for International Development.

The report will be available early next week on the Treasury website: [www.treasury.govt.nz/charities](http://www.treasury.govt.nz/)

Trans-Tasman "triangular tax": discussion document released
===========================================================

The Australian and New Zealand governments today released a discussion document outlining proposals to relieve the double taxation of investments in Australian and New Zealand companies that operate in both countries. As a solution to the "triangular tax" problem, the discussion document proposes widening each country's imputation laws to include companies resident in the other country, allocating both imputation and franking credits to shareholders in proportion to their ownership of a company. For more information see today's [media release](/news/2002/2002-03-06-trans-tasman-triangular-tax-discussion-document-released#statement)
 from Australian Treasurer Peter Costello and New Zealand Finance and Revenue Minister Michael Cullen. The discussion document ["Trans-Tasman triangular tax](/publications/2002/2002-dd-trans-tasman-triangular)

JOINT MEDIA STATEMENT

### Oz-NZ governments to consult on triangular tax

The Australian and New Zealand governments are consulting with taxpayers in both countries about possible changes to deal with concerns relating to the taxation of certain trans-Tasman investments.

Proposed changes are set out in a discussion document, "Trans-Tasman triangular tax", released today by Australian Treasurer Peter Costello and New Zealand Finance and Revenue Minister Michael Cullen.

Triangular taxation occurs where Australian shareholders in a New Zealand company operating in Australia are unable to access Australian-sourced franking credits, with the same problem applying in reverse for New Zealand shareholders in Australian companies operating in New Zealand.

"We are pleased to be examining this issue, which business in both countries has long highlighted as a barrier to trans-Tasman investment flows," Mr Costello and Dr Cullen said today. "The release of this discussion document is a further example of the commitment of both governments to the CER relationship and the facilitation of trans-Tasman business."

"Clearly, triangular tax reform requires a bilateral approach that preserves the Australian and New Zealand tax bases and is acceptable to business and government in both countries."

"The mechanism under consideration is one that allocates both Australian franking credits and New Zealand imputation credits to shareholders in proportion to their ownership of a company."

"We are inviting the views of businesses, the tax community and other interested parties on the workability of the proposed changes. Their responses will contribute to the decision of whether or not to proceed with the proposals," Mr Costello and Dr Cullen said.

The discussion document is available in electronic format at [www.treasury.gov.au](http://www.treasury.gov.au)

Minister on NZ economy, trans-Tasman business law

### Speech To Trans-Tasman Business Circle

### Hon Dr Michael Cullen, Minister of Finance

### Sydney, Australia

I am very pleased to have this opportunity to give you my perspective on the recent performance of the New Zealand economy and to describe what I see as the most important features of the economic terrain ahead. Amongst the latter - I am happy to say, as Finance Minister in a centre-left government - are some considered actions by the New Zealand government, specifically:

*   A better balance in macroeconomic policy;
*   A new approach to fostering innovation; and
*   Initiatives on Trans-Tasman business law and taxation.

The New Zealand economy awoke to the new millennium with a more than slight hangover from the 1990s. During that decade, the growth rate improved, but it was heavily dependent on expanding private domestic consumption. That in turn was underpinned by a dramatic increase in private foreign borrowing, and to some extent by rounds of tax cuts. A strong - some would say overvalued - currency put a lot of pressure on export industries.

The end result was that we closed out the century with high private foreign debt, a balance of payments deficit of around seven percent of GDP, and an export sector that was both demoralised and operating with weakened balance sheets.

Two years into this century, the picture is a lot brighter. The Dispirin is back in the medicine cabinet. The economic indicators are stronger, and more balanced, than they have been since the mid 1960s. The balance of payments deficit has fallen to about 3.5 percent of GDP. Inflation is at 1.8 percent. Unemployment, at 5.4 percent, is close to thirteen year lows. Employment growth is strong, but it has been accompanied by an increase in immigration and a sharp rise in the participation rate which, at 66.4 percent, is the highest it has been in fifteen years.

The government for its part is operating with a fiscal surplus averaging around one percent of GDP, and forecast to rise to nearer 2.5 percent over the next three years. We have held government spending as a percentage of GDP, and it is fractionally lower than it was two years ago. Net crown debt has fallen from just under 22 percent of GDP in 1999 to just under 18 percent now.

The economy grew by 2.6 percent in the 2001 March year, and is forecast to grow by 3.1 percent in the current year. It is likely to taper in the next year to around 2 percent before lifting again to something like a three percent rate in the out years.

In short, today's numbers reveal an economy that is growing steadily, with low inflation, rising employment, moderate unemployment, and a current account deficit that is very low by recent standards. Real wages and share prices have both risen. Government spending is at prudent levels, with healthy fiscal surpluses, and manageable public debt.

All of this at a time when the world economy has been through one of its more synchronised recessions, when confidence has been badly knocked by the events of September 11 last year.

After September 11, all optimism must be cautious. However, when the government published its economic and fiscal updates a week before Christmas there was some comment that the central forecasts were overly optimistic, and that the balance of risk was downside. Commentators pointed to a number of short term risks:

*   commodity prices were at record highs, and so it was a long way down to any trough that might be driven by a global downturn;
*   investor and consumer confidence surveys showed significant pessimism;
*   there was a risk of an emerging drought, which would not only impact on agriculture but risk a repeat of, or even a worsening of, last year's power crisis;
*   the September 11 attacks meant that tourism was particularly exposed, and this was a key component of good recent economic performance.

In the event, these downside risks are largely dissipating, and a number of commentators are now revising up their short-term growth outlook as a result of recent developments and what looks to be better news out of the United States.

Export price falls have been matched, and at times outdone by import price declines, so the net effect on the tradeables sector has not been as negative as was feared. Immigration numbers have turned around dramatically, and this has lifted the construction sector. Business confidence is rebounding and the risk we saw of firms retreating into their shells and stopping hiring or investing does not seem to be occurring. Employment was up at the end of last year and new investment is taking place. Consumer confidence is holding up and retail spending is ahead of market expectations. Tourist numbers have bounced back, largely because the composition of tourists has changed. It is raining - too much for the proper enjoyment of summer in fact. Tax returns are even slightly ahead of forecast. And there has been no real implosion or contagion in the global marketplace.

I am happy to concede an element of good luck in these results. We have had good growing weather at a time when commodity prices, especially for the sorts of commodities New Zealand produces have been at cyclically high levels.

One could hypothesize some causal relationship between economic stewardship by a "wet" finance minister and increased rainfall. However, I cannot claim to have engineered the coincidence of good weather and good prices with a rather large drop in the value of our currency, meaning that we had a competitive exchange rate that allowed other exporters, and the tourism industry in particular, to join in the good times.

Good economic management is an important part of the picture, however. One of the first things that the new government did was to renegotiate the Policy Targets Agreement with the Governor of the Reserve Bank. It confirmed that the primary objective of the Bank was to control inflation, and that was good for confidence. But it also required the Bank to be more sensitive to the impacts of its monetary management on output in the real economy in the immediate term. I think that the Bank would argue that it had taken a tough line in the early stages of the new monetary regime in order to make it clear that it meant business and to discipline expectations. As price setters adjusted behaviour around an expectation of low inflation, it could take a more pragmatic stance. The application of monetary policy had evolved to where the new PTA placed it.

For all of that, formally writing in the new practice did reinforce the bank's duty to have regard to the effects of monetary policy on the exchange rate, interest rates and output volatility when setting the Official Cash Rate; that is to keep inflation within the target range, but to seek to smooth monetary policy changes where feasible and to recognise that there will be brief periods where headline inflation moves outside the band for good reason. The basic framework - a focus on price stability and the independence of the Governor in making decisions on monetary settings - remained unchanged.

We also commissioned a review of monetary policy and practice, and that has fine-tuned structures and informed practices. We are tending to adopt a medium term focus for the inflation target rather than the point to point target that might have contributed to some of the volatility of the mid 1990s.

Fiscal settings have supported monetary policy. This government has raised the extra money required to cover its extra spending on social and economic development programmes. And it has introduced a scheme to partially pre-fund tax-funded pensions, so that when our demographic structure acquires the inevitable older age profile, there is a cushion to assist in the transition.

This Superannuation Fund will also have three important macroeconomic effects. It will discipline short-term fiscal policy at a time when a favourable demographic structure might otherwise have tempted governments into tax or spending plans that would be impossible to sustain but painful to reverse. It will increase the level of national savings. And finally, it is likely to deepen capital markets.

The government has also moved away from a passive role in the economy. The late 80s and 90s was the era of the "neutral referee" model of intervention. It was preferable to the crude attempts to rig economic results that preceded it; but as a neutral referee government increasingly found itself presiding over a series of tepid nil-all draws. This government is developing an "active promoter" approach, characterised by smarter activism. To continue the sporting analogy, what will ultimately fill the stands is fitter players, systems for developing young talent, good teamwork, clever strategy and better promotion.

I could cite from a growing list of examples of this "smart, active" style: initiatives in dealing with skill shortages, upgrading the regulatory environment that applies to the electricity and telecommunications sectors, supporting the development of e-commerce, improving the funding of research and development, and simplifying the tax treatment of private sector R&D.

The government's method is pragmatic and case-by-case, as evidenced by the consolidation of the dairy industry on the one hand, and the deregulation of the apple industry on the other. Each was a considered response to the global marketplace.

I want to focus for a moment on our most recent initiative on Growing an Innovative New Zealand, as set out in the GAINZ report. It sets out a comprehensive programme aimed at lifting our game, and raising our sustainable growth rate through innovation.

GAINZ is different in two crucial respects. Unlike, say, a Singapore, it does not place the emphasis on economic results, leaving social dividends to flow at a future undefined time when they can be afforded. GAINZ lays out a pathway where social development and environmental protection not only rank alongside economic growth, but where they actually become agents of that growth.

Secondly, GAINZ blends what I would call the vertical and horizontal dimensions of innovation. The vertical dimension is about addressing missing or weak links in the "chain" of innovation. Hence we improve our scientific and product development capacity. We nurture ideas through appropriate support systems, so that the full range of business disciplines - legal, accounting, financial, logistical and so on - are brought together to convert good ideas into profitable enterprises.

Science, skill, business, finance and trade are connected, and New Zealand is connected with the outside world. Connectivity is a core concept behind the vertical dimension of the GAINZ strategy.

However, it is the horizontal level of innovation that needs more emphasis. We recognise that there are advantages of environment and national aptitude and attitude that need special attention if we are to deepen our business activity. There is no point in a focus on an area of advantage unless it is also an area where the potential of the global market coincides with the potential of New Zealand to sell into it.

We have identified three areas where there is a good fit: biotechnology, information and communications technology, and creative industries. It is important to stress that we are not trying to pick individual industries as winners. Instead, innovative advances in these areas have the potential to complement each other and to thicken value added in a number of industries that use or could use these technologies. In other words, they are sectoral competencies that have multi-industry applications. Where vertical innovation clears the path for young plants to grow, horizontal innovation creates "hybrid vigour" by applying new technologies and ways of thinking across both old and new industries.

The GAINZ report is a "what" document. A lot of the "how" is already being rolled out or is in an advanced stage of development; but more of the how will unfold as work that has been commissioned by the government is completed. It goes without saying that the GAINZ strategy envisions a continuation, indeed an enhancement, of foreign direct investment into the New Zealand economy. We continue to welcome investment by Australian companies, in particular in the biotechnology, information and communications technology, and creative industries.

Cooperation between New Zealand and Australian on science and innovation is a growing element in the trans-Tasman agenda. Our scientists and companies have been collaborating one way or another for years, but recently both governments have taken a closer look at the policy frameworks we need to maximise our strengths in science and innovation in terms of global competitiveness. Bilaterally we are looking at where the impediments to trans-Tasman collaboration may be and how governments can best work together to support the skills and energy in our research and commercial sectors.

I want to conclude by looking briefly at where we are going in the areas of Trans-Tasman business law and taxation. Given the inescapable influence of distance from global markets, New Zealand and Australia have a strong mutual interest in extracting the most from our common market. We have done a lot to open up trade, labour and investment flows, but the potential of our close economic relationship is often frustrated by the lack of cohesion between our commercial laws and practices and our tax laws.

In August 2000 our two countries signed a memorandum and understanding aimed at better coordination of business law. While recognising that a single approach will not necessarily work for every area of business law in both countries, this MOU identified eight areas as possible candidates for coordination. These are:

*   Cross recognition of companies;
*   Disclosure regimes for financial products;
*   Cross border insolvency;
*   Mutual recognition of share markets;
*   Recognition of intellectual property rights;
*   Consumer issues;
*   Electronic transactions, and
*   Competition law.

I think it is fair to say that while a lot of work is going on behind the scenes, in many areas New Zealand is taking unilateral action to make sure its own business law is compatible with Australia's. Our recent Takeovers Code has many features in common with the Australian code, and Australian law is informing our approach to the control of insider trading .

Other unilateral action such as that taken to reduce business compliance costs does not necessarily involve coordination of laws in both countries, but it should benefit businesses on both sides of the Tasman.

A recent initiative of the Australian government was an invitation to our government to develop proposals for the mutual recognition of securities offerings. I am hopeful that the work now starting will result in reduced compliance costs for cross border securities offerings and give investors in both countries increased investment options.

With the best will in the world, events will not always go smoothly, and we both need to be alert to developments that might impede Trans-Tasman business activity. An example is the Australian Stock Exchange's proposal to amend its rules for Foreign Exempt Category listings, effectively requiring all New Zealand companies that want to remain listed on the ASX to comply with the full set of ASX rules, rather than - as is currently the case - a limited subset of those rules. Our government has offered to work with the ASX at a technical level to minimise these costs if the rule change proceeds.

From my point of view the important thing is to recognise that there is still significant unrealised potential to be gained from business law coordination. It requires good will, and continued steady work. If I could add a special plea it would be for our two countries to work together so that business law reform proceeds in tandem, rather than each country working to separate legislative agendas.

Turning to taxation, most of you will be aware that yesterday Peter Costello and I released a discussion document on options for resolving the trans-Tasman triangular tax problem. Previous New Zealand and Australian governments have attempted without success to resolve the longstanding issue of how to make imputation credits available to investors in companies that pay tax in both countries. This discussion document is the first real progress that has been made. It sets out a proposed mechanism for relieving the double taxation that can occur in certain trans-Tasman investments. Referred to as "pro rata allocation", it is a method for allocating Australian franking credits and New Zealand imputation credits to dividends of Australian and New Zealand companies who pay tax in both countries. The advantage of this method over other methods described in the discussion document is that it is consistent with both countries' policies on imputation, which is to apportion tax credits on the basis of shareholders' ownership in the company.

The pro rata allocation method is only a proposal at this point. The purpose of the discussion document is to hear from investors and business in both countries whether it could work and to assess the costs and benefits of proceeding with the proposal.

I confess to being an inveterate optimist when it comes to looking at future economic prospects. We can become very sensitised to the risks in the international political, financial and trading environments. And we can easily downplay the positives that are out there, and take for granted our own strengths. Generally speaking, most democracies have well functioning legal, financial and political institutions, and are well placed to respond effectively to shocks, both political and financial. Technology is opening up both new opportunities and methods to deal with old problems. Public finances are generally in a much healthier state than they were twenty years ago.

Down here, both our countries have these qualities in good measure, and both have weathered the global slowdown and the post 11 September storms better than most. This resilience is due in no small measure to the maintenance of CER, which is approaching its 20th anniversary in 2003. It will be interesting to see if some of the disadvantages of location and scale are turned on their heads, and our countries emerge increasingly as a safe but also profitable location for investment, business location, tourism and lifestyle.

Thank you.

KPMG's corporate tax survey: our note
=====================================

The week has seen media interest in recent comments from us on the KPMG corporate tax survey released in January. The comments were contained in a note the Policy Advice Division prepared for the Minister of Revenue on the results of the 68-country survey. Our note expanded on a point made in the survey report that effective company rates can differ from headline rates for a variety of reasons. Given the interest in the note, we are publishing it in full here for those who may be interested. See [Note on KPMG company tax rate survey](/news/2002/2002-03-08-kpmgs-corporate-tax-survey-our-note#note)
.

* * *

### Note on KPMG Company Tax Rate Survey

#### Company tax rates

*   Headline company tax rates do not necessarily provide an accurate indication of effective company tax rates. This is because the effective rate depends upon the tax base, which varies across jurisdictions. Typically, differences in tax bases occur in areas such as:
    *   depreciation rules,
    *   the taxation of foreign sourced income,
    *   the taxation of capital gains, and
    *   industry specific concessions.
*   Small business tax relief and state or provincial company taxes can also alter effective company rates within jurisdictions.
*   Of note is that New Zealand provides concessionary depreciation treatment (a 20% "depreciation loading") and does not have a comprehensive capital gains tax. These work to reduce our effective company rate.  
    The Tax Review emphasised that competing considerations complicate the choice of a company tax rate. The Tax Review concluded that to the extent company tax is attributable to New Zealand residents, there is a very strong case for aligning the company tax rate with the top marginal tax rate to remove the incentive for individuals to undertake complex tax planning and to substantially simplify the tax system and reduce compliance costs.  
    Reducing further the company tax rate without reducing the top marginal personal rate would increase the incentive for more individuals to undertake tax planning activity and could reduce the equity in the tax system. A reduction in the perceived fairness and integrity of the tax system would be likely to have negative consequences for the New Zealand system that is based upon voluntary compliance. The legislation required to attempt to reduce the scope for tax planning (for example, excess profit retention taxes) would also be likely to be complex in nature and could distort companies financing decisions. Therefore, the Tax Review recommended against reducing the company tax rate without reducing the top marginal income tax rate.  
    However, the Tax Review also stated that alignment would not necessarily be appropriate if it resulted in a company tax rate that was materially out of step with international norms, particularly if foreign investors were motivated by 'headline' rates of company tax.
*   In terms of attracting inbound foreign investment into New Zealand, the Foreign Investor Tax Credit regime, combined with the ability of companies to manipulate debt/equity ratios to take advantage of lower tax rates that apply to debt investment, allows foreign investors to reduce their effective tax rate substantially below the statutory company rate (15.75% in some cases).

### Company tax systems and personal tax rates

*   A low effective company tax rate does not necessarily result in a low effective tax rate for individuals resident in that country. The effective tax rate on dividend income depends upon the interaction of the company tax regime with personal income tax rules.  
    Countries without full imputation systems, or countries with full imputation but personal income tax rates higher than company tax rates, may well have effective tax rates on dividend income that are higher than the effective company tax rate. In particular, classical company tax systems lead to double taxation as the after-tax company profits are taxed again as dividend income in the hands of shareholders at the shareholders' marginal personal tax rates without any credit provided for tax paid at the company level.  
    The following table broadly categorises the company tax regimes in OECD countries. The company tax rate is in brackets, source: KPMG survey.

| Full Imputation | Partial recognition of company tax | Classical |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Australia (30) | Canada (38.6) | Austria (34) |
| Finland (28) | Denmark (30) | Belgium (40) |
| France (34) | Germany (38) | Hungary (18) |
| Mexico (35) | Iceland (18) | Ireland (16) |
| New Zealand (33) | Italy (40) | Japan (42) |
| Norway (28) | Korea (29.7) | Luxembourg (30) |
|     | Portugal (30) | Netherlands (34.5) |
|     | Spain (35) | Poland (28) |
|     | Turkey (33) | Sweden (28) |
|     | United Kingdom (30) | Switzerland (24.5) |
|     |     | United States (40) |

*   Top marginal personal income tax rates for most OECD countries range approximately between 37% to 60%. Actual effective tax rates may be even higher because of additional social security charges and/or local body taxes.
*   It is not possible, however, to determine a single effective tax rate on dividend income distributed to shareholders in many countries because there are often progressive income tax scales as well as different tax rules relating to different forms of the dividend distributions.  
    For example, distributions by UK companies of after-tax profits may effectively be exempt from any further tax if they are paid to specified entities that can distribute income tax-free to UK residents. Conversely, the lack of a full imputation regime in the UK means that after-tax company profits distributed directly to UK residents may be taxed at an effective rate that is higher than the top marginal income tax rate of 40%.
*   Also relevant is that in some countries, particularly those with classical systems such as the US, companies may tend not to distribute profits. In these cases shareholders returns are largely based around increases in value of shareholdings, that may be taxed via capital gains taxes on realisation.
*   Some countries with large disparities between the company tax rate and personal tax rates may also have excess retention taxes that seek to tax profits that are retained within companies in an effort to avoid the higher personal rates that would apply upon distribution. Alternatively, some forms of company income may be attributed directly to individuals and taxed at their marginal tax rate.

#### Summary

While it is likely that many countries with a lower headline company tax rate than New Zealand will have lower effective tax rates on income distributed to shareholders, this is not necessarily the case.

A more relevant comparison would be to compare effective tax rates across countries. However, effective tax rates are difficult to determine and can vary significantly within jurisdictions.

Any change to the company tax rate would have several different effects given the different roles the company tax rate performs, in particular, taxing inbound foreign investment and operating as a withholding tax on income derived by domestic investors.

Government proposes GST changes for financial services
======================================================

The government today announced a proposal to zero-rate GST on services supplied by financial institutions to registered businesses, to allow financial institutions to claim GST on their business costs. It will also delay legislating for a "reverse charge" on imported services until the zero-rating measure is ready for legislation. The zero-rating proposal will be detailed in a forthcoming discussion document on GST and financial services. For more information on today's announcement see the Minister's [media release](#statement)

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Govt to remove gst anomalies on financial services

The government is proposing to relieve the over-taxation of business-to-business transactions in the financial services sector, Revenue Minister Michael Cullen announced today.

"Financial institutions cannot claim GST refunds on most goods and services they buy because the services they supply are exempt from GST. Instead they must absorb the costs or pass them on to their customers.

"The government recognises the problem this creates and is concerned to relieve it," Dr Cullen said.

"We are proposing to zero-rate GST on services supplied by the sector to registered businesses. The effect would be that GST would still not be payable on the services but that the financial institutions could claim back GST on their business costs.

"The proposal developed out of discussions with the industry and will be subject to a further round of consultations. Later this year the government will release a discussion document on the wider issue of GST and financial services, seeking public comment. It will include details on how the zero-rating idea might work.

"Any resulting legislative changes will be included in the first taxation bill after the election. In the same bill we will also introduce a measure to remove another GST anomaly, the fact that imported services are not subject to GST.

"This serves as an incentive for New Zealand businesses to import services rather than acquire them locally. The government's solution is to introduce a 'reverse charge', whereby the New Zealand recipient rather than the overseas supplier assesses the GST and pays it to Inland Revenue.

"We had intended to include the change in the taxation bill scheduled for introduction in May but have decided that it should be dealt with at the same time as the zero-rating measure. The two measures are expected to take effect from 1 April 2004," Dr Cullen said.

Technical information on the proposals is available on the website of the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue at [www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz](https://www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz)

### Speech To Deutsche Bank Investment Conference

### Hon Dr Michael Cullen, Minister of Finance

### 10.00 am Friday 22 March 2002

### Quay West Hotel, Auckland

I am very pleased to have this opportunity to give you my perspective on the recent performance of the New Zealand economy and to describe what I see as the most important features of the economic terrain ahead.

You might say that, as Minister of Finance, it is my job to be an eternal optimist about the New Zealand economy. That is true; but it is gratifying to have, first, good solid reasons for optimism in the form of a good set of economic indicators, and, second, the company of 52% of New Zealanders who, in a recent poll, identified themselves as being optimistic about the economy.

The poll also recording a drop in pessimists to 25%, roughly the number of New Zealanders whose livelihood is derived from the game of rugby. The remaining 23%, I like to think, were out of the country on business.

Turning first of all to the latest economic and fiscal indicators, these show the New Zealand economy to be in very good shape, considering the ongoing reverberations of the September 11 events on the global economy.

The New Zealand economy awoke to the new millennium with a more than slight hangover from the 1990s. During that decade, the growth rate improved, but it was heavily dependent on expanding private domestic consumption. That in turn was underpinned by a dramatic increase in private foreign borrowing, and to some extent by rounds of tax cuts. A strong - some would say overvalued - currency put a lot of pressure on export industries.

The end result was that we closed out the century with high private foreign debt, a balance of payments deficit of around seven percent of GDP, and an export sector that was both demoralised and operating with weakened balance sheets.

Two years into this century, the picture is a lot brighter. The Aspirin is back in the medicine cabinet. The economic indicators are stronger, and more balanced, than they have been since the mid 1960s. The balance of payments deficit has fallen to about 3.5 percent of GDP. Inflation is at 1.8 percent. Unemployment, at 5.4 percent, is close to thirteen year lows. Employment growth is strong, but it has been accompanied by an increase in immigration and a sharp rise in the participation rate which, at 66.4 percent, is the highest it has been in fifteen years.

The government for its part is operating with a fiscal surplus averaging around one percent of GDP, and forecast to rise to nearer 2.5 percent over the next three years. We have held government spending as a percentage of GDP, and it is fractionally lower than it was two years ago. Net crown debt has fallen from just under 22 percent of GDP in 1999 to just under 18 percent now.

The economy grew by 2.6 percent in the 2001 March year, and is forecast to grow by 3.1 percent in the current year. It is likely to taper in the next year to around 2 percent before lifting again to something like a three percent rate in the out years.

In short, today's numbers reveal an economy that is growing steadily, with low inflation, rising employment, moderate unemployment, and a current account deficit that is very low by recent standards. Real wages and share prices have both risen. Government spending is at prudent levels, with healthy fiscal surpluses, and manageable public debt.

All of this at a time when the world economy has been through one of its more synchronised recessions and confidence has been badly knocked by the events of September 11 last year.

After September 11, all optimism must be cautious. However, when the government published its economic and fiscal updates a week before Christmas there was some comment that the central forecasts were overly optimistic, and that the balance of risk was downside. Commentators pointed to a number of short term risks:

*   commodity prices were at record highs, and so it was a long way down to any trough that might be driven by a global downturn;
*   investor and consumer confidence surveys showed significant pessimism;
*   there was a risk of an emerging drought, which would not only impact on agriculture but risk a repeat of, or even a worsening of, last year's power crisis;
*   the September 11 attacks meant that tourism was particularly exposed, and this was a key component of good recent economic performance.

In the event, these downside risks are largely dissipating, and a number of commentators are now revising up their short-term growth outlook as a result of recent developments and what looks to be better news out of the United States.

The net effect of export and import price changes on the tradeables sector has not been as negative as was feared. Immigration numbers have turned around dramatically, and this has lifted the construction sector. Business confidence is rebounding and the risk we saw of firms retreating into their shells and stopping hiring or investing does not seem to be occurring. Employment was up at the end of last year and new investment is taking place. Consumer confidence is holding up and retail spending is ahead of market expectations. Tourist numbers have bounced back, largely because the composition of tourists has changed. It is raining - too much for the proper enjoyment of summer in fact. And there has been no real implosion or contagion in the global marketplace.

As for the government's own accounts, the recently released financial statements for the seven months ended 31 January 2002 showed some encouraging trends:

*   Our operating balance for the period was $385 million higher than forecast, due to:
    *   total revenue being higher than forecast by $248 million;
    *   total expenses being lower than forecast by $52 million; and
    *   state owned enterprise and crown entity surpluses being higher than forecast by $85 million.
*   Our net worth was $443 million higher than forecast, due to the improved operating balance and some revaluations of physical assets (which as a matter of policy are not forecast); and
*   Net Crown debt was $278 million lower than forecast due to higher than forecast net cash flows from operations of $246 million, and additional issues of circulating currency of $153 million. (The latter are also not forecast as a matter of policy.)

I am happy to concede an element of good luck in these results. We have had good growing weather at a time when commodity prices, especially for the sorts of commodities New Zealand produces have been at cyclically high levels.

One could hypothesize some causal relationship between economic stewardship by a "wet" finance minister and increased rainfall. However, I cannot claim to have engineered the coincidence of good weather and good prices with a rather large drop in the value of our currency, meaning that we had a competitive exchange rate that allowed other exporters, and the tourism industry in particular, to join in the good times.

Good economic management is an important part of the picture, however. And I would like to expand upon several important themes that are a focus for my government:

*   Achieving a better balance in macroeconomic policy;
*   Maintaining transparency in respect of the government's budget;
*   A more pro-active role for government in the economy, guided by a commitment to partnership with the business community; and
*   A renewed focus on the benefits still to be gained from the Trans-Tasman common market under CER.

One of the first things that the new government did was to renegotiate the Policy Targets Agreement with the Governor of the Reserve Bank. It confirmed that the primary objective of the Bank was to control inflation, and that was good for confidence. But it also required the Bank to be more sensitive to the impacts of its monetary management on output in the real economy in the immediate term. I think that the Bank would argue that it had taken a tough line in the early stages of the new monetary regime in order to make it clear that it meant business and to discipline expectations. As price setters adjusted behaviour around an expectation of low inflation, it could take a more pragmatic stance. The application of monetary policy had evolved to where the new PTA placed it.

For all of that, formally writing in the new practice did reinforce the bank's duty to have regard to the effects of monetary policy on the exchange rate, interest rates and output volatility when setting the Official Cash Rate; that is to keep inflation within the target range, but to seek to smooth monetary policy changes where feasible and to recognise that there will be brief periods where headline inflation moves outside the band for good reason. The basic framework - a focus on price stability and the independence of the Governor in making decisions on monetary settings - remained unchanged.

We also commissioned a review of monetary policy and practice, and that has fine-tuned structures and informed practices. We are tending to adopt a medium term focus for the inflation target rather than the point to point target that might have contributed to some of the volatility of the mid 1990s.

Fiscal settings have supported monetary policy. This government has raised the extra money required to cover its extra spending on social and economic development programmes. And it has introduced a scheme to partially pre-fund tax-funded pensions, so that when our demographic structure acquires the inevitable older age profile, there is a cushion to assist in the transition.

This Superannuation Fund will also have three important macroeconomic effects. It will discipline short-term fiscal policy at a time when a favourable demographic structure might otherwise have tempted governments into tax or spending plans that would be impossible to sustain but painful to reverse. It will increase the level of national savings. And finally, it is likely to deepen capital markets.

Another important aspect of economic management - and one that is, by definition, easy to overlook - is the rigorous "no surprises" approach to the government's Budget. This year's Budget will be presented to Parliament on Thursday 23 May.

Budgets used to be occasions for intrigue, rumour, speculation and finally grand histrionics on the part of the Minister of Finance, followed by a rush by consumers to stock up on liquor, cigarettes, petrol or US bonds, as the situation required. Now the process is completely demythologised, and most importantly Budget announcements carry no rude surprises and rarely have any measurable impact on the markets. We have left the theatrics to our performing arts industry, and now have a budgetary regime that provides more or less continuous disclosure through regular fiscal updates.

I want to focus for a while on this government's move away from a passive role in the economy. The late 80s and 90s was the era of the "neutral referee" model of intervention. It was preferable to the crude attempts to rig economic results that preceded it; and has bequeathed to us a set of economic playing fields that are some of the flattest in the world. But as a neutral referee government increasingly found itself presiding over a series of tepid nil-all draws.

This government is developing an "active promoter" approach, characterised by smarter activism. To continue the sporting analogy, we are looking to fill the stands and we recognise that what will ultimately do this is fitter players, systems for developing young talent, good teamwork, clever strategy and better promotion.

I could cite from a growing list of examples of this "smart, active" style: initiatives in dealing with skill shortages, upgrading the regulatory environment that applies to the electricity and telecommunications sectors, supporting the development of e-commerce, improving the funding of research and development, and simplifying the tax treatment of private sector R&D.

There are two important features of the government's method:

*   First, it is pragmatic and case-by-case, as evidenced by the consolidation of the dairy industry on the one hand, and the deregulation of the apple industry on the other. Each was a considered response to some careful analysis of the industry concerned and the global marketplace.
*   Second, creating and maintaining working partnerships between government and the business sector is at the heart of the strategy. There is no long-term value in unilateral action by government in economic development, even if it draws upon the best analysis available.

I would like to touch on two examples of this partnership approach. My government has for the last few months been in discussion with the financial services sector on ways to improve the application of GST to the sector. Because financial services are inherently difficult to value, they tend to be over-taxed in countries that have value-added taxes. At present, financial institutions in New Zealand, as in many other countries, cannot claim GST refunds on most goods and services they purchase. This is because the services they supply are exempt from GST. To compensate for their inability to claim refunds, they must absorb the cost or raise their fees. The businesses to whom they provide services cannot recoup the cost, so they pass it on to the consumer. This situation is often referred to a tax cascade. As a consequence of our discussions, we are proposing that supplies by the financial sector to registered businesses be zero-rated. This will mean that these transactions are treated in the same way for GST purposes as non-financial transactions, while at the same time removing the valuation difficulties. It is not an easy measure to design, and the details of the proposal are still being developed. I am confident, however, that the government and the financial services sector can together design a workable regime.

My second example of the partnership approach is the strategy "Growing an Innovative New Zealand", as set out in the report of that name. This is a comprehensive programme aimed at lifting our game, and raising our sustainable growth rate through innovation.

Unlike traditional innovation strategies, it does not place the emphasis solely on economic results, leaving social dividends to flow at a future undefined time when they can be afforded. Instead it lays out a pathway where social development and environmental protection not only rank alongside economic growth, but where they actually become agents of that growth.

Secondly, the strategy blends what I would call the vertical and horizontal dimensions of innovation. The horizontal dimension of innovation recognises that there are aspects of New Zealand's environment, industry-clusters, national aptitude and attitude where the potential of the global market coincides with the potential of New Zealand to sell into it. We have identified three areas where there is a good fit: biotechnology, information and communications technology, and creative industries.

It is important to stress that we are not trying to pick individual industries as winners. Instead, innovative advances in these areas have the potential to complement each other and to thicken value added in a number of industries that use or could use these technologies. In other words, they are sectoral competencies that have multi-industry applications.

The vertical dimension is about addressing missing or weak links in the "chain" of innovation. Hence we improve our scientific and product development capacity. We nurture ideas through appropriate support systems, so that the full range of business disciplines - legal, accounting, financial, logistical and so on - are brought together to convert good ideas into profitable enterprises. We seek increased foreign direct investment, in particular in the biotechnology, information and communications technology, and creative industries. Vertical innovation clears the path for young plants to grow; while horizontal innovation creates "hybrid vigour" by applying new technologies and ways of thinking across both old and new industries.

To move to my final theme, my recent discussions with political and business leaders in Australia illustrated the growing interdependence of the two economies. There is untapped value in our combined economy.

The increased awareness of this in Australia is partly a response to September 11; but also to the acquisition of some major Australian companies by foreign interests. The prospect of becoming a branch economy of the United States, with "hollowed out" companies exercising a major influence on the country's economic well-being, is something both Australia and New Zealand now share. Part of the answer is to build a web of Trans-Tasman companies with a firm base in our common market.

Government is playing its part with ongoing coordination of business law and alignment of tax regimes. In many areas New Zealand is taking unilateral action to make sure its own business law is compatible with Australia's. Our recent Takeovers Code has many features in common with the Australian code, and Australian law is informing our approach to the control of insider trading. And while the proposal to merge stock exchanges has fallen by the wayside, the Australian government has recently invited our government to develop proposals for the mutual recognition of securities offerings. I am hopeful that the work now starting will result in reduced compliance costs for cross border securities offerings and give investors in both countries increased investment options.

As I said at the outset, I have very sound reasons for optimism about the New Zealand economy. It is easy to become very sensitised to the risks in the international political, financial and trading environments. And we can easily downplay the positives that are out there, and take for granted our own strengths. We share with other democracies the well functioning legal, financial and political institutions that make us well placed to respond effectively to shocks, both political and financial. Technology is opening up both new opportunities and methods to deal with old problems.

At the risk of speaking too soon, I would argue that New Zealand has weathered the global slowdown and the post 11 September storms better than most. We have learned to deal with the twin challenges of distance from our markets and a relatively small domestic economy. In fact, these disadvantages of location and scale are being turned on their heads, and we emerge increasingly as a safe but also profitable location for investment, tourism and lifestyle.

Thank you.

A special report by the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue

22 March 2002

### Goods and services tax: financial and imported services

The Minister of Finance and Revenue is considering measures to zero-rate domestic business-to-business supplies of financial services to accompany the introduction of a "reverse charge" on imported services.

Hon Dr Michael Cullen announced today that these measures are intended, respectively, to address two anomalies in the GST system - the over-taxation of business-to-business supplies of financial services and the absence of GST on imported services.

#### Background

The discussion document GST & Imported Services, released in June 2001, outlined a number of reforms including proposals to implement a "reverse charge" mechanism and clarify the place of supply rules in relation to telecommunication services.

Since then the Government has been involved in discussions with interested parties on the treatment of financial services arising from issues raised in submissions on the discussion document. Two key areas of concern were raised in these discussions - whether financial services should be included in the GST base at all and, on the assumption that they should, how the difficulties caused by the current exemption should be addressed.

There are arguments for and against the inclusion of financial services within the GST base. The theoretical argument against the inclusion of financial services is that, in the case of savings, financial intermediation merely defers consumption and, accordingly, should be outside the scope of the tax. The alternative argument is that financial intermediation is a valuable service purchased by consumers and should be within the scope of the GST base.

The current review of the GST treatment of financial services will consider these arguments - but they are unlikely to ever be resolved. Consistent with the broad based approach to GST since its inception, New Zealand governments have assumed that financial services are appropriately classified as taxable consumption and should continue to be included within the GST base.

If this approach continues, the Government has been considering ways in which the difficulties associated with the current exempt treatment of financial services can be resolved. The exempt treatment of financial services prevents financial intermediaries, such as banks, from claiming an input tax credit for GST paid on their purchases that are used to supply financial services. Financial intermediaries are, therefore, treated as if they are final consumers and taxed under GST. Two key difficulties with exemption have been identified. These include the potential for GST to "cascade" in relation to supplies by the financial services sector to the business sector and the incentive that exemption creates for the financial services sector to "self-supply" key activities.

*   **"Tax cascades":** Tax cascades can arise where a supplier of a financial service cannot recover the GST paid on goods and services purchased. To compensate, the financial services provider either raises the price of the service or absorbs the GST cost. If the irrecoverable GST cost is passed on to businesses through higher prices, this may increase the prices charged by businesses for their products. This arguably creates over-taxation.

**Figure 1: How tax cascades arise**

![Figure 1: How tax cascades arise](/-/media/project/ir/tp/news/2002/2002-03-22-government-proposes-gst-changes-financial-services/2002-03-22-gst-financial-services-figure-1.gif?sc_lang=en&modified=20200910060151&hash=E4667385B5CD9EE5287025C7C3F4FE90)

As the GST cannot be recovered from the transaction between Business A and the financial intermediary, this cost forms part of the financial service supplied by the financial intermediary to Business B. This higher cost is then passed through to the products sold by Business B to its customers. Business B charges GST on the higher cost of the product sold to the final consumer resulting in more GST being paid than otherwise.

*   **"Self-supply":** A bias for a financial services provider to provide all necessary services "in-house" arises from its inability to recover the GST paid on goods and services purchased. If the financial services provider cannot pass on these costs, or faces tightening margins, it may elect to reduce the cost of supplies by replicating external supplies internally.

#### Zero-rating of business-to-business financial supplies

These anomalies could be removed by taxing all financial services. This, however, has proven to be extremely problematic as overseas studies, such as that undertaken in the European Union in relation to cash flow taxation, have shown. This is because financial services can either be charged for directly (for example, through bank fees) or indirectly through the inclusion of the intermediation costs of the service in the suppliers' margins (for example, in the interest rate margin). In the case of interest rate margins, the value of the financial intermediation fee is difficult to determine. If the policy decision were made to tax just fee-based income, a high degree of substitutability between direct and indirect charges would remain and would undermine the ability to apply GST successfully to financial services.

Given this constraint, the preferred policy response is to zero-rate domestic supplies of financial services between the financial services sector and businesses. Zero-rating has the advantage of removing the potential for tax cascades to arise without having to deal with the valuation and identification problems that make the application of GST to financial transactions difficult. It also means that a financial service provider's financial supplies to businesses will be treated in much the same way for GST purposes as non-financial transactions. The treatment of financial services supplied to final consumers will remain unchanged, that is, they will still be exempt from GST.

The proposal does not, therefore, change the current tax treatment of bank fees. Such fees will continue to have no GST added to them.

**Figure 2: How zero-rating will work**

![Figure 2: How zero-rating will work](/-/media/project/ir/tp/news/2002/2002-03-22-government-proposes-gst-changes-financial-services/2002-03-22-gst-financial-services-figure-2.gif?sc_lang=en&modified=20200910060152&hash=A34F64875F35F5B7139EB1A22E445B06)

As the supply by the financial intermediary to the business is a zero-rated taxable supply, the financial intermediary will be able to claim an input tax credit in respect of making that financial supply. There will be no GST charged to Business B either directly or through higher prices. Business B will charge GST with the final consumer paying the correct amount of GST on the final product.

Although details of the proposal are still being developed, it is expected that the applicable rule would be that a financial service, as defined in section 3 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act), made by a registered person to another registered person will be treated as a zero-rated supply. An exception to this general rule will apply if the recipient registered person has an activity (other than an incidental activity) of supplying financial services to final consumers. This is because of the tax advantage that consumers would otherwise receive relative to the consumption of other goods and services.

**Figure 3: When zero-rating will not apply**

![Figure 3: When zero-rating will not apply](/-/media/project/ir/tp/news/2002/2002-03-22-government-proposes-gst-changes-financial-services/2002-03-22-gst-financial-services-figure-3.gif?sc_lang=en&modified=20200910060153&hash=307A9A65B39CE5575C1A61A0D4A80C7E)

The difference in this example from that in figure 2 is that the supply by Financial Intermediary A is not a taxable supply. Financial Intermediary A will not be able to claim an input tax credit in respect of the purchases from Business A.

Details on the application of the proposed zero-rating of financial services will be outlined, together with other reforms to the treatment of financial services, in a discussion document to be released later in the year.

#### The "reverse charge" on imported services

The reverse charge will require registered persons to self-assess and return GST on the value of any services imported by them. The reverse charge will apply only if:

*   the services are acquired for purposes other than that of making taxable supplies, and
*   the supply of the imported services, if made in New Zealand by a registered person, would be a taxable supply.

Importers of the services will be treated as if they had made the supply for the purpose of imposing and enforcing the reverse charge and for determining whether they exceed the GST registration threshold.

The value of the service on which GST will be assessed will be based on the either the invoiced value or, in the case of associated party transactions, on the market value of the supply unless the amount would be an allowable deduction to the New Zealand recipient under the Income Tax Act 1994.

Specific to the application of the reverse charge, a New Zealand branch will be treated as separate from its offshore head office. This means that New Zealand branches of a non-resident company will be treated as separate entities. Similar changes will also be made to the GST grouping rules so that imported services between members of a group are not disregarded.

#### Consultation

The public will be given the opportunity to comment when detailed proposals on the GST treatment of financial services are outlined in the upcoming government discussion document, GST & Financial Services, expected to be released later in the year.

#### Application date

The amendments to effect these changes will be included in the first available taxation bill after the general election. The amendments are expected to take effect from 1 April 2004.

Reform of Maori authority tax rules announced
=============================================

The government is to introduce legislation modernising the tax rules on organisations that manage Maori assets held in communal ownership. The policy package announced today includes a tighter definition of "Maori authority", new tax rules based on the company imputation system, and a lower withholding tax rate for Maori authorities. Other changes relate to the "charitable" status of Maori organisations and marae for tax purposes. The legislation will be included in the taxation bill to be introduced in May.

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Tax laws on Maori authorities to be modernised

The Government will modernise the tax rules on organisations managing Maori assets held in communal ownership, Revenue Minister Michael Cullen and Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia announced today.

"The present rules date back to the early 1950s and have not kept pace with changes in tax law," Dr Cullen said. "As a result, taxpayers can face undue complexity and, in some cases, even double taxation."

Mr Horomia said there had been repeated calls from Maori over the years for the rules to be overhauled as, in their present shape, they were probably inhibiting Maori economic and social development.

"Tax rules specific to Maori authorities will continue to be needed because of the unique way that Maori freehold land and other tribal assets are administered and owned, including communal ownership and restrictions on the ability to sell," Mr Horomia said.

The main features of the proposed legislation are:

*   The definition of "Maori authority" for tax purposes will be tightened to include only organisations that manage Maori assets.
*   New tax rules relating to Maori authorities will be based on the company imputation model.
*   The tax rate applying to Maori authorities will continue to be lower than the company tax rate because most members are taxed at a lower personal tax rate. The new withholding tax rate will reduce from 25 percent to 19.5 percent.

Other changes relate to the "charitable" status of Maori organisations for tax purposes:

*   Entities that qualify as charities will not be excluded from the associated exemption from income tax simply because they benefit people connected by blood ties.
*   Marae on Maori reservations whose funds are solely applied to the administration and maintenance of the marae will qualify for a "charitable" income tax exemption.

"The proposed changes have been the subject of consultation throughout the country with Maori organisations and their advisers, and we are confident that they will be widely welcomed by the Maori community," the Ministers said.

The new rules will be included in the taxation bill to be introduced in May.

### Taxation of Maori Organisations

### Questions and Answers

#### Why review the taxation of Maori organisations?

The specific tax rules applying to Maori authorities are complex and outdated. They were last revised in 1952 and, as a result, the rules do not incorporate subsequent changes in tax policy and tax administration, nor do they reflect the evolutionary changes undertaken by Maori organisations. These tax rules now involve unnecessary restrictions, complex processes and high compliance costs (such as tracking income) and, in some cases, can lead to double taxation of Maori authority income. This, in turn, may actually inhibit Maori economic and social development. Over the years there have been repeated calls from various Maori groups for these laws to be reviewed.

The inability of an entity to qualify for a "charitable" tax exemption when its beneficiaries are determined on the basis of bloodlines has been raised by the Maori community as a major concern, although it is by no means an issue limited to Maori. Although Maori organisations often provide benefits of a charitable nature to iwi and hapu, they might not qualify for an exemption because their benefit extends to a specified group of people connected by blood-ties - that is, they fail to meet the "public benefit" test for charitable status. It is recognised that this test seems inappropriate to New Zealand society because it fails to recognise New Zealand's unique cultural groupings.

The tax status of marae was also raised as a significant issue for Maori. Marae have similar functions to churches and public halls but often cannot gain the same "charitable" tax exemption as these institutions because of the "public benefit" test and the uncertainty about whether maintaining marae is a "charitable" purpose at common law.

#### What are the proposed changes?

The key proposal in this package recognises that there is a continued need for a separate tax framework for Maori authorities because of:

*   restrictions Maori authorities face in the development of their assets;
*   impediments which pose barriers to economic efficiency in the use of their assets; and
*   attenuated and ill defined property rights of individual members associated with Maori authorities.

The policy rationale for retaining a separate tax framework for Maori authorities is to recognise the restrictions and limitations placed on those Maori organisations that own and administer property for the benefit of Maori by applying tax rules that take account of these barriers.

These characteristics set certain Maori organisations apart from companies and trusts. The most defining characteristic is the non-transferability of property rights, and this is particularly evident in relation to Maori authorities that administer Maori freehold land on behalf of their owners under the Maori Land Act 1993.

Thus, tax rules specific to Maori authorities will continue to be needed because of the unique way that Maori freehold land and other tribal assets are administered and owned, including communal ownership and restrictions on the ability to sell.

The main features of the Maori authority proposal are:

*   The definition of "Maori authority" for tax purposes would be tightened to include those entities that are the subject to the restrictions and constraints described above.
*   The new tax rules would incorporate a credit attribution system, similar to the company imputation model, and would apply to all Maori authorities.
*   The tax rate applying to Maori authorities would continue to be lower than the company tax rate because most members are taxed at a lower personal tax rate. The new standard rate on retained earnings would be 19.5 percent, down from the current 25 percent for large authorities.

There are a number of second-order issues relating to detailed design and transitional issues that are still being finalised.

#### What are the Maori authority proposals aimed at?

The Maori authority proposals are aimed at clarifying and simplifying tax administration for Maori authorities and minimising the extent to which individuals who derive benefits from these entities must interact with the tax system. In particular the proposed rules should update and simplify the tax processes for Maori authorities and their members and the Maori Trustee. This should mean that there would be less need for these taxpayers to interact with Inland Revenue.

#### Why is the deduction for donations available to Maori authorities being extended?

The current deduction available to Maori authorities for donations to Maori associations is being extended to include donations of money to organisations with "approved donee status". The deduction would continue to be limited to 5 percent of the net income of the authority, but any changes in the company deduction limit should also apply to the deduction available to Maori authorities. This proposal should recognise the greater range of community benefits that are assisted by Maori authority funding.

#### Why is the public benefit test being relaxed?

The public benefit test is being relaxed so that an entity that meets the "charitable purposes" requirement should not be automatically excluded from the charitable income tax exemption simply because its members are connected by blood ties. In determining whether an entity meets the public benefit test other factors must be considered, such as the nature of the entity, the activities it undertakes, the potential beneficiary class, the relationship between the beneficiaries and the number of potential beneficiaries.

In practice, the application of this proposal will require some guidance so that an entity can determine whether it benefits a sufficient section of the public.

#### Can marae be "charitable" organisations for tax purposes?

Marae situated on Maori reservations (pursuant to the Maori Land Act 1993) that solely apply their funds to the administration and maintenance of the physical structures of the marae may qualify for charitable tax exemption.

This measure would not preclude marae or marae based organisations from seeking the general charitable income tax exemption if they meet the common law requirements of a charity (as amended by the public benefit test proposal).

### If I have any questions, how can I get answers?

The discussion document, _Taxation of Maori organisations_, on the website of the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue at [www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz](https://www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz)
, contains details on the proposals. It also contains the history of the Maori authority tax rules and a glossary of the tax terms as they apply to Maori authorities.

A commentary on the bill will be available when the bill is introduced at the above website. The commentary will explain the policy underlying the proposed new rules and how they work. We will be distributing hard copies of the relevant parts of the commentary to interested parties.

#### What Maori input was there in the development of the proposed reforms?

Preliminary discussions on the review's terms of reference were held with key national Maori organisations including the Federation of Maori Authorities, the Maori Trustee, the Maori Women's Welfare League, and the New Zealand Maori Council.

In February 2000, a series of focus-group discussions were held with Maori organisations and tax practitioners to seek feedback on initial policy ideas that the review team had developed. These initial ideas considered the appropriateness of applying company and trust taxation to Maori authorities, and the options for retaining and simplifying the current Maori authority tax rules. Options for amending the law of charities as it relates to Maori organisations were also canvassed.

On 9 August 2001 the Government released a discussion document on the review of the taxation of Maori organisations for public consultation. The document contains proposals for simplifying and updating the income tax rules applying to a broad range of organisations known as "Maori authorities", including marae, runanga, land trusts, trust boards, incorporations, and for Maori organisations seeking "charitable" tax exemption.

To support the discussion document, information workshops were held in 22 regions around the country. The purpose of these workshops was to raise awareness about the proposals set out in the discussion document and to encourage people to make submissions on the proposed changes. Over 1200 people including trustees and administrators of Maori organisations, tax professionals and other interested parties, attended these workshops. In response to numerous requests from people for more time to make submissions, the Government extended the submission closing date from 19 October to 9 November.

Eighty-one submissions were received on the document, from a wide range of people.

The key views arising from this consultation round was that the tax rules for Maori authorities should be simple and flexible in order to accommodate the future development needs of Maori organisations and businesses. It was also believed that the tax rules should be consistent with the Government's desire to minimise, as far as practicable, the extent to which individuals must interact with the tax system. There was a clear preference for retaining a separate set of rules for Maori authorities - but in a more efficient and simplified form.

The Federation of Maori Authorities and the Maori Trustee have had input into the policy development process.

The proposed reforms were developed after consideration of the submissions received and further consultation on the discussion document proposals.

#### What will happen after this?

The proposed changes will be contained in a tax bill scheduled for introduction in mid May 2002.

After the legislation is introduced, it will have its first reading and be referred to a Select Committee, which will call for submissions from the public. This is another opportunity for people to have their say on the proposed changes before they become law.

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Tax bill raises maximum charity rebate

A bill introduced today will raise the maximum rebate for donations to charities from $500 to $630 and will extend the corporate tax deduction to include a wider range of companies.

The legislation will also modernise the tax rules on organisations that manage Maori assets held in communal ownership.

"The present rules date from 1952 and are unnecessarily complex and restrictive so an update is long overdue," Revenue Minister Michael Cullen said.

"The rule changes will affect Maori authorities ranging from small trusts managing blocks of land to the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission. They will also simplify the income tax requirements for people who derive benefits from these organisations," Dr Cullen said.

Other major features of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill are:

*   Further changes arising from the government's review of the taxpayer compliance and penalty legislation, including a new penalty on promoters of certain tax schemes.
*   Further tax simplification measures aimed at small and medium-sized businesses.
*   Changes clarifying the GST treatment of cross-border telecommunications.

"The Government had considered including in the bill the proposals arising from the recent issues paper on mass-marketed tax schemes but consultation indicated that further analysis is needed," Dr Cullen said.

Hon Paul Swain  
Associate Minister of Revenue

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Tax simplification measures introduced

Associate Revenue Minister Paul Swain has welcomed the business tax simplification measures contained in a bill introduced today.

"The Government is seeking ways to involve the private sector in helping businesses to meet their tax obligations with less stress and hassle," Mr Swain said. "Two of the proposed changes in today's bill have a lot of potential for doing that, by allowing businesses to use intermediaries to meet their tax obligations."

#### Pooling provisional tax payments

The bill introduces new rules allowing businesses to pool their provisional tax payments with those of other businesses. Tax underpayments will be offset by overpayments within the same pool, thus reducing the participating businesses' exposure to use-of-money interest.

Commercial intermediaries will be able to set up pools and will arrange for participants to be charged or compensated for the offset.

"Small and medium-sized businesses often find it difficult to estimate with accuracy how much income they will earn during the year," Mr Swain said. "If they underestimate it, they will have to pay use-of-money interest on the difference. The pooling proposal should reduce the amount of interest they have to pay and help remove some of the uncertainty and worry to do with estimating provisional tax."

#### Using PAYE intermediaries

Another simplification measure in the bill makes it easier for employers to transfer the bulk of their PAYE obligations to accredited intermediaries, who will be legally responsible for calculating and paying PAYE deductions to Inland Revenue, meeting return filing requirements and paying employees.

"The proposal was developed in response to employers' concerns about the time they spend keeping up to date with the PAYE tax rules and calculating and paying deductions," Mr Swain said. "And if they get it wrong they risk penalties and interest."

"The measure is intended to help make it easier for small businesses to employ staff. By making the intermediaries legally responsible for meeting the employer's obligations, the measure also reduces barriers that may prevent employers from using intermediaries as well as supporting those who already use them but at present bear the risk themselves," he said.

These two measures are part of the government's continuing programme of tax simplification.

Hon Parekura Horomia  
Minister of Maori Affairs

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Reform of tax laws for Maori organisations welcomed

Maori Affairs Minister Parekura Horomia has welcomed the announcement of the long awaited reform of the tax rules on organisations managing Maori assets held in communal ownership.

"These are very important changes for the future of the Maori estate," Parekura Horomia said.

"They replace a set of outdated tax rules that impose a lot of complexity, and even double taxation in some cases, on the many organisations, large and small, that manage communally owned Maori assets.

"The changes will be welcomed by the many Maori who, over the years, have made repeated calls for these cumbersome tax rules to be updated.

"The reforms will provide greater flexibility for organisations that manage communally held assets and give them access to more efficient tax rules, which will remove barriers to Maori economic and social development," Parekura Horomia said.

The main features of the proposed changes to the Maori authority tax rules are:

*   The definition of "Maori authority" for tax purposes will be tightened to include only organisations that manage Maori assets held in communal ownership.
*   New tax rules relating to Maori authorities will be based on the company imputation model.
*   The tax rate applying to Maori authorities will continue to be lower than the company tax rate because most members are taxed at a lower personal tax rate. The new withholding tax rate will reduce from 25% to 19.5%.

"The reforms also include changes to the charitable status of Maori organisations for tax purposes, in recognition that these organisations may provide charitable services that are often based on bloodlines, through hapu or iwi," Parekura Horomia said.

"Under the proposed legislation, organisations that qualify as charities for tax purposes will not be excluded from charitable status simply because their members are connected by blood ties. This change will apply to both Maori and non-Maori.

"As well, marae on Maori reservations whose funds are solely applied to the administration and maintenance of the marae will qualify for the 'charitable' income tax exemption.

"All these changes are the result of months of consultation with Maori organisations up and down the country. The proposals have been met with enthusiasm, and many people and organisations have made a major contribution to their development. I thank them for that contribution.

"The next stage of consultation is when the proposals are considered by a parliamentary select committee. I urge all those who are interested in this very important legislation to take the opportunity to send a submission to the committee," Parekura Horomia said.

Tax highlights of Budget 2002
=============================

Today's Budget provides an extra $146 million to Inland Revenue over four years:

*   $17 million to fund work on reducing tax compliance costs for small and medium-sized businesses.
*   $4.2 million for implementing new debt and hardship rules.
*   $26 million for audit activities.
*   $98.8 million to maintain the tax base.

For more information, see ["Small business will benefit from IRD's budget boost"](/news/2002/2002-05-23-tax-highlights-budget-2002#statement)
.

The government is considering two options for reducing over-taxation of employer contributions to superannuation schemes: to reduce SSCWT for those earning under $38,000 a year to their marginal tax rate, or to extend the present 6 percent concessional rate for those earning over $60,000 to all income earners. See ["Budget affirms commitment to security in retirement"](/news/2002/2002-05-23-tax-highlights-budget-2002#statement2)
.

The government has made no decisions yet on Tax Review recommendations relating to taxation of inbound investment, exemption for overseas income of new migrants, and the application of the risk-free rate of return on offshore portfolio investment. For more information on the recommendations see our [backgrounder](/news/2002/2002-05-23-tax-highlights-budget-2002#background)

BUDGET 2002

### Small business will benefit from IRD's budget boost

"Budget 2002 provides $17 million over four years to fund further work by the Inland Revenue Department into simplifying the tax obligations of small and medium sized enterprises," Revenue Minister Michael Cullen said.

"For many small businesses, the compliance costs of tax are the biggest bugbear because they do not earn enough to incur big tax bills but have to plough through a lot of paperwork to establish that. And tax design tends to focus on the dynamics of the large corporate, often at the expense of the smaller enterprise.

"Yet small businesses dominate our economy, are an obvious source of economic innovation and offer us the best prospect for raising our sustainable growth rate," Dr Cullen said.

The IRD received a total increase over the four-year period of $146 million. Of the $129 million balance, $4.2 million would go into new debt and hardship rules, $98.8 million into maintaining the tax base and $26 million into audit activities.

"The increased enforcement budget is expected to generate a net fiscal gain for the Crown of $79 million a year, $317 million over four years. This is money the government can invest in social services and infrastructure for the benefit of all New Zealanders."

The government had been considering a number of recommendations from the McLeod Tax Review on the international tax regime. Those still to be consulted on were the introduction of a time-limited tax exemption for new migrants, not on their New Zealand income, but on income sourced from overseas and the application of the risk free rate of return method to offshore equity investment in a private rather than a business context.

Consultation on both proposals would be in accordance with the normal Generic Tax Policy Process, Dr Cullen said.

"I have ruled out the $1 million tax cap proposal as inequitable. I have also been advised by my officials that the proposed 18 per cent tax rate for new foreign direct investment is unworkable.

"They believe it would be impossible over the longer-term to maintain the boundary between new and existing investment, with a potential cost to the revenue of $500 million a year, and that it would not produce benefits of anything like this order to New Zealanders.

"However, before rejecting the idea, I will release their analysis for comment from interested parties," Dr Cullen said.

Hon Dr Michael Cullen  
Minister of Finance

BUDGET 2002

### Budget affirms commitment to security in retirement

Budget 2002 demonstrates the government's strong commitment to maintaining security of income for older New Zealanders, says Finance Minister Michael Cullen.

The budget figures show the New Zealand Superannuation Fund will have reached almost $9 billion by 2005-06 and that the projected surpluses over the forecast period will be sufficient to both meet the Fund contributions and the government's debt targets.

|     | 2001-02 | 2002-03 | 2003-04 | 2004-05 | 2005-06 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OBERAC | $2.3 billion | $2.3 billion | $3.1 billion | $3.9 billion | $4.2 billion |
| NZSF transfers | $0.6 billion | $1.2 billion | $1.8 billion | $2.0 billion | $2.1 billion |
| NZSF balance | $0.6 billion | $1.9 billion | $3.9 billion | $6.3 billion | $8.9 billion |
| Net debt | 16.8% gdp | 16.8% gdp | 16.8% gdp | 16.2% gdp | 15.5% gdp |
| Net debt less NZSF assets | 16.3% gdp | 15.2% gdp | 13.9% gdp | 11.6% gdp | 9.3% gdp |

Dr Cullen said the Fund continued the government's strong record on New Zealand Super.

"One of our first actions on coming into office was to reverse the previous government's decision to cut to 60 per cent the 65 per cent wage relativity floor set by the 1993 multi-party Accord. That added another $21 a week to the married couple rate.

"But even as we have protected the value of the public pension, we have also emphasised the need for people to save privately if they want a comfortable standard of living in retirement.

"The government has concluded that employment based superannuation schemes offer the greatest potential to encourage savings behaviour with the least risk to the revenue," Dr Cullen said.

"Employers' contributions are now generally taxed at 33 percent irrespective of the employee's individual tax rate. The options under review are:

*   to match the withholding tax paid by employers to the statutory marginal tax rate paid by the worker; or
*   to extend the 6 per cent concessional rate now enjoyed by those earning over $60,000 a year to all income earners.

"My intention is make the new regime effective from 1 April, 2004," Dr Cullen said.

Policy Advice Division  
Inland Revenue Department

### Background on McLeod Review international tax recommendations

#### Taxation of inbound investment

The Tax Review recommended that the company tax rate for non-residents be reduced from 33% to 18% and that the non-resident withholding tax rate on dividends (NRWT) be reduced from 15% to 2%. The review advanced two options for consideration. Under option one, the lower tax rate would apply to all foreign direct investment, while under option two (the Review's preferred option) the lower rate would be limited to investment by non-residents in "new" activities.

The Review regarded increased levels of foreign direct investment as essential in order to increase New Zealand's GDP per capita. Foreign direct investment provides productive capital without having to rely on domestic savings, and this can contribute to achieving higher economic output. To be of benefit, however, increased foreign direct investment must produce benefits to New Zealanders over and above the return provided to the foreign investor.

Sustaining any boundary between new and existing foreign direct investment is a key aspect of the Review's recommendation. Officials consider that the lower rates of tax cannot be restricted to new investment except as a transitional measure. Consequently, the annual fiscal cost of the proposal is expected to be around $500 million. While there would be significant benefits to the foreign investor, a reduction in tax on foreign investment seems unlikely to produce greater net benefits to New Zealanders.

As part of the tax policy process, officials' analysis of this issue will shortly be released for private sector comment. The government has indicated that if this analysis holds true following consultation, it will not implement a lower tax rate for foreign direct investment. However, given its importance to New Zealand's economic development, the tax treatment of foreign direct investment will be subject to further review.

#### Exemption for foreign sourced income and tax cap

The Tax Review suggested that the rules for taxing foreign sourced income deter highly skilled non-residents from working in New Zealand and recommended a temporary exemption for new residents from taxation on that income.

An issues paper which considers the benefits and potential design features of an exemption for foreign sourced income is being prepared as a basis for consultation. It will include consideration of options for targeting particular problem areas - for instance, expanding existing exemptions for interests in foreign life insurance policies and superannuation schemes to other types of foreign sourced income. Options for reform will need to take account of any proposed changes to the taxation of offshore portfolio investment.

To attract and retain more high-income individuals to live in New Zealand permanently, the Review recommended that the income tax liability of residents be limited to a set amount such as $1 million. The government has ruled out this proposal.

#### Outbound portfolio equity investment

The Tax Review highlighted problems with the tax rules that apply to New Zealanders investing overseas. At present, offshore portfolio equity investment outside the "grey list" countries is taxed fully on accrued gains under the foreign investment fund rules. Similar investments in "grey list" countries may be free of any New Zealand tax.

The Tax Review recommended application of a risk-free rate of return method (RFRM) to portfolio investments in offshore listed shares and foreign retail unit trusts - no matter the country of investment. This method would levy tax on an imputed risk-free return to an asset, based on the asset's value. As returns to risk would not be taxed, the actual tax rate on these investments would be lower, on average, than if full income were taxed.

However, as consultations have identified capital account investments as the main problem area, the government is exploring whether RFRM could be applied to investments on capital account. Consideration of these issues will be subject to the usual generic tax policy process.
Page 1 A special report by the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue 28 May 2002 Transfers of excess tax The Taxation (Relief, Refunds and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which was reported back to the House yesterday inserts into the Tax Administration Act 1994 a new Part XB. This sets out comprehensive new rules governing the transfer of overpaid tax to another tax type or period of the same taxpayer, or to another taxpayer. Transfers under the new rules apply only to tax that is refundable and that has not been offset by the Commissioner against tax arrears (for example, under section MD 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994). However, when the Commissioner does apply excess tax against arrears, the taxpayer may choose that the excess is applied at a date that the taxpayer could elect under the new transfer provisions (proposed section 173T). A full explanation of the new provisions will be set out in a Tax Information Bulletin following enactment of the bill in the usual manner but, in the meantime, an explanation of, and examples illustrating, the formulae in proposed sections 173P, 173Q and 173R will be helpful to tax agents and taxpayers. The formulae apply to taxpayers who pay provisional tax, and calculate at what date tax is overpaid for the purpose of transfers within the same taxpayer’s account and to listed associates who may transfer as at the date tax is overpaid. Such associates are listed in section 173M(2)(a) – (e) and 173M(3). Sections 173P and 173Q apply before tax is assessed. Section 173P applies when taxpayers pay more than their provisional tax liability and want to transfer the excess. Section 173Q applies in only two circumstances – • when taxpayers who estimate provisional tax revise down their estimate and, as a result, have paid more provisional tax than their revised estimated residual income tax; or • when taxpayers initially pay provisional tax on the uplift basis then estimate down at a subsequent instalment so that they have paid more provisional tax than their estimated residual income tax. Section 173R applies after assessment when a taxpayer has paid more provisional tax than their residual income tax liability. Page 2 Section 173P – Transfer of excess provisional tax if provisional tax paid is more than taxpayer’s provisional tax liability, determined before assessment (1)This section applies in respect of excess provisional tax if- (a)a taxpayer or their agent requests a transfer allowed by section 173L, section 173M(2)(a) to 173M(2)(e), or section 173M(3); and (b)on the date that the Commissioner actions the request, the taxpayer has paid more provisional tax for an income year than the provisional tax payable by that date; and (c)the request is actioned before an assessment is made under Part VI. (2)The excess provisional tax that may be transferred on a particular date ( date A ) is calculated according to the formula: provisional tax paid - refunds - provisional tax liability where - provisional taxis the provisional tax paid for an paidincome year on or before date A, including: (a) voluntary payments made under section MB 6 of the Income Tax Act 1994; and (b) tax transferred to the taxpayer: refundsare the refunds of the provisional tax that are paid to the taxpayer on or before date A, including transfers by the taxpayer or offsets by the Commissioner against unpaid tax: provisional taxis the provisional tax payable by date A: liability (3) The Commissioner must not transfer an amount on date A if, as a result, the taxpayer would not satisfy their provisional tax liability in respect of the income year on a date (date B) that falls after date A, unless the taxpayer requests a transfer back to their account to satisfy their provisional tax liability on date B. Section 173P is the general rule that applies before tax is assessed for the year and when the taxpayer has paid more provisional tax than their provisional tax liability (whether that is calculated on the estimation or uplift basis). This amount is refundable under section MD 1(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994 (subject to its limitations). Whether there is an excess is determined at the time the transfer request is actioned. The formula calculates an amount that is available for transfer at any particular date (date A) that the taxpayer wishes. The formula can be applied a number of times to calculate the excess tax available for transfer at specific dates as requested by the taxpayer, for example, at P1, P2, or P3. When the formula is applied at P1, date A is P1. When it is applied at P2, date A becomes P2, and so on. If the amount is first available at date A and is not transferred at that date, it will be included in the amount available for transfer at a subsequent date A. The Commissioner must not transfer an amount on date A if, as a result of the transfer, the taxpayer would not satisfy their provisional tax liability on a subsequent date before the transfer is actioned. This can apply in two situations. First, when a taxpayer prepays provisional tax by date A and therefore pays less than they otherwise would have at subsequent instalment dates (see example 4 below). Second, when a taxpayer has received a refund of overpaid provisional tax after date A and before the transfer is actioned (see example 5 below). Page 3 If the Commissioner cannot transfer an amount because it would result in a provisional tax underpayment after date A, a temporary transfer is allowed - the amount must be transferred back to the taxpayer’s account in time to meet the provisional tax liability on that date. The following examples illustrate the application of section 173P. The examples relate to standard balance dates unless otherwise stated. Example 1 – overpayment of provisional tax at each instalment date A estimates provisional tax at $150,000 ($50,000 at each provisional tax payment date) but pays $75,000 at each provisional tax instalment date. On 31 March, A requests a transfer of the excess provisional tax paid as at the earliest dates. The total amount available for transfer is $75,000. The relevant dates A are P1, P2 and P3. These are considered in date order because transfers at earlier dates (for example P1) are reflected in “refunds” at subsequent dates (P2 and P3). P1 P2 P3 Amount paid $75k$75k$75k PT liability$50k $50k$50k PT paid = $75k $150k$225k Refunds =$0$25k$50k PT liability = $50k$100k$150k PT overpaid$25k$25k$25k $25,000 is transferable at P1, and if $25,000 is transferred at P1 or up to P2 (as it is in this example), only $25,000 is transferable at P2. (If nothing were transferred before P2, $50,000 would be transferable at P2 and so on). Subsection (3) does not apply to restrict the amount transferred in this example – if $25,000 is transferred at P1, A still satisfies his provisional tax liability at subsequent dates; the same applies to the transfers at P2 and P3. Example 2 – voluntary payment A pays provisional tax on the uplift basis, but is subject to use-of-money interest. A’s provisional tax liability based on last year’s residual income tax plus 5% is $90,000 and A pays the required amounts at P1, P2 and P3. However, A is concerned that this is not sufficient and, in order to minimise a UOMI liability on underpayments, makes a voluntary payment on March 20. On 31 March, A requests a transfer of the excess provisional tax which is $20,000. She wants to transfer the maximum available at the earliest dates. The relevant dates A are the provisional tax dates and 20 March, which are considered in date order. Page 4 P1 P2 P3 20/3 Amount paid $30k$30k$30k$20k PT liability$30k $30k$30k $0 PT paid = $30k $60k$90k$110k Refunds = $0$0$0$0 PT liability =$30k$60k$90k$90k PT overpaid$0$0$0$20k The excess of $20,000 is available for transfer on 20 March. Subsection (3) does not apply in this example – if the $20,000 is transferred on 20 March A will still have met her provisional tax obligations in relation to the year. Example 3 – taxpayer misses P1 A pays provisional tax on the uplift basis and is required to pay $50,000 at each instalment. She misses instalment 1, but pays $100,000 at instalment. After P2, she requests a transfer of tax she considers overpaid at P2. P1 P2 Amount paid $0$100k PT liability$50k $ 50k Section 173P does not apply, because at the date on which the Commissioner actions the request (say 1 December) the taxpayer has not paid more than the provisional tax payable by that date. Example 4 – taxpayer pays excess provisional tax at P1 A pays provisional tax on the uplift basis and is required to pay $50,000 at each instalment. She pays $150,000 at P1. Transfer request actioned before P2 Before P2, A calls Inland Revenue to request a transfer as at P1 of the excess tax paid on that date. P1 Amount paid$150k PT liability$50k PT paid = $150k Refunds = $0 PT liability =$50k PT overpaid $100k Page 5 The amount available for transfer as at P1 is $100,000. Subsection (3) does not apply because a transfer of $100,000 at P1 will mean that A has still satisfied her provisional tax obligations up to the date the transfer is actioned. P2 has not yet passed and it is assumed that further instalments would be paid at P2 and P3. Transfer request actioned after P2 and before P3 Assume that A has made no request for a transfer before P2. A pays no provisional tax on the second instalment date (because she knows that she paid sufficient to cover this at P1.) After P2 and before P3, A calls Inland Revenue to request a transfer - she wants to transfer the maximum available at P1. P1 P2 Amount paid $150k$0 PT liability$50k $50k PT paid = $150k $150k Refunds = $0$50k PT liability =$50k$100k PT overpaid $100k$0 The formula calculates the amount overpaid at P1 at $100,000 but subsection (3) applies to restrict this. If the Commissioner transfers the $100,000 there will be a provisional tax underpayment at P2. Therefore the Commissioner will transfer only $50,000 at P1. (The Commissioner will transfer the additional $50,000 only if it is transferred back at P2). Transfer request actioned after P3 Assume A pays no provisional tax at P3 and waits until after P3 to request the transfer. P1 P2 P3 Amount paid $150k$0$0 PT liability$50k $50k$50k Section 173P does not apply – the taxpayer has not paid more provisional tax than the provisional tax payable by the date the transfer is actioned. Example 5 – refund of provisional tax paid at P1 A’s provisional tax liability is $150,000 for the year. He pays $150,000 (an additional $100,000) at P1 (7 July) and then obtains a refund of $75,000 on 1 August. Shortly before P2 he seeks to transfer any excess tax overpaid at P1 (which is date A). Page 6 P1 1/8 Amount paid $150k-$75k PT liability$50k PT paid = $150k Refunds = $0 PT liability =$50k PT overpaid $100k The formula calculates the amount overpaid at P1 at $100,000 but subsection (3) applies to restrict this because A has had a refund on 1 August (which is date B). Transfer of the $100,000 would give rise to an underpayment of provisional tax as at 1 August. The Commissioner can therefore transfer only $25,000 as at P1. (However, A can temporarily transfer the remaining $75,000 until 1 August). Section 173Q – Transfer of excess provisional tax if taxpayer estimates or revises estimate of residual income tax, determined before assessment (1)This section applies in respect of excess provisional tax if- (a)a taxpayer or their agent requests a transfer allowed by section 173L, section 173M(2)(a) to 173M(2)(e), or section 173M(3) ; and (b)on the date that the Commissioner actions the request, the taxpayer- (i)has paid provisional tax for an income year based on an estimate of their residual income tax and, as a result of a revised estimate for the year, the taxpayer has paid more provisional tax than the revised estimate for the year; or (ii)pays provisional tax for an income year in accordance with section MB 2(1)(a) or section MB 2(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act 1994 and, as a result of estimating their residual income tax for the year, the taxpayer has paid more provisional tax than the estimated residual income tax for the year; and (c)the request is actioned before an assessment is made under Part VI. (2)The excess provisional tax that may be transferred on a particular date ( date A ) is calculated according to the formula: provisional tax paid - refunds - estimated RIT where provisional taxis the provisional tax paid for an income year on or before date A, including: (a) voluntary payments made under section MB 6 of the Income Tax Act 1994; and (b) tax transferred to the taxpayer: refundsare the refunds of the provisional tax that are paid to the taxpayer on or before date A, including transfers by the taxpayer or offsets by the Commissioner against unpaid tax: estimated RITis the taxpayer’s estimated residual income tax or revised estimated residual income tax that would be due by date A for the purpose of calculating interest under Part VII, calculated as if the estimated residual income tax or revised estimated residual income tax were residual income tax and section 120K(4) did not apply. Page 7 (3) The Commissioner must not transfer an amount on date A if, as a result, (a) a taxpayer to whom subsection (1)(b)(i) applies would not have paid, on a date (date B) that falls after date A, the amount of their revised estimated residual income tax that would have been due on date B under Part VII calculated as if the revised estimated residual income tax were residual income tax and section 120K(4) did not apply, unless the taxpayer requests a transfer back to their account on or before date B; or (b) a taxpayer to whom subsection (1)(b)(ii) applies would not have paid, on a date (date B) that falls after date A, the amount of their estimated residual income tax that would have been due on date B under Part VII calculated as if the estimated residual income tax were residual income tax and section 120K(4) did not apply, unless the taxpayer requests a transfer back to their account on or before date B. (4)The amount that may be transferred under subsection (2) may not be more than- “(a)if subsection (1)(b)(i) applies, the net provisional tax paid less the revised estimated residual income tax for the income year: “(b)if subsection (1)(b)(ii) applies, the net provisional tax paid less the estimated residual income tax for the income year. Section 173Q applies in limited situations to transfers actioned before tax is assessed for the year. It applies in only two circumstances in which provisional tax would be refundable under section MB 8 of the Income Tax Act 1994. First, it applies to taxpayers who pay provisional tax on the estimation basis and revise their estimate on or before P3, so that, at the time of the transfer request, they have paid more provisional tax than their revised estimate for the year. Secondly, it applies to taxpayers who pay the first one or two instalments on the uplift basis and estimate at P2 or P3 with the result that they have paid more provisional tax (at the date the transfer is actioned) than their estimated residual income tax for the year. The section does not apply when a taxpayer pays all provisional tax instalments on the uplift basis. (Taxpayers in this situation will nevertheless be able to transfer, at provisional tax dates, the difference between provisional tax paid and residual income tax (RIT) after assessment). In short, section 173Q provides for the transfer of the difference between provisional tax paid and the revised estimated (or estimated) RIT for the year. Unlike section 173P, it can apply when a taxpayer has paid only its provisional tax liability on provisional tax instalment dates. The formula is subject to a cap in subsection (4) – the maximum amount that can be transferred under the formula is the net provisional tax paid (that is, the tax paid less refunds of that tax) less the revised estimated RIT, or estimated RIT. Regardless of the formula, the Commissioner cannot transfer an amount at date A that would result in the taxpayer underpaying the revised estimated RIT, or estimated RIT, that would be due under the use-of-money interest provisions on a subsequent date B if the revised estimated RIT, or estimated RIT, were actual residual income tax and the safe harbour provisions in section 120K(4) did not apply. However, temporary transfers are permitted where the amount is transferred back in time to ensure the taxpayer pays its estimated, or revised estimated, RIT at date B. The formula in section 173Q is essentially the same as that in section 173R, which applies after assessment. The difference is that section 173Q refers to “estimated RIT” or “revised estimated RIT” rather than the actual RIT. \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* Page 8 Taxpayers should note that if they ask for a transfer at a provisional tax date under this section, and their revised estimated, or estimated, RIT is lower than their actual RIT, they could expose themselves to late payment penalties and use of money interest in relation to underpaid provisional tax at that date. \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* The following examples illustrate the application of proposed section 173Q. Example 6 – revised estimated RIT filed at P3 A estimates RIT at $300,000 and pays P1 and P2 on this basis. By P3, it is clear that A’s RIT is more likely to be $150,000. A files this revised estimate at P3, and does not pay any further provisional tax. Section MB 8 allows the Commissioner to refund provisional tax in these circumstances. A requests the Commissioner to transfer the excess provisional tax at the earliest date available. A can transfer a total of $50,000, being the difference between the amount of provisional tax paid in the year ($200,000) and the revised estimated RIT ($150,000). P1 P2 P3 Amount paid $100k$100k$0 revised est. $50k $50k$50k RIT PT paid = 100k $200k$200k Refunds =$0$50k$50k Est RIT = $50k$100k$150k Tax overpaid $50k$50k$0 The $50,000 excess is available for transfer at P1. The formula itself would calculate $50,000 as also being available at P2, but the cap in subsection (4) applies to restrict the amount available to the $50,000 transferred at P1. (Subsection (3) does not apply in this situation. If $50,000 is transferred at P1, the revised estimated RIT that would be due under Part VII on P2 and P3 has still been paid – that is, there is no deficit at P3 because of the excess tax paid relative to the revised estimated RIT due at P2). Example 7 – revised estimated RIT at P2 then P3 A estimates RIT at $300,000 and pays P1 on this basis. At P2 A revises this estimate to $250,000 and pays $75,000 at P2. At P3, it is clear that A’s RIT is more likely to be $150,000. A files this revised estimate at P3 and does not pay any further provisional tax. A can transfer a total of $25,000, being the difference between the amount of provisional tax paid in the year ($175,000) and the revised estimated RIT ($150,000). Page 9 A wants to transfer the excess at the earliest date. P1 P2 P3 Amount paid $100k$75k$0 revised est. $50k $50k$50k RIT PT paid = 100k $175k$175k Refunds =$0$25k$25k Est RIT = $50k$100k$150k Tax overpaid $50k$50k$0 The $25,000 excess is transferable at P1. Although the amount calculated under the formula at P1 is $50,000, this is subject to the cap in subsection (4). Only $25,000 is transferable. Subsection (3) does not apply to restrict the $25,000 that is transferable at P1 – if $25,000 is transferred at P1, A has still paid the right amount of revised estimated RIT at P3 ($0 is paid at P3 because this is, in effect, prepaid at P1 and P2). Example 8 – provisional tax paid does not exceed revised estimated RIT A estimates RIT at $90,000 and pays P1 and P2 on this basis. After P2, it is clear that A’s RIT is more likely to be $75,000. A files this revised estimate after P2, and seeks to transfer the excess at provisional tax dates. Section MB 8 allows the Commissioner to refund provisional tax in these circumstances. However, section 173Q does not apply because A has not paid more provisional tax than the revised estimate for the year. A has paid only $60,000 and the revised estimate is $75,000. P1 P2 Amount paid $30k$30k revised est. $25k $25k RIT Example 9 – revised estimated RIT at P3 A estimates RIT at $150,000 and pays P1 and P2 on this basis. By P3, it is clear that A’s RIT is more likely to be $75,000. A files this revised estimate at P3, and does not pay any further provisional tax. Section MB 8 allows the Commissioner to refund excess provisional tax in these circumstances. After P3, A requests the Commissioner to transfer the excess provisional tax at the earliest date available. Section 173Q applies because the provisional tax paid ($100,000) exceeds the revised estimated RIT ($75,000). A can transfer a total of $25,000, being the difference between the amount of provisional tax paid in the year ($100,000) and the revised estimated RIT ($75,000). A wants to transfer the excess at the earliest date. Page 10 P1 P2 P3 Amount paid $50k$50k$0 revised est. $25k $25k$25k RIT PT paid = $50k $100k$100k Refunds =$0$25k$25k Est RIT = $25k$50k$75k Tax overpaid $25k$25k$0 A can transfer the $25,000 excess at P1. The formula by itself would calculate $50,000 as also being available at P2, but the cap in subsection (4) applies to restrict the amount available to what has been transferred at P1. Subsection (3) does not apply in this example to reduce the $25,000 that can be transferred at P1. If $25,000 is transferred at P1, the taxpayer has still paid on all subsequent dates the revised estimated RIT due on those dates (the amount that would be due at P3 is prepaid at P2). Example 10 – application of subsection 173Q(3) A estimates RIT at $60,000 and pays P1 on this basis. After P1, A is certain he will be in loss for the year. He files a revised estimated RIT of $0 and seeks a refund of the $20,000. At P2, the business situation has improved dramatically for A and he files a further revised estimated RIT of $60,000. He pays $40,000 at P2. By P3 he considers his estimated RIT will be $30,000. He files a further revised estimate and pays nothing at P3. Section MB 8 allows the Commissioner to refund provisional tax in these circumstances. A requests the Commissioner to transfer the excess provisional tax at the earliest date available. A can transfer a total of $10,000, being the difference between the net provisional tax paid in the year ($40,000) and the revised estimated RIT ($30,000). P1 31/8 P2 P3 Amount paid $20k -$20k$40k$0 revised est. $10k $10k$10k RIT PT paid = $20k$20k $60k$60k Refunds =$0$20k$20k$30k Est RIT = $10k$10k$20k$30k Tax overpaid $10k$20k$0 The formula itself would calculate $10,000 as available for transfer at P1. However, the transfer of this amount is restricted because subsection (3) applies. If the $10,000 were transferred at P1, on 31 August A would not have paid the estimated RIT that would be due on that date ($10,000). Therefore nothing can be transferred permanently at P1 (this is reflected in “refunds” at P2, which comprises only the $20,000 refunded on 31 August). A could however temporarily transfer the $10,000 if it is transferred back by 31 August. Page 11 $10,000 is available for transfer at P2 (the formula calculates $20,000 overpaid at P2 but the cap in subsection (4) applies to restrict this to $10,000). Subsection (3) does not apply to restrict the transfer of the $10,000 at P2 because nothing is due on P3. (The $40,000 payment at P2 covers the $10,000 that would be due at each of P1, P2 and P3 plus the $10,000 transferred.) Section 173R – Transfer of excess tax if provisional tax is more than taxpayer’s residual income tax, determined after assessment (1)This section applies in respect of excess tax if- (a)a taxpayer or their agent requests a transfer allowed by section 173L, section 173M(2)(a) to 173M(2)(e) , or section 173M(3) ; and (b)on the date that the Commissioner actions the request, the taxpayer has paid more provisional tax than the taxpayer’s residual income tax for an income year. (2)The excess provisional tax that may be transferred on a particular date (date A ) is calculated according to the formula: provisional tax paid - refunds - residual income tax where- provisional taxis the provisional tax paid for the income paidyear on or before date A, including: (a) voluntary payments made under section MB 6 of the Income Tax Act 1994; and (b) tax transferred to the taxpayer: refundsare the refunds of the provisional tax that are paid to the taxpayer on or before date A, including transfers by the taxpayer or offsets by the Commissioner against unpaid tax: residual income taxis the taxpayer’s residual income tax that would be due by date A for the purpose of calculating interest under Part VII, calculated as if section 120K(4) did not apply: (3)The Commissioner must not transfer an amount on date A if, as a result, the taxpayer would be liable to pay interest on unpaid tax under Part VII or would have a late payment penalty imposed under Part IX in respect of their provisional tax payments for the income year on a date (date B) that falls after date A, unless the taxpayer requests a transfer back to their account so as to prevent interest or a late payment penalty being imposed on date B in respect of their provisional tax payments. (4)The amount that may be transferred under subsection (2) may not be more than the net provisional tax paid for an income year less the residual income tax for the year. Section 173R applies once tax has been assessed, if the provisional tax paid exceeds the residual income tax for the year. The formula in subsection (2) calculates the amount that is available for transfer on a particular date (date A) which can be any date the taxpayer chooses. The total excess that may be transferred under the formula is capped at the net provisional tax paid for the year less the residual income tax for the year. Under subsection (3), the Commissioner cannot transfer an amount at date A when that would result in the taxpayer incurring use-of-money interest on unpaid tax, or a late payment penalty, at a subsequent date (date B). This will apply to restrict a transfer where, for example, subsequent to date A there was a refund or transfer of provisional tax, or if Page 12 provisional tax for the year was prepaid by date A. The examples set out below illustrate the application of proposed section 173R. Example 11 – equal provisional tax instalments: RIT = $0 A Co pays $20,000 provisional tax at each of P1, P2, P3 on the uplift or estimation basis. A Co is assessed as having a loss for the year. The total credit available for transfer is $60,000, being the difference between the provisional tax paid ($60,000) and the residual income tax ($0). A asks for this amount to be transferred at the earliest dates. The amount that may be transferred at the first, second and third provisional tax dates is calculated as follows: P1 P2 P3 Amount paid $20k$20k$20k RIT due$0 $0$0 PT paid =20k $40k$60k Refunds =$0$20k$40k RIT =$0$0$0 Tax overpaid $20k$20k$20k A may transfer $20,000 at each of P1, P2 and P3 (this is reflected in “refunds” at P2 and P3). Subsection (3) does not apply to restrict the amount transferred at any of those dates because transfer of those amounts would not result in late payment penalties or interest arising in relation to the provisional tax payments. If, instead of transferring at the provisional tax payment dates above, A wanted to transfer the excess to her first provisional tax date (7 July) for the following year, she would calculate the amount available at that date, which is $60,000. Example 12 – equal provisional tax payments with RIT A Co estimates its provisional tax and pays $120,000 at P1, P2 and P3. RIT is $300,000. The total excess available for transfer is $60,000 being the difference between provisional tax paid ($360,000) and RIT ($300,000). A Co wants to transfer the excess at the earliest dates. P1P2P3 Amount paid $120k$120k$120k RIT/3$100k$100k$100k PT paid =$120k$240k$360k Refunds =$0$20k$40k RIT =$100k$200k$300k Tax overpaid $20k$20k$20k A Co has overpaid $20,000 at each instalment and can transfer at those dates. Page 13 Example 13 – no provisional tax payment at P3 A estimates its RIT at $300,000 and pays instalments due on P1 and P2 on this basis. By P3, it is clear that A’s RIT is more likely to be $150,000. A files this revised estimate at P3, and doesn’t pay any further provisional tax. A’s return is assessed and his RIT is $150,000. A can transfer a total of $50,000 (being provisional tax paid of $200,000 less the RIT of $150,000). A wants to transfer this at the earliest date. P1 P2 P3 Amount paid $100k$100k$0 RIT/3$50k $50k$50k PT paid = 100k $200k$200k Refunds =$0$50k$50k RIT = $50k$100k$150k Tax overpaid $50k$50k$0 A can transfer the $50,000 on P1. The formula would calculate $50,000 as overpaid at P2, but A has already transferred the maximum at P1, so the cap in subsection (4) would apply to prevent this. (If A had transferred nothing at P1, the formula would calculate $100,000 available at P2 – again the cap in subsection (4) would apply). Subsection (3) does not apply to restrict the transfer at P1 as the transfer would not result in late payment penalties or interest arising at a subsequent date. Example 14 – no provisional tax payment at P3 A pays provisional tax on the uplift basis. It paid its liability of $20,000 on P1 and P2 but misses P3. The residual income tax is $15,000. The total excess that may be transferred is $25,000 being provisional tax paid ($40,000) less RIT ($15,000). A wishes to transfer the excess at the earliest date. P1P2P3 Amount paid $20k$20k$0 RIT/3$5k$5k$5k PT paid =$20k$40k$40k Refunds =$0$15k$25k RIT =$5k$10k $15k Tax overpaid $15k$15k$0 A can, and does, transfer $15k at P1 (see “refunds” at P2) and $10,000 on P2. (The formula itself calculates $15,000 available at P2 but the amount transferable is restricted to $10,000 by the cap in subsection (4).) Subsection (3) does not apply to restrict either transfer. (If $15,000 is transferred at P1, the RIT due subsequently is paid by the due date under Part VII. The same applies to the $10,000 transferred on P2.) Page 14 Example 15 – taxpayer misses P2 – application of subsection (3) A pays provisional tax on the uplift basis, but he is subject to use-of-money interest. He paid his liability of $20,000 on P1, missed the payment due on P2, and paid $20,000 on P3. His RIT is $15,000. The total excess that may be transferred is $25,000 (being tax paid of $40,000 less the RIT of $15,000). A wants to transfer the maximum available at the earliest dates. P1P2P3 Amount paid $20k$0$20k RIT/3$5k$5k$5k PT paid =$20k$20k$40k Refunds =$0$10k$10k RIT =$5k$10k $15k Tax overpaid $15k$0$15k P1 is considered first. The formula calculates $15,000 available at P1. However subsection (3) applies to limit this. If the $15,000 were transferred the taxpayer would be liable for late payment penalties and interest at P2. Therefore only $10,000 is transferable at P1 (though the additional $5,000 may be transferred out and back by P2). $10,000 is transferred at P1 (reflected in “refunds” at P2 and P3), the remaining $15,000 is transferred at P3. Example 16 – taxpayer misses P2 – application of subsection (3) A pays its provisional tax liability of $20,000 on P1, but misses P2 and pays $20,000 on P3. RIT is $30,000. The total excess transferable is $10,000, being the difference between provisional tax paid ($40,000) and the RIT ($30,000). The formula below calculates when the excess may be transferred. A wants to transfer the excess at the earliest dates. P1P2P3 Amount paid $20k$0$20k RIT/3$10k$10k$10k PT paid =$20k$20k$40k Refunds =$0$0$0 RIT = $10k$20k$30k Tax overpaid $10k$0$10k The formula calculates $10,000 available for transfer at P1 but subsection (3) applies to restrict that amount to zero (reflected in “refunds” at P2) because that would result in late payment penalties, and perhaps use-of-money interest, at P2. However, A can temporarily transfer the $10,000 at P1 provided it is back in by P2. The $10,000 is available for permanent transfer only at P3. Page 15 Example 17 – taxpayer increasing estimate at P2 A Co estimates its provisional tax at $300,000. It pays $100,000 on P1 then reestimates to $450,000 at P2 and pays $200,000 at P2 and $150,000 at P3. The RIT is $300,000. The excess that may be transferred is $150,000 ($450,000 - $300,000). A Co wants to transfer at the earliest date in each of the variations below. P1P2P3 Amount paid $100k$200k$150k RIT/3$100k$100k$100k PT paid =$100k$300k$450k Refunds =$0$0$100k RIT =$100k$200k$300k Tax overpaid $0$100k$50k A Co. can transfer $100,000 at P2 and, if it does so, $50,000 at P3. If it does not transfer anything before P3, $150,000 would be transferable on P3. Example 18 – taxpayer decreasing estimate at P2 A Co estimates its provisional tax at $300,000. It pays P1 of $100,000 then reestimates to $200,000 at P2 and pays $33,333 at P2 and $66,667 at P3. The residual income tax is $150,000. The total excess transferable is $50,000 (provisional tax paid of $200,000 less residual income tax of $150,000). A Co wants to transfer the excess at the earliest dates. P1P2P3 Amount paid $100k$33,333$66,667 RIT/3$50k$50k$50k PT paid =$100k$133,333$200k Refunds =$0$ 33,333$33,333 RIT =$50k$100,000$150k Tax overpaid $50k$0$16,667 A Co can transfer only $33,333 on P1. (The formula calculates $50,000 available at P1 but subsection (3) applies to reduce the amount transferable at P1 to $33,333 because transfer of the $50,000 will result in late payment penalties or interest at P2. However, A can temporarily transfer the remaining $16,667 until P2.) The balance of the total excess, $16,667, can be permanently transferred on P3. Page 16 Example 19 – taxpayer pays terminal tax then reassessment A paid $600,000 provisional tax and $100,000 terminal tax for the 2002-2003 year. The original RIT was $700,000. A is reassessed for that year - RIT after reassessment is $450,000. The total excess provisional tax transferable is $150,000 ($600,000 provisional tax paid less $450,000 RIT). Excess terminal tax is $100,000. P1P2P3TT Amount paid $200k$200k$200k$100k RIT/3$150k$150k$150k PT paid =$200k$400k$600k Refunds =$0$50k$100k RIT =$150k$300k$450k Tax overpaid $50k$50k$50k $100k $50,000 is available at each of P1, P2 and P3 (plus $100,000 on the terminal tax date). Example 20 – taxpayer receives refund of excess provisional tax after P2 A Co estimates its provisional tax at $300,000. It pays P1 of $100,000 then reestimates at P2 to $40,000. It pays nothing at P2 and P3 and seeks a refund after P2 of $60,000. RIT is $30,000. The total excess available for transfer is $10,000 (the difference between net provisional tax paid of $40,000 ($100,000 - $60,000) and RIT of $30,000) .

(The formula calculates $90,000 available for transfer at P1, and $70,000 at P2, but the cap in subsection (4) applies to restrict this to $10,000.) Page 17 Example 21 – taxpayer receives refund of excess provisional tax before P2 A Co estimates its provisional tax at $300,000. It pays P1 of $100,000 then reestimates in September to $40,000 and seeks a refund of $60,000 before P2. It pays nothing at P2 and P3. The RIT is $30,000. The total excess available for transfer is $10,000 (net provisional tax paid of $40,000 less RIT of $30,000).

(The formula calculates $90,000 available for transfer at P1, and $10,000 at P2, but the cap in subsection (4) applies to restrict this to $10,000.) Example 22 – taxpayer receives refund of excess provisional tax after P2 but offsetting excess at P2 A Co estimates its provisional tax at $300,000. It pays $100,000 at P1 and P2 and then reestimates in December to $140,000. It seeks a refund after P2 of $60,000 and pays nothing at P3. RIT is $30,000. The total excess available for transfer is $110,000 (being the difference between net provisional tax paid of $140,000 and RIT of $30,000).

It is a new provisional taxpayer and is required to pay two equal instalments of provisional tax (section MB 4(2)(a)). It pays $30,000 on November 7 (P1) and $30,000 on March 7 (P2). It also makes a voluntary payment on 31 March of $10,000. RIT is $50,000. The total excess available for transfer is $20,000 (being the difference between provisional tax paid of $70,000 and RIT of $50,000).

Tax change for superyacht crews

The government is introducing a law change to exempt crews of visiting superyachts from New Zealand income tax, America's Cup Minister Trevor Mallard announced today. Once enacted, the change will be effective from today. For more information, see the government's [media statement](/news/2002/2002-05-28-tax-change-superyacht-crews#statement)

Hon Trevor Mallard  
Minister for the America's Cup

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Tax change for superyacht crews

Cabinet has agreed to a tax change, effective immediately, that will exempt crewmembers of visiting superyachts from paying New Zealand income tax.

The change was brought about after representation from the Marine Industry, who feared their sector would lose millions of dollars of income as a result of superyachts not staying for refits in New Zealand.

"This decision has been made on a sound economic basis," Minister for the America's Cup Trevor Mallard said today.

"While the crewmembers themselves are undertaking employment for reward in New Zealand, the yachts upon which they serve are in New Zealand only for the private and domestic purposes of their owners. They are not here to conduct business.

"Yet there is evidence that the way we tax the crews of the yachts while they are in New Zealand was causing the superyachts to spend less time in New Zealand than they otherwise might have. As a result the marine industry was missing out on refits that could last many months.

"New Zealand's boat builders and refitters are among the best in the world. They have a reputation for quality and innovation that is seeing New Zealand become the preferred South Pacific destination for superyachts needing maintenance and refitting.

"The government had two choices: keep the tax law the same, and have the yachts and the refit business leave the country or change the tax laws, keep the vessels here and have it flourish. That is what drove our decision.

"To remove the barrier, the government has decided to change the law so that superyacht crewmembers are exempt from New Zealand income tax if the yacht is in New Zealand for private and domestic purposes," Trevor Mallard said.

Details of the legislation will be worked-out with industry representatives and then included in one of the taxation bills currently before Parliament. Once enacted, the change will be effective from today.

### Tax change for superyacht crews

### Questions and answers

**Why do the crew of visiting super-yachts have to pay NZ income tax?**  
All non-residents temporarily employed in New Zealand are generally subject to our income tax laws. There is a limited exception for persons (other than some entertainers) who are in New Zealand for less than 92 days and are employed by a non-resident - provided their income is taxable in their country of residence. Bilateral tax treaties can modify these rules.

**Will the tax change apply to other people, such as entertainers, who are also in New Zealand temporarily?**  
No. Non-residents who come to New Zealand for commercial reasons (including entertainers) will continue to be subject to the existing rules.

**If we don't tax the crews and there is no GST on the work done on the yachts, what does New Zealand stand to gain out of this arrangement?**  
The New Zealand economy gets the benefits of any refit or maintenance work undertaken on a yacht that would otherwise have gone elsewhere, plus any spending by the crews. The government benefits from income tax on the providers of refits, PAYE on the wages of refit workers and any GST on purchases by the crews.

**Do super-yacht crews visiting other countries have to pay income tax there?**  
Our understanding is that the laws applying to super-yachts are pretty much the same everywhere: income tax applies, but with significant local variations around things like exemptions for short-term stays and income thresholds that apply before tax is imposed. Whether they are actively enforced is another matter.

**Is the law change just a tax concession?**  
No. Because the superyachts are in New Zealand for private purposes, the proposed change also reflects the practical reality that the employment of crew on superyachts visiting New Zealand has no meaningful connection with New Zealand. Taxing crew of superyachts just doesn't make sense if they can escape the tax so easily by leaving New Zealand on their yachts and going elsewhere for their refits - possibly Australia. In that case, New Zealand won't collect any PAYE. Nor will it get the refit and tourism business that superyachts bring to New Zealand.

**Will this change create a tax loophole?**  
No. It is intended that this change will have very limited application. But the government will be keeping a close eye on its application in practice. If it transpires that this new law is being used for tax avoidance purposes the government will review its scope and application.

**When will the change be enacted?**  
The law change will have effect from the date of announcement. The government will move as quickly as the legislative programme will allow to enact these changes. We will include them in a tax bill that is currently before Parliament's Finance and Expenditure Committee. It is uncertain, at this stage, exactly when that bill will become law.

Minister on the economy, tax policy work programme
==================================================

In a speech last night, Finance and Revenue Minister Michael Cullen outlined the government's economic priorities and key items on the tax policy work programme. For more information see Dr Cullen's [speech](/news/2002/2002-06-20-minister-economy-tax-policy-work-programme#speech)

### Address to ANZ Client Function

### Hon Dr Michael Cullen, Minister of Finance

Wednesday 19 June 2002  
St James Theatre, Wellington

I would like to focus my remarks today on the territory the economy has traversed in the last three years, and the economic priorities - including taxation reform - for the next three years.

Without doubt the economic situation we inherited in 1999 was fragile and somewhat unbalanced. The outlook published the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Update in 1999, was for subdued economic growth of 2.3 percent in the year to March 2000, and employment growth at a modest 1.1 percent. Unemployment was forecast to remain at an uncomfortable 7 percent, inflation at 2.7 percent, and the Balance of Payments a very unhealthy 8.3 percent of GDP.

This situation has been largely turned around in the last three years. The budget this year forecast growth to March 2003 at a much healthier 3.1 percent, employment growth nearly doubled compared with 1999 at 2 percent, and the unemployment rate a more respectable 5.4 percent. Forecast inflation is largely unchanged at 2.5 percent, and the Balance of Payments deficit dramatically lower at 4.4 percent of GDP.

The economy has advanced on a broad front, and all the key indicators have improved.

It is particularly pleasing to see that 100,000 new jobs have been created, the bulk of them full time. The unemployment rate has fallen, and the better prospects for finding jobs have meant that more and more people are looking for them. As a result, the participation rate - the proportion of people looking for work out of the working age population - is now at its highest level since this survey started. Ironically it is only this increase in the numbers seeking work that is stopping the unemployment rate falling even faster.

It is particularly gratifying for me as a Labour finance minister to see that this growth has been achieved alongside better protections for workers through increases in the minimum wage and the passage of the Employment Relations Act.

It is also salutary to note that, despite the dire prophecies from economic commentators on the right, higher wages and better protections have not fuelled inflation. Instead, more people working their hours of choice in better paid jobs has seen a lift in the total value of wages - by more than ten percent above the rate of inflation.

A lift in the real incomes of working New Zealand families of this order has not been seen in many decades. This is without doubt a major contributor to the persistently robust levels of economic confidence recorded in opinion surveys.

Through this period the government's own fiscal situation has been prudently managed. We have managed major spending initiatives - raising the floor for New Zealand Superannuation, reintroducing income related rents for low-income state house tenants and easing the student loan burden of students - without weakening the government's finances.

Compared to 1999, the government's finances are in a very strong position. The 1999 PREFU envisaged a balanced budget in the year to June 2000, alongside a gross debt of 34.1 percent of GDP and net debt of 22.4 percent. In the year to June 2003, the operating surplus is forecast at 1.8 percent of GDP, gross debt is scheduled to fall to 28.6 percent and net debt to 16.8 percent.

Thus we have materially improved the public accounts, and in addition have put aside money to protect the future of New Zealand Superannuation: by 30 June next year there will be $1,890 million in the New Zealand Superannuation Fund.

Of course, our critics and opponents have been quick to label this government as "lucky". This claim is without justification. It is true that the New Zealand economy has benefited from high commodity prices, good growing conditions and a low dollar. But in fact just as much of the luck has been running the other way.

The world economy has been in one of its longest and most broadly based stagnations since the oil crises of the 1970s. The events of 11 September jolted confidence and disrupted tourism. There was a winter drought that reduced electricity-generating capacity. The rapid decline in the New Zealand dollar led to accusations that investors had lost confidence in New Zealand.

History would have suggested that the conjunction of both external factors, impacting on trading, and internal factors, impacting on confidence, would lead to a sharp downturn in activity, such as occurred after the 1997 Asian economic crisis. This did not occur, and luck had nothing to do with it.

The government knew it had to go onto the front foot in a range of areas:

*   We amended the Policy Targets Agreement with the Reserve Bank Governor to require the Bank to be more sensitive to output volatility.
*   We made a conscious decision to allow the automatic fiscal stabilisers to work to avoid exacerbating fluctuations in the business cycle.
*   We initiated a detailed policy dialogue with business, local government and other stakeholder groups to shore up confidence and develop a shared analysis of the problems confronting the economy.
*   We reinforced confidence in the export orientation of policy through an ambitious approach to bi-lateral closer economic partnerships.
*   We moved to a more active immigration policy to address short-term skill gaps.
*   We indicated an intention to deepen capital markets through the diversification of the GSF and NDF, and the establishment of the NZSF; and
*   We upgraded regulatory regimes to bring them into line with best commercial practice.

There were also some pragmatic, problem solving solutions to specific issues:

*   Facilitating the Fonterra merger to permit that industry to evolve along the lines sought by its farmer owners.
*   Recapitalising Air New Zealand.
*   Initiating a save electricity campaign to head off potential power outages.
*   Engaging on options for Auckland's traffic congestion problems, and
*   Financing programmes to leverage the advantages to be reaped from Lord of the Rings and America's Cup attention.

If we are to attribute the current state of the economy to luck, then I can only remind you of the old golfer's adage, that the more skilful players are the ones who attract all the lucky breaks.

So to the medium term outlook. The Budget 2002 forecasts are for economic growth to remain robust, with GDP growth forecast to be 3.1 percent to March 2003 (up from 1.9 percent forecast in the December update). Growth of 3 percent is also expected in the year to March 2004 as trading partner growth accelerates to 3.6 percent in 2003.

That outlook was developed around an assumption that economic activity would rebalance with the significance of domestic activity increasing relative to export led growth. The forecast increase in domestic activity reflects the combined effects of the net migration turnaround, a rebound in construction, continued consumer confidence and growing business investment.

The only material change in the short time since the budget has been a marked appreciation in the exchange rate. Two risks are starting to appear on the forecasters' radar screens. One is a risk of a more substantial correction - or even an over-correction - in the US dollar with uncertain consequences. The other is the prospect of a summer drought.

There is no evidence that either of these factors has impacted on confidence or economic activity in New Zealand, although the Treasury will be reviewing its budget forecasts for the publication of the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Update on 25 June.

One thing we have learnt in the last two and a half years is not to be panicked by risks that might not materialise, and which we may well be able to trade through anyway. The panic responses to the 1997 Asian economic crisis worsened its impacts here. Our own response to the US and Japanese recessions and the events of 11 September confirmed the value of cool heads and calm nerves. We do allow the fiscal stabilisers to work, and we have found that a small economy can reposition itself to ride out international economic turbulence.

So we are moving forward into the next three years with significant economic headroom: unemployment is low by historical standards, the participation rate is high, the budget surpluses are strong and government debt is moderate. Interest rates are above prevailing rates in the rest of the developed world. This means that there is some capacity in macroeconomic settings to respond to any adverse shift in circumstance, but I have to stress that there is no intention to do so at the present time.

The challenge for the next three years is to make use of the economic headroom to prepare New Zealand to move progressively into the top half of the OECD. This will require business and government to work in partnership to invest in initiatives which will transform our economy.

We need to invest in skills to enhance the productivity of the New Zealand labour force. This is the overriding aim of our reform of the tertiary education sector, and of our significant increases in funding for industry training and apprenticeships.

We need to support innovation, in particular in those areas - such as information technology, bio-technology and the creative industries - where there is a good strategic fit between our natural capabilities and our ability to sell into world markets. This is why we are investing in collaborative research programmes which focus public and private sector resources on areas of specific business opportunity.

We need to attract foreign direct investment to New Zealand, in particular in those areas of strategic fit. And we are merging the Investment New Zealand arm of Trade New Zealand and Industry New Zealand's Major Investment Service into a single world-class investment promotion agency operating under the wing of Industry New Zealand, with an initial budget of $14.5 million.

There is also work to be done on improving the tax system. Key items on the tax policy work programme for the next three years include international taxation, the taxation of superannuation and reducing tax compliance costs for small to medium-sized businesses.

The recommendations of the McLeod Tax Review are under intensive study. It is important to remember that the Review's principal recommendation was that our tax system was basically sound. It wasn't broke and we shouldn't try to fix it. That recommendation has guided our responses to specific proposals, which were to fine-tune the tax system around the edges, not at the core.

We are currently exploring the introduction of a time limited exemption for overseas earnings for new migrants and the application of the risk free return method to the broad area of offshore equity investment on capital account outside a business context. This is being done in full consultation with the private sector.

I will also be looking at the two tax options available to stimulate employment based superannuation - on the one hand, aligning the Superannuation Scheme Contributions Withholding Tax for those earning under $38,000 to their statutory marginal tax rate, and on the other hand, extending the present 6 cent concessional rate to all taxpayers. Consultation on detailed design is proceeding.

The initiative on Small and Medium Enterprises is well underway. Officials are currently considering the merits of a number of options to reduce tax compliance costs; for example, whether taxable income can be calculated on a cash rather than an accrual basis.

On trans-Tasman taxation issues, both governments have recently made substantial progress towards removing impediments to trans-Tasman business. Work is progressing well on cross border recognition of imputation credits; and officials are due to report back shortly on submissions on the proposed pro rata allocation of Australian and New Zealand imputation credits.

Of course, any greater harmonisation of tax policies needs to be considered against fiscal impacts. However, New Zealand is committed to resolving trans-Tasman tax issues and discussions at both the ministerial and public official levels continue.

In short, there is a very full work programme for the next three years, not only in taxation, but also in reforming our business and securities law - in particular with a view of better harmonisation with Australia.

No doubt we can expect our share of good and bad luck. However, compared with the state of the economy in 1999, we are, at the mid point of 2002, now much better prepared to weather economic storms, and - most significantly - much better placed to take advantage of the opportunities in world markets, and secure the prosperity that is our shared goal.

Thank you.

Compliance cost, simplification stocktake
=========================================

Associate Revenue Minister Paul Swain has outlined progress in reducing compliance costs and simplifying the tax system for businesses. For more information see [media statement](/news/2002/2002-07-02-compliance-cost-simplification-stocktake#statement)

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Compliance Cost Reduction Initiatives Well on Track

Steady progress is being made to reduce compliance costs for businesses by implementing initiatives in the discussion document 'More Time for Business' and the recommendations made by the Ministerial Panel on Business Compliance Costs, Commerce and Associate Revenue Minister Paul Swain said today.

"The tax simplification initiatives were designed to reduce the stress, uncertainty and risks for small businesses in meeting their tax obligations," said Mr Swain. "Today, ten of those initiatives are in taxation bills before Parliament and close to becoming law."

Those initiatives include:

*   making it easier for employers to employ staff;
*   allowing businesses to pool their provisional tax payments with those of other businesses and thereby reduce the amount of interest they pay to Inland Revenue;
*   businesses not having to value small amounts of trading stock;
*   raising the threshold under which a provisional taxpayer is not subject to the use-of-money interest rules;
*   increasing the number of taxpayers who do not have to file tax returns;
*   more flexibility for interest payers in the way they communicate resident withholding tax (RWT) information; and
*   simplifying family assistance entitlements and improving the way family tax credits are paid.

"Work is also being done to match provisional tax payments with cashflow. That way businesses will pay tax when they have money instead of in three large lumps that bear no relation to how they actually operate," said Mr Swain.

"Another angle of the government's approach to tax simplification is to explore ways of using electronic technology to simplify tax administration processes, and to broaden the range of electronic services that Inland Revenue provides," said Mr Swain. "The department is planning a number of new electronic services designed to make it easier for businesses to pay their tax.

"Simplification is one of the focuses of the government's forthcoming review of fringe benefit tax, which will aim to simplify and improve fringe benefit tax," said Mr Swain.

In other compliance cost reduction areas the government is making progress. "We've established a Business Compliance Costs Unit within the Ministry of Economic Development," said Mr Swain. "The Unit is dedicated to improving the standard of policy making." We have also moved forward on our response to the report of the Ministerial Panel on Business Compliance Costs, established in 2001. Around 60% of the Panel's recommendations have been implemented, or are about to be implemented.

Initiatives that have been implemented include:

*   $1 million for a number of projects to reduce the time and costs involved with consent processes under the Resource Management Act.
*   The appointment of additional judges and additional funding ($2.1m over the next 3 years) to improve administration and reduce the backlog in the Environment Court.
*   The development of a new case management regime that will allow for better prioritisation of cases and speed up the appeals process in the Environment Court.
*   $500,000 to enhance the BIZ service, and to progress a "one stop shop" for business. The additional funding will be used to improve the BIZ website, develop new publications to assist business and provide additional training for BIZ advisors.
*   The formation of a test panel comprising both employee and business representatives, formed in October 2001, to advise the government on operational issues arising from the implementation of the HSE Amendment Bill.
*   ACC now being responsible for collecting both fully-funded and tail levies, resulting in significant compliance cost reductions for employers and the self employed. Previously, IRD collected 'tail' (residual claims) levies.

We've also started the process of improving the quality of new regulation, said Mr Swain. "From April last year, all policy proposals submitted to Cabinet, which have compliance cost implications for business must include a Business Compliance Cost Statement. These complement the Regulatory Impact Statements, which sets out all the costs and benefits of regulations."

"This government is serious about reducing compliance costs for business", said Mr Swain. "We will be building on the successes of the previous two and a half years and incorporating initiatives to improve the regulatory environment for business. In particular we want to ensure we remove unnecessary barriers to innovation, competition and business performance."

MEDIA STATEMENT

### Govt's tax policy work programme announced

The government has announced its tax policy work programme through to June 2004.

"Top of the agenda in the new tax policy work programme are measures to support the government's growth and innovation framework," Revenue Minister Michael Cullen said.

"The growth and innovation framework aims to return New Zealand's per capita income to the top half of the OECD rankings over time. The tax policy work programme reflects this goal, with a focus on both the international and domestic spheres."

"In the international sphere much of the emphasis is on recommendations of Tax Review 2001. The work will consider whether current tax rules support the government's goals for foreign investment, attracting skilled people and creating an environment for firms to grow."

"In the domestic sphere we will be looking to simplify the tax obligations of small to medium-sized enterprises. The easing of their tax compliance burden will allow them to put more energy, time and focus on innovation and growth. The particular focus is on tax requirements that might inhibit small companies developing into larger companies."

"Tax policy officials and officials from other government areas are also working closely with the private sector taskforces that are part of the growth and innovation framework. It is expected that the taskforces will progress a small but important package of measures that could remove some tax barriers to growth."

"Also high on the agenda in the tax policy work programme are measures to support the government's broader social and economic policies. An example is the measure announced in the Budget to reduce the over-taxation of employer contributions to superannuation funds. This may involve changing the way contributions are taxed or extending the present 6 percent concession rate enjoyed by those earning over $60,000 to all contributions."

"The work programme contains a number of other projects, many of which are already in progress or are new issues that need addressing."

"The tax policy work programme is an important part of the government's generic tax policy process. Its publication ensures that the tax profession, business and interested taxpayers are better informed about what is likely to emerge in tax policy over the next two years," Dr Cullen said.
