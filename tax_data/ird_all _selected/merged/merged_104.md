New Zealanders have access to high quality public services, funded by a tax system which strives to simplify requirements and to minimise costs. 1.2 The system works well for individuals who have employment and investment income which is subject to withholding and reported to Inland Revenue during the year. For them, tax assessments are largely automated. 1.3 The Government’s investment in Inland Revenue through its Business Transformation programme has improved administration of the tax and social payments system as well as enabling further improvements through a more digital system. The case for change 1.4 While the tax system works smoothly and efficiently for most earners, it works less well for people with a variety of income sources including those who receive benefits through the tax system, or for small businesses. 1.5 Working better would mean being more effective at collecting tax, being fairer by ensuring everyone pays the tax they should, ensuring people receive the payments they are entitled to, lowering overall cost for operating the system, and making more contribution to wider economic goals. These are consistent with the Government’s long-term objective of a tax system that is fair, balanced and promotes the long-term sustainability and productivity of the economy. 1.6 The way business operates is changing to become fully digital. This is more than transactions happening online. Digital is becoming the complete and “natural system” for businesses. This means tax calculations can be embedded in the software businesses use and tax can become an automated process that happens as a by-product of other processes. 1.7 Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme – the modernisation of its systems and how taxpayers and other parties interact with them – is nearing completion. Business transformation has digitised Inland Revenue and enables Inland Revenue to transact digitally with taxpayers and their representatives. It has created the platform for further development of a digital tax system. 1.8 These factors led the Government to include an examination of tax administration on its 2021 tax policy work programme. Inland Revenue has led this work so that it can advise the government. A fully digital system 1.9 Businesses are moving online and this shapes our thinking about the future world in which the tax system will operate. Key features of this world are likely to be: • Businesses operating in a digital ecosystem – that is, they’re connected digitally to their suppliers and customers. • Administration of tax and social policy payments integrated into broader economic systems, for instance individuals or businesses can use a common digital identity across a range of services. 6 • Tax administration processes embedded in the natural systems businesses are using, that is, the systems that businesses use to suit their business rather than to suit tax obligations. • Digital processes enabling data to flow in real time. 1.10 Further features of this future tax administration could include: • Taxpayers granting and managing consents to the party or parties they want to represent them or manage their tax affairs and with whom they are comfortable having their data shared. • Processes being streamlined through there being one source of truth for data and information. Rather than there being separate data repositories that need to be reconciled, participants would access this data when needed. • Increased partnering between Inland Revenue and the external parties who provide the apps and services that taxpayers will use. The potential benefits 1.11 Greater automation of tax obligations is likely to mean better compliance because compliance improves when paying tax is the easy thing to do. It is harder to get it wrong or for taxpayers to manipulate the data. It will also mean lower compliance costs, and less stress and risk for taxpayers, and lower administration costs for Inland Revenue. 1.12 Also, the integration of tax and payment systems into broader economic systems will create value throughout the economy through more efficient processes or through providing a spur to innovation. A suggested route to get there 1.13 Moving to a more digital tax and payments system will involve a series of steps. It will build on developments already underway such as businesses operating their management systems digitally and tax calculations being embedded in the software businesses use. 1.14 Over the next decade, officials believe further changes for tax administration will be most pronounced for the small business sector – that is the self- employed, micro and small-medium businesses. For individuals receiving wage and salary income and investment income where PAYE and resident withholding tax are deducted, tax is already largely automated. Large businesses are adopting digital processes, but their affairs and tax are sufficiently complex to require a mixture of automation and manual intervention. 1.15 Developing digital natural systems within social policy is more complex as this is not the target market for third party innovation. However, business models are emerging that help with the transition to work or that focus on budgeting support with the payback being fewer debt issues to manage downstream. Potentially, social policy interventions that reduce costs to society could be considered for Government subsidy, as occurred previously with payroll software. 1.16 The needs of taxpayers, social policy customers, and businesses vary. What functions as the natural system for one may not work for another. The trend towards tax occurring in natural systems will be driven by innovation in the private sector developing products and services that meet customer need. In turn, this will mean greater external party involvement in the tax system with 7 Inland Revenue’s focus being one of facilitation, third party support and standard setting. 1.17 While we see a greater involvement of external parties, for reasons of skill, privacy, or cost some taxpayers will want to deal directly with Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue will continue to serve them. Similarly, social policy customers, whose affairs can be complex and personal, may also wish to continue a direct relationship with Inland Revenue. Having a direct channel to Inland Revenue puts appropriate pressure on the private sector to make sure their service offerings truly innovate and add value as customers will always have the option of managing their own affairs. How this fits with other processes 1.18 The administration of the tax and transfer system comprises many dimensions such as policy, operations, design and delivery. In total, these relate to Inland Revenue’s strategy as administrator of the system. Moving forward will require evolution in all aspects of Inland Revenue’s strategy. 1.19 This issues paper focuses on these policy elements that could, if not addressed, be potential blockages to achieving a more digital system: • The regulatory framework applying to external parties, including intermediaries and other entities which interact with the tax and payments system. • The rules, frameworks and scope of data sharing. • How tax legislation could support a more digital future. Scope 1.20 Tax and transfer administration is a broad topic. It covers the way taxpayers determine and pay their tax obligations, and understand and receive their social policy entitlements. It includes actions taken by Inland Revenue and third parties that facilitate or enforce these processes. 1.21 This issues paper does not look at all aspects of tax and social policy administration. Its focus is where policy changes, potentially leading to legislative changes, will be required to give effect to a more digital tax system. This means it does not address these issues: • Changes to rates and bases: bases refer to who faces a tax obligation or is entitled to a benefit, while rates refer to how much tax or benefit they pay or receive. • Digital developments in other parts of Government – a separate exercise is considering potential opportunities to leverage opportunities from business transformation to support a unified Public Service. • Administrative functions where a more digital world is not having an impact, such as processes relating to ruling and disputes. 1.22 This paper outlines themes and directions. As ideas evolve, specific policy initiatives will be developed and proposed to the Government for inclusion in the tax and social policy work programme. 8 About this consultation process 1.23 The policy issues covered in this issues paper are complex. There is a potential to solve current problems but also create new issues and risks. A steady and careful pace of change allows management of risks as they arise. 1.24 This issues paper builds on the engagement we have already had with many parties involved in the tax and transfer system. It sets out key themes identified from that engagement and from reviewing international developments. This engagement will be ongoing. Making a submission 1.25 This issues paper is an invitation to provide feedback. We have included questions as prompts for this feedback, but you are not limited to these questions in how you respond. 1.26 Please send your feedback to policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “Tax Administration in a Digital World” in the subject line by 31 March 2022. 1.27 Alternatively, or in addition, we are happy to meet you if there are issues you want to discuss. 1.28 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which will result in their publication unless there are grounds under that Act for the information to be withheld.

If you consider that any part of your submission should properly be withheld under the Act, please clearly indicate this. 9 Frameworks 2.1 From previous studies of the tax system 1 we have identified four pillars that set out the core framework for the administration of the tax and social policy system to function well: • Fairness: This is crucial for maintaining social licence and promoting voluntary compliance. It means people in similar situations being treated similarly and those in different situations being treated differently. • Integrity: The systems collect the revenue that Parliament has mandated, and people receive what they are entitled to. • Efficiency: This is about minimising the total cost of administering the tax and payments system. This includes the compliance costs, including emotional costs, to taxpayers and recipients, and administration costs to Inland Revenue. • Effectiveness: The system contributes to other elements of the New Zealand economy and society. An example could be how data supplied to Inland Revenue can be used for non-tax purposes. 2.2 There are also other perspectives which can provide weight or emphasis to the pillars. The first is the impact of technology. 2.3 In a more digital world, how Inland Revenue and its partners think about technology will also shape how the administration of the tax and social policy system evolves. A core part of Inland Revenue’s business transformation was de veloping a digital platform for the tax system. In terms of how this could evolve, we have been influenced by the OECD’s publication Tax Administration 3.0: The Digital Transformation of Tax Administration. 2 2.4 Technology enables key concepts, such as: • A greater integration of tax and social policy administration into the natural systems that individuals and businesses are using for regular tasks. • Efficiency through accessing data in real time and removing redundancy. 2.5 Consideration of technology prompts various questions: • How do we ensure taxpayers have control over the systems and processes they will use for managing their tax and social policy entitlements so that they maintain trust in Inland Revenue? • How can processes be automated since this can be the key to efficiency gains? • How do we think about the boundary between Inland Revenue and external parties so that processes are handled in the most efficient way from a system perspective? 1 For example, The Tax Working Group. https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/ 2 OECD. (2020). Tax Administration 3.0: The Digital Transformation of Tax Administration. https://www.oecd.org/tax/forum-on-tax-administration/publications-and-products/tax-administration-3-0- the-digital-transformation-of-tax-administration.htm 10 2.6 The above-mentioned can apply equally well to tax systems around the world. The final framework we have considered, and which has particular weight for the New Zealand system, is He Ara Waiora. 3 2.7 Under te Tiriti o Waitangi-the Treaty of Waitangi, the government is committed to work with Māori to actively protect Māori interests and to consult with Māori on matters significant to them. 2.8 He Ara Waiora is a framework centred on an ao Māori view of wellbeing. It was initially developed for the Tax Working Group by Māori thought leaders, Ngā Pūkenga, who continue to work with the Treasury to develop and apply He Ara Waiora to policy work. 2.9 The principles of He Ara Waiora are derived from mātauranga Māori and are relevant to the wellbeing of all New Zealanders. These principles emphasise: co-ordination and alignment, partnership, collective and strengths-based actions, protecting and building mana, and stewardship, as illustrated by these examples: • Kotahitanga: Kotahitanga encompasses the unity of people, actions, purpose, and vision. Through kotahitanga, He Ara Waiora encourages people to work together for the benefit of all, driven by a shared purpose and inspired by shared aspirations. • Whanaungatanga: Focusses on relationships and kinship. Relationships with iwi, hapū, and whānau Māori interests are essential to addressing challenges, and improving economic and social outcomes for Māori and New Zealand. • Manaakitanga: This value is associated with care, relationships, and reciprocity. Manaakitanga requires maintaining a focus on improved wellbeing and enhanced mana for all New Zealanders. • Tiakitanga – Tiakitanga is about guardianship and has connotations of responsibility and obligation. Tiakitanga helps promote long term sustainability. 2.10 Consideration of He Ara Waiora encourages us to consider: • Are there ways of improving outcomes for all New Zealanders, including Māori, through greater involvement of external parties in providing services to taxpayers or social payment recipients? • How do concepts of trust and reciprocity play out in the tax and payments system? 3 He Ara Waiora. https://www.treasury.govt.nz/information-and-services/nz-economy/higher-living- standards/he-ara-waiora 11 Scene setting – the shift to digital 3.1 The shift to digital, that is transactions or processes happening through digital channels, is the fundamental concept driving our view of the future and provides the context for this issues paper. 3.2 Efficiency, convenience, and effectiveness are factors underpinning the development of a more digital economy, with COVID-19 providing an added spur. We see no reason for this shift to slow and we anticipate that digital channels and systems will become even more dominant. 3.3 Transactions happening digitally is not new. What is influential, however, is the extent to which complete business systems are online. It is the shift to businesses operating digitally, rather than undertaking some digital transactions, that is important. 3.4 Inland Revenue too is providing an increasing amount of its services and functions online. Thanks to the Government’s investment in business transformation, the revenue system now operates on a digital platform and Inland Revenue can interact online with taxpayers, payment recipients and a range of intermediaries and business partners. 3.5 Inland Revenue, however, is not driving the shift to digital. Adapting tax and social policy systems to facilitate digital interaction is about keeping up with how people are living their lives and doing business. Equally, failure to adapt presents risks that the tax system would negatively affect revenue raising, integrity and fairness. 3.6 New Zealand is not alone in moving in this direction. Across member countries of the OECD, we see – with variations in focus or pace – a consistent pattern. These are summed up in the OECD’s Tax Administration 3.0: The Digital Transformation of Tax Administration. 4 In mid-2020, the United Kingdom’s Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs released Building a trusted, modern tax administration system 5 which canvasses many of the same issues and suggests heading in the same direction as described in this issues paper. 3.7 There are similar themes in policy development within other government departments. Examples include the Strategy for a Digital Public Service 6 and the Digital Strategy for Aotearoa. 7 This latter strategy is motivated by the world we live in becoming more digital and ensuring that New Zealand can leverage the economic and social advantages of innovative technologies. 3.8 Work within government to establish the consumer data right is relevant to the issues explored in chapter 5 about sharing data.

What a more digital tax system means 3.9 Increasingly smaller companies are using software to run their business, particularly to manage their financial record keeping, invoicing and calculation of tax obligations. They are spending less time on the more routine aspects of accounting and tax and are freed up to focus more on running their business. 3.10 The shift of business management into digital channels means tax calculations can be embedded in the software businesses use. This is referred to as tax occurring in the business’s natural systems. 3.11 The effect is that meeting tax obligations becomes a by-product of non-tax processes. This is a paradigm shift for taxpayers and tax administration. Compliance is built in. It reduces the scope for errors and options for non- compliance (though still reliant on the quality of data that is inputted), while also reducing the burden of compliance arising from using different processes for taxation and other aspects of business. 3.12 Exactly how this will play out in terms of details and pace is unknown, as it will be driven by private sector innovation and uptake by taxpayers. This issues paper considers what foundations are needed to allow the system to evolve. 3.13 Not all people and businesses will adopt digital ways of operating and some will continue to self-service for tax. However, there are already signs of new products and services being developed which give us confidence that the uptake of digital processes will continue to grow. Examples we are aware of include: • Financial intermediaries who provide accounting software and automate much of the tax calculation for self-employed contractors. • Platforms that provide job matching services, but which also manage payment and tax deductions. • A software developer whose focus is on lower income people who might struggle to maintain control over their finances. Via an app, an accurate picture of people’s financial circumstances is developed by compiling information from various sources and this is used to provide tailored services, such as budgeting or prompts when significant payments are due. What the future could look like 3.14 A fully digital tax and payments system would involve the administration of that system being integrated in broader economic systems. People would grant and manage consents to the party or parties they want to represent them or manage their tax affairs and with whom they are comfortable having their data shared. Processes would be streamlined through there being one source of truth for data and information – participants access this data when needed rather than there being separate data repositories that need to be reconciled. Inland Revenue is often, but not always, the holder of this information. Inland Revenue’s role would evolve to ensure a seamless boundary between it and 8 New Zealand Government. Digital Identity Services Trust Framework. https://www.digital.govt.nz/digital- government/programmes-and-projects/digital-identity-programme/trust-framework/ 13 external parties. Inland Revenue partners with external parties to manage risk and ensure the integrity of the tax and transfer system. 3.15 Aspects of this system are in place. For instance, external parties already play a major role in the system supporting taxpayers. A more digital world will, however, shift the nature of these entities’ involvement with the taxpayer and the tax system. 3.16 The vision is also idealised. It will need to be adapted as risks and tensions emerge between developing a more efficient system and maintaining the integrity of the tax and social payments system. However, it guides our thoughts as how the system should evolve over the near term. Implications for taxpayers 3.17 The impact of an increasingly digital business environment will differ by type of taxpayer. Most individuals receive income with PAYE deducted and investment income with tax already withheld. Third parties (employers and financial institutions) supply this data to Inland Revenue and this pre-populates taxpayers’ income tax returns. This flow of information is largely automated and imposes low compliance costs on taxpayers. The scope for improvement is likely to be limited, though there may be digital innovations to improve outcomes for some sub-groups such as individuals who receive social policy payments or who have debt to Inland Revenue. 3.18 However, it’s a different story for other types of taxpayers. Compared with individuals who earn wages from which PAYE is deducted, the self-employed, micro and small business segments tend to have more complex tax arrangements. Typically, they have been a harder group for Inland Revenue to serve. Evidence suggests they face high compliance costs relative to the tax they pay and may not be as compliant with their tax obligations. 9 3.19 Larger businesses have complex and bespoke tax affairs that make them less receptive to the types of standardised solutions anticipated for smaller companies. However, there are still opportunities to improve how administration of the tax system works for them, for instance around minimising the compliance costs for the data they supply and how they supply it. Inland Revenue’s role 3.20 The ideas discussed above are consistent with Inland Revenue’s business transformation. The potential policy and legislative changes discussed in this paper complement the technological capability arising from business transformation. 3.21 A more digital future will involve further change. Inland Revenue’s digital transformation has strengthened its ability to deliver services based on core information, involving collection and payment of money and processing at scale. More tailored services, which increasingly the public expects in the digital environment, are likely to come from private sector entities. For example, integrating financial management with tax management for a small business or providing budgeting assistance for someone with debt. Digital channels provide the opportunity for private sector entities to deliver customised services that 9 See for instance Ana Cinta G. Gabral and Norman Gemmell. (2018). Estimating Self-Employment Income- Gaps from Register and Survey Data: Evidence for New Zealand. Working Paper 07/2018. Victoria University of Wellington. http://researcharchive.vuw.ac.nz/handle/10063/7625 14 can more effectively and efficiently meet taxpayers’ needs. The impact of these developments is that for these taxpayers Inland Revenue will act more as an enabler and the customer-facing parts of tax compliance would be delivered by private sector entities. 3.22 These shifts are motivated by making routine tasks, including tax, easier for customers. This produces lower compliance costs. It will also bring compliance benefits for the tax system. Where calculation and payment of tax is automated, compliance is improved because non-compliance requires more effort. Basic, unintentional errors are removed from the system. Digital transactions leave a footprint so make non-compliance riskier, and when business operations are fully digitised it’s harder to push transactions into a non-digital space. These developments mean we think a more digital and automated tax system will make it more likely that everyone is paying the tax they should, resulting in higher overall tax revenues for given tax settings. 3.23 Inland Revenue will evolve as a digital entity just as other businesses are doing. In a more digital world, issues like data security become even more important. Operating models will also need to adapt to take advantage of the technology Inland Revenue’s business transformation has delivered. For instance, a different approach may be needed for onboarding new users of gateway services than has traditionally applied to Inland Revenue accepting a new tax agent into the tax system. Where external parties have the primary relationship with the taxpayer, Inland Revenue’s relationship with those external parties will need to focus on how the system works overall. 3.24 New business models, for instance greater use of crypto assets, and new ways for taxpayers to meet their obligations will present risks as well as opportunities. An advantage that Inland Revenue has is its membership of international bodies such as the OECD, which enables New Zealand to participate in global solutions to challenges such as the taxation of multinationals. Within New Zealand, Inland Revenue will also need to participate with the private sector in the development of new busine ss models to ensure the tax base is protected. Digital inclusion 3.25 A more digital world works well for those able to embrace those technologies but can create barriers for those not able or wanting to participate in this way. Digital exclusion will arise for those lacking access to digital services and devices, skills in using them, and motivation and trust to operate in digital channels. The Government estimates one in five people lack at least one of the elements to be digitally included. 10 Groups who are less likely to be digitally included in New Zealand are: people living in social housing, individuals with disabilities, Pasifika, Māori, people living in large country towns, older members of society, and those not in the workforce. 3.26 However, people will use digital services if the benefit is clear and there are signs that innovative firms are finding ways to provide services catering for the digitally excluded. This will help bridge the barriers to accessing digital services. But these are at a fledgling state and at best will contribute to a solution rather than being the solution. Inland Revenue will continue to provide personalised services using non digital channels, such as phone and over the counter. Though these channels can appear more costly for service delivery, this has to be set against the right to access government services. 10 New Zealand Government. (2020). Digital Inclusion Action Plan 2020-21. https://www.digital.govt.nz/dmsdocument/174~digital-inclusion-action-plan-20202021/html 15 3.27 In contrast, we think professional parties have the capability to operate digitally and consequently there is an expectation that these groups should use digital channels to interact with Inland Revenue. 3.28 A related aspect of the digital story is expectations around small businesses adopting digital accounting software or using tax agents. Uptake of digital software amongst small businesses is increasing as businesses look for efficiencies and find more tailored services. However, options for business taxpayers to self-serve in less digital ways will remain. How the shift to digital shapes this document 3.29 We have grouped the impacts from more digital processes into three areas – though noting a significant degree of overlap amongst them. These are: • External parties: Their potential to meet the needs of taxpayers and recipients of payments and what changes are necessary to facilitate this. • Data: Rationalising data collection and unlocking value through taxpayers authorising Inland Revenue to share their data. • Tax rule changes: Adapting the tax system to more digital processes and making changes that facilitate a more automated approach to determining tax obligations. 3.30 Our exploration of these topics is covered in the next three chapters. Questions for submitters • Does our emphasis on the shift to digital channels and processes resonate with your experience? • Are there other economic or social trends that we are not giving sufficient weight to in terms of influences on tax and social policy administration? • Are there other ways we should think about those who are digitally excluded or who might not see themselves in a digital story? 16 External parties 4.1 External parties and intermediaries already play an important role in the tax and transfer system. 4.2 In a more digital environment this role is likely to expand as external parties play three overlapping roles: • The traditional tax agent/intermediary function – helping taxpayers determine and pay their tax liabilities. • Providers of products and services that taxpayers use for a business purpose that as a by-product assist taxpayers with their tax. For example, a job matching website where the platform provider manages payments and tax obligations for employees and contractors. • Entities that provide access to services which are unrelated to tax, but which use tax information and require some form of access to data held by Inland Revenue. 4.3 The expanded role will come from the development of niche products and adaptation to suit smaller groups of customers. Inland Revenue’s strength lies in delivering at scale, so is more attuned to standardised bulk-processing solutions, whereas we see the private sector complementing this with more customised services. 4.4 Another benefit from private sector involvement is the relationship such entities develop with taxpayers. Some taxpayers prefer to deal with their tax affairs through intermediaries rather than directly with Inland Revenue. This is particularly the case where software developers are providing new services based on integrating data from a range of sources, such as banking, tax, and other business records. Taxpayers who want advice based on a holistic view of their financial situation will get this from a private sector provider rather than Inland Revenue. 4.5 From a policy perspective, the issue is the regulatory environment in which external entities interact with the tax and payments system. How Inland Revenue works with external parties 4.6 Given a greater role for external parties, the goal will be to create a seamless boundary between them and Inland Revenue so that their customers have a flexible and convenient experience when paying tax and receiving entitlements. 4.7 External parties will connect with Inland Revenue digitally through Inland Revenue’s gateway services. Gateway services refer to the web services that allow third parties to integrate their services with Inland Revenue’s systems. 4.8 With the conclusion of business transformation, Inland Revenue will be more open to accepting applications from external parties so that they can access the gateway services. In anticipation of this shift, Inland Revenue is engaging with a wide variety of entities to better understand their business models, the types of services they are providing and consequently the types of gateway services they want to access. 17 4.9 More information about Inland Revenue’s gateway services and how external parties can access them can be found on Inland Revenue’s website. 11 Regulation of external parties 4.10 The traditional approach to regulation has focused on the roles that entities play in the tax system. The Tax Administration Act 1994 describes different types of entities, such as tax agents or PAYE intermediaries, with further sections of the Act defining the entry requirements and rights of the entity types. 4.11 This approach is becoming less fit for purpose. There are new entities whose services cross the boundaries that previously defined the types of entities. Overcoming the rigidities in the current framework has led to inefficient workarounds. 4.12 The following approach could form the basis of a new regulatory framework: • As a starting point, all parties involved in the tax system must have an obligation to uphold the integrity of the tax system. What this means in practice might differ by the role the party plays, but the concept will still apply. • All external parties interacting with Inland Revenue through the gateway services would also be required to comply with the technical/compatibility and security standards that Inland Revenue sets for its gateway services. • External parties’ access to Inland Revenue services and data should be based on the role they perform for their customers and what data is required to fulfil that role. A tax agent for all of a taxpayer’s affairs would require access to all that taxpayer’s files and data, whereas a party who assists a taxpayer claim a donation tax credit would have limited access based on providing that service. • The service the external party is providing for their customer will also dictate how they interact with the Inland Revenue system. Some parties will “read” data (for example access information held by Inland Revenue), while others will “write” or “amend” data (for example someone acting as a tax agent for a taxpayer who supplies data or a tax return to Inland Revenue). • Standards would apply to each of these functions. For example, if parties access data held by Inland Revenue, there would be obligations relating to privacy and secure storage of that data. If a party is amending data, there would be obligations around accuracy and reliability. • Failure to meet the standards could lead to loss of access. 4.13 Tax advisors are another group of external parties. Often their role will overlap with that of a tax agent and in a practical sense the roles of agent and advisor will be indistinguishable, but in a pure sense advisors’ relationship is solely with the client (taxpayer) and not with Inland Revenue. 4.14 The advisor plays an important role in ensuring compliance, providing advice, and acting as a bridge between Inland Revenue and the taxpayer. They advise taxpayers based on their circumstances in ways that Inland Revenue is not suited to. For the tax system to work well, advisors need to act to support the integrity of the tax system. 11 Inland Revenue. Gateway services architecture. https://www.ird.govt.nz/digital-service-providers/guides- and-docs/gws-architecture 18 4.15 Currently, there is no specific regulatory obligation on the advisor from the perspective of the revenue legislation, though in practice the majority are members of a professional organisation that imposes educational and ethical standards on them. 4.16 We are considering whether the regulatory framework should specify requirements for the tax advisor or whether general obligations for all parties to uphold the integrity of the tax system would be sufficient. Regulation of systems 4.17 In a digital world, taxpayers will use systems that will “tell” them how much tax to pay. 4.18 This is like the role of the advisor but there is a subtle distinction between the advisor applying judgement to advise on how much tax to pay and a software programme applying rules to advise on how much tax to pay. From the perspective of the integrity of the tax system, for the first situation there is an expectation of care. For the second situation there is an expectation of following the rules. 4.19 Any regulatory framework for external parties needs to consider the role of system providers. We anticipate obligations on these entities relating to accuracy of tax calculation, with Inland Revenue support by testing of these systems. Co-dependence of Inland Revenue and external parties 4.20 As external parties play a greater role in the administration of the tax and transfer system, there will be a greater interdependence between them and Inland Revenue. Potentially, Inland Revenue will need to view external parties’ operations as integral extensions of Inland Revenue’s operating model. 4.21 Feedback from the private sector suggests business transformation has provided an effective platform but that improvement is needed to enable external parties to participate effectively. 4.22 Different mechanisms may be required to support these developments. This would involve mechanisms to consider whole of system perspectives in investment decisions. It might also mean bringing additional perspectives into the consultation process for new tax policy proposals, to get feedback on the system and digital elements of any proposal. Supporting the development of social policy 4.23 Inland Revenue administered social policies such as Working for Families can be difficult for recipients to manage. Eligibility and entitlement depend on family composition and estimates of income. Where recipients fail to notify Inland Revenue of changes in their circumstance, or do so with a delay, recipients may end up being overpaid, leading to debt. 4.24 It is possible that external parties could develop products that would help recipients identify if they are eligible for support and manage their entitlements. However, a factor that might deter investment in these types of products is that recipients will be lower income so their ability and willingness to pay may be limited. 19 4.25 Consequently, there is an argument that subsidising these products could be beneficial if it encouraged their development and uptake. The benefits could include: • Improved fairness if people get the benefits they are entitled to. • Lower compliance costs for recipients. • Lower administration costs for Inland Revenue if there are fewer instances of under or over-payment. 4.26 A precedent for this intervention is the subsidy the Government provided to payroll intermediaries to encourage the use of specialist payroll firms. Questions for submitters • Are there roles that external parties play, or could play, in the tax and transfer system that have not been recognised? • Do you agree that the regulatory framework for external parties, as currently set out in the Tax Administration Act, should change? • Is the distinction between a tax advisor (who provides advice to a taxpayer about tax liabilities) and another intermediary involved in the tax system useful when considering the regulation of external parties? • What changes does Inland Revenue need to make to enable external parties to contribute to the tax and payments system? • Should the Government consider subsidies for products that assist social payment recipients? 20 Data 5.1 In a digital world, data is important. Sharing and re-using data can create efficiency gains as data is accessed or collected in more automated ways or productivity gains as more ready access to data enables new products and services to be developed. 5.2 Two issues come to the fore. What data is collected and how it is managed. Data collection 5.3 Data collection is at the heart of tax collection. Inland Revenue is rethinking its approach to the data it collects and accesses. 5.4 Previously, access to data meant physical collection and storage. In a digital world, this will still be the case for much of the data that Inland Revenue needs. But, in some cases, it might be as practical and efficient for Inland Revenue to access data without the need to hold it. This question – whether data needs to be collected or whether it can be accessed, is within the frameworks that Inland Revenue is adopting to guide its approach to data. 5.5 These frameworks will continue to emphasise that the provision of required data is compulsory. Where possible, however, provision of that data should be simple for taxpayers to comply with – for example by focusing on existing financial information and where data is generated in digital channels using natural systems. 5.6 Inland Revenue has traditionally collected less data than comparable tax administrations. In the main, the focus has been on what data is needed for compliance rather than other purposes such as tax policy. A recent legislative amendment reinforced Inland Revenue’s ability to collect data that relates to developing policy or reform of the tax system. Sometimes, this will lead to collection of additional data. 5.7 In other areas, for example relating to the data taxpayers supply as part of their tax return, there could be rationalisation of what is collected. External parties have suggested there is scope to simplify what is collected in ways that improve its usefulness. Work in this area will also address the format in which the data is provided. Sharing data 5.8 Traditionally, the law in New Zealand (similar to many other tax jurisdictions) has required Inland Revenue to hold important tax data (classified as sensitive revenue information in the Tax Administration Act) as confidential and not disclose it to external parties. This constraint is imposed on Inland Revenue; unlike the Privacy Act this obligation does not sit within an overarching framework where the customer or taxpayer has control over their data. 5.9 The approach is based on balancing the powers Inland Revenue has to obtain information, with responsibilities to keep that data confidential. 5.10 The approach has exceptions. There are legislative dispensations so that Inland Revenue can share data with other government agencies for social policy or 21 enforcement purposes, where doing so will assist tax revenue collection, or if it is sharing the taxpayer’s data directly with the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s agent. Data sharing with taxpayer consent 5.11 The question that now arises is whether Inland Revenue could share data with a non-government third party, where the taxpayer consents. Possible examples could include: • when customers enrol with a financial institution, they may want Inland Revenue to share their identity data • when applying for a loan, taxpayers may want Inland Revenue to share their income data, and • taxpayers who are receiving budgeting advice may want Inland Revenue to share data about tax debts or upcoming tax payments. 5.12 Moving in the direction of enabling taxpayers to share their data more widely is consistent with the Government’s policy to implement a new legislative framework for a consumer data right. (Legislation is planned for 2022.) The essence of this policy is to allow consumers to securely share data that is held about them with trusted third parties, using standardised data formats and interfaces. Security and privacy of consumer data will be addressed in this policy and will provide guidance for Inland Revenue’s approach. 5.13 Any consideration of this issue points to consent being a fundamental element. Ensuring that consent is robust - that the person granting it understands the consequences of their consenting - is important both for any new areas of data sharing and, where applicable, existing areas of data sharing. 5.14 Inland Revenue has conducted research to better understand taxpayer attitudes to data sharing. The research suggests that taxpayers are comfortable about consenting to Inland Revenue sharing their data with external parties as long as: • the benefit is clear and understandable • the taxpayer feels in control of consent, and • there is trust in Inland Revenue and the third party. 5.15 From Inland Revenue’s perspective, there would also need to be safeguards so that any data sharing did not undermine taxpayers’ trust in Inland Revenue as a steward of their data and manager of the tax system. For example, these points would need to be considered : • Does the sharing of data, subject to taxpayer authorisation, ali gn with ideas that are important for Māori? • The supply of the information to the third party will not damage the integrity of the tax system. Factors would include the intended use of the data and the ability of the receiving entity to satisfy security and privacy requirements. • The benefits to New Zealand of sharing outweigh the costs (there could be costs to Inland Revenue in meeting these requests). 5.16 Our current thought is that Inland Revenue would not charge for the data it shares, even if the data sharing were part of a commercial product or service. However, we are aware of different views on this and therefore are keen to explore it further. 22 Sharing statistical (anonymised) data 5.17 A different aspect of data sharing could be where statistical (therefore an onymised) information is made available by Inland Revenue to taxpayers or representative bodies. This could improve the quality of information available to external parties which can help research and decision making. A possible example of this would be enabling an iwi to see patterns amongst members with respect to average incomes or receipt of benefits. Publishing debt data 5.18 Where tax debt is unpaid, particularly PAYE and GST which is collected on behalf of others, it can be a sign of a business under stress. This can be useful information for other businesses and enable them to make informed credit decisions. This could lead to wider economic benefits, for instance preventing a cascade of business failures when one business fails. 5.19 Inland Revenue already has a limited ability to share names of debtors with credit agencies. This sits as an exception to the principle of only sharing data with taxpayer consent. The Government has asked officials from the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and Inland Revenue to undertake policy development to improve the availability of tax debt information. 1213 Questions for submitters • How do you view the concept of sharing sensitive revenue information, subject to taxpayers’ consent? • Do you have other examples of how data sharing could be applied beyond the tax system? • What do you consider are important elements in a consent framework for data sharing? • Do you agree making tax debt data more available, with controls, will have a significant positive benefit for the wider business community? • Do you agree with the proposal to make more statistical (not individual) income and administrative information to wider groups, such as iwi or social groups? 12 Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. Insolvency Review Working Group. https://www.mbie.govt.nz/business-and-employment/business/regulating-entities/insolvency-review- working-group/ 13 Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. (2019). Changes to insolvency law. Proactive release. https://www.mbie.govt.nz/assets/insolvency-law-reform.pdf 23 Simplification 6.1 There is a subtle interaction between a more digital world and simplification of the tax system. In a digital world data is cheap and, by comparison, people are expensive. This is a reversal where traditionally, data has been expensive and people relatively cheap. 6.2 This shift in relative costs increases the incentives for both taxpayers and Inland Revenue as tax administrator to adopt: • Automated tax processes that do not require human intervention. Automation may not always require simplicity – computers are good at complex calculations. But it does generally mean eliminating complex judgements. • Tax rules that may not require as much accuracy in the determination of tax liabilities because the cost of achieving complete accuracy, through human intervention, outweighs any tax saved (by the taxpayer) or tax collected (by Inland Revenue). 6.3 The intention is not to reduce tax liabilities but, by making changes that simplify tax or make it easier for external parties to automate tax obligations, reduce the burden of tax. This rationale drives our thinking in the following areas. How tax laws are written 6.4 Legislation provides the foundation of the tax system. A goal in a more digital tax and social policy system would be legislation that has logical foundations and supports machine learning so that tax and payment calculation can be automated within external party systems. 6.5 This has implications for the way tax laws are written and the systems that taxpayers use. Simplifying the year-end tax return 6.6 Much of the complexity of determining income tax arises from the end of year adjustments. These serve to bring net income into closer alignment with underlying economic income but involve more calculations. For some, mostly larger firms, the greater accuracy is worthwhile. But for others the adjustments are being made solely to comply with tax rules and the cost of any accuracy gain outweighs the tax benefit, especially as many adjustments unwind in the subsequent year. 6.7 A possibility would be to give taxpayers flexibility to adopt an approach that best suits their business. This would enable businesses to match their income determination to those required for other purposes (for example, aligning with how they determine GST liabilities). For some this will mean moving closer to a cash basis (though capital/revenue distinctions will remain for most assets). Entities would be able to choose the approach that they adopted with the proviso that moving between different approaches would be limited to prevent opportunistic switching to gain a tax advantage. 6.8 Another example of this approach could be asset depreciation. Currently, there is a detailed schedule of assets with different depreciation rates applying to each category. 24 6.9 Some firms with very specialised assets may want to continue using the detailed schedule. But many small businesses and their advisors would be comfortable with only a few categories of assets, such as: motor vehicles, buildings, plant and equipment with motors, other plant and equipment, other. A simpler schedule would make it easier to apply machine learning and automate the allocation of assets to the correct group. The rate applying within each category would be averages of the rates applying to individual assets in that category. There would not be an option of picking and choosing to minimise tax outcomes. The simplicity arises from lack of choice and the goal is simplification (and the ensuing compliance cost reductions) and not tax minimisation. Systems for paying tax 6.10 Innovative products are providing different options for businesses to manage their finances and pay their taxes. These can give businesses greater comfort that the tax they pay during the year better matches their annual tax liability. For instance, providing a different mechanism for tax collection, say through an intermediary, could allow contractors to elect out of withholding tax or provisional tax. 6.11 New products will need to show they do not pose risks to the tax system, for instance by ensuring tax payments occur with an accuracy and frequency at least as good as current rules. Business models which simply defer payment to Inland Revenue will not meet the tests of tax integrity or improved compliance. Legislation may be needed to ensure that acceptable products are not constrained. The role of system assessment 6.12 Traditionally, tax system design has focussed on either Commissioner assessment or taxpayer self-assessment of tax liability. A more digital world would not necessarily change the obligation on taxpayers to self-assess their tax liabilities. But with external parties playing a greater role in assisting taxpayers to comply with and determine their tax liabilities, two questions arise: • Should taxpayers be protected in relation to a tax shortfall if they have followed the advice and calculation of the external party? • What should the implication be for the external party who gets the calculation wrong? 6.13 One approach could be that the taxpayer has an obligation to take care to provide correct information while the intermediary becomes responsible for the interpretation of the tax law using the data provided. For example, the taxpayer provides a receipt to an intermediary for the purchase of a new computer, discharging the obligation to take care. The intermediary has the obligation to correctly code that expenditure as capital (a tax position). In case of an error in the information or the algorithm, the taxpayer would still have to pay any outstanding taxes. But the above approach to responsibilities would affect the party to which penalties are applied. 6.14 This issue is not new. For instance, there are rules in respect of employees whose tax obligations are not met because their employer does not return PAYE. Sharing the certainty benefit 6.15 Much of the change proposed represents a move towards real time systems and away from end-of -year focussed systems. This raises a question about how long matters can be open to review by the Commissioner (the time-bar). This issue 25 is complex but a reduction in this period could be appropriate for taxpayers complying with tax obligations in a speedier way because their tax is being determined in their natural system. No changes to review periods would be considered for those who remain in traditional systems. Questions for submitters • What factors do you think are important for the automation of tax calculations? • What consequences should taxpayers face if there is a tax shortfall, but they have relied on the calculation of an external party? • What consequences should external parties face if there is a tax shortfall because of taxpayers relying on the calculations within the system provided by the external party?

POLICY AND REGULATORY STEWARDSHIP Tax policy report: Order in Council: Tax Administration (Canterbury Flood Event) Order 2021 - use of money interest relief Date: 2 June 2021 Priority: High Security level: In Confidence Report number: IR2021/251 Action sought Action sought Deadline Minister of Revenue Approve and lodge the attached paper to Cabinet office Refer a copy of this report and the attached Cabinet paper to the Minister of Finance 4 June 2021 Contact for telephone discussion (if required) Name Position Telephone Peter Frawley Policy Lead Brandon Sloan Principal Policy Advisor s 9(2)(a) In Confidence IR2021/251: Order in Council: Tax Administration (Canterbury Flood Event) Order 2021- use of money interest relief Page 1 of 3 2 June 2021 Minister of Revenue Order in Council: Tax Administration (Canterbury Flood Event) Order 2021- use of money interest relief 1. A medium-scale adverse event has been declared for the wider Canterbury region as a result of the recent heavy rains and subsequent flooding. 2. In response to that event, this report recommends you approve and lodge the attached paper to Cabinet. The paper seeks Cabinet’s approval for an Order in Council allowing Inland Revenue to remit interest charges on the late payment of tax for taxpayers who are physically prevented from making payment as a result of the flooding. 3. The current rate of interest (use-of -money interest) on underpayments of tax is 7%. 4. The level of flooding and disruption in Canterbury, resulting from the heavy rains that fell over the period 29 May to 1 June 2021, is physically preventing some taxpayers from meeting their tax obligations, including filing, and paying tax on time. For example, GST returns for taxpayers with taxable periods ending May and FBT quarterly returns are now due, and upcoming PAYE payments are due on 5 June. The late payment of these tax types results in the automatic imposition of interest by Inland Revenue. 5. The number of taxpayers affected by the flooding is not yet known. 6. Relief from late payment and late filing penalties is already available for taxpayers affected by the flooding. However, this relief does not extend to the remission of interest charged to compensate the Crown for the loss of the use of the revenue. This reflects that the remission of interest requires a higher threshold, such as a natural disaster, before the relief can be provided. Order in Council: Tax Administration (Canterbury Flood Event) Order 2021 7. The Tax Administration Act 1994 allows for an Order in Council to be made allowing Inland Revenue to remit interest where: 7.1 an emergency event physically prevents a taxpayer from paying tax on time; 7.2 this non-payment results in the imposition of interest; and 7.3 the taxpayer is a member of a class of persons eligible for remission of interest if the Order in Council declaring the emergency event describes such a class of persons. 8. The major flooding in Canterbury meets the criteria for remission. The Order would allow Inland Revenue to remit use-of -money interest incurred by taxpayers who were physically prevented from paying their tax on time due to the flooding. For the purposes of the Order, the emergency event is defined as the floods resulting from the heavy rains Canterbury received between 29 May and 1 June 2021. 9. While the Order allows Inland Revenue to remit amounts of interest incurred before the Order is made, it is desirable to authorise the relief as soon as possible. The reasons for this are taxpayer certainty and equity, and the efficient use of Inland Revenue resource. In Confidence IR2021/251: Order in Council: Tax Administration (Canterbury Flood Event) Order 2021- use of money interest relief Page 2 of 3 10. The Order will expire on 31 August 2021. Tax debts that remain unpaid from PAYE, GST or FBT obligations would incur interest after that date. Other tax relief for taxpayers 11. Under existing administrative relief, Inland Revenue is offering relief from late payment and late filing penalties for taxpayers affected by the floods. Farmers with income equalisation accounts who have been affected by flooding are able to make early withdrawals. 12. Some taxpayers may, under the circumstances, have lost some or all of their tax records. Inland Revenue is able to manage this situation under current law. 13. Recent tax changes giving favourable treatment to donated trading stock will also be of assistance to support the region’s recovery. Revenue implications 14. The baseline forecasts do not include the emergency event, nor the potential interest charges should the event trigger additional debt. Remission of interest charges arising from the Canterbury flood event will not have an effect on the existing fiscal baselines. Consultation 15. Inland Revenue’s advice has been informed by advice from the Ministry for Primary Industries. 16. The Treasury has been consulted in the preparation of this report. Officials have informed the Chartered Accountants of Australia and New Zealand about the proposed interest remission relief. 17. A copy of this report, and the attached paper to Cabinet, should be referred to the Minister of Finance for his information. In Confidence IR2021/251: Order in Council: Tax Administration (Canterbury Flood Event) Order 2021- use of money interest relief Page 3 of 3 Recommended action We recommend that you: (a) Approve and lodge the attached paper to Cabinet for its meeting on 8 June 2021.

\[IN CONFIDENCE\] In confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet TAX ADMINISTRATION (CANTERBURY FLOOD EVENT) ORDER 2021 Proposal 1. I seek Cabinet’s agreement to allow Inland Revenue to remit interest charges on late payments of tax caused by taxpayers being physically prevented from paying tax due to the recent flooding in Canterbury. Allowing Inland Revenue to remit this interest requires an Order in Council. Policy 2. A medium-scale adverse event has been declared in response to the recent h eavy rains and subsequent flooding in Canterbury. The level of flooding and disruption in Canterbury is physically preventing some taxpayers from meeting their tax obligations, including filing, and paying tax on time. 3. Relief from late payment and late filing penalties is already available for t axpayers affected by the flooding. However, this relief does not extend to the remission of interest charged by Inland Revenue to compensate the Crown for the loss of the use of revenue (use-of-money interest). This reflects that the remission of interest requires a higher threshold, such as a natural disaster, before the relief can be provided and requires Cabinet approval. The current rate of interest on underpayments of tax is 7%. 4. The Tax Administration Act 1994 provides for an Order in Council to allow I nland Revenue to remit interest where: a. an emergency event physically prevents a taxpayer from paying tax on time; b. the non-payment of tax results in the imposition of interest; and c. the taxpayer is a member of class of persons eligible for remission of i nterest if the Order in Council declaring the emergency event describes such a class of person. 5. The major flooding in Canterbury meets the criteria for interest remission. The Order authorises Inland Revenue to remit use-of-money interest incurred by taxpayers who were physically prevented from paying their tax on time due to the floods. For the purposes of the Order, the emergency event is defined as the floods in Canterbury resulting from the heavy rain that fell between 29 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-07 15:26:17 1 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] May and 1 June 2021. The Order will commence on its notification in the Gazette and will expire 31 August 2021. Timing and 28-day rule 6. A waiver of the 28-day rule is sought, to enable the regulations to take effect f rom the day after their notification in the Gazette. Exercise of this power is taxpayer-friendly, and not expected to affect anyone negatively. Further, the sooner the relief is effective the more certain taxpayers’ positions will be, and Inland Revenue’s processing of relief applications will be more efficient. Once in force, the Order will enable Inland Revenue to remit interest charged prior to the making of the Order. Compliance 7. Section 183ABA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides the statutory a uthority for the Governor-General to declare an event to be an emergency event and qualify for the making of an Order in Council. This event meets the Tax Administration Act’s qualifying criteria. 8. The Order in Council complies with the following: The principles of the Treaty of Waitangi N ot applicable The rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Not applicable Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993 The principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act Not applicable 1 993 Relevant international standards and obligations Not applicable The Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are Compliant ma intained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee Regulations Review Committee 9. Officials believe there are no grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Order in Council to the attention of the House under Standing Order 319. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 10. The regulations have been certified by the Parliamentary Counsel Office as b eing in order for submission to Cabinet, except that they will come into force earlier than the 28 th day after the date of their notification in the Gazette. 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-07 15:26:17 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Impact Analysis Regulatory Impact Assessment 11. The Regulatory Impact Analysis Team at the Treasury has determined that the regulatory proposals in this paper are exempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statement on the basis that they are only modifying the effect of primary legislation, under powers only able to be exercised by the government during a declared emergency or emergency transition period. Climate Implications of Policy Assessment 12. The Climate Implications of Policy Assessment (CIPA) team has been co nsulted and confirms that the CIPA requirements do not apply to this proposal as the threshold for significance is not met. Publicity 13. I will announce Inland Revenue’s ability to remit use-of-money interest once t he Order is in effect and notified in the Gazette. Proactive Release 14. I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers in whole within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Consultation 15. Inland Revenue officials have consulted with the Treasury who agree with the p roposal in this paper. My officials have also informed the Chartered Accountants of Australia and New Zealand about Inland Revenue proposed response to the flooding event. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that Cabinet: 1. Note that the Tax Administration Act 1994 authorises the Commissioner of I nland Revenue to remit interest charged to taxpayers for late payment of tax, where the late payment was due to the effects of an emergency event declared by Order in Council. 2. Note that the event described as the Canterbury Flood Event meet the criteria sp ecified in the Tax Administration Act 1994 for the declaration of an emergency event. 3. Authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Tax Administration (C anterbury Flood Event) Order 2021. 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-07 15:26:17 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 4. Note that this remission of interest is not expected to have a fiscal cost. 5. Note that a waiver of the 28-day rule is sought on the grounds that the e xercise of the power will only positively affect taxpayers, and the power it confers will apply to events before the making of the Order. 6. Agree to the waiver of the 28-day rule so that the regulations can come into f orce after their notification in the Gazette.

POLICY AND REGULATORY STEWARDSHIP Tax policy report: Order in Council: Tax Administration (Top of the South Island Flood Event) Order 2021 - use of money interest relief Date: 20 July 2021 Priority: High Security level: In Confidence Report number: IR2021/314 Action sought Action sought Deadline Minister of Revenue Approve and lodge the attached paper to Cabinet office Refer a copy of this report and the attached Cabinet paper to the Minister of Finance 10am, Thursday 22 July 2021 Contact for telephone discussion (if required) Name Position Telephone Peter Frawley Policy Lead Brandon Sloan Principal Policy Advisor s 9(2)(a) In Confidence IR2021/314: Order in Council: Tax Administration (Top of the South Island Flood Event) Order 2021- use of money interest relief Page 1 of 3 20 July 2021 Minister of Revenue Order in Council: Tax Administration (Top of the South Island Flood Event) Order 2021 – use of money interest relief 1. A medium-scale adverse event has been declared for the top of the South Island. 2. Between 15 to 18 July 2021 the West Coast, Nelson/Tasman, and Marlborough regions were subject to very heavy rainfall and resulting inundation. The most affected districts are Buller, Grey, Westland, Tasman, and Marlborough. Buller and Marlborough declared a state of emergency during the event. 3. In response to that event, this report recommends you approve and lodge the attached paper to Cabinet. The paper seeks Cabinet’s approval for an Order in Council allowing Inland Revenue to remit interest charges on the late payment of tax for taxpayers who are physically prevented from making payment as a result of the flooding. The current rate of interest (use-of -money interest) on underpayments of tax is 7%. 4. Cabinet’s approval will be provided by a group of Ministers with power to act, and a special Executive C ouncil meeting is being arranged for 26 July 2021 to make the Order in Council. Impact of the floods on taxpayers 5. The level of flooding and disruption resulting from the heavy rain that fell over the period 15 July to 18 July 2021 has or will physically prevent some taxpayers from meeting their tax obligations, including filing, and paying tax on time. The inundation in the affected areas has impacted local infrastructure and taxpayers in those communities need to focus on the immediate effects of the floods rather than their tax affairs. 6. The are several key tax payment dates where tax is due around this time of July. For example, PAYE is due 20 July for many taxpayers in the affected regions. FBT quarterly returns are also required for some taxpayers on the same date. 7. Given the extent of the damage for example, in Westport or Spring Creek, near Blenheim, GST returns for taxpayers with taxable periods ending June, and due 28 July, are also likely to be affected. Non-standard provisional tax balance date taxpayers in the affected regions may also be affected as they have tax payments due 28 July. 8. Late payment of these tax types results in Inland Revenue automatically imposing interest. 9. The number of taxpayers affected by the flooding is not yet known. 10. Relief from late payment and late filing penalties is already available for taxpayers affected by the flooding. However, this relief does not extend to the remission of interest charged to compensate the Crown for the loss of the use of the revenue. This is because the remission of interest requires a higher threshold, such as a natural disaster, and Cabinet approval before the relief can be provided. In Confidence IR2021/314: Order in Council: Tax Administration (Top of the South Island Flood Event) Order 2021- use of money interest relief Page 2 of 3 Order in Council: Tax Administration (Top of the South Island Flood Event) Order 2021 11.

The major flooding in the top of the South Island meets the criteria for remission. The Order would allow Inland Revenue to remit use-of -money interest incurred by taxpayers who were physically prevented from paying their tax on time due to the flooding. For the purposes of the Order, the emergency event is defined as the floods resulting from the heavy rain the West Coast, Nelson/Tasman, and Marlborough regions received between 15 and 18 July. 13. While the Order allows Inland Revenue to remit amounts of interest incurred before the Order is made, it is desirable to authorise the relief as soon as possible. The reasons for this are taxpayer certainty and equity, and the efficient use of Inland Revenue resource. 14. The Order will expire on 31 October 2021. Tax debts that remain unpaid from PAYE, GST or FBT obligations would incur interest after that date. The Wellington region is not within scope of the proposed Order 15. Parts of the Wellington region have also been affected by the heavy rainfall over 16 and 18 July, but on a localised basis. The Wellington region has not been included in the medium-scale adverse event declaration and is not included within the scope of the proposed Order in Council allowing UOMI remission. There is no evidence to suggest that taxpayers affected by the localised flooding have been or will be physically prevented from paying tax as existing telecommunications and physical infrastructure remains intact. Wellington taxpayers affected by the heavy rain and who cannot meet their tax obligations will be considered on a case-by -case basis under Inland Revenue’s existing administrative relief rules. They would not, however, be automatically eligible for interest remission relief. Other tax relief for taxpayers 16. Under existing administrative powers, Inland Revenue is offering relief from late payment and late filing penalties for taxpayers affected by the floods. Farmers with income equalisation accounts who have been affected by flooding are able to make early withdrawals. 17. Some taxpayers may, under the circumstances, have lost some or all of their tax records. Inland Revenue is able to manage this situation under current law. 18. Recent tax changes giving favourable treatment to donated trading stock will also be of assistance to support the region’s recovery. Fiscal implications 19.

Consultation 20. Inland Revenue’s advice has been informed by advice from the Ministry for Primary Industries. 21. The Treasury has been consulted in the preparation of this report. Officials have consulted the Federated Farmers and they support the proposed interest remission relief for the affected regions. The Chartered Accountants of Australia and New Zealand has been informed. Next steps 22. The attached paper to Cabinet should be referred to the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Crown-Māori Relations, and the Minister for Housing (as Ministers with the Power to Act as per CAB-21-MIN-0282) for their approval. A special Executive Council meeting is being arranged for 26 July 2021 to make the Order in Council. Recommended action We recommend that you: (a) Refer the attached Cabinet paper to the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Crown-Māori Relations, and the Minister for Housing, as Ministers with the Power to Act, as per CAB-21-MIN-0282, for their approval.

In confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Tax Administration (Top of the South Island Flood Event) Order 2021 Proposal 1 I seek Cabinet’s agreement to allow Inland Revenue to remit interest charges on late payments of tax caused by taxpayers being physically prevented from paying tax due to the recent flooding in the South Island – specifically the West Coast, Nelson/Tasman, and Marlborough regions. Allowing Inland Revenue to remit this interest requires an Order in Council. Policy 2 A medium-scale adverse event has been declared in response to the recent heavy rain and subsequent flooding in the West Coast, Nelson/Tasman, and Marlborough.

This extension of time can be achieved by an Order in Council made under section 226 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). 2. Customers may struggle to meet the existing due date because of a combination of COVID-19 impacts across the country, the extended higher alert level in the Auckland region and the cutover of the second release of Stage 4 of START 1 . This change of date will allow customers more time to meet their compliance requirements. 3. Section 226 of the TAA gives the Governor-General, by Order in Council, the power to extend the time for a taxpayer to do anything required under the TAA, the Income Tax Act 2007 or the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. This includes the due date for the filing of tax returns and the payment of tax. 4. The second release of Stage 4 of Inland Revenue’s START system is due to “go live” on the 28 th of October. This process will involve the shutdown of Inland Revenue’s computer systems from the afternoon of the 21 st of October to the morning of the 28 th of October. During this period, customers will not be able to access those systems to file their GST returns before the due date. Although taxpayers will still generally be able to make payments during that cutover period 2 , they will not be able to file returns. 5. Before the COVID-19 outbreak, Inl and Revenue considered we could manage any concerns of customers on an exception basis. However, this has now changed with the pressure on both businesses and Inland Revenue. 6. Delaying the due date to 4 November will largely restore to customers the business days when Inland Revenue’s systems are unavailable. More generally, it will also give customers extra time to meet their obligations, which may not have been top of mind during the extended lockdown period. 7. The fiscal cost of delaying the due date will be a maximum of $1.80 million, which can be met through the scorecard. Background 8. The final release of Inland Revenue’s START system is due to “go live” on the morning of 28 October 2021. Before that, customers will not be able to access Inland Revenue systems from the afternoon of the 21 st of October until the morning of the 28 th of October. 1 START – Simplified Tax and Revenue Technology – Inland Revenue’s new technology platform. 2 The exceptions being payments made by direct debit or credit card. IR2021/415: Extending the tax due date on 28 October 2021 to 4 November 2021. Page 2 of 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 9. This cutover period was chosen because the timing of Labour weekend means Inland Revenue systems would only be unavailable for three working days. Cutting over without the long weekend would mean a minimum of four working days without customer access to the systems. 10. In addition, this release of START migrates child support into START. Having a later cutover date might have affected when child support customers received their first payment under the START system. 11. System upgrades to be made at the same time will also make improvements to myIR to make it easier to use and deliver new functionality for customers. However, some customers may take a little time to get familiar with the new improvements. 12. The 28 th of October is a major due date for GST and a minor due date for income tax (including provisional tax) 3 by volume. Although many customers file their returns early, the inaccessibility of Inland Revenue systems may be problematic for some customers who would usually file their GST returns and make their GST payments during that period before the due date when those systems are inaccessible. While Inland Revenue will still be able to accept most payments 4 , customers may need system access to calculate their liability to pay. 13. In addition, many customers may only just be getting back to semi-normal operations at level 2 by that date, due to the extended lockdown in the Auckland region. While Inland Revenue can assist those customers who have financial difficulties due to COVID-19, a large number of customers won’t meet the requirements for that assistance but would benefit from a few extra days to meet their compliance obligations. 14. Another pressure on this period is the opening of the next tranche of the resurgence support payment (RSP) on the 29 th of October. This was an additional measure that was unplanned for this period. The additional work required to support the next tranche of the RSP will use resources that would otherwise be used to support customers during the cutover period. 15. Customers will be charged use of money interest and late payment and filing penalties if an extension of the due date is not made and they are unable to complete their returns or make payments on time because of the cutover or the extended lockdown and are not able to claim relief under the Commissioner’s specific COVID-19 remission powers. 16. Section 226 of the TAA gives the Governor-General, by Order in Council, the power to extend the time for anything required under the TAA, the Income Tax Act 2007 or the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. No other provision within the Inland Revenue Acts would allow the Commissioner to extend the due date or otherwise remove the consequences of taxpayers filing or paying late 5 . 17. Officials consider that giving customers some extra time to meet their compliance obligations for this payment date would be appropriate, due to the combination of Inland Revenue systems being inaccessible before 28 October, the pressures on Inland Revenue to deliver a range of support packages, and businesses recovering from the extended lockdown in the Auckland region. 18. Officials therefore recommend using the power in section 226 of the TAA to extend the 28 October filing and payment date to 4 November 2021. The additional time 3 The 28 th of October is the due date for the filing and payment of GST returns for the period to 30 September 2021 and includes customers who file monthly, two-monthly and six-monthly. Although this is a minor payment date for provisional tax it does include some larger taxpayers with September balance dates, being some of the major trading banks. 4 The exceptions being payments made by direct debit or credit card. 5 Other than a limited power to remit late payment penalties. IR2021/415: Extending the tax due date on 28 October 2021 to 4 November 2021. Page 3 of 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] given will largely restore to customers the time when Inland Revenue systems will be inaccessible. 19. Due to the limited timeframe before the due date, it will also be necessary to seek a waiver of the 28-day rule to ensure the Order in Council comes into force before 28 October. Administrative implications 20. There are no significant administrative implications to changing the due date from 28 October to 4 November. While some administrative work will be required to reflect the changed date, this is manageable within existing workloads. 21. Using an Order in Council to change the due date allows Inland Revenue to deal with affected customers as a group without individual contacts where customers have issues filing and paying on time. This will improve the customer experience and reduce the need for customers to contact Inland Revenue. 22. If you agree to extending the due date to 4 November, we propose communicating this extension to customers to ensure they are fully aware of the availability of Inland Revenue systems and when they will need to file and pay to give them certainty around the cutover period. The messaging for customers would be: 22.1 Before cutover (closing afternoon of 21 October) – please file and pay early. 22.2 During cutover (afternoon 21 October to morning of 28 October) – customers are unable to file but please pay through the usual payment channels (Direct Debit and Credit Card options will not be available). 22.3 After cutover (morning of 28 October) – please file and pay by the new due date of 4 November and you will not be exposed to UOMI or LPP. Fiscal implications 23. Due to the three-day delay in receiving payments, there is technically a fiscal cost to the extension. On the assumption that every customer delays their GST payments until the 4 th of November, the approximate fiscal cost will be $1.80 million, which we recommend be charged to the scorecard. Consultation 24. Treasury has been consulted on this report. Next steps 25. If you agree to the extension, officials will issue drafting instructions to the Parliamentary Counsel Office to draft an Order in Council to extend the due date from 28 October to 4 November 2021 under section 226 of the TAA. 26. Once a draft Order in Council is prepared, we will report to you with a draft Cabinet paper for lodging with Cabinet Office by 10am on 14 October 2021. 27. For the Order in Council to come into effect by 28 October, and accounting for the extended recess in October, the Cabinet paper would need to be considered by Cabinet and the Executive Council on 18 October and a waiver to the 28-day rule obtained.

In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet TAX ADMINISTRATION (EXTENSION OF DUE DATES) ORDER 2021 Proposal 1. This paper seeks agreement to extend the due date for the payment of tax and the filing of tax returns required under the Tax Administration Act 1994, Income Tax Act 2007 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 from the 28th of October 2021 to the 4th of November 2021. 2. This paper seeks agreement to submit the Tax Administration (Extension of Due Dates) Order 2021 to the Executive Council extending this due date. Background 3. The second release of Stage 4 of Inland Revenue’s START 1 system is due to “go live” on the 28th of October 2021. This process will involve the shutdown of Inland Revenue’s computer systems from the afternoon of the 21st of October to the morning of the 28th of October. During this period, taxpayers will not be able to access those systems to file their Goods and Services Tax (GST) returns before the due date. 4. The 28th of October is a major due date for GST 2 and a lesser due date for income tax (including provisional tax). Although many taxpayers file their returns early, the shutdown of Inland Revenue systems may be problematic for some customers who would usually file their GST returns and make their GST payments. While Inland Revenue will still be able to accept most payments 3 , taxpayers may need system access to calculate their liability to pay. 5. This shutdown period was chosen because the timing of Labour weekend means Inland Revenue systems would only be unavailable for three working days. Shutting down without the long weekend would mean a minimum of four working days without customer access to the systems. 6. In addition, this release migrates child support into START. Having a later shutdown date might have affected when child support customers received their first payment under the START system. 1 START – Simplified Tax and Revenue Technology – Inland Revenue’s new technology platform. 2 The 28 th of October is the due date for the filing and payment of GST returns for the period to 30 September 2021 and includes taxpayers who file monthly, two-monthly and six-monthly. 3 The exceptions being payments made by direct debit or credit card. 1 2r4hxlcklw 2021-12-13 13:28:15 7. Before the COVID-19 outbreak, Inland Revenue considered it could manage any concerns of taxpayers around the cutover period on an exception basis. However, this has now changed with the pressure on both businesses and Inland Revenue. 8. Taxpayers may struggle to meet the existing due date because of a combination of COVID-19 impacts across the country, the extended higher alert level in the Auckland region and the shutdown of Inland Revenue’s systems. Should they miss that date they may become liable to use of money interest, penalties for late payment and filing. 9. Extending the due date for payments and the filling of tax returns from the 28th of October 2021 to the 4th of November 2021 will allow taxpayers more time to meet their compliance requirements and reduce stress to taxpayers at an already difficult time. Order in Council 10. Section 226 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 gives the Governor-General, by Order in Council, the power to extend the time for anything required under the Tax Administration Act 1994, the Income Tax Act 2007 or the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (Revenue Acts). This includes the due dates for the filing of tax returns and payments required under the Revenue Acts. 11. The Order in Council, Tax Administration (Extension of Due Dates) Order 2021, extends the due date for payments and the filling of tax returns required under the Revenue Acts from the 28th of October 2021 to the 4th of November 2021. Financial Implications 12. Due to the seven-day delay in receiving payments, there is a fiscal cost to this proposal. On the assumption that most taxpayers delay their tax and GST payments until the 4th of November, the approximate fiscal cost will be $1.40 million, which will be charged to the tax policy scorecard. 13. The table below provides the indicative estimates of the cost of extending the due date for payment from 28th October 2021 to 4th November 2021: $m – increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 Tax Revenue (1.400) --- Total Operating 1.400 2 2r4hxlcklw 2021-12-13 13:28:15 14. I have the delegated authority to approve this fiscal cost and charge this against the tax policy scorecard. 15. There is no additional administrative cost from the extension of the due date. Impact Analysis 16. Treasury's Regulatory Impact Analysis team has determined that the proposal to extend the due date for the payment of tax and the filing of returns is exempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statement on the grounds that it has no or only minor impacts on businesses, individuals, and not-for-profit entities. Consultation 17. The Treasury have been consulted on the extension. The Treasury and the Parliamentary Counsel Office have been informed of the contents of this paper. Communications 18. Inland Revenue have communicated this change to taxpayers to give them time to plan for the extension since Ministers agreed to the extension. Timing and 28-day rule 19. The Order in Council will come into force on the 21st of October 2021. A waiver of the 28-day rule is sought due to the short timeframe between the making of the order and the original due date for filing of returns and payment of tax. The order must be in force prior to the original due date. 20. A waiver is appropriate in this circumstance as the Order in Council will confer only benefits on taxpayers by allowing them to defer the filing and payment of tax without penalty where many of them may still be struggling with the extended lockdown due to COVID-19. Proactive Release 21. This paper will be proactively released with any appropriate withholdings within 30 business days of final decisions being taken by Cabinet. Recommendations I recommend that Cabinet: 1. agree to extend by Order in Council the due date for the payment of tax and the filing of tax returns required under the Tax Administration Act 1994, Income Tax Act 2007 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 from the 28 th of October 2021 to the 4 th of November 2021. 2. agree to a waiver of the 28-day rule for the coming into force of the Order in Council. 3. note that the fiscal cost of recommendation 1 is approximately $1.4 million which will be charged to the tax policy scorecard. 3 2r4hxlcklw 2021-12-13 13:28:15 4. note that the Tax Administration (Extension of Due Dates) Order 2021 will give effect to the decision referred to in recommendation 1 above; 5. note that the Tax Administration (Extension of Due Dates) Order 2021 will come into force on 21st October 2021; and 6. authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Tax Administration (Extension of Due Dates) Order 2021.

1 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Tax Administration (August Flood Events) Order 2022 Proposal 1 I seek Cabinet’s agreement to allow Inland Revenue to remit interest charges on late payments for taxpayers who have been significantly adversely affected by recent flooding in the top of the North and South Islands – specifically, the Far North district, and the Marlborough, Nelson, and Tasman regions. Allowing Inland Revenue to remit this interest requires an Order in Council. Policy 2 A medium-scale adverse event has been declared in response to the recent heavy rain and subsequent flooding in the Far North district, and the Marlborough, Nelson, and Tasman regions, between 17 and 21 August 2022. Marlborough, Nelson, and Tasman declared a state of emergency during the event. The level of flooding and disruption in these regions has significantly adversely affected the ability of some taxpayers to meet their tax obligations, including filing and paying tax on time. 3 The are several key tax payment dates around this time of August. For example, PAYE was due on 22 August for many taxpayers in the affected regions. GST returns and payments, as well as provisional income tax instalments, are also required for some taxpayers on 29 August. Given the extent of the damage in some affected areas, these returns and payments are likely to be affected and result in interest charges and penalties. 4 Inland Revenue has the power to provide relief from late payment and late filing penalties for taxpayers affected by flooding, at the Commissioner’s discretion. However, this relief does not extend to the remission of interest (use-of-money interest) charged by Inland Revenue to compensate the Crown for the loss of the use of revenue. This is because the remission of interest requires a higher threshold, such as a natural disaster, and requires Cabinet approval before the relief can be provided. The current rate of interest on underpayments of tax is 7.28 percent. Without relief, the late payment of tax due on the statutory date results in the automatic statutory imposition of interest. 5 The Tax Administration Act 1994 provides for an Order in Council to allow Inland Revenue to remit interest where: 5.1 an emergency event has, or will, significantly adversely affect a taxpayer’s ability to pay an amount of tax on time, or make an accurate forecast of provisional tax; 5.2 the non-payment of tax results in the imposition of interest; and 1lp2bvftqb 2022-09-07 13:32:48 1. 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 5.3 the taxpayer is a member of class of persons eligible for remission of interest if the Order in Council declaring the emergency event describes such a class of person. 6 The major flooding in the top of the North and South Islands meets the criteria for interest remission. The Order authorises Inland Revenue to remit use-of-money interest incurred by taxpayers whose ability to pay their tax on time was significantly adversely affected by the floods. For the purposes of the Order, the emergency event is defined as the floods in the Far North district, and the Marlborough, Nelson, and Tasman regions, resulting from the heavy rainfall that fell between 17 and 21 August 2022. 7 The Order will commence on its notification in the Gazette and will expire on 31 January 2023. Timing and 28-day Rule 8 A waiver of the 28-day rule is sought, to enable the regulations to take effect from the day after their notification in the Gazette. Exercise of this power is taxpayer-friendly, and is not expected to affect anyone negatively. Further, the sooner the relief is effective the more certain taxpayers’ positions will be, and Inland Revenue’s processing of relief applications will be more efficient. Once in force, the Order will enable Inland Revenue to remit interest charged prior to the making of the Order. Compliance 9 Section 183ABA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides the statutory authority for the Governor-General by Order in Council to declare an event to be an emergency event and allow Inland Revenue to remit use-of-money interest. This event meets the Tax Administration Act’s qualifying criteria. 10 The Order in Council complies with the following: The principles of the Treaty of Waitangi Not applicable The rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993 Not applicable The principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993 Not applicable Relevant international standards and obligations Not applicable The Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee Compliant Financial Implications 11 The baseline forecasts do not include the emergency event, nor the potential UOMI charges should the event trigger additional debt. Remission of UOMI for significantly adversely affected taxpayers in the Far North district, and the Marlborough, Nelson, and Tasman regions, will not affect existing fiscal baselines. 1lp2bvftqb 2022-09-07 13:32:48 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Regulations Review Committee 12 Officials believe there are no grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Order in Council to the attention of the House under Standing Order 327. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 13 The regulations have been certified by the Parliamentary Counsel Office as being in order for submission to Cabinet, except that they will come into force earlier than the 28 th day after the date of their notification in the Gazette. Impact Analysis Regulatory Impact Assessment 14 The Treasury's Regulatory Impact Analysis team has determined that this proposal to allow Inland Revenue to remit interest charges on late payments is exempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statement on the grounds that it is intended to manage the direct actions taken to protect the public in response to a declared emergency event and intended to temporarily defer or extend legislative deadlines where a declared emergency has made compliance with the existing legislative requirements impossible, impractical or unreasonably burdensome. Climate Implications of Policy Assessment 15 The Climate Implications of Policy Assessment (CIPA) team has been consulted and confirms that the CIPA requirements do not apply to this proposal as the threshold for significance is not met. Publicity 16 I will announce Inland Revenue’s ability to remit use-of-money interest once the Order is in effect and notified in the Gazette. Proactive Release 17 I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers in whole within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Consultation 18 Inland Revenue officials have consulted with the Treasury, and the Ministry for Primary Industries, which agree with the proposal in this paper. Federated Farmers were also consulted and agree with the proposed Order. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand have been informed of the proposed Order. 1lp2bvftqb 2022-09-07 13:32:48 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that Cabinet: 1 Note that the Tax Administration Act 1994 authorises the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to remit interest charged to taxpayers for late payment of tax, where the late payment was due to the effects of an emergency event declared by Order in Council. 2 Note that the event described as the August Flood Events meets the criteria specified in the Tax Administration Act 1994 for the declaration of an emergency event. 3 Authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Tax Administration (August Flood Events) Order 2022. 4 Note that this remission of interest is not expected to have an effect on fiscal baselines. 5 Note that a waiver of the 28-day rule is sought on the grounds that the exercise of the power will only positively affect taxpayers, and the power it confers will apply to events before the making of the Order. 6 Agree to the waiver of the 28-day rule so that the regulations can come into force after their notification in the Gazette.

Page 1 of 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 7 July 2021 Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue Extending the Commissioner’s COVID-19 administrative flexibility 1. This report seeks your agreement to extend the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s (“Commissioner”) discretionary power to provide administrative flexibility for taxpayers affected by COVID-19. This power was introduced on 30 April 2020 as part of a range of response measures to COVID-19. 2. The COVID-19 Response (Taxation and Other Regulatory Urgent Measures) Act 2020 inserted the discretionary power into the Tax Administration Act 1994. The discretion allows the Commissioner to vary time related requirements (timelines, due dates, deadlines, and time periods), procedural or administrative requirements when taxpayers are likely to be impacted by COVID-19 and compliance with current requirements is impossible, unreasonable, or impractical. 3. The administrative flexibility measure was limited in application to an 18-month period ending 30 September 2021, unless extended by an Order in Council upon recommendation of the Minister of Revenue. Officials recommend the discretionary power be extended for one year, to enable the Commissioner to respond quickly in the event taxpayers are further impacted by COVID-19. Background 4. The discretionary power provides more flexibility for taxpayers to comply with their tax obligations where they have been affected by COVID-19. The legislation enables the Commissioner to issue a COVID-19 variation to provide flexibility in the compliance obligations under the Inland Revenue Acts. Where taxpayers comply with a variation, they are treated as if they complied with the requirement set out in legislation. 5. When a taxpayer applies for a COVID-19 variation, the Commissioner must first consider whether the issue can be resolved using existing legislation, including the Commissioner’s care and management discretion. If the issue cannot be resolved, the Commissioner may only issue a variation if compliance is impossible, impractical, or unreasonable in circumstances arising from the imposition of COVID- 19 response measures or as a consequence of COVID-19. 6. Any COVID-19 variation issued by the Commissioner is optional for taxpayers to apply, t axpayers may choose to comply with the requirements set out in legislation rather than any variation issued. This is to ensure that taxpayers are not worse-off from the variation. 7. Since the power has been in force, t he Commissioner has issued 12 variations in 2020 and two variations in 2021, with 17 requests being declined. 1 Generally, variations are targeted and time limited. 1 Three of the 17 applications noted were resolved using the Commissioner’s care and management provision. IR2021/303: Extending the Commissioner’s COVID-19 administrative flexibility. Page 2 of 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 8. For example, a variation was given extending the due date for filing statements of R&D loss tax credits and R&D repayment tax from 1 April 2020 until 31 August 2020. The variation was limited to taxpayers for whom the impact of COVID-19 response measures or the consequences of COVID-19 had a material impact on them not filing the statements on time. 9. Although Inland Revenue does not expect the power to be exercised while in the current circumstances, retaining the discretionary measure will be of use in the event of future outbreaks and/or lockdowns impacting taxpayer’s ability to meet their compliance obligations. Administrative implications 10. There are no significant administrative implications, as the process for assessing and implementing variations under the COVID-19 administrative flexibility measure is already in place. Fiscal implications 11. Fiscal costs for the COVID-19 variation power are unquantifiable in advance because it depends how the power is exercised. However, the fiscal impact of the variations issued so far ha ve been minor or immaterial as most variations related to the timing allowed for elections or applications to occur. 12. Each fiscal impact depends on the period affected by the variation. For example, two very similar GST variations had varying fiscal impacts depending on whether the variations effectively crossed fiscal years. 13. One variation allowed GST-registered persons to elect to change from six -monthly filing periods to one-monthly, enabling any refunds to be claimed earlier. In this instance the fiscal cost was approximately $4 million in 2019/20, as GST refunds were claimed in 2019/20 fiscal year instead of the 2020/21 year. In comparison, a similar GST variation had no June year fiscal impact for the government because it covered return periods which did not cross between June fiscal years. However, it was still beneficial from a taxpayers’ perspective because it allowed for refund claims earlier than would otherwise have occurred. Consultation 14. Treasury has been consulted on this report. Next steps 15. If you agree to the extension, officials will issue drafting instructions to the Parliamentary Counsel Office to draft an Order in Council to extend the power by one year. 16. Once a draft Order in Council is prepared, we will report to you with a draft Cabinet paper for submission with the Cabinet Legislation Committee. 17. For the Order in Council to come into effect by 30 September, the Cabinet paper would need to be considered by the Cabinet Legislation Committee in the second half of August, or a waiver to the 28-day rule obtained.

You previously agreed to extend the COVID-19 administrative flexibility measure by one year (to 30 September 2022), and for officials to instruct the Parliamentary Counsel Office (PCO) to draft an Order in Council to give effect to this change (IR2021/303 refers). 3. The administrative flexibility measure was introduced in 2020 in the Tax Administration Act 1994 to provide more flexibility for taxpayers to comply with their tax obligations where they have been affected by the impacts of COVID-19. The measure was limited in application to an 18-month period ending 30 September 2021, unless extended by an Order in Council upon recommendation of the Minister of Revenue. 4. The administrative flexibility measure allows the Commissioner to vary time- related, procedural or administrative requirements (timelines, due dates, deadlines, and time periods) when taxpayers are likely to be impacted by COVID-19 and compliance with current requirements is impossible, unreasonable or impractical. The legislation enables the Commissioner to issue a COVID-19 variation to provide flexibility in the compliance obligations under the Inland Revenue Acts. Where taxpayers choose to comply with a variation, they are treated as if they complied with the requirement set out in legislation. 5. The Parliamentary Counsel Office are currently drafting the Tax Administration (COVID-19 Response Variations) Order 2021 (Order in Council). Officials have prepared a LEG paper for your consideration and, if you agree, for lodgement to the Cabinet Office by 19 August 2021, for consideration at the LEG meeting of 26 August 2021. Implementation 6. The proposed change has an unqualifiable fiscal impact in advance because it depends how the power is exercised. However, the fiscal impact of the variations issued so far have been minor or immaterial as most variations related to the timing al lowed for elections or applications to occur as noted in our previous report (IR2021/303 refers). Any administrative costs of implementing the change will be accommodated within existing processes for assessing and implementing COVID- 19 variations.

\[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee TAX ADMINISTRATION (COVID-19 RESPONSE VARIATIONS) ORDER 2021 Proposal 1. This paper seeks the Committee’s agreement to extend the Commissioner of Inland R evenue’s (Commissioner) COVID-19 administrative flexibility measure by one year (to September 2022). 2. It also seeks the Committee’s agreement to submit the Tax Administration (COVID- 19 Response Variations) Order 2021, which gives effect to the extension, to the Exe cutive Council. Policy 3. In 2020, greater administrative flexibility was granted to the Commissioner in the T ax Administration Act 1994 as part of the response to COVID-19. The discretion allows the Commissioner to vary time related requirements (such as timelines, due dates, deadlines, and time periods), procedural or administrative requirements when taxpayers are likely to be impacted by COVID-19 and compliance with current requirements is impossible, unreasonable, or impractical. 4. The discretionary power allows the Commissioner to issue variations to provide f lexibility for taxpayers to comply with their tax obligations under the Inland Revenue Acts where they have been affected by the impacts of COVID-19. Where taxpayers comply with a variation, they are treated as if they complied with the requirement set out in legislation. 5. Any COVID-19 variation issued by the Commissioner is optional for taxpayers to a pply; taxpayers may choose to comply with the requirements set out in legislation rather than any variation issued. This is to ensure that taxpayers are not worse off from the variation. 6. Extending the Commissioner’s COVID-19 administrative flexibility measure to 30 Se ptember 2022 will enable the Commissioner to act quickly in the event taxpayers are further impacted by COVID-19. 7. To implement this proposal, the Parliamentary Counsel Office has drafted the Tax Ad ministration (COVID-19 Response Variations) Order 2021. This is in accordance with the empowering provision in the Tax Administration Act 1994. The section provides that the administrative flexibility measure was to be time limited to an 18- month period, unless extended by Order in Council upon the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue. 1 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-07 14:25:16 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Timing and 28-Day Rule 8. I propose that the extension of the Commissioner’s administrative flexibility measure under section 6I of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is extended by one year (to 30 September 2022), and applies 28 days after the gazetting date. The Order would then be made in accordance with the rule that a regulation must not come into force, until at least 28 days after the public have been notified in the New Zealand Gazette. Compliance 9. The Order complies with: 9.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 9.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 a nd the Human Rights Act 1993; 9.3 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 2020; 9.4 relevant international standards and obligations; and 9.5 the Legislation Guidelines, which are maintained by the Legislation Design a nd Advisory Committee. 10. Section 6H of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that the measure may be extended upon the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue if it is reasonably necessary in the circumstances because of the continuing impact of COVID-19 related measures or circumstances. 11. I consider that the discretionary power should be extended as it is necessary to e nable the Commissioner to respond quickly in the event taxpayers are further impacted by the effects of COVID-19. I consider the statutory requisites have been met. Regulations Review Committee 12. There are no anticipated grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the O rder in Council to the attention of the House under Standing Order 319. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 13. The Parliamentary Counsel Office has certified that the Order in Council is in order f or submission to Cabinet. Impact Analysis 14. The Treasury's Regulatory Impact Analysis Team has determined that the proposal to extend the Commissioner of Inland Revenue's discretionary power (section 6I of the Tax Administration Act 1994) to provide administrative flexibility for taxpayers affected by COVID-19 by one year (to September 2022) is exempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statement on the grounds that it has no or only minor impact on businesses, individuals, and not-for-profit entities. 2 2r4hxlcklw 2021-09-07 14:25:16 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Communications 15. The new Order in Council will be published in the New Zealand Gazette and on Inland Revenue’s website. Inland Revenue will also publish an article about these changes in its Tax Information Bulletin. Proactive Release 16. I propose to release the policy report and this Cabinet paper in full, shortly following t he notification of the signed Order in Council in the New Zealand Gazette, subject to redactions under the Official Information Act 1982. Consultation 17. The Treasury have been consulted on the extension. The Treasury and the Pa rliamentary Counsel Office have been informed of the contents of this paper. Recommendations I recommend that the Cabinet Legislation Committee: 1. agreet o the extension of the Commissioner’s administrative flexibility measure; 2. note that the Tax Administration (COVID-19 Response Variations) Order 2021 will give effect to the decision referred to in recommendation 1 above; and 3. authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Tax Administration (COVID-19 Response Variations) Order 2021.

POLICY AND STRATEGY Tax policy report: Collecting regular datasets from payment service providers Date: 28 January 2021 Priority: Medium Security level: In Confidence Report number: IR2021/020 Action sought Action sought Deadline Minister of Revenue Agree to recommendations Authorise the submission of the Cabinet Economic Development Committee paper to the Cabinet Office 4 March 2021 Contact for telephone discussion (if required) Name Position Telephone Martin Neylan Principal Advisor, Inland Revenue S 9(2)(a) Sabena Blackhall Policy Advisor, Inland Revenue S 9(2)(a) In Confidence IR2021/020: Collecting regular datasets from payment service providers Page 1 of 5 28 January 2021 Minister of Revenue Collecting regular datasets from payment service providers Purpose 1. This paper seeks your agreement to refer the attached Cabinet Economic Development Committee paper and draft consultation document to the Cabinet Office by 10:00 a.m., 4 March 2021 for the Cabinet Economic Development Committee (DEV) to consider at its meeting on 10 March 2021. 2. The draft paper is seeking Cabinet’s agreement to draft an Order in Council and delegate authority to you to then release the Order in Council, once drafted, with the attached discussion document for consultation with stakeholders. Context and background 3. The Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) allows for the bulk collection of data from persons holding that data, where necessary or relevant for a function lawfully conferred on the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. The Commissioner has a duty to protect the integrity of the tax system and to collect the highest net revenue over time with certain data critical to the undertaking of these duties. 4. Datasets from third parties are currently collected under this power on an ad hoc basis. The reason for this is that the legislative provision they are collected under was not designed for repeat requests and so requires the Commissioner to issue a notice under the TAA legislative power each time the data is required. 5. Inland Revenue has been collecting datasets on a semi-regular basis from two major payment service providers operating in New Zealand since 2005. 1 The datasets collected consist of aggregated data of merchants’ incoming financial transactions and are valuable for several purposes. 2 Primary among these is the insights they make possible for ensuring compliance through education, marketing and targeted campaigns as well as the identification of potential non-compliance. Macro-analysis of this information is also used in research and to inform policy. 6. New legislation was enacted in early 2019 to address the need for the regular collection of large datasets. 3 The change provides for recurring collection of datasets on a continuing and regular basis, enabled by Order in Council. Officials are now seeking to use this new power for the first time and collect data sets from payment service providers on a regular and repeating basis. 7. This new mechanism for dataset collecting will provide a more efficient and transparent process for collecting the same type of information Inland Revenue do es currently, but more regularly, and from more payment service providers. 1 A payment service provider is defined as a third-party business who facilitates payment for goods and services between customers and merchants. Examples include Windcave and Verifone, etc. Some recognised names, such as Apple Pay and AliPay, are excluded from this definition as these are considered products supported by the various banks rather than payment service providers in their own right. 2 A merchant is defined as a person or entity that is engaged in a business activity. T his aggregated data will consist of data from merchants who use payment service providers. 3 Section 17L of the Tax Administration Act enables Regulations providing for the regular collection of bulk datasets In Confidence IR2021/020: Collecting regular datasets from payment service providers Page 2 of 5 8. In June 2020, officials provided the previous Minister of Revenue with the necessary Cabinet paper and accompanying discussion document to be submitted to Cabinet seeking authorisation for consultation. These were approved by the previous Minister of Revenue ahead of the election however there was not enough time for them to progress through Cabinet before Parliament dissolved. Officials are now seeking to resume this process. 9. In this report, officials seek your approval for the attached discussion document and Cabinet paper. The Cabinet paper is seeking that Cabinet: • agree the content of the attached discussion document, • authorise you to instruct the Parliamentary Counsel Office to draft an Order in Council for consultation, and • delegate authorising the release of the discussion document and draft Order in Council to you. Improving voluntary compliance 10. Inland Revenue has previously collected datasets from payment service providers on an ad hoc basis. This process is very time and resource-consuming and has resulted in data being collected irregularly. Irregular collection makes it difficult to achieve outcomes such as accurately assessing compliance over several years and providing timely support. 11. The data collected to date has been crucial to improving Inland Revenue’s ability to know where and when to direct resources to realise value for taxpayers, Inland Revenue and the Government. This information has been used and will continue to be used for three main purposes: • to increase compliance through education, marketing and targeted campaigns to enable taxpayers to fulfil their tax obligations right from the start, • to undertake risk analysis, including the detection of those operating in the hidden economy, and • to inform policy development through macro-analysis research and aid in policy evaluation and application. 12. Irregular dataset collection makes it difficult for us to achieve outcomes such as gaining insights into behaviour over several years and providing timely support or enforcement action. Information sharing between payment service providers and Inland Revenue will be streamlined under the proposal. This will improve efficiency and so help promote compliance and maintenance of the integrity of the tax system. Example of this data helping taxpayers get it right from the start A new business has recently started trading and, due to a predicted annual turnover of $40,000, is not GST registered. After a successful start-up period, they receive $75,000 of income in their first six months. Inland Revenue can verify the business’ income through the information provided by the relevant payment service provider and take proactive steps to remind the business owner that they are now required to register for GST, providing education and support earlier and enabling them to fulfil their tax obligations. They are able to meet their tax obligations and embed best practices, rather than receiving an unexpected tax bill for the oversight. In Confidence IR2021/020: Collecting regular datasets from payment service providers Page 3 of 5 13. The payment service provider market continues to change and is no longer dominated by a small number of major players. Under this new legislation, the Order in Council would apply to a class of persons rather than specific, named entities. The outcome of this is that the repeat request for datasets made under this provision would apply to all payment service providers operating in New Zealand, leaving no party at a commercial disadvantage. Increasing the number of payment service providers Inland Revenue receives information from also mitigates the impact of these market changes on potential insights. 14. Although the first use for this provision is proposed to be for payment service providers, it will be used for more industries in the future to realise further insights. It is therefore important that an effective process is established as part of this initial use so that Inland revenue can more efficiently utilise this provision in the future. Privacy is a priority 15. The aggregated merchant payment data received from payment service providers will show debit, credit, cash out and refunds, both volume and value, per merchant ID for the previous three-month period. This will be accompanied by generic merchant information as outlined in the discussion document (e.g. merchant unique identifier, trade name, contact information, etc). The data received will not relate to individual customer detail and individuals’ payment data will not be identifiable in what is collected. 16. Inland Revenue has been working closely with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner throughout the lifecycle of this project and will continue to do so through the creation of the Order in Council. Consulting on the draft Order in Council 17. An Order in Council can be made for the regular collection of information for the purpose of administration or enforcement of the Inland Revenue Acts, or to fulfil a function lawfully conferred on the Commissioner. The Order in Council is required to prescribe: • the type of information that may be collected; • to whom the regulations apply; • the frequency of reporting; • the form of the information; and • the specifications for the reporting method. 18. The making of an Order in Council requires certain consultation to be undertaken. Consequently, the Cabinet paper seeks to commence consulting on the proposal and draft Order in Council in order to meet these requirements. 19. The draft discussion document will be finalised, and the draft Order in Council attached once drafted. These will then both be released for consultation with the Privacy Commissioner, interested stakeholders, and other organisations who represent the interests of the public affected by the regulation, to further develop the proposal and determine the above requirements. 20. The attached Cabinet paper will seek Cabinet’s approval for you to invite the Parliamentary Counsel Office to commence drafting an Order in Council to give effect to this proposal and allow us to consult on it. Officials have indicated to the Parliamentary Counsel Office that a report is being provided to you on this matter. In Confidence IR2021/020: Collecting regular datasets from payment service providers Page 4 of 5 Consultation 21. Initial consultation was undertaken with identified payment service providers in formulating the discussion document. This means that all major players in this market are aware of our intention to consult on and enact an Order in Council under section 17L of the Tax Administration Act. 22. The Treasury, the Parliamentary Counsel Office, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment were consulted in preparing these papers, including the discussion document. 23. Key stakeholders, including the Privacy Commissioner, will be formally consulted on the discussion document and draft Order in Council. Proactive release of documents 24. Cabinet papers are required to be proactively released within 30 business days of final decisions being taken by Cabinet, unless there is a good reason not to. The attached Cabinet paper contains a proposal to delay its proactive release, alongside the associated minutes and key advice papers, until the launch of consultation. Next steps 25. If you agree for us to consult, a Cabinet Economic Development Committee paper is attached for your consideration and referral to the Cabinet Office. 26. Following consultation, officials will report back to you and Cabinet on the outcome of submissions and seek final policy approval. Officials anticipate this will be in mid- 2021. 27. The proposed timeline for this is: Cabinet authorises the discussion document for consultation and authorises you to instruct Parliamentary council to draft an Order in Council for inclusion as part of consultation. March 2021 Parliamentary Counsel Office drafts Order in Council March to May 2021 Officials report to you seeking your approval to release the discussion document and draft Order in Council May 2021 Discussion document and draft Order in Council released for consultation May to July 2021 (minimum of 6 weeks in line with section 17L requirements). Officials report back to you and Cabinet on the outcome of submissions and seek final policy approval September 2021 (factoring time for PCO to redraft the OIC in line with consultation analysis and final policy proposals) In Confidence IR2021/020: Collecting regular datasets from payment service providers Page 5 of 5 Recommended action We recommend that you: 28.

1 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Economic Development Committee REGULAR DATASET COLLECTION FROM PAYMENT SERVICE PROVIDERS Proposal 1. This paper seeks the Committee’s authorisation to release a discussion document, Regular dataset collection from payment service providers: a government discussion document, for consultation with stakeholders. 2. This paper also seeks the Cabinet Economic Development Committee’s agreement to invite the Minister of Revenue to instruct the Parliamentary Counsel Office to draft an Order in Council for consultation. 3. Following Cabinet approval of the release of the discussion document and the drafting of the Order in Council, delegate the release of these documents to the Minister of Revenue. Relation to Government Priorities 4. This proposal is part of the information collection and use workstream on the Government’s current tax policy work programme. The efficient and effective collection and use of information helps to support voluntary compliance with tax obligations and ensures that compliance and administration costs are minimised. The proposal also supports wider Government priorities of minimising opportunities for avoidance and evasion. Executive Summary 5. Inland Revenue can collect datasets from third parties on an ad hoc basis under the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). The reason for this irregular collection is that the legislative provision they are collected under was not designed for repeat requests and so requires the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to issue a notice under the TAA’s legislative power each time the data is required. This is inefficient and resource intensive, resulting in irregular collection despite the valuable insights such data makes possible. 6. Datasets have previously been collected from a limited number of payment service providers operating in New Zealand. The datasets collected consist of aggregated data of merchants’ incoming financial transactions and are valuable for several purposes. Primarily the insights they make possible for ensuring compliance through education, marketing and targeted campaigns including investigation of high-risk cases. As an example, these datasets directly result in the early identification of ceased merchants who may need assistance in finalising their tax affairs or new merchants who may need support to understand their tax obligations and how best to comply. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-03-16 19:20:34 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 7. Electronic payment has grown exponentially in New Zealand and is now the main way that most businesses make sales. These electronic transactions are facilitated by payment service providers. The legislative provision for data collection is now out-dated in this context and does not allow for regular information collection from a third-party. Currently, a notice is required to be issued each time such data is required. 8. New legislation was enacted in early 2019 to address the need for the regular collection of large datasets. This new regulation power represents a streamlining, rather than increase, of existing dataset collection from third parties, improved transparency for taxpayers and, by applying to a ‘class of persons’ rather than named entities, equality amongst organisations in the same industry from whom data is collected. 9. In this Cabinet paper, I am seeking authorisation to progress the making of an Order in Council under this regulation making provision. The Order in Council will enable the collection of datasets from payment service providers on a regular and repeating basis. Improving voluntary compliance 10. Inland Revenue is committed to helping taxpayers get it right from the start. This approach supports compliant behaviour, drives out error and reduces the possibilities of non- compliant behaviour. The purpose is not just to reduce unintentional mistakes, but also to reduce evasion and to strengthen the overall willingness to comply. 11. The goal is first time accuracy and a reduction in subsequent adjustments. This enhances taxpayer certainty, fairness across the system and reduces the resources taxpayers and the Commissioner need to commit to the process. Data underpins this commitment and is increasingly at the heart of ambitions for a modernised tax system. Inland Revenue collects datasets from key third parties to improve information and intelligence capabilities under powers contained in the TAA. 12. Currently, the legislative authority enabling the gathering of this information is for one-off requests for information, not ongoing requests, requiring the process to be repeated every time information is required. This is a time and resource intensive process which has resulted in irregular collection, reducing effectiveness. 13. Existing powers were created in a world where the collecting and analysing of such datasets was difficult to achieve. The legislation was consequently not designed for repeat collection of data from a single entity or industry. Irregular collection makes it difficult to achieve outcomes such as accurately assessing compliance over several years and providing timely support. 14. New legislation, section 17L, was enacted in early 2019 to address this need for regular collection of large datasets. The change provides for the collection of datasets on a continuing and regular basis, enabled by Order in Council. This legislation enables the collection of data from a ‘class of persons’ rather than named entities. This means that data will be collected from all entities within a defined industry under one request, improving fairness, rather than a request being made to each entity individually. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-03-16 19:20:34 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Collecting data from payment service providers 15. Inland Revenue has been collecting large datasets on a semi-regular basis from a limited number of payment service providers operating in New Zealand since 2005. 1 Due to time and resource demands as well as the legislative limitations noted above, these requests have been made only to the major players within the market. 16. This new legislative power provides a more efficient and transparent process for Inland Revenue to collect the same type of information it already does, but regularly and from more providers. Information sharing between payment service providers and Inland Revenue will therefore be streamlined under this provision and the making of an Order in Council. 17. The datasets consist of aggregated data of merchants’ financial transactions and are used to support improved compliance and detect those operating in the hidden economy. The aggregated merchant data collected to date has been crucial to improving Inland Revenue’s insights, including knowing where and when to direct resources to make positive change for taxpayers, the department and the Government. 18. The information proposed to be collected relates to all merchants who engage a payment service provider and whose activity through the payment service provider is up to $30 million per year. 2 This information has and will be used for three main purposes: 18.1. to increase compliance through education, marketing and targeted campaigns, to enable customers to get their tax obligations right from the start, 18.2. to undertake risk analysis, including the detection of those operating in the hidden economy or intentionally not complying with tax obligations, and 18.3. to inform policy development through macro-analysis research, and aid in policy evaluation and application. 19. An Order in Council can be made for the regular collection of information for the purpose of administration or enforcement of the Inland Revenue Acts, or to fulfil a function lawfully conferred on the Commissioner. The proposal is for the Government to make an Order in 1 A payment service provider is defined as a third-party business who facilitates payment for goods and services between customers and merchants. 2 The $30m figure is in line with the requirements for International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Entities with a turnover above this amount are considered to have better checks and balances on income compared to smaller entities. Example – Timely, targeted support A new business has recently started trading and, due to a predicted annual turnover of $40,000, is not GST registered. After a successful start-up period, they receive $75,000 of income in their first six months. Inland Revenue can verify the business’ income through the information provided by the relevant payment service provider and take proactive steps to remind the business owner that they are now required to register for GST, providing education and support earlier and enabling them to fulfil their tax obligations. They are able to meet their tax obligations and embed best practices, rather than receiving an unexpected tax bill for the oversight. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-03-16 19:20:34 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Council authorising the collection of information, on a regular basis, from payment service providers on merchants’ aggregated transactions and account information. Privacy is a priority 20. The government takes the protection of personal information seriously. The proposed collection would include controls and processes to minimise any risk of a privacy or secrecy breach occurring. The data received will not relate to individual customer detail and individuals’ payment data will not be identifiable in what is collected. 21. The information collected from payment service providers will be the aggregate monthly income data of a merchant. This information will include transactions – showing debit, credit, cash out and refunds (both volume and value) - as well as related identity and contact information. Some account-specific information will be collected to enable accurate matching. These datasets include only aggregated merchant data and do not go to the level of individual transactions ensuring that it is not possible to identify customer’s payment data in what is collected. 22. Inland Revenue is targeting the information request at businesses. Most of the information collected relates to the merchant entity and those individuals who run those businesses. Only the minimal personal information necessary will be included in the data request. The personal information relates to merchants who are undertaking business in their own name, as well as individuals who are the contact point for the merchant. 23. Inland Revenue has been working closely with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner throughout the lifecycle of this project and will continue to do so through the creation of the Order in Council. Improving transparency for taxpayers and providers 24. Improving the tax system means comprehensively supporting its integrity for a better experience for all, not just more revenue collected. In line with this, a commitment to transparency is at the heart of this proposal. 25. Currently, the payment service providers from whom data is collected under the current provision are not publicly known, and there is limited public awareness that this data is being collected by Inland Revenue. Under this proposal, the information collected is authorised by a regulation and details on what types of data it collects and from whom will be public. 26. This increased transparency also means the legal provision for what information can be shared with Inland Revenue, and the legal mechanism authorising this sharing, is understood and visible. Section 17L provides greater certainty of authority for disclosure of information so there is no risk to reputation through the perception of information sharing practices only understood behind closed doors. 27. The purpose of publishing these details on the Inland Revenue website is to improve transparency for individuals. This also ensures that there is no commercial disadvantage through customer perception of payment service providers who provide information to Inland Revenue vs those that do not. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-03-16 19:20:34 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Releasing a discussion document 28. The attached draft discussion document provides a detailed and informative overview of the specific collection of datasets that is proposed to be authorised by the regulation made under this power. Responses are invited to specific questions as part of the document which are designed to ensure that the Order in Council is comprehensive, fit for purpose and future proof. 29. Releasing the document is intended to support informed discussion amongst key stakeholders and therefore covers context and issues critical to the design of the Order in Council, as prescribed in section 17L. These issues include ensuring that the definition of ‘payment service providers’ used will effectively capture all entities within the industry and seeks information from stakeholders that will inform the frequency and format of information requested. A chapter is devoted to outlining the safeguards around information handling and disposal. 30. I am now seeking Cabinet approval to progress this work by authorising the release of the attached discussion document, Collecting data from payment service providers: a government discussion document, for consultation with stakeholders. These stakeholders include payment service providers, relevant industry bodies and the general public. I am also seeking authority to instruct Parliamentary Counsel Office to draft an Order in Council to give effect to the regular collection of datasets, which will be sent to stakeholders alongside the discussion document for consultation. 31. A summary of how I am proposing that each of the elements that the Order in Council is required to prescribe under section 17L are addressed, is attached as Appendix A. A full list of the persons to whom the discussion document and draft regulation are proposed to be provided is available in Appendix B. 32. Consultation for a minimum of six weeks on the draft Order in Council is required by law. Once this has been completed, any necessary changes will be made to the draft Order in Council, and I will report back to Cabinet with the outcome of consultation and seek approval for the making of the Order in Council. Financial Implications 33. Approving the release of the attached Government discussion document is not expected to have any fiscal implications. Any fiscal implications resulting from the proposals will be included in final policy advice to Ministers and Cabinet following consultation. Legislative Implications 34. I am required by legislation to undertake a consultation process, for which I am seeking approval in this paper. 35. The release of the discussion document will not give rise to any immediate legislative implications. However, an Order in Council will be necessary to give effect to the regular collection of payment service provider data. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-03-16 19:20:34 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Impact Analysis Regulatory Impact Assessment 36. The Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) panel at Inland Revenue has reviewed and confirmed that the discussion document substitutes for a RIA and so a RIA is not required to be prepared at this point. The discussion document is likely to lead to effective consultation and support the delivery of a quality RIA. 37. Should Ministers recommend progressing the regular collection of datasets from payment service providers following public consultation, a RIA will form part of the submission to Cabinet, seeking final agreement on the dataset collection Order in Council. It is anticipated that this will be in late 2021. Climate Implications of Policy Assessment 38. The Ministry for the Environment has been consulted and confirms that the Climate Implications of Policy Assessment (CIPA) requirements do not apply to this proposal, as the threshold for significance is not met. Population Implications 39. This proposal has no population implications. Human Rights 40. I consider that the proposals contained in the discussion document are consistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993. Consultation 41. Initial consultation was undertaken with identified payment service providers in formulating the discussion document. 42. The making of an Order in Council requires certain consultation to be undertaken. Consequently, formal consultation will be undertaken with the Privacy Commissioner, interested stakeholders and other organisations who represent the interests of the public affected by the regulation in the discussion document and draft Order in Council. 43. The Treasury, the Parliamentary Counsel Office, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment were consulted in preparing this paper. Communications 44. The discussion document and draft Order in Council will be released as part of a focused consultation with identified stakeholders and interested parties. The consultation will contain a summary of the proposals and will seek views on questions raised in the discussion document. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-03-16 19:20:34 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Proactive Release 45. The discussion document will be finalised and released in full for consultation alongside the draft Order in Council once the latter is complete. 46. I propose to delay the proactive release of this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers until the launch of consultation, subject to redactions under the Official Information Act 1982. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Cabinet Economic Development Committee: 1. Note the contents of the attached draft Government discussion document Regular dataset collection from payment service providers: a government discussion document; 2. Authorise the drafting of an Order in Council for the regular collection of information from payment service providers, which will be consulted on with interested parties; 3. Invite the Minister of Revenue to instruct the Parliamentary Counsel Office to prepare the draft Order in Council; 4. Authorise the Minister of Revenue to approve editorial, presentational and other minor changes to the discussion document before its release; 5. Agree to the Minister of Revenue releasing the attached Government discussion document and draft Order in Council once drafted for consultation; 6. Invite the Minister of Revenue to report back to the Cabinet Economic Development Committee on the outcome of consultation and final recommendations in late-2021. Authorised for lodgement Hon David Parker Minister of Revenue 2r4hxlcklw 2021-03-16 19:20:34 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] APPENDIX A: THE PROPOSED CONTENT OF THE REGULATIONS 1. Under section 17L (2), The Governor-General may, by Order in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue, make regulations– (a) authorising the Commissioner to collect on a continuing and regular basis, information in the form of datasets from a person, or a class of persons: (b) prescribing– (i) the type of information that may be collected: (ii) the person or the class of persons to whom the regulations apply: (iii) the frequency of reporting by the person or class of persons: (iv) the form of the information: (v) the specifications for the reporting method that must be used: (c) setting out the way in which the information is necessary for the purposes set out in subsection (1): (d) specifying a person or class of persons who may be given an exemption from some or all of a requirement under paragraph (a), (b), or (c): (e) prescribing how provisions of this Act or another Inland Revenue Act must be applied or modified for the purpose set out in section 17B. I am proposing that each of these elements are addressed in the manner outlined below. The type of information that may be collected 2. As a minimum, Inland Revenue would require the below information from each payment service provider: a. Merchant unique identifier b. Identity and contact information c. Legal name, Trade name, Merchant name d. Contact person and details, including locations e. IRD number or NZBN (if held) f. Merchant bank account g. Aggregated monthly data on payments h. Debit, credit, cash out, refunds – both volume and value i. Details relating to aggregated overseas transactions. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-03-16 19:20:34 9 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 3. The payment service providers will vary in size, market capture and technological architecture. Thus, the level of information they hold will vary. Consequently, Inland Revenue would be seeking the above information, supplemented by relevant additional fields individual payment service providers may hold. To whom the regulations apply 4. The regulations will apply to payment service providers. A payment service provider is defined as a third-party business who facilitates the payment of goods and services between customers and merchants. The frequency of reporting 5. The data is to be provided on a quarterly basis. The form of the information 6. The information is to be provided in a structured formatted electronic file sent by a secure transmission mechanism. The specifications for the reporting method 7. The reporting method will be dependent on the technological capability of the payment intermediary but may include web services, API and email. Manual records or the sending of digital media such as CD or USB key will not be accepted. As technologies change so too may the reporting methods in the future. How is the information necessary or relevant for a purpose relating to the administration or enforcement of a matter arising from or connected with a function lawfully conferred on the Commissioner 8. The Commissioner has a duty to protect the integrity of the tax system and to collect over time the highest net revenue. In order to undertake these duties, the Commissioner must ensure that all taxpayers are meeting their tax obligations. The information is necessary and relevant to allow the Commissioner to ensure that this is happening. Setting out a person or class of persons that may be given an exemption from some or all of a requirement 9. A payment service provider will be exempt where they contract another payment service provider to undertake the processing of the payments on the proviso that the required information is held by the contracted intermediary. Prescribing how this Act or another Inland Revenue Act must be applied or modified for the purpose set out in section 17B. 10. There are no provisions that must be applied or modified. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-03-16 19:20:34 10 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] APPENDIX B: PROPOSED PERSONS TO BE FORMALLY CONSULTED WITH 11.

I n Confidence IR2021/020: Collecting regular datasets from payment service providers Page 1 of 5 28 January 2021 M inister of Revenue Collecting regular datasets from payment service providers Purpose 1.This paper seeks your agreement to refer the attached Cabinet Economic Development Committee paper and draft consultation document to the Cabinet Office by 10:00 a.m., 4 March 2021 for the Cabinet Economic Developmen t C ommittee (DEV) to consider at its meeting on 10 March 2021. 2.The draft paper is seeking Cabinet’s agreement to draft an Order in Council and delegate authority to you to then release the Order in Council, once drafted, with the attached discussion document for consultation with stakeholders. Context and background 3.The Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) allows for the bulk collection of data fro m p ersons holding that data, where necessary or relevant for a function lawfully conferred on the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. The Commissioner has a duty to protect the integrity of the tax system and to collect the highest net revenue over time with certain data critical to the undertaking of these duties. 4.Datasets from third parties are currently collected under this power on an ad hoc basis. The reason for this is that the legislative provision they are collected under was not designed for repeat requests and so requires the Commissioner to issue a notice under the TAA legislative power each time the data is required. 5.Inland Revenue has been collecting datasets on a semi-regular basis from two major payment service providers operating in New Zealand since 2005. 1 The datasets collected consist of aggregated data of merchants’ incoming financial transactions and are valuable for several purposes. 2 Primary among these is the insights they make possible for ensuring compliance through education, marketing and targeted campaigns as well as the identification of potential non-compliance. Macro-analysi s of this information is also used in research and to inform policy. 6.New legislation was enacted in early 2019 to address the need for the regular collection of large datasets. 3 The change provides for recurring collection of datasets on a continuing and regular basis, enabled by Order in Council. Officials are now seeking to use this new power for the first time and collect data sets from payment service providers on a regular and repeating basis. 7.This new mechanism for dataset collecting will provide a more efficient an d tr ansparent process for collecting the same type of information Inland Revenue do es currently, but more regularly, and from more payment service providers. 1 A payment service provider is defined as a third-party business who facilitates payment for goods and services between customers and merchants. Examples include Windcave and Verifone, etc. Some recognised names, such as Apple Pay and AliPay, are excluded from this definition as these are considered products supported by the various banks rather than payment service providers in their own right. 2 A merchant is defined as a person or entity that is engaged in a business activity. T his aggregated data will consist of data from merchants who use payment service providers. 3 Section 17L of the Tax Administration Act enables Regulations providing for the regular collection of bulk datasets I n Confidence IR2021/020: Collecting regular datasets from payment service providers Page 2 of 5 8.In June 2020, officials provided the previous Minister of Revenue with the necessary Cabinet paper and accompanying discussion document to be submitted to Cabine t s eeking authorisation for consultation. These were approved by the previous Minister of Revenue ahead of the election however there was not enough time for them to progress through Cabinet before Parliament dissolved. Officials are now seeking to resume this process. 9.In this report, officials seek your approval for the attached discussion document and Cabinet paper. The Cabinet paper is seeking that Cabinet: •agree the content of the attached discussion document, •authorise you to instruct the Parliamentary Counsel Office to draft an Orde r in Council for consultation, and •delegate authorising the release of the discussion document and draft Orde r i n Council to you. Improving voluntary compliance 10.Inland Revenue has previously collected datasets from payment service providers on an ad hoc basis. This process is very time and resource-consuming and has resulted in data being collected irregularly. Irregular collection makes it difficult to achieve outcomes such as accurately assessing compliance over several years and providing timely support. 1 1.The data collected to date has been crucial to improving Inland Revenue’s ability to know where and when to direct resources to realise value for taxpayers, Inland Revenue and the Government. This information has been used and will continue to be used for three main purposes: •to increase compliance through education, marketing and targeted campaigns to enable taxpayers to fulfil their tax obligations right from the start, •to undertake risk analysis, including the detection of those operating in the hidden economy, and •to inform policy development through macro-analysis research and aid in policy evaluation and application. 12.Irregular dataset collection makes it difficult for us to achieve outcomes such as gaining insights into behaviour over several years and providing timely support o r e nforcement action. Information sharing between payment service providers and Inland Revenue will be streamlined under the proposal. This will improve efficiency and so help promote compliance and maintenance of the integrity of the tax system. Example of this data helping taxpayers get it right from the start A new business has recently started trading and, due to a predicted annual turnover of $40,000, is not GST registered. After a successful start-up period, they receive $75,000 of income in their first six months. I nland Revenue can verify the business’ income through the information provided by the relevant payment service provider and take proactive steps to remind the business owner that they are now required to register for GST, providing education and support earlier and enabling them to fulfil their tax obligations. They are able to meet their tax obligations and embed best practices, rather than receiving an unexpected tax bill for the oversight. I n Confidence IR2021/020: Collecting regular datasets from payment service providers Page 3 of 5 13.The payment service provider market continues to change and is no longer dominated by a small number of major players. Under this new legislation, the Order in Council would apply to a class of persons rather than specific, named entities. The outcome of this is that the repeat request for datasets made under this provision would apply to all payment service providers operating in New Zealand, leaving no party at a commercial disadvantage. Increasing the number of payment service providers Inland Revenue receives information from also mitigates the impact of these market changes on potential insights. 14.Although the first use for this provision is proposed to be for payment service providers, it will be used for more industries in the future to realise further insights. It is therefore important that an effective process is established as part of this initia l u se so that Inland revenue can more efficiently utilise this provision in the future. Privacy is a priority 15.The aggregated merchant payment data received from payment service providers will show debit, credit, cash out and refunds, both volume and value, per merchant ID for the previous three-month period. This will be accompanied by generic merchant information as outlined in the discussion document (e.g. merchant unique identifier, trade name, contact information, etc). The data received will not relate to individual customer detail and individuals’ payment data will not be identifiable in what is collected. 16.Inland Revenue has been working closely with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner throughout the lifecycle of this project and will continue to do so through the creation of the Order in Council. Consulting on the draft Order in Council 17.An Order in Council can be made for the regular collection of information for the purpose of administration or enforcement of the Inland Revenue Acts, or to fulfil a function lawfully conferred on the Commissioner. The Order in Council is require d t o prescribe: •the type of information that may be collected; •to whom the regulations apply; •the frequency of reporting; •the form of the information; and •the specifications for the reporting method. 18.The making of an Order in Council requires certain consultation to be undertaken. Consequently, the Cabinet paper seeks to commence consulting on the proposal and draft Order in Council in order to meet these requirements. 19.The draft discussion document will be finalised, and the draft Order in Council attached once drafted. These will then both be released for consultation with the Privacy Commissioner, interested stakeholders, and other organisations who represent the interests of the public affected by the regulation, to further develop the proposal and determine the above requirements. 20.The attached Cabinet paper will seek Cabinet’s approval for you to invite the Parliamentary Counsel Office to commence drafting an Order in Council to give effect to this proposal and allow us to consult on it. Officials have indicated to the Parliamentary Counsel Office that a report is being provided to you on this matter. I n Confidence IR2021/020: Collecting regular datasets from payment service providers Page 4 of 5 Consultation 21.Initial consultation was undertaken with identified payment service providers in formulating the discussion document. This means that all major players in this market are aware of our intention to consult on and enact an Order in Council under section 17L of the Tax Administration Act. 22.The Treasury, the Parliamentary Counsel Office, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment were consulted in preparing these papers, including the discussion document. 23.Key stakeholders, including the Privacy Commissioner, will be formally consulted on the discussion document and draft Order in Council. Proactive release of documents 24.Cabinet papers are required to be proactively released within 30 business days of final decisions being taken by Cabinet, unless there is a good reason not to. The attached Cabinet paper contains a proposal to delay its proactive release, alongside the associated minutes and key advice papers, until the launch of consultation. Next steps 25.If you agree for us to consult, a Cabinet Economic Development Committee paper is attached for your consideration and referral to the Cabinet Office. 26.Following consultation, officials will report back to you and Cabinet on the outcome of submissions and seek final policy approval. Officials anticipate this will be in mid- 2021. 27.The proposed timeline for this is: Cabinet authorises the discussion document for consultation and authorises you to instruct Parliamentary council to draft an Order in Council for inclusion as part of consultation. March 2021 Parliamentary Counsel Office drafts Order in Council March to May 2021 Officials report to you seeking your approval to release the discussion document and draft Order in Council May 2021 Discussion document and draft Order in Council released for consultation May to July 2021 (minimum of 6 weeks in line with section 17L requirements).

Relation to Government Priorities 4.This proposal is part of the information collection and use workstream on the Government’s current tax policy work programme. The efficient and effective collection and use of information helps to support voluntary compliance with tax obligations and ensures that compliance and administration costs are minimised. The proposal also supports wider Government priorities of minimising opportunities for avoidance and evasion. Executive Summary 5.Inland Revenue can collect datasets from third parties on an ad hoc basis under the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). The reason for this irregular collection is that the legislative provision they are collected under was not designed for repeat requests and so requires the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to issue a notice under the TAA’s legislative power each time the data is required. This is inefficient and resource intensive, resulting in irregular collection despite the valuable insights such data makes possible. 6.Datasets have previously been collected from a limited number of payment service providers operating in New Zealand. The datasets collected consist of aggregated data of merchants’ incoming financial transactions and are valuable for several purposes. Primarily the insights they make possible for ensuring compliance through education, marketing and targeted campaigns including investigation of high-risk cases. As an example, these datasets directly result in the early identification of ceased merchants who may need assistance in finalising their tax affairs or new merchants who may need support to understand their tax obligations and how best to comply. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-03-16 19:20:34 . 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 7.Electronic payment has grown exponentially in New Zealand and is now the main way that most businesses make sales. These electronic transactions are facilitated by payment service providers. The legislative provision for data collection is now out-dated in this context and does not allow for regular information collection from a third-party. Currently, a notice is required to be issued each time such data is required. 8.New legislation was enacted in early 2019 to address the need for the regular collection of large datasets. This new regulation power represents a streamlining, rather than increase, of existing dataset collection from third parties, improved transparency for taxpayers and, by applying to a ‘class of persons’ rather than named entities, equality amongst organisations in the same industry from whom data is collected. 9.In this Cabinet paper, I am seeking authorisation to progress the making of an Order in Council under this regulation making provision. The Order in Council will enable the collection of datasets from payment service providers on a regular and repeating basis. Improving voluntary compliance 10. Inland Revenue is committed to helping taxpayers get it right from the start. This approach supports compliant behaviour, drives out error and reduces the possibilities of non- compliant behaviour. The purpose is not just to reduce unintentional mistakes, but also to reduce evasion and to strengthen the overall willingness to comply. 11. The goal is first time accuracy and a reduction in subsequent adjustments. This enhances taxpayer certainty, fairness across the system and reduces the resources taxpayers and the Commissioner need to commit to the process. Data underpins this commitment and is increasingly at the heart of ambitions for a modernised tax system. Inland Revenue collects datasets from key third parties to improve information and intelligence capabilities under powers contained in the TAA. 12. C urrently, the legislative authority enabling the gathering of this information is for one-off requests for information, not ongoing requests, requiring the process to be repeated every time information is required. This is a time and resource intensive process which has resulted in irregular collection, reducing effectiveness. 13. Existing powers were created in a world where the collecting and analysing of such datasets was difficult to achieve. The legislation was consequently not designed for repeat collection of data from a single entity or industry. Irregular collection makes it difficult to achieve outcomes such as accurately assessing compliance over several years and providing timely support. 14. N ew legislation, section 17L, was enacted in early 2019 to address this need for regular collection of large datasets. The change provides for the collection of datasets on a continuing and regular basis, enabled by Order in Council. This legislation enables the collection of data from a ‘class of persons’ rather than named entities. This means that data will be collected from all entities within a defined industry under one request, improving fairness, rather than a request being made to each entity individually. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-03-16 19:20:34 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Collecting data from payment service providers 15. Inland Revenue has been collecting large datasets on a semi-regular basis from a limited number of payment service providers operating in New Zealand since 2005. 1 Due to time and resource demands as well as the legislative limitations noted above, these requests have been made only to the major players within the market. 16. This new legislative power provides a more efficient and transparent process for Inland Revenue to collect the same type of information it already does, but regularly and from more providers. Information sharing between payment service providers and Inland Revenue will therefore be streamlined under this provision and the making of an Order in Council. 17. The datasets consist of aggregated data of merchants’ financial transactions and are used to support improved compliance and detect those operating in the hidden economy. The aggregated merchant data collected to date has been crucial to improving Inland Revenue’s insights, including knowing where and when to direct resources to make positive change for taxpayers, the department and the Government. 18. The information proposed to be collected relates to all merchants who engage a payment service provider and whose activity through the payment service provider is up to $30 million per year. 2 This information has and will be used for three main purposes: 18.1. to increase compliance through education, marketing and targeted campaigns, to enable customers to get their tax obligations right from the start, 18.2. to undertake risk analysis, including the detection of those operating in the hidden economy or intentionally not complying with tax obligations, and 18.3. to inform policy development through macro-analysis research, and aid in policy evaluation and application. 19. An Order in Council can be made for the regular collection of information for the purpose of administration or enforcement of the Inland Revenue Acts, or to fulfil a function lawfully conferred on the Commissioner. The proposal is for the Government to make an Order in 1 A payment service provider is defined as a third-party business who facilitates payment for goods and services between customers and merchants. 2 The $30m figure is in line with the requirements for International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Entities with a turnover above this amount are considered to have better checks and balances on income compared to smaller entities. Example – Timely, targeted support A new business has recently started trading and, due to a predicted annual turnover of $40,000, is not GST registered. After a successful start-up period, they receive $75,000 of income in their first six months. Inland Revenue can verify the business’ income through the information provided by the relevant payment service provider and take proactive steps to remind the business owner that they are now required to register for GST, providing education and support earlier and enabling them to fulfil their tax obligations. They are able to meet their tax obligations and embed best practices, rather than receiving an unexpected tax bill for the oversight. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-03-16 19:20:34 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Council authorising the collection of information, on a regular basis, from payment service providers on merchants’ aggregated transactions and account information. Privacy is a priority 20. The government takes the protection of personal information seriously. The proposed collection would include controls and processes to minimise any risk of a privacy or secrecy breach occurring. The data received will not relate to individual customer detail and individuals’ payment data will not be identifiable in what is collected. 21. The information collected from payment service providers will be the aggregate monthly income data of a merchant. This information will include transactions – showing debit, credit, cash out and refunds (both volume and value) - as well as related identity and contact information. Some account-specific information will be collected to enable accurate matching. These datasets include only aggregated merchant data and do not go to the level of individual transactions ensuring that it is not possible to identify customer’s payment data in what is collected. 22. Inland Revenue is targeting the information request at businesses. Most of the information collected relates to the merchant entity and those individuals who run those businesses. Only the minimal personal information necessary will be included in the data request. The personal information relates to merchants who are undertaking business in their own name, as well as individuals who are the contact point for the merchant. 23. Inland Revenue has been working closely with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner throughout the lifecycle of this project and will continue to do so through the creation of the Order in Council. Improving transparency for taxpayers and providers 24. Improving the tax system means comprehensively supporting its integrity for a better experience for all, not just more revenue collected. In line with this, a commitment to transparency is at the heart of this proposal. 25. Currently, the payment service providers from whom data is collected under the current provision are not publicly known, and there is limited public awareness that this data is being collected by Inland Revenue. Under this proposal, the information collected is authorised by a regulation and details on what types of data it collects and from whom will be public. 26. This increased transparency also means the legal provision for what information can be shared with Inland Revenue, and the legal mechanism authorising this sharing, is understood and visible. Section 17L provides greater certainty of authority for disclosure of information so there is no risk to reputation through the perception of information sharing practices only understood behind closed doors. 27. The purpose of publishing these details on the Inland Revenue website is to improve transparency for individuals. This also ensures that there is no commercial disadvantage through customer perception of payment service providers who provide information to Inland Revenue vs those that do not. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-03-16 19:20:34 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Releasing a discussion document 28. The attached draft discussion document provides a detailed and informative overview of the specific collection of datasets that is proposed to be authorised by the regulation made under this power. Responses are invited to specific questions as part of the document which are designed to ensure that the Order in Council is comprehensive, fit for purpose and future proof. 29. Releasing the document is intended to support informed discussion amongst key stakeholders and therefore covers context and issues critical to the design of the Order in Council, as prescribed in section 17L. These issues include ensuring that the definition of ‘payment service providers’ used will effectively capture all entities within the industry and seeks information from stakeholders that will inform the frequency and format of information requested. A chapter is devoted to outlining the safeguards around information handling and disposal. 30. I am now seeking Cabinet approval to progress this work by authorising the release of the attached discussion document, Collecting data from payment service providers: a government discussion document, for consultation with stakeholders. These stakeholders include payment service providers, relevant industry bodies and the general public. I am also seeking authority to instruct Parliamentary Counsel Office to draft an Order in Council to give effect to the regular collection of datasets, which will be sent to stakeholders alongside the discussion document for consultation. 31. A summary of how I am proposing that each of the elements that the Order in Council is required to prescribe under section 17L are addressed, is attached as Appendix A. A full list of the persons to whom the discussion document and draft regulation are proposed to be provided is available in Appendix B. 32. Consultation for a minimum of six weeks on the draft Order in Council is required by law. Once this has been completed, any necessary changes will be made to the draft Order in Council, and I will report back to Cabinet with the outcome of consultation and seek approval for the making of the Order in Council. Financial Implications 33. Approving the release of the attached Government discussion document is not expected to have any fiscal implications. Any fiscal implications resulting from the proposals will be included in final policy advice to Ministers and Cabinet following consultation. Legislative Implications 34. I am required by legislation to undertake a consultation process, for which I am seeking approval in this paper. 35. The release of the discussion document will not give rise to any immediate legislative implications. However, an Order in Council will be necessary to give effect to the regular collection of payment service provider data. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-03-16 19:20:34 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Impact Analysis Regulatory Impact Assessment 36. T he Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) panel at Inland Revenue has reviewed and confirmed that the discussion document substitutes for a RIA and so a RIA is not required to be prepared at this point. The discussion document is likely to lead to effective consultation and support the delivery of a quality RIA. 37. Should Ministers recommend progressing the regular collection of datasets from payment service providers following public consultation, a RIA will form part of the submission to Cabinet, seeking final agreement on the dataset collection Order in Council. It is anticipated that this will be in late 2021. Climate Implications of Policy Assessment 38. The Ministry for the Environment has been consulted and confirms that the Climate Implications of Policy Assessment (CIPA) requirements do not apply to this proposal, as the threshold for significance is not met. Population Implications 39. This proposal has no population implications. Human Rights 40. I consider that the proposals contained in the discussion document are consistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993. Consultation 41. Initial consultation was undertaken with identified payment service providers in formulating the discussion document. 42. The making of an Order in Council requires certain consultation to be undertaken. Consequently, formal consultation will be undertaken with the Privacy Commissioner, interested stakeholders and other organisations who represent the interests of the public affected by the regulation in the discussion document and draft Order in Council. 43. The Treasury, the Parliamentary Counsel Office, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment were consulted in preparing this paper. Communications 44. The discussion document and draft Order in Council will be released as part of a focused consultation with identified stakeholders and interested parties. The consultation will contain a summary of the proposals and will seek views on questions raised in the discussion document. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-03-16 19:20:34 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Proactive Release 45. The discussion document will be finalised and released in full for consultation alongside the draft Order in Council once the latter is complete. 46. I propose to delay the proactive release of this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers until the launch of consultation, subject to redactions under the Official Information Act 1982.

\[IN CONFIDENCE\] 1. POLICY AND REGULATORY STEWARDSHIP Tax policy report: Extending tax relief for donations of trading stock made by businesses in response to the COVID-19 outbreak Date: 9 December 2021 Priority: Medium Security level: In Confidence Report number: IR2021/624 Action sought Action sought Deadline Minister of Finance Agree to recommendations 17 December 2021 Minister of Revenue Agree to recommendations 17 December 2021 Contact for telephone discussion (if required) Name Position Telephone Peter Frawley Policy Lead s 9(2)(a) Brandon Sloan Principal Policy Advisor s 9(2)(a) \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 9 December 2021 Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue Extending tax relief for donations of trading stock made by businesses in response to the COVID-19 outbreak Purpose 1. This report seeks your agreement to extend a COVID-19 relief measure concerning the income tax treatment of donated trading stock. Officials recommend that this relief, due to expire on 16 March 2022 1 is extended for a further 12 months until 31 March 2023. Background 2. In 2020 stakeholders from both the charitable and commercial sectors informed Inland Revenue officials and your office about their concerns that the Income Tax Act 2007 disincentivises businesses from donating goods by imposing tax on the market value of the donated trading stock. This is a long-standing issue within the tax system. 3. A donation of trading stock is deemed to be a disposal. A deemed income rule in the Income Tax Act effectively reverses the deduction that was claimed when the trading stock was purchased and imposes tax on a deemed profit. You agreed to turn this rule off, as a temporary COVID-19 relief measure, for a two-year period starting 17 March 2020 (IR2021/051 refers). As a result, where a business donates trading stock to a donee organisation or public authority they are not subject to tax on deemed income and are eligible for a deduction. The purpose of the temporary measure was to provide immediate tax relief to businesses, while officials continued work on whether a more enduring solution should be inserted into the Income Tax Act. 4. This deemed income rule was introduced principally as an integrity measure. However, it arguably overreaches by imposing tax in situations where tax avoidance is not a concern. The overreach of this rule is not limited to COVID-19 but has been exacerbated by it, for example by increased donations to food banks or of masks and consumable medical equipment (such as personal protective equipment). 5. Prior to introducing this exemption, it was believed there was widespread non- compliance with the deemed income rule. Therefore, tax relief for donated trading stock has likely aligned the law with common business practice, rather than changed behaviour. Inland Revenue has limited data on trading stock donations. 6. There is public interest in this issue, with a submitter raising it with the Finance and Expenditure Committee during their hearing on the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2021-22, GST, and Remedial Matters) Bill. Proposals 7. The temporary relief provided that where a business donates trading stock to: 1 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020-21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2021, s 84. IR2021/624: Extending tax relief for donations of trading stock made by businesses in response to the COVID- 19 outbreak Page 1 of 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 7.1 public authorities and donee organisations (an organisation whose donors can claim a tax concession for donations made to the organisation) they are not subject to the deemed income rule and are eligible for a tax deduction. 7.2 non-associated persons (which are not public authorities or donee organisations) they are not subject to the deemed income rule. However, the donor will only be able to claim a tax deduction where they can demonstrate the donation is made for business purposes. 8. The legislation allows for the COVID-19 response measure to be extended by Order in Council if you are satisfied that people in New Zealand are likely to continue, beyond the expiry of the existing period, to be significantly adversely affected by COVID-19. Officials are working on assessing the case for a more enduring solution, but the issues are complex, paragraph 13 refers. The question of allowing deductions for donated trading stock touches on a wider tax issue of recognising expenses that do not have a clear relationship with earning taxable income. Rationale for extending the relief and consultation 9. The economic and social impacts of COVID-19 continue to be felt throughout New Zealand, for example, through increased demands on community foodbanks. Officials therefore consulted a select group of stakeholders 2 in November 2021 on the possibility of extending the relief measures. All responses we received were in favour of a one-year extension to provide certainty for businesses and donee organisations. Stakeholders were confident that the impacts of COVID-19 will continue beyond March 2022. 10. Stakeholders considered that taxpayers and businesses who have donated trading stock have been motivated by the need of the community rather than incentivised by specific tax rules. However, they did emphasise the need to address the potential that the tax law settings could discourage donations at this time of greater need if the relief from the deemed income rule is not extended. 11. When consulting with stakeholders on a possible extension we also asked for examples of how the temporary relief measure has made a difference to taxpayers. Federated Farmers provided the example of Meat the Need, a nationally based charity established in April 2020 to supply meat to city missions and foodbanks. Meat the Need has advised Federated Farmers that when farmers donate livestock, they often comment that the tax implication of their donation is part of their reason for donating. An enduring solution 12. Stakeholders also voiced a strong preference for an enduring solution to the deemed income rule to ensure it does not disincentivise donations. 13. Officials note, however, that a permanent solution: 13.1 would be a departure from providing tax benefits for monetary donations only, 13.2 raises broader tax integrity concerns about providing tax benefits for non- cash donations where valuation of the gift can be problematic, and 2 Corporate Taxpayers’ Group, Chartered Accountants Australia New Zealand, Federated Farmers, Fonterra, EY, PwC, The New Zealand Law Society, and Auckland City Mission. This is the same group of stakeholders consulted on the introduction of the relief measures (IR2021/051 refers). IR2021/624: Extending tax relief for donations of trading stock made by businesses in response to the COVID- 19 outbreak Page 2 of 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 13.3 the integrity of the trading stock rules also needs to be considered alongside the original anti-avoidance purpose of the deemed income rule. 14. However, the current legislation does allow for the deemed income rule to be turned off by Order in Council whenever you are satisfied that a Civil Defence Emergency event has occurred and people in New Zealand are being significantly adversely affected as a consequence of the event. 15. Officials can progress work on an enduring solution in 2022 subject to other Government priorities on the Government’s tax policy work programme. Consultation 16. The Treasury has been consulted in the preparation of this report. Financial implications 17. The estimated fiscal cost of the tax relief provided by the 2021 change earlier this year was $10 million, which was spread across the 2020/21 to 2022/23 fiscal years (the change applied only to one tax year, but the impact is spread across multiple fiscal years because taxpayers file at different times). An extension has an estimated fiscal cost of $5 million, spread across the 2022/23 and 2023/24 fiscal years. 18. Notwithstanding the recent review of the Tax Policy Scorecard (IR2021/551 refers), officials are satisfied this change meets the criteria for the Scorecard funding. This is because, although motivated in part by providing relief from COVID-19, it is an extension of an existing policy responding to a long-standing issue within the tax system. Administrative implications 19. There are no significant administrative implications to extending this relief from the deemed income rule. Next steps and process 20. If you agree to the recommendations in this report: 20.1 officials will prepare a paper to the Cabinet Legislation Committee seeking its approval to an Order in Council that would extend the relief from the deemed income rule to 31 March 2023. 20.2 officials will instruct the Parliamentary Counsel Office to draft an Order in Council. 21. Legislative and policy approval will need to be sought from Cabinet at the same time to ensure that an extension can come into force prior to 16 March 2022. We will report again on 27 January 2022.

3\. \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Economic Development Committee EXTENSION OF END DATE FOR TAX RELIEF FOR DONATIONS OF TRADING STOCK MADE BY BUSINESSES IN RESPONSE TO COVID-19 Proposal 1. This paper seeks the Cabinet Economic Development Committee’s agreement to an Order in Council extending the end date of a tax relief measure for donations of trading stock. The extension is part of the Government’s wider COVID-19 relief strategy. Policy 2. The proposed Order extends a tax relief measure for trading stock donated by businesses in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, with the new end date being 31 March 2023. 3. As a relief measure, the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020-21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2021 provided time limited relief so that the Income Tax Act did not disincentivise businesses from donating trading stock to mitigate the economic and social impacts of COVID-19. 4. A donation of trading stock is deemed to be a disposal. A deemed income rule in the Income Tax Act effectively reverses the deduction that was claimed when the trading stock was purchased and imposes tax on a deemed profit. 5. Cabinet agreed to turn this rule off, as a temporary COVID-19 relief measure, for a two-year period starting 17 March 2020 (CAB-21-MIN-0013 refers). As a result, 5.1 when a business donates trading stock to a donee organisation or public authority, taxable income does not arise; and 5.2 when a business donates trading stock to a non-associated person (which are not public authorities or donee organisations) taxable income is deemed not to arise if the donation is made for a business purpose. 6. The current end date for this temporary relief measure is 17 March 2022. 7. The economic and social impacts of COVID-19 continue to be felt throughout New Zealand, for example, through increased demands on community foodbanks. Officials therefore consulted a group of stakeholders in November 2021 on the possibility of extending the relief measures. All responses were in favour of a one- year extension to provide certainty for businesses and donee organisations. 1 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 10:58:45 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Stakeholders were confident that the impacts of COVID-19 would continue beyond March 2022. Proposed Order in Council 8. The proposed Order, to be made under s 225ABA of the Tax Administration Act 1994, will extend the period of relief for certain disposals of trading stock. It will come into force on 16 March 2022 and extend the relief period so it ends on 31 March 2023. 9. I recommend this Order be made on the basis that the legal requirements of s 225ABA(4) of the Tax Administration Act have been met. In particular, I am satisfied that people in New Zealand are likely to continue, beyond the expiry of the existing period, to be significantly adversely affected by COVID-19. T he comments from stakeholders echoed that the economic and social impacts of COVID-19 continue to be felt throughout New Zealand, for example, through increased demands on community foodbanks. Timing and 28-Day Rule 10. The proposed Order will come into force on 16 March 2022. 11. A waiver of the 28-day rule is sought to allow the Order to come into force by 16 March 2023 on the grounds that the Order needs to be in force before the current temporary relief measure period expires. This is necessary to ensure that businesses donating trading stock to donee organisations and public authorities in response to COVID-19 are not disincentivised from donating trading stock. The change is taxpayer favourable. Financial Implications 12. The estimated financial implications of extending the temporary relied period from the deemed income rule is shown in the table below. Over the forecast period 2021 - 22 to 2025-26 the estimated fiscal cost is $5 million. This cost will be charged against the Tax Policy Scorecard. $m – increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue M i ni s ter of Revenue 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 & outyears Tax Revenue -(2.000) (3.000) -- Total Operating -2.000 3.000 -- Compliance 13. The order complies with: 13.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 2 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 10:58:45 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 13.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993; 13.3 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993 (if the regulations raise privacy issues, indicate whether the Privacy Commissioner agrees that they comply with all relevant principles); 13.4 relevant international standards and obligations; 13.5 the Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. Regulations Review Committee 14. Officials consider there are no grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Order to the attention of the House of Representatives under Standing Order 327. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 15. The regulations have been certified by the Parliamentary Counsel Office as being in order for submission to Cabinet. Impact Analysis 16. Treasury's Regulatory Impact Analysis team has determined that the extension of the end date for tax relief for donations of trading stock made by businesses in response to Covid-19 is exempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statement on the grounds that it has been addressed by existing impact analysis \[CAB-21-MIN-0013 and RIA Pack for Supplementary Order Paper No 23 to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020–21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill (March 2021) (ird.govt.nz)\]. Communications 17. I will issue a media statement once the Order in Council is made by the Executive Council. 18. Inland Revenue will publish an article about these changes in its Tax Information Bulletin. Proactive Release 19. I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers with appropriate redactions within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Consultation 20. In November 2021 officials consulted a group of interested stakeholders which included the Corporate Taxpayers’ Group, Chartered Accountants Australia New Zealand, Federated Farmers, Fonterra, EY, PwC, The New Zealand Law Society, 3 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 10:58:45 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] and Auckland City Mission. This is the same group of stakeholders consulted on the introduction of the relief measures as a part of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020 - 21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2021. All responses we received were in favour of a one-year extension to provide certainty for businesses and donee organisations.

POLICY AND REGULATORY STEWARDSHIP Tax policy report: Extending tax relief for donations of trading stock made by businesses in response to the COVID-19 outbreak Date: 9 December 2021 Priority: Medium Security level: In Confidence Report number: IR2021/624 Action sought Action sought Deadline Minister of Finance Agree to recommendations 17 December 2021 Minister of Revenue Agree to recommendations 17 December 2021 Contact for telephone discussion (if required) Name Position Telephone Peter Frawley Policy Lead s 9(2)(a) Brandon Sloan Principal Policy Advisor s 9(2)(a) \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 9 December 2021 Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue Extending tax relief for donations of trading stock made by businesses in response to the COVID-19 outbreak Purpose 1. This report seeks your agreement to extend a COVID-19 relief measure concerning the income tax treatment of donated trading stock. Officials recommend that this relief, due to expire on 16 March 2022 1 is extended for a further 12 months until 31 March 2023. Background 2. In 2020 stakeholders from both the charitable and commercial sectors informed Inland Revenue officials and your office about their concerns that the Income Tax Act 2007 disincentivises businesses from donating goods by imposing tax on the market value of the donated trading stock. This is a long-standing issue within the tax system. 3. A donation of trading stock is deemed to be a disposal. A deemed income rule in the Income Tax Act effectively reverses the deduction that was claimed when the trading stock was purchased and imposes tax on a deemed profit. You agreed to turn this rule off, as a temporary COVID-19 relief measure, for a two-year period starting 17 March 2020 (IR2021/051 refers). As a result, where a business donates trading stock to a donee organisation or public authority they are not subject to tax on deemed income and are eligible for a deduction. The purpose of the temporary measure was to provide immediate tax relief to businesses, while officials continued work on whether a more enduring solution should be inserted into the Income Tax Act. 4. This deemed income rule was introduced principally as an integrity measure. However, it arguably overreaches by imposing tax in situations where tax avoidance is not a concern. The overreach of this rule is not limited to COVID-19 but has been exacerbated by it, for example by increased donations to food banks or of masks and consumable medical equipment (such as personal protective equipment). 5. Prior to introducing this exemption, it was believed there was widespread non- compliance with the deemed income rule. Therefore, tax relief for donated trading stock has likely aligned the law with common business practice, rather than changed behaviour. Inland Revenue has limited data on trading stock donations. 6. There is public interest in this issue, with a submitter raising it with the Finance and Expenditure Committee during their hearing on the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2021-22, GST, and Remedial Matters) Bill. Proposals 7. The temporary relief provided that where a business donates trading stock to: 1 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020-21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2021, s 84. IR2021/624: Extending tax relief for donations of trading stock made by businesses in response to the COVID- 19 outbreak Page 1 of 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 7.1 public authorities and donee organisations (an organisation whose donors can claim a tax concession for donations made to the organisation) they are not subject to the deemed income rule and are eligible for a tax deduction. 7.2 non-associated persons (which are not public authorities or donee organisations) they are not subject to the deemed income rule. However, the donor will only be able to claim a tax deduction where they can demonstrate the donation is made for business purposes. 8. The legislation allows for the COVID-19 response measure to be extended by Order in Council if you are satisfied that people in New Zealand are likely to continue, beyond the expiry of the existing period, to be significantly adversely affected by COVID-19. Officials are working on assessing the case for a more enduring solution, but the issues are complex, paragraph 13 refers. The question of allowing deductions for donated trading stock touches on a wider tax issue of recognising expenses that do not have a clear relationship with earning taxable income. Rationale for extending the relief and consultation 9. The economic and social impacts of COVID-19 continue to be felt throughout New Zealand, for example, through increased demands on community foodbanks. Officials therefore consulted a select group of stakeholders 2 in November 2021 on the possibility of extending the relief measures. All responses we received were in favour of a one-year extension to provide certainty for businesses and donee organisations. Stakeholders were confident that the impacts of COVID-19 will continue beyond March 2022. 10. Stakeholders considered that taxpayers and businesses who have donated trading stock have been motivated by the need of the community rather than incentivised by specific tax rules. However, they did emphasise the need to address the potential that the tax law settings could discourage donations at this time of greater need if the relief from the deemed income rule is not extended. 11. When consulting with stakeholders on a possible extension we also asked for examples of how the temporary relief measure has made a difference to taxpayers. Federated Farmers provided the example of Meat the Need, a nationally based charity established in April 2020 to supply meat to city missions and foodbanks. Meat the Need has advised Federated Farmers that when farmers donate livestock, they often comment that the tax implication of their donation is part of their reason for donating. An enduring solution 12. Stakeholders also voiced a strong preference for an enduring solution to the deemed income rule to ensure it does not disincentivise donations. 13. Officials note, however, that a permanent solution: 13.1 would be a departure from providing tax benefits for monetary donations only, 13.2 raises broader tax integrity concerns about providing tax benefits for non- cash donations where valuation of the gift can be problematic, and 2 Corporate Taxpayers’ Group, Chartered Accountants Australia New Zealand, Federated Farmers, Fonterra, EY, PwC, The New Zealand Law Society, and Auckland City Mission. This is the same group of stakeholders consulted on the introduction of the relief measures (IR2021/051 refers). IR2021/624: Extending tax relief for donations of trading stock made by businesses in response to the COVID- 19 outbreak Page 2 of 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 13.3 the integrity of the trading stock rules also needs to be considered alongside the original anti-avoidance purpose of the deemed income rule. 14. However, the current legislation does allow for the deemed income rule to be turned off by Order in Council whenever you are satisfied that a Civil Defence Emergency event has occurred and people in New Zealand are being significantly adversely affected as a consequence of the event. 15. Officials can progress work on an enduring solution in 2022 subject to other Government priorities on the Government’s tax policy work programme. Consultation 16. The Treasury has been consulted in the preparation of this report. Financial implications 17. The estimated fiscal cost of the tax relief provided by the 2021 change earlier this year was $10 million, which was spread across the 2020/21 to 2022/23 fiscal years (the change applied only to one tax year, but the impact is spread across multiple fiscal years because taxpayers file at different times). An extension has an estimated fiscal cost of $5 million, spread across the 2022/23 and 2023/24 fiscal years. 18. Notwithstanding the recent review of the Tax Policy Scorecard (IR2021/551 refers), officials are satisfied this change meets the criteria for the Scorecard funding. This is because, although motivated in part by providing relief from COVID-19, it is an extension of an existing policy responding to a long-standing issue within the tax system. Administrative implications 19. There are no significant administrative implications to extending this relief from the deemed income rule. Next steps and process 20. If you agree to the recommendations in this report: 20.1 officials will prepare a paper to the Cabinet Legislation Committee seeking its approval to an Order in Council that would extend the relief from the deemed income rule to 31 March 2023. 20.2 officials will instruct the Parliamentary Counsel Office to draft an Order in Council. 21. Legislative and policy approval will need to be sought from Cabinet at the same time to ensure that an extension can come into force prior to 16 March 2022. We will report again on 27 January 2022.

This paper seeks the Cabinet Economic Development Committee’s agreement to an Order in Council extending the end date of a tax relief measure for donations of trading stock. The extension is part of the Government’s wider COVID-19 relief strategy. Policy 2. The proposed Order extends a tax relief measure for trading stock donated by businesses in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, with the new end date being 31 March 2023. 3. As a relief measure, the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020-21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2021 provided time limited relief so that the Income Tax Act did not disincentivise businesses from donating trading stock to mitigate the economic and social impacts of COVID-19. 4. A donation of trading stock is deemed to be a disposal. A deemed income rule in the Income Tax Act effectively reverses the deduction that was claimed when the trading stock was purchased and imposes tax on a deemed profit. 5. Cabinet agreed to turn this rule off, as a temporary COVID-19 relief measure, for a two-year period starting 17 March 2020 (CAB-21-MIN-0013 refers). As a result, 5.1 when a business donates trading stock to a donee organisation or public authority, taxable income does not arise; and 5.2 when a business donates trading stock to a non-associated person (which are not public authorities or donee organisations) taxable income is deemed not to arise if the donation is made for a business purpose. 6. The current end date for this temporary relief measure is 17 March 2022. 7. The economic and social impacts of COVID-19 continue to be felt throughout New Zealand, for example, through increased demands on community foodbanks. Officials therefore consulted a group of stakeholders in November 2021 on the possibility of extending the relief measures. All responses were in favour of a one- year extension to provide certainty for businesses and donee organisations. 1 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 10:58:45 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Stakeholders were confident that the impacts of COVID-19 would continue beyond March 2022. Proposed Order in Council 8. The proposed Order, to be made under s 225ABA of the Tax Administration Act 1994, will extend the period of relief for certain disposals of trading stock. It will come into force on 16 March 2022 and extend the relief period so it ends on 31 March 2023. 9. I recommend this Order be made on the basis that the legal requirements of s 225ABA(4) of the Tax Administration Act have been met. In particular, I am satisfied that people in New Zealand are likely to continue, beyond the expiry of the existing period, to be significantly adversely affected by COVID-19. T he comments from stakeholders echoed that the economic and social impacts of COVID-19 continue to be felt throughout New Zealand, for example, through increased demands on community foodbanks. Timing and 28-Day Rule 10. The proposed Order will come into force on 16 March 2022. 11. A waiver of the 28-day rule is sought to allow the Order to come into force by 16 March 2023 on the grounds that the Order needs to be in force before the current temporary relief measure period expires. This is necessary to ensure that businesses donating trading stock to donee organisations and public authorities in response to COVID-19 are not disincentivised from donating trading stock. The change is taxpayer favourable. Financial Implications 12. The estimated financial implications of extending the temporary relied period from the deemed income rule is shown in the table below. Over the forecast period 2021 - 22 to 2025-26 the estimated fiscal cost is $5 million. This cost will be charged against the Tax Policy Scorecard. $m – increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue M i ni s ter of Revenue 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 & outyears Tax Revenue -(2.000) (3.000) -- Total Operating -2.000 3.000 -- Compliance 13. The order complies with: 13.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 2 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 10:58:45 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 13.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993; 13.3 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993 (if the regulations raise privacy issues, indicate whether the Privacy Commissioner agrees that they comply with all relevant principles); 13.4 relevant international standards and obligations; 13.5 the Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. Regulations Review Committee 14. Officials consider there are no grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Order to the attention of the House of Representatives under Standing Order 327. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 15. The regulations have been certified by the Parliamentary Counsel Office as being in order for submission to Cabinet. Impact Analysis 16. Treasury's Regulatory Impact Analysis team has determined that the extension of the end date for tax relief for donations of trading stock made by businesses in response to Covid-19 is exempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statement on the grounds that it has been addressed by existing impact analysis \[CAB-21-MIN-0013 and RIA Pack for Supplementary Order Paper No 23 to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020–21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill (March 2021) (ird.govt.nz)\]. Communications 17. I will issue a media statement once the Order in Council is made by the Executive Council. 18. Inland Revenue will publish an article about these changes in its Tax Information Bulletin. Proactive Release 19. I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers with appropriate redactions within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Consultation 20. In November 2021 officials consulted a group of interested stakeholders which included the Corporate Taxpayers’ Group, Chartered Accountants Australia New Zealand, Federated Farmers, Fonterra, EY, PwC, The New Zealand Law Society, 3 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 10:58:45 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] and Auckland City Mission.

Consultation is no w complete. T his report seeks your agreement to set the minimum standards by Order i n Council (OIC) . Bac kground 2.T he Taxation (Income Tax Rate and Other Amendments) Act 2020 introduce d i ncreased disclosure requirements for trusts to support the Commissioner’s abilit y to assess compliance with the new 39% personal income tax rate and assist th e C ommissioner in understanding and monitoring the use of structures and entitie s b y trustees . 3. The new rules require trustees of a trust that derives assessable income, and does n ot fall within a specific exclusion category, to prepare financial statements. This is i n addition to requirements to disclose settlors, settlements, distributions an d appointer details. 4.An OIC will set minimum standards for the financial statements. This will provide c ertainty regarding the level of detail to which the statements must be prepare d a nd will impact on the quality of data collected . C onsultation 5 .P olicy officials undertook targeted and public consultation on the content of the OI C f rom June to December 2021. Officials also consulted on operational guidance to a ddress practical matters for trustees, which is planned to be issued in a n op erational statement in March 2022 . 6.T he main themes arising from the OIC consultation involved a concern about hig h co mpliance costs, a preference for a one-year deferral of all disclosur e re quirements, general support for the OIC, recommendations concerning th e de finition and extent of relief for small trusts, and suggestions concerning variou s t echnical matters including related legislative amendments . An alysis 7 .O fficials acknowledge that the trust disclosure rules will result in increase d c ompliance costs. T his was addressed in the 2020 Regulatory Impact Assessmen t (RI A) “Introducing a new top personal income tax rate”. The RIA included th e r ecommendation to conduct a post-implementation review of the new disclosur e ru les. An appropriate time would be in 2023, after trustees using agents have file d IR2022/002: minimum standards for financial statements prepared by domestic trusts Page 1 of 11 their first returns under the new rules (these trustee s have until 31 March 2023 to file their returns for the 2021-22 year). 8.T hroughout the OIC consultation process in 2021, policy officials attempted to strik e a b alance between ensuring the OIC does not generate unnecessary complianc e co sts and ensuring the Commissioner will have sufficient financial information to m eet the objectives of the disclosure rules. We believe the proposed OIC conten t w ill achieve this . 9. T he proposed key features of the OIC are : 9 .1 Date of application: Officials propose that the OIC will apply for the 2021- 22 and future income years. 9.2 OIC requirements: Officials propose that the OIC specifies core requirements for financial statements that must be met by all trusts and additional requirements that must be met for trusts that are not small trusts. 9.3 Limited relief for small trusts: Officials propose limited relief in the OIC for small trusts. This would simplify their reporting obligations and significantly reduce compliance costs. However, all trusts will provide the same financial information in forms prescribed by the Commissioner to ensure the Commissioner has sufficient financial information to meet the objectives of the disclosure rules. Small trusts would be defined as having less than $100,000 assessable income, $100,000 tax deductions, and $5 million total assets in the relevant income year. The income and deduction thresholds would exclude income and expenditure relating to the residential property bright-line rules. Officials estimate that these thresholds will provide limited relief for approximately 75% or 135,000 out of 180,000 trusts subject to the new disclosure rules. 9.4 Asset valuation: Valuations will be market value, cost or tax adjusted value, at the discretion of the trustees. 9.5 Associated person disclosures: Associated person transactions must be disclosed in the financial statements if not disclosed in prescribed forms. Disclosures will not be required for transactions at market value. The definition of associated person will be the general definition to be consistent with prescribed forms, however the Commissioner’s operational statement will accept a best endeavours approach to reporting all associated persons transactions in the first year if information is not available. 10 .O fficials have recommended three legislative amendments to the trust disclosur e ru les in the separate policy report for including amendments to the Taxation (Annua l R ates for 2021-22, GST, and Remedial Matters) Bill at the Finance and Expenditur e C ommittee stage (IR2022/017 refers) . T iming 11 .O fficials recommend that the OIC come into force by 31 March 2022. Subject to C abinet Committee and Cabinet meeting dates, this will require a waiver of the 28- day rule . 12.O fficials have been liaising with the Parliamentary Counsel Office (PCO) regardin g th e drafting of this OIC. Due to the compressed timeframes, there is not sufficien t ti me to obtain Cabinet approval to provide drafting instructions to PCO, and the n s eparately obtain Cabinet Legislation Committee approval to submit the OIC t o E xecutive Council. Officials recommend seeking policy and legislative approval fo r t he OIC in the same Cabinet paper. PCO will begin drafting the OIC following you r a greement to the minimum standards set out in this paper . IR2022/002: minimum standards for financial statements prepared by domestic trusts Page 2 of 11 Background 1 4.T he Taxation (Income Tax Rate and Other Amendments) Act 2020 introduce d i ncreased disclosure requirements for trusts to support the Commissioner’s abilit y t o assess compliance with the new 39% personal income tax rate and assist th e C ommissioner in understanding and monitoring the use of structures and entitie s b y trustees. Amendments to reduce compliance costs for some trusts wer e s ubsequently enacted in March 2021 in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020-21 , Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2021. 15.T he increased disclosure requirements apply to trustees of trusts that deriv e a ssessable income and are not subject to specific exclusions. These new rules appl y f or the 2021–22 and later income years and require trustees to include with thei r a nnual retur n: 1 5.1 A statement of profit or loss and a statement of financial position 15.2 The amount and nature of settlements received 15.3 Settlor details, including details of previous settlors if not previously supplied to the Commissioner 15.4 The amount of distributions made and details of beneficiaries who received the distributions 15.5 Appointer details. 1 6.Of ficials propose setting minimum standards for the financial statements by a n O rder in Council made under section 21C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) . In the absence of minimum standards, there would be uncertainty regarding the l evel of detail the statements must be prepared to. This would affect the quality o f d ata collected . 17.Two similar Orders have been made under the same section in the past: 17 .1 The Tax Administration (Financial Statements) Order 2014 sets out th e min imum standards for financial statements of companies, and 17.2 The Tax Administration (Financial Statements—Foreign Trusts) Order 2017 sets out the minimum standards for financial statements of foreign trusts. Impact 1 8.The total volume of New Zealand trusts has been estimated to be up to 500,000. I nland Revenue records indicate that approximately 180,000 domestic trusts repor t a ssessable income each year and may be affected to some extent by the ne w dis closure requirements. The financial statement disclosure requirements w ill pr imarily affect approximately 55,000 of these domestic trusts. These are trust s th at report assessable income to Inland Revenue but do not currently repor t b usiness income or file any financial statement s. O bjectives 1 9.O fficials proposed minimum standards that are consistent with the followin g o bjectives : •M inimise compliance costs while supporting policy objectives. Th e min imum standards will strike a balance between minimising unnecessar y c ompliance costs and ensuring the Commissioner will have sufficient financia l i nformation to meet the objectives of the disclosure rules . IR2022/002: minimum standards for financial statements prepared by domestic trusts Page 4 of 11 •Improve the quality of data. The minimum standards will positively impact o n the quality of data collected . •E nsure consistency with existing frameworks. Th e minimum standar ds w ill be consistent with previous minimum standards set for companies an d f oreign trusts and they will align with accounting principles where appropriate . •F ollow the proportionality principle. The minimum standards will b e t ailored to the size of the trust. Small trusts will not be required to meet all o f t he minimum standards set for large trusts . C onsultation 2 0.P olicy officials undertook targeted and public consultation on the content of the OI C f rom June to December 2021. Officials also consulted on operational guidance to a ddress practical matters for trustees. The main themes arising from the OI C c onsultation were : 2 0.1 High compliance costs. The new disclosure rules will result in some trust s in curring significant compliance costs. Submitters suggested this could be addressed by legislating a one-year deferral of all of the trust disclosure rules, to allow trustees to structure out of the rules or give them more time to prepare for implementation of the rules. In addition, legislative amendments could provide small trusts an exemption from all of the trust disclosure rules. 20.2 Support for OIC. The proposal to enact an OIC to set minimum financial reporting standards was supported, as it would provide guidance for trustees. 20.3 OIC relief for small trusts. Submitters engaged on how small trusts should be defined for the purposes of the OIC relief and the scope of that relief. 20.4 Technical matters. Submitters engaged on a range of technical matters that should be required in the OIC, the most significant relating to valuation, associated person disclosures, and disclosures relating to beneficiary accounts. Analysis 2 1.T he proposed key features of the OIC content, largely supported by submitters an d o utlined below and in detail in Appendices A and B, are : 2 1.1 Date of application: Officials propose that the OIC will apply for the 2021- 22 and future income years. There are several areas where compliance for the first year (2021-22) could be on a ‘best endeavours’ basis and these will be addressed in the Commissioner’s operational statement. For example, the calculation of opening balances and the reporting of transactions with associated persons. Compliance with the OIC will not impact on the financial information the Commissioner will collect in prescribed forms. 21.2 OIC requirements: Officials propose that the OIC specifies core requirements for financial statements that must be met by all trusts and additional requirements that must be met for trusts that are not small trusts. 21.3 Limited relief for small trusts: Officials propose limited relief in the OIC for small trusts which would be defined using income, expense and asset thresholds. The proposal is to set these thresholds at $100,000 assessable income, $100,000 tax deductions, and $5 million total assets. The income IR2022/002: minimum standards for financial statements prepared by domestic trusts Page 5 of 11 and deduction thresholds would exclude income and expenditure relating to the residential property bright-line rules. Officials estimate that these thresholds will result in 75% (135,000 out of 180,000) of trusts will be classified as small trusts for the purpose of OIC relief. This means small trusts will have to meet fewer minimum requirements for their financial statements set out in the OIC, but the information they provide to the Commissioner in prescribed forms will remain the same for all trusts (information to be collected in prescribed forms is summarised in Appendix A). 21.4 Asset valuation: Valuations will be market value, cost or tax adjusted value, at the discretion of the trustees. The valuation method for certain assets must be disclosed. 21.5 Associated person disclosures: Associated person transactions must be disclosed in the financial statements if not disclosed in prescribed forms. Disclosures will not be required for transactions at market value. The general definition of associated persons will be applied, however for practical purposes the Commissioner’s operational statement will accept a best endeavours approach to reporting associated persons transactions in the first year if information is not available to trustees. 21.6 Beneficiary account movements: Beneficiary account movement details will not be set out in the OIC but movements disclosed in prescribed forms would, at a minimum, be part of the materials supporting the financial statements. 22 .O fficials have recommended three legislative amendments to the trust disclosur e r ules in the separate policy report for including amendments in the Taxation (Annua l R ates for 2021-22, GST, and Remedial Matters) Bill at the Finance and Expenditur e C ommittee stage (IR2022/017 refers). These proposed changes will : 22 .1 Exclude non-cash distributions that are minor services incidental to th e op eration of the trust from the disclosure requirements. 22.2 Clarify that the new rules require trusts to disclose the nature of each distribution made by the trustee of the trust. 22.3 Exempt all foreign trusts from the new domestic disclosure rules. Administrative implications 2 3.Implementation and on-going administration costs will be met through baseline f unding . IR2022/002: minimum standards for financial statements prepared by domestic trusts Page 6 of 11 Appendix A – Summary of proposed minimum requirements for the preparation of financial statements by domestic trusts subject to section 59BA of the Tax Administration Act 2 5.T he OIC will contain minimum requirements for the preparation of financia l s tatements by trusts subject to section 59BA of the Tax Administration Act 199 4 ( TAA), as summarised below. For the purpose of the OIC, the term “financia l s tatements” includes any notes and other supporting materials forming part of th e fi nancial statement s. T ier 1: Core requirements – for all trusts subject to s 59B A i. P repare a statement of financial position and a profit and loss statemen t. ii. Apply the double-entry method of recording financial transactions. iii. Us e the prescribed valuation principles and disclose the valuation metho d a dopted for shares/ownership interests, land and buildings . i v . Fin ancial statements must contain all relevant amounts that any for ms p rescribed by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue under section 35 of the TA A r equire to be copied from the company’s financial statements (for example, th e I R10 Financial Statements Summary and the financial statement disclosur e s ection in the IR6 income tax return and the IR6B movement in beneficiar y a ccounts) . T ier 2: Additional requirements for trusts that are not “small trusts” v .Apply the principles of accrual accounting. v i . P rovide a statement of accounting policies . vii.D isclose comparable figures for the previous income year to the extent that th e tr ustee has that information . viii.Disclose several specific items: -A reconciliation between the profit or loss in the statement of profit an d l oss to taxable income ; -A n appropriately detailed schedule of the trust’s fixed assets an d depreciable property used for tax purposes; -M atters relating to trusts with forestry and livestock businesse s: i nformation about the cost of timber as at the end of the income year a nd a reconciliation of movements in the cost of timber during the income year ; if the trust is a specified livestock owner, details of livestock valuatio n m ethods, valuations, and calculations for tax purposes . i x . D isclose associated persons transaction details. For the purposes of th e d isclosure rule s: -The disclosure should include details of transactions between the trust and a ny associated person of the trustee, unless the transaction is minor an d i ncidental to the activities of the trustee ; -T ransaction details include names of the associated persons, the nature o f th e association, the nature of the transactions and the amounts involved ; -D isclosures are not required if transactions are at a market rate ; -I f associated person disclosures have been made separately in any form s p rescribed by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, this information doe s not need to be duplicated in the financial statements. -A ssociated persons are as defined in subpart YB of the Income Tax Ac t 2 00 7.

Financial statements may be prepared to an y le vel above the minimum specified by the OIC. These minimum standards will no t directly affect other disclosures required under section 59BA(2), which include d etails of settlements, settlors, distributions and appointers . 29.D ate of application: Officials propose the OIC be enacted by 31 March 2022 an d a pply it to the 2021-22 income year for balance dates ending 31 March or later . There are several areas where compliance for the first year (2021-22) could be on a ‘best endeavours’ basis and these will be addressed in the Commissioner’ s op erational statement rather than the OIC. Changes proposed as a result o f c onsultation remove significant compliance costs so there is no advantage i n deferring its application. Making the OIC before 31 March 2022 and applying it for t he 2021-22 year onwards will provide useful guidance for trustees. Setting out i n a n operational statement where the Commissioner will accept a ‘best endeavours ’ a pproach for the first year will reduce transition costs for many trusts. Earl y balance-date trusts will not be required to follow the OIC (approximately 400 out of 18 0,000 trusts with assessable income are early balance date trusts and about hal f w ill be able to access the OIC small trust concessions) . 30.F inancial statement notes and supporting materials: Officials propose th e d omestic trust OIC will clarify that, for the purposes of the OIC, the term ‘financia l s tatements’ includes any notes and other supporting materials. Section 59BA(2)(a ) r equires trusts to provide “a statement of profit or loss and a statement of financia l p osition”. Where the OIC refers to financial statements it will align with th e co mpanies OIC which states that the term financial statements “includes any note s a nd other supporting materials forming part of the financial statements”. This is a n impo rtant compliance cost savings measure – making it clear that items required in the OIC can simply be supporting materials rather than in the actual financial s tatements . 31.N on-standard balance date reporting: Officials propose that financia l s tatements may be prepared to a non-standard balance date (i.e. a balance dat e th at is not 31 March) used for accounting purposes, provided the trust does no t de rive business income which would require Commissioner approval for non- standard balance date reporting. This concession will relieve passive investmen t tr usts from having to re-state their financial statements to the 31 March tax year i f t hey have non-standard balance dates for accounting purposes . 32.S mall trust thresholds: Officials propose that small trust relief thresholds be a s f ollows : i. T o qualify as a small trust, a trustee must report, for the relevant income yea r: • le ss than $100,000 assessable income (before allocation); an d • le ss than $100,000 deductible expenditure; an d • to tal assets (including assets that are not in the tax base) valued at les s t han $5m as at balance date . ii. T he $100,000 assessable income and deductible expenditure figures used f or t he purpose of determining whether a trust is small will not include inco me a ssessed under the bright-line rules or related deductible expenditure . IR2022/002: minimum standards for financial statements prepared by domestic trusts Page 9 of 11 iii.Assets will be valued using the valuation principles in the OIC and must be co nsistent with financial statement s. 33.O fficials estimate that raising these thresholds will provide relief for approximate ly 75 % or 135,000 out of 180,000 trusts subject to the new disclosure rules . T hreshold increases remove significant compliance costs but allow IR to continue t o c ollect sufficient information in prescribed forms . 34.O fficials considered suggestions from submitters to minimise trusts ‘flipping’ in an d ou t of the disclosure rules if they have one-off transactions which would put the m a bove the thresholds. Officials recommend the approach suggested by som e s ubmitters that the calculation be limited to assessable income (and deductibl e e xpenditure) in the current year but that assessable income derived from the bright- line residential property sale rules (and related deductible expenditure) be excluded t o avoid anomalies involving residential property sales . 35.S mall trust scope of relief: Officials propose the scope of relief for small trust s will mean only four minimum standards will apply to small trusts: i. P repare a statement of financial position and a profit and loss statemen t. ii. A pply the double-entry method of recording financial transactions . iii.Us e the prescribed valuation principles and disclose the valuation metho d a dopted for shares/ownership interests, land and buildings . i v . Fin ancial statements must contain all relevant amounts that any for ms p rescribed by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue under section 35 of the TA A require to be copied from the company’s financial statements (for example, the I R10 Financial Statements Summary and the financial statement disclosur e s ection in the IR6 income tax return and the IR6B movement in beneficia ry a ccounts). These increases in the scope of the relief for small trusts remov e significant compliance costs but allow the Commissioner to continue to collect s ufficient information in prescribed forms . 36.Va luations: Officials propose the valuation method will be left to the judgement of the trustees. 37.T he OIC will clarify that for the purposes of calculating market value of properties , th e use of rating valuations is an acceptable proxy . 38.I n order to prevent inappropriate use of a ‘tax value’ option, this option will be r estricted to assets and liabilities that are in the tax base . 39.A ssociated person disclosures: Officials propose : i. T rustees must disclose associated persons transaction details, with th e e xception of trustees of small trusts who must only disclose associated perso n t ransactions when required to do so in prescribed forms . ii. T ransaction details include names of the associated persons, the nature of th e a ssociation, the nature of the transactions and the amounts involved . iii. A ssociated persons are defined in subpart YB of the Income Tax Act 200 7. i v . T he disclosure should include details of transactions between the trust and an y a ssociated person of the trustee, unless the transaction is minor and incidenta l to the activities of the trustee . v.D isclosures are not required if transactions are at a market rate . IR2022/002: minimum standards for financial statements prepared by domestic trusts Page 10 of 11 vi . I f associated person disclosures have been made separately in any forms p rescribed by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, this information does no t n eed to be duplicated in the financial statements . 40.T he approach will reduce duplication with disclosures in prescribed forms, provid e m ore clarity as to what disclosure is required, and reduce the extent of disclosure s r equired (for example, by excluding minor and incidental transactions) . 41.B eneficiary account movements: Officials propose there will be no requiremen t i n the OIC to provide a line-by -line reconciliation in beneficiary accounts. Instea d, t he OIC will clarify that financial statements must contain all relevant amounts tha t a ny forms prescribed by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue including the IR6 B m ovement in beneficiary accounts. The beneficiary account movements disclose d in the prescribed form will be sufficient for the purpose of the OIC. This will save co mpliance cost s. 42.G ross-up options: Officials propose the OIC will not prescribe dividend gross-u p f or imputation credits and interest/dividend gross-up for RWT. The gross-up optio n w ill be left to the judgement of the trustees . 43.T rusts Act 2019: Officials propose the OIC will explicitly note that there a re re quirements for trustees to keep records under section 45 of the Trusts Act 2019 . Section 45 of the Trusts Act 2019 requires each trustee of a trust to keep, so far as i s reasonable, records of the trust property that identify the assets, liabilities , i ncome, and expenses of the trust and that are appropriate to the value an d complexity of the trust property. 44.This requirement differs from the OIC as it does not explicitly require trustees to c ompile financial statements and it allows the trustee to exercise judgement as t o w hat is reasonable and appropriate in respect of record keeping. However, it is a le gislative provision that could be usefully referenced in the OIC, while clarifyin g that the minimum reporting standards in the OIC are more prescriptive and in some c ases apply income tax concepts (for example, the use of tax valuations ). 45.F ixed asset schedule: Officials propose the financial statements will include a n appropriately detailed schedule of the trust’s fixed assets and depreciable property u sed for tax purposes. Fixed assets with a tax value are typically tracked through a ta x fixed assets register. For the purpose of the OIC it will only be required to b e in cluded in financial statements as supporting materials . IR2022/002: minimum standards for financial statements prepared by domestic trusts Page 11 of 11 In Confidence Office of the Minister Revenue Chair, Cabinet Economic Development Committee TAX ADMINISTRATION (FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—DOMESTIC TRUSTS) ORDER 2022 Proposal 1.In 2020, Cabinet agreed to increase the disclosure requirements for trusts, including the requirement to prepare financial statements for the 2021–22 and later income years (CAB-20-MIN-0484 refers). This paper seeks Cabinet’s approval of the minimum level of detail required in those financial statements. Approval is also sought for the Order in Council required to bring the minimum standards into law, and for authority to submit the Order directly to the Executive Council. Relation to Government Priorities 2.The Taxation (Income Tax Rate and Other Amendments) Act 2020 introduced a new to p personal income tax rate of 39% on income exceeding $180,000 for the 2021–22 and later income years. The introduction of a 39% tax rate formed part of the Labour Party’s manifesto for the 2020 General Election. Labour campaigned explicitly that we would not increase the trustee income tax rate but would monitor behaviour around avoidance and the success of enforcement measures. 3.The Act also introduced additional information reporting and disclosure obligations fo r trustees for the 2021–22 and later income years. The objective of these obligations is related to the integrity of the tax system. The disclosure rules will help evaluate the effectiveness of the new 39% rate and gain insight into the use of structures and entities by trustees in New Zealand. Executive Summary 4.The increased trust disclosure requirements include a requirement to prepare a sta tement of profit or loss and a statement of financial position. This requirement does not specify what level of detail the statements must be prepared to. 5.I propose to set, by Order in Council, minimum requirements for financial statements prepared by trusts subject to the new disclosure rules. This will provide increased certainty for trustees regarding their reporting obligations, support compliance with the disclosure rules and will improve the quality of data collected. The proposed Order would apply for the 2021–22 and later income years for most trusts. 6.Inland Revenue officials undertook targeted and public consultation on the proposed con tent of the Order in 2021. Submitters supported setting minimum standards by Order in Council, as it would provide certainty regarding trustees’ reporting obligations and help mitigate the compliance costs imposed by the disclosure rules. 1 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 11:05:11 2 7. The proposed Order has been designed based on feedback received in consultation and is aimed at striking a balance between supporting the Government’s objectives for the disclosure rules and minimising compliance costs for trusts. The proposed minimum standards provide simplified reporting requirements for certain trusts. Background 8. On 23 November 2020, Cabinet decided to defer the decision on whether to increase t he trustee income tax rate to 39% to a later date pending information on whether there is a behavioural response to avoid paying the new 39% top personal income tax rate. Cabinet agreed to collect information from trustees to test compliance and effective operation of the new 39% rate and provide better information to understand and monitor the use of structures and entities by trustees (CAB-21-MIN-0484 refers). 9. The Taxation (Income Tax Rate and Other Amendments) Act 2020 was enacted on 7 D ecember 2020 and introduced increased disclosure requirements for trusts that derive assessable income. The rules apply for the 2021–22 and later income years and require trustees to prepare a statement of profit or loss and a statement of financial position. Trustees must disclose the following information to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue: 9.1 the amount and nature of settlements received (settlements do not need to be d isclosed if they are minor services incidental to the activities of the trust and are provided to the trustee at less than market value); 9.2 settlor details, including details of previous settlors if not previously supplied to t he Commissioner of Inland Revenue; 9.3 the amount of distributions made and details of beneficiaries who received the distributions; and 9.4 appointer details. 10. Certain trusts are excluded from these rules. These exclusions largely relate to trusts t hat already have reporting requirements under other regimes. Examples include non-active trusts, trusts eligible to be Māori authorities, foreign trusts and charitable trusts. 11. The total volume of trusts in New Zealand has been estimated to be over 400,000. I nland Revenue records indicate that approximately 180,000 domestic trusts report assessable income each year and may be affected to some extent by the new disclosure requirements. The financial statement disclosure requirements will primarily affect approximately 55,000 of these domestic trusts. These are trusts that report assessable income to Inland Revenue but do not currently report business income or file any financial statements. 12. There would be uncertainty regarding the level of detail the financial statements must b e prepared to if minimum standards were not set. This would affect the quality of data collected and possibly lead to non-compliance with the rules. 13. Section 21C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) provides that the Governor- General can prescribe minimum requirements for financial reporting. Before 2 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 11:05:11 recommending the making of an Order under this section, the Minister of Revenue must consult with professional accounting bodies. This requirement has been satisfied by consultation undertaken by officials in 2021, as detailed below. Objectives 14. The minimum standards should be consistent with the following objectives: 14.1 Minimising compliance costs: T he minimum standards should strike a balance between ensuring the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will have sufficient financial information to meet the objectives of the disclosure rules and minimising unnecessary compliance costs. 14.2 Achieving the Government’s objectives: T he minimum standards should positively impact on the quality of data collected to help evaluate the effectiveness of the new 39% rate and gain insight into the use of structures and entities by trustees. 14.3 Ensuring consistency with existing frameworks: T he minimum standards should be consistent where possible with previous minimum standards set for companies and foreign trusts and should align with accounting standards and principles where appropriate. 14.4 Proportionality: T he minimum standards should be tailored to the size of the trust. Smaller trusts should have simplified reporting requirements. Consultation 15. Inland Revenue officials undertook targeted and public consultation on the proposed mi nimum standards in 2021. Officials also consulted on operational guidance for the disclosure rules to address practical matters for trustees. The main themes arising from consultation were: 15.1 High compliance costs: T he new disclosure rules will result in some trusts incurring significant compliance costs. Submitters suggested this could be addressed by legislating a one-year deferral of all the trust disclosure rules, to allow trustees to restructure out of the rules or give them more time to prepare for implementation of the rules. In addition, legislative amendments could provide smaller trusts an exemption from all the disclosure requirements. 15.2 Support for Order in Council: T he proposal to set minimum financial reporting standards by Order in Council was supported, as it would increase certainty for trustees regarding reporting obligations. 15.3 Relief for small trusts: S ubmitters engaged on how small trusts should be defined for the purposes of the Order in Council relief and the scope of that relief. 15.4 Technical matters: S ubmitters engaged on a range of technical matters that should be covered by the Order in Council, the most significant relating to valuation methods, associated person disclosures, and disclosures relating to beneficiary accounts. 3 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 11:05:11 16.In addition to consulting with members of the tax and accounting community, the External Reporting Board, the Department of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, the Ministry of Justice, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, Statistics NZ and the Treasury were consulted during the development of the proposed minimum standards. Minimum standards 17.The key features of the proposed Order are set out below. These features have been de veloped based on feedback received in consultation and the objectives set out above. The annex contains further detail on the proposed minimum requirements. Application date 18.A small number of trusts have an early balance date and will have already filed their annual return before the Order is proposed to come into force. Inland Revenue data indicates approximately 0.2% (400 out of 180,000) of trusts subject to these rules are in this situation. 19.To prevent retrospectively imposing requirements on these trusts, I propose that the min imum standards apply for income years that end after the Order comes into force. This will be 2021–22 and future income years for the large majority of trusts that do not have an early balance date. 20.There are several areas where compliance for the first year (2021–22) could be on a ‘best endeavours’ basis and these are expected be addressed in the Commissioner’s Operational Statement on the disclosure rules. For example, this could include the calculation of opening balances in the first year and the reporting of transactions with associated persons. Simplified reporting requirements for certain trusts 21.The proposed Order provides simplified reporting requirements for certain trusts. A trust with less than $100,000 assessable income, less than $100,000 tax deductions and less than $5 million total assets in an income year will have simplified reporting requirements. These thresholds would exclude income and expenditure relating to the residential property brightline rules to reduce the risk of trusts not qualifying for the simplified reporting requirements due to large one-off transactions. 22.Officials estimate that these thresholds will result in 75% (135,000 out of 180,000) of tru sts qualifying for simplified reporting requirements. 23.While these trusts will have to meet fewer requirements for their financial statements, all trusts will provide the same financial information in forms prescribed by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. This helps reduce compliance costs for a significant number of trusts, while continuing to support the objectives of the disclosure rules of evaluating the effectiveness if the new 39% rate and gaining insight into the use of structures and entities by trustees in New Zealand. 4 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 11:05:11 Asset valuation 24. Assets will be valued at either market value, cost or tax adjusted value, at the discretion of the trustees. For the purposes of calculating the market value of properties, the use of rating valuations will be an acceptable proxy. This helps ensure trustees are not forced to re-value assets, or engage valuers, to comply with the disclosure rules. 25. The valuation method for certain assets must be disclosed. This helps support the q uality of the data collected. Associated person disclosures 26. Trustees must disclose associated persons transaction details, except for trustees of “simplified reporting trusts” who only need to disclose associated person transactions when required to do so in prescribed forms. 27. Disclosures will not be required for transactions at market value. Disclosure of t ransactions with associated persons not at market value is important to assess compliance with the 39% personal income tax rate. Financial Implications 28. This proposal has no financial implications. Timing and 28-Day Rule 29. The proposed Order will come into force on 31 March 2022, the end of the 2021–22 income year for trustees with standard balance dates. The minimum standards set by the Order will apply for income years ending on or after the Order comes into force. That is, the Order will not retrospectively impose requirements on trustees with balance dates prior to the Order coming into force. 30. A waiver of the 28-day rule is sought to allow the Order to come into force by 31 Ma rch 2022 on the grounds that the Order needs to be in force before the end of the 2021–22 income year for trustees with standard balance dates, to provide increased certainty regarding reporting obligations for the 2021–22 and later income years. Compliance 31. The Order in Council complies with: 31.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 31.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 a nd the Human Rights Act 1993; 31.3 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 2020; 31.4 relevant international standards and obligations; 31.5 the Legislation Guidelines (2021 edition), which are maintained by the L egislation Design and Advisory Committee. 5 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 11:05:11 Regulations Review Committee Application date 32.The short time between the proposed making of this Order and the application date of the minimum standards may be a basis for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Order to the attention of the House of Representatives under Standing Order 327. Officials consider this risk to be low and that the application date is appropriate for the following reasons: 32.1 The disclosure rules were enacted in December 2020. Trustees have had a rea sonable amount of notice regarding the requirements in the disclosure rules in section 59BA of the TAA. 32.2 Trustees will have until 7 July 2022 to file returns for the 2021–22 income yea r. Trustees with tax agents (the large majority) will be able to file returns as late as 31 March 2023. 32.3 During consultation in 2021, submitters broadly supported applying the mi nimum standards for the 2021–22 income year. Submitters considered that this would provide increased certainty regarding trustees’ reporting obligations. Deferring the application of the Order to a later date would provide no relief from the requirement in section 59BA to prepare financial statements for the 2021–22 income year. 32.4 Inland Revenue has been engaged with tax agents, accountants and software pr oviders regarding the implementation of the disclosure requirements. Sub-delegation issue 33.Clause 1(e) of the Schedule to the Order requires that the financial statements must include all relevant amounts that are required to be copied from financial statements into a form prescribed by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (for example, the IR10 form – financial statements summary). 34.There is a low risk that this clause may be a basis for the Regulations Review Co mmittee to draw the Order to the attention of the House of Representatives under Standing Order 327. This is because there is a risk that the Order could be seen to sub-delegate to the Commissioner the legislative power to set requirements for financial statements for domestic trusts. 35.Taxpayers that derive business income are required to either file an IR10 form or pro vide a set of financial statements to Inland Revenue. Clause 1(e) of the Schedule is an important integrity measure to ensure that taxpayers cannot avoid the requirements in the IR10 form by filing a set of financial statements prepared to a lower standard. This clause ensures that the financial statements are an appropriate proxy for the IR10 form. This approach follows the precedent set by the minimum standards for financial reporting for companies. 1 36.Clause 1(e) of the Schedule to the Order only relates to forms that the Commissioner is already authorised to prescribe under section 35 of the TAA. To ensure the 1 Clause 1(e) of the Schedule to Tax Administration (Financial Statements) Order 2014. 6 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 11:05:11 financial statement requirements are workable, it is important that they interface with these forms. In these circumstances, officials are satisfied that this approach is within the scope of the regulation making power contemplated by Parliament. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 37.The Order in Council has been certified by the Parliamentary Counsel Office as be ing in order for submission to Cabinet. Impact Analysis Regulatory Impact Statement 38.A Regulatory Impact Statement has been completed and is attached. 39.The Quality Assurance reviewers at Inland Revenue have reviewed Re gulatory Impact Statement: Minimum standards for financial statements prepared by domestic trusts and consider that the information and analysis summarised in it meets the quality assurance criteria of the Regulatory Impact Statement framework. Climate Implications of Policy Assessment 40.The Climate Implications of Policy Assessment (CIPA) team has been consulted and confirms that the CIPA requirements do not apply to this proposal as the threshold for significance is not met. Population Implications 41.There are no population implications arising from these proposals. Human Rights 42.The proposals do not give rise to any human rights implications. Communications 43.I will publish a press statement regarding the minimum standards for financial sta tements prepared by domestic trusts before the end of the 2021–22 income year. 44.The Order will be published in the Ga zette and Inland Revenue will include details of the new minimum standards in a Tax Information Bulletin after the Order is made. 45.To date a number of submitters and media articles have focused on the increased compliance costs for trustees as a result of the new domestic trust disclosure rules. They have noted these rules go further than reporting requirements under the Trusts Act 2019 and suggested that because the disclosure rules were enacted in December 2020 with no consultation it would be preferrable to defer their application for a year. While the proposed Order goes some way to reducing compliance costs based on submitter feedback, it is likely that concerns about the timing and the amount of information being collected will continue to be raised. 7 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 11:05:11 Proactive Release 46.I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key ad vice papers with appropriate redactions within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Committee: 1.note that the Taxation (Income Tax Rate and Other Amendments) Act 2020 i ntroduced increased disclosure requirements for certain trusts, including the requirement to prepare financial statements for the 2021–22 and later income years. 2.note that section 21C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows the Governor- G eneral to prescribe, by Order in Council, minimum requirements for preparing financial statements for certain classes of taxpayers. 3.note that before recommending the making of an Order in Council under section 21C o f the Tax Administration Act 1994, the Minister of Revenue must consult with professional accounting bodies. Targeted and public consultation undertaken by officials in 2021 satisfies this requirement. 4.agree to the minimum financial reporting requirements as set out in the attached Order, Tax Administration (Financial Statements—Domestic Trusts) Order 2022. 5.agree that the proposed Order should apply to all trusts subject to the disclosure ru les introduced by the Taxation (Income Tax Rate and Other Amendments) Act 2020. 6.agree that the proposed Order should apply for income years that end on or after 31 March 2022. 7.authorise th e submission to the Executive Council of the Tax Administration (Financial Statements—Domestic Trusts) Order 2022. 8.note that the Tax Administration (Financial Statements—Domestic Trusts) Order 2022 will come into force on 31 March 2022, the end of the 2021–22 income year for trusts with standard balance dates. 9.note that a waiver of the 28-day rule is sought so that the Order in Council can come i nto force by 31 March 2022 on the ground it needs to be in force before the end of the 2021–22 income year. 8 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 11:05:11 10. agree to waive the 28-day rule so that the Order in Council can come into force by 31 March 2022. Authorised for lodgement Hon David Parker M inister of Revenue 9 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 11:05:11 Annex – minimum standards for financial statements prepared by domestic trusts For the purposes of the Order in Council, the term “financial statements” includes any notes an d other supporting materials forming part of the financial statements. The standards set out below are “minimum” standards. Financial statements may be pr epared to any level above these minimum requirements. Financial statements may be prepared to a non-standard balance date (i.e. a balance date that is not 31 March) used for accounting purposes, provided the trust does not derive business income (which would require approval from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue for non-standard balance date reporting – section 38 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA)). Valuation Valuation of assets and liabilities can be either at market value, cost or tax adjusted value, at the discretion of the trustee. The use of ‘tax value’ will be limited to assets and liabilities that are in the tax base (i.e., assets and liabilities that are used in the production of assessable income). Simplified reporting trusts A trust is a “simplified reporting trust” for a relevant income year if the trustee reports: less than $100,000 assessable income, AND less than $100,000 deductible expenditure, AND total assets reported in the statement of financial position (including both private and in come producing assets) valued at less than $5 million as at balance date. The $100,000 assessable income and deductible expenditure thresholds used in this test do not include income assessed under the brightline rules or related deductible expenditure. Assets will be valued using the valuation principles set out above and must be consistent with the prepared financial statements. Core requirements for all trusts The following minimum standards apply to all trusts subject to the disclosure rules. The financial statements must consist of: A statement of financial position setting out the assets, liabilities, and net assets of th e trust as at the end of the return year; and A statement of profit or loss statement showing income derived, and expenditure in curred, by the trust during the return year. Financial statements must be prepared using the double-entry method of recording financial tra nsactions. Financial statements must use the prescribed valuation principles (set out above) and di sclose the valuation method adopted for land, buildings, and shares/ownership interests. 10 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 11:05:11 A trustee can choose to adopt a different valuation method for each of these categories. If there are multiple assets within one category (e.g., multiple buildings), each asset may be valued using a different method. Financial statements must contain all relevant amounts that any forms prescribed by the Co mmissioner under section 35 of the TAA require to be copied from the company’s financial statements. Additional requirements for trusts that are not “simplified reporting trusts” For trusts that do not qualify for simplified reporting for an income year, the financial st a tements must: Be prepared applying the principles of accrual accounting. Include a statement of accounting policies Disclose comparable figures for the previous income year to the extent that the tru stee has that information. Disclose several specific items: oa reconciliation between the profit or loss in the statement of profit or loss to ta xable income; oan appropriately detailed schedule of the trust’s fixed assets and depreciable pr operty used for tax purposes; omatters relating to trusts with forestry and livestock businesses: information about the cost of timber as at the end of the income year and a reconciliation of movements in the cost of timber during the income year; if the trust is a specified livestock owner, details of livestock valuation me thods, valuations, and calculations for tax purposes. oDisclose details of transactions between the trust and any associated person of the trustee, unless the transaction is minor and incidental to the activities of the trust. Transaction details include the names of the associated persons, the n ature of the association, the nature of the transactions and the amounts involved. Disclosure is not required if the transaction is at a market rate. If associated person disclosures have been made separately in any f orms prescribed by the Commissioner, this information does not need to be duplicated in the financial statements. 11 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 11:05:11 I N C O N F I D E N C E DEV-22-MIN-0016 Cabinet Economic Development Committee Minute of Decision This document contains information for the New Zealand Cabinet.

This report seeks your approval to release the GST apportionment and adjustment rules officials’ issues paper, for public consultation. These rules apply when a GST registered business purchases an asset which is used for both business and for private or exempt use. A draft officials’ issues paper and draft cabinet paper are attached to this report, for your consideration. 2. As outlined in our earlier report to you in February 2021 (IR2021/060 refers), the GST apportionment and adjustment rules have been an issue of high priority for stakeholders for some time, with reform of the apportionment rules being ranked the highest priority in the recent GST stewardship review, as well as in submissions received in the February 2020 GST issues paper. 3. In recent months, we have been engaging with external stakeholders (including private sector GST advisors) in developing several policy proposals and technical amendments, with a view of making the rules simpler and easier for taxpayers to comply with, that now should be subject to public consultation. 4. We seek your approval to publicly consult on these proposals. 5. The draft officials’ issues paper seeks submissions on : 5.1 Allowing GST-registered persons to elect capital assets not to be subject to GST. 5.2 Introducing a principal purpose test for assets worth less than $5,000, whereby an asset purchased for predominant business use will receive full input deduction. 5.3 Establishing a 20% margin rule for assets worth more than $5,000, whereby businesses would not be required to make annual apportionment adjustments unless their business use of the asset has significantly changed. 5.4 Introducing new rounding-based rules for assets that h ave less than 20% or more than 80% of taxable use, so they are effectively not subject to the apportionment rules. 5.5 Proposing technical changes to the definitions of residential and commercial accommodation services, to provide more certainty to various commercial situations. 5.6 Exploring potentially treating houses as fully private assets and GST exempt on sale. 5.7 Simplifying the rules for residential property developers, while encouraging land to be developed within a reasonable timeframe. 5.8 A number of other technical improvements that will reduce compliance costs.

If you agree to the recommendations in this report, the next step is to obtain Cabinet’s approval to release the officials’ issues paper for public consultation. A draft Cabinet paper is attached for lodgement with the Cabinet Office by 10.00am Thursday 3 February 2022, for consideration by the Economic Development Committee the following Wednesday 9 February 2022. 10. The Treasury has been consulted in the preparation of this report. s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2021/510: Public release of an officials’ issue paper on the GST apportionment and adjustment rules Page 3 of 9 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Recommended action We recommend that you: Recommendations Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue (a) note the contents of the attached draft Cabinet paper and draft GST apportionment and adjustment rules officials’ issues paper Noted Noted (b) note the draft officials’ issues paper is subject to minor technical and editorial changes Noted Noted (c) (d) (e) approve and lodge the attached Cabinet paper and draft officials’ issues paper to the Cabinet Office, for consideration by the Cabinet Economic Development Committee N/A Approved and lodged Graeme Morrison Policy Lead, Indirect Tax Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Hon Grant Robertson Hon David Parker Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue / /2021 / /2021 s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2021/510: Public release of an officials’ issue paper on the GST apportionment and adjustment rules Page 4 of 9 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Background 11. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a 15% tax on the consumption of most goods and services supplied to New Zealand consumers. To prevent businesses bearing the burden of GST, GST-registered businesses can claim back GST paid on their purchases (known as an input tax deduction), provided these goods and services are used in their business. 12. However, some businesses purchase goods and services that are used in both their business, known as taxable use, such as a delivery van supplying courier services during the week, and for private use 1 , such as recreational use of the van in the weekend. Where the good or service has been used both for taxable use and non- taxable use, then the business must apportion the input tax deduction based on the estimated percentage of taxable use. This is known as apportionment. 13. Once the business has apportioned their input tax deduction based on their estimated taxable use, they are required to monitor their actual use of the asset over time (often several years). I f their estimated use is inaccurate, then this must be accounted for in their GST return. This is known as adjustment or change in use. 14. The goal of the apportionment rules is to ensure that GST is collected on the portion of the good or service’s use that is not for making taxable supplies, as would be the outcome if the asset was bought outright for non-taxable use. Calls to reform the apportionment and adjustment rules 15. As outlined in our earlier report (IR2021/060 refers), p ublic submissions received on proposed technical amendments to the apportionment rules in the 2020 GST Policy Issues: an officials’ issues paper were that in many situations, the existing rules are complex and impose unreasonable compliance costs, and that more substantial reform was required. 16. Submissions received on the 2020 GST Policy Issues: an officials’ issues paper made it clear that substantial reform of the apportionment and adjustment rules is a priority. Submitters said the focus needs to be creating rules that are simpler and practical to apply, especially for small and medium-sized businesses. 17. Importantly, reform to the apportionment and adjustment rules was the number one issue identified by private sector stakeholders in the recent GST system stewardship review. A redesign of the existing rules is required to ensure they support emerging commercial practices, such as the gig and sharing economy. 18. Since our earlier report we have been regularly engaging with key stakeholders, such as private sector GST advisors, to discuss what reform options are available. This has included removing assets from the apportionment rules and reducing the need for annual monitoring by businesses. 19. The four significant proposals are further explained in this report. The election method 20. It is proposed that a GST-registered business can elect whether to exclude certain capital assets 2 from GST. An election to exclude the asset would have the same GST outcome as the scenario where an asset was purchased by an unregistered person - no GST input claimed, no GST charged on sale or disposal. T he proposal 1 Or for making GST-exempt supplies. 2 Such as private homes, holiday homes and other mainly private and appreciating assets. IR2021/510: Public release of an officials’ issue paper on the GST apportionment and adjustment rules Page 5 of 9 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] would apply to capital improvements and would exclude certain assets such as trading stock. 21. It is anticipated that historically, many affected taxpayers have not claimed input tax deductions on predominantly private assets, and so potentially this method could be applied retrospectively (where no inputs have been claimed on existing assets). 22. This proposal seeks to resolve a current concern of Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand and private sector tax advisors known as the “farmhouse or home- office issue” whereby predominately private properties have be en used to support a taxable activity ( including where some have only claimed GST input deductions on the property’s operating expenses) but can unexpectedly result in the whole property being subject to GST on sale (including any capital gain). The current rules are complex and unfair, with stakeholders seeking a policy solution to this issue with some urgency. 23. The effectiveness of the election method will ultimately depend on the extent to which taxpayers choose to use it. If take-up is high, then the election method would remove GST liabilities from mainly private assets and reduce compliance costs; however, if take-up is low, then the benefits are not likely to be realised. 24. It is expected that stakeholders will be supportive of this proposal, as it will allow predominantly private capital assets to be kept outside the GST base. Principal purpose test for low-value assets 25. It is proposed that a principal purpose test would apply for assets that cost less than $5,000 (excluding GST). For example, if the asset was purchased for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies, then a full input tax deduction could be claimed, and the asset would effectively not be subject to the apportionment rules 3 . A $5,000 limit means the maximum GST adjustment would be $750 per asset. 26. It is expected that stakeholders will be supportive of this proposal, as it will reduce compliance costs as well as aligning the law to reflect current commercial practices. 20 percent margin rule and rounding rules for near exclusive business or private use 27. It is proposed that a +/-20% margin (or buffer) is applied to a chosen apportionment percentage, for assets that are not subject to the principal purpose test. Essentially, the mix of taxable use and non-taxable use can move freely within this range without consequence. The GST-registered person would only make an adjustment if the change in use was greater than 20%. 28. For example, if an asset had an initial apportionment of 66% business use, then an adjustment would only be made if the business use dropped below 46% (-20%) or increased above 86% (+20%). 29. Additionally, it is proposed that rounding rules apply to assets not subject to the principal purpose test, that have an overwhelming taxable or non-taxable use. Where an asset has a taxable use of 80% or more, then the asset’s taxable use would be rounded up to 100%. This rounding-up rule would be taxpayer-friendly 3 U nless the asset then became no longer principally used to make taxable supplies – then the input would be repaid. IR2021/510: Public release of an officials’ issue paper on the GST apportionment and adjustment rules Page 6 of 9 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] because businesses would receive full input tax deductions; whilst allowing a limited amount of private use (such as most work-related vehicles). 30. Likewise, where an asset has a taxable use of 20% or less, then the asset’s taxable use would be rounded down to 0%, meaning the GST-registered person would treat the asset like a private asset. It is anticipated that this rule would remove most residential property that has limited taxable use (such as a home office or farmhouse). If a dwelling has higher than 20 percent taxable use, but still has mainly private use (such as a holiday home rented to guests and used privately) it could be removed from GST on sale by using the election method discussed above. 31. It is expected that stakeholders will be supportive of the proposal, as it will effectively remove assets that are 80% or more taxable or private from the apportionment rules. Rules for residential property developers 32. Currently, GST apportionment rules are complex to apply if land that is being developed by a residential property developer also has some non-taxable use (such as owner-occupier or an on-going residential tenancy) before the improved property is sold. 33. The issues paper proposes to simplify the rules, whereby GST-registered property developers would no longer apply the apportionment rules and instead claim a full input tax deduction for the purchase of the land and for other capital development costs once their development activity had commenced. This simplification proposal is expected to be supported by stakeholders. 34. Another issue is that currently, Inland Revenue can have difficulty distinguishing between GST-registered persons who are bona fide property developers and those who intend to develop land. Both groups claim input tax deductions when purchasing the land but some ultimately don’t commence the development or don’t sell the developed property. This represents a fiscal risk as large GST deductions / refunds are paid on purchase, but no subsequent GST is collected as the land is ultimately not improved and sold. 35. The issues paper proposes potential timing and information changes which could reduce this risk, whilst also encouraging land to be developed and sold in a reasonable timeframe (such as 36 months with an ability to apply to Inland Revenue for an extension). 36. Where the developer has an established property development business, they would continue to receive their input deduction at the time of purchase, however the issues paper proposes that other first-time or small-scale developers could have to wait until their development activity has commenced (rather than claiming deductions at the time the land is purchased as per current rules). 37. This delay may negatively impact their cash flow. Stakeholders are likely to raise concerns about this proposal because developers use the input tax deduction to partly fund the purchase and/or initial development costs. 38. Stakeholders may also raise concerns with the proposed deadline for developing and selling the land, given some property developers prefer to hold land until it is commercially suitable to undertake the development activity. The consultation process will allow us to better refine the proposals towards areas of concern, while mitigating unintended consequences.

The officials’ issues paper also includes several proposed changes that seek to reduce compliance costs for businesses. These issues are listed below, under the same headings and in the same order as in the officials’ issues paper. These are: 39.1 Accommodation services supplied in dwellings and commercial dwellings. 39.2 Sale of a dwelling an exempt or separate supply. 39.3 Reduce the required number of adjustment periods. 39.4 Expand the wash-up rule eligibility. 39.5 Repeal the mixed-use asset rules in section 20G; Repeal the concurrent use of land rules in section 21E. 39.6 Allowing a wider range of apportionment methods to be approved by Inland Revenue. Consultation 40. The Treasury has been consulted in the preparation of this report. 41. The Ministry of Housing and Urban Development has been consulted on the proposals and has not raised any concerns. We will continue to work with the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development before seeking final policy decisions. 42. We have also had preliminary discussions with several private sector GST advisors and the Chartered Accountants of Australia and New Zealand, where they have provided feedback and advice on various policy issues and proposals. We intend to continue to meet with stakeholders after the officials’ issues paper has been released for public consultation, as part of developing final policy decisions. s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2021/510: Public release of an officials’ issue paper on the GST apportionment and adjustment rules Page 8 of 9 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Timing of the officials’ issues paper 48.

\[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Economic Development Committee GST APPORTIONMENT: AN OFFICIALS’ ISSUES PAPER Proposal 1. This paper seeks the Cabinet Economic Development Committee’s agreement to the re lease of an officials’ issues paper GST apportionment and adjustment rules, which is attached. The consultation document discusses policy issues with the existing goods and services tax (GST) apportionment and adjustment rules and suggests potential solutions. 2. I seek Cabinet’s approval for the officials’ issues paper to be finalised and publicly re leased for consultation. Subject to Cabinet’s approval, I plan to direct officials as to when the officials’ issues paper should be released for consultation. Relation to Government Priorities 3. This proposal supports the Government’s Fiscal Strategy 1 and the following workstream in the Government’s 2021–22 tax policy work programme: Maintaining the tax system: tax legislation needs to be regularly maintained and updated in response to changing technology and business practices. It is important that the tax legislation reflects the principles of fairness and certainty. 4. The attached officials’ issues paper supports this workstream as the proposed policy o ptions it consults on seek to update the existing GST rules to improve fairness, reduce compliance costs and better reflect commercial practices. Executive Summary 5. Goods and Services Tax is a consumption tax on most goods and services which are su pplied by registered persons (such as businesses), at a single rate of 15%, under the Goods and Services Act 1985 (“GST Act”). A GST registered taxpayer can claim GST input tax deductions on purchases of assets (such as buildings and vehicles) that they intend to use in their business. 6. Where the asset is used both for business use and for private use (or making exempt su pplies), then the taxpayer can only deduct a percentage of the total deduction, based on their estimate of the percentage of business use. This is known as apportionment. 7. Once the taxpayer has apportioned their input tax deduction based on their e stimated business use, they are required to monitor their actual use of the asset 1 See https://treasury.govt.nz/publications/wellbeing-budget/wellbeing-budget-2019-html#section-13 1 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 12:46:57 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] over time, and if their estimate is inaccurate, then the taxpayer must account for this difference in their GST return, annually. This is known as an adjustment or change in use. 8. The current GST apportionment and adjustment rules are complex and have high compliance costs. Submissions on the February 2020 GST policy issues paper suggested the current apportionment rules should be replaced with simpler rules. Additionally, the recent stewardship review of the GST system identified the apportionment and adjustment rules as the number one issue that needed revision. 9. In recent months, my officials have met with key stakeholders such as private sector G ST advisors to discuss what practical reform options are available, for inclusion into an officials’ issues paper. 10. The attached officials’ issues paper consults on options for simplifying the rules. To a ddress some of the gaps and weaknesses of each option, it is likely that a combination of potential solutions will be required, as a reform package. The policy options in the officials’ issues paper include: 10.1 Allowing GST registered businesses to elect that their capital assets not be su bject to GST on sale, by not claiming input tax deductions when the asset is purchased (the election method). 10.2 Introducing a simple p rincipal purpose test for assets purchased for less than $5,000 (GST exclusive), where for assets which are principally acquired for business purposes the business would claim a full GST input tax deduction (rather than applying the apportionment rules). 10.3 A 2 0% margin rule, whereby GST registered businesses would no longer be required to make annual adjustments unless their business use of the asset has significantly changed (by more than 20 percent). 10.4 Introducing r ounding-based rules for assets purchased for $5,000 or more (GST exclusive), that seek to remove most assets from the apportionment and adjustment rules: 10.4.1 Assets with 80% or more of business use would be deemed to have 1 00% business use, allowing the taxpayer to claim full input tax deductions while having a small amount of private or exempt use. 10.4.2 Likewise, assets with 20% or less of business use would be deemed to have 0% business use and consequently the asset is treated like a private asset. 10.5 Several potential, technical changes to the d efinitions of residential and commercial accommodation services, which are more certain and easier to apply to various commercial situations, than the existing definitions. 10.6 Discussing if special GST rules should apply to the sale of houses ( and other types of dwellings), whereby these could be treated as fully private assets and GST exempt on sale, unless the house has been built or developed by a property developer for sale. 2 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 12:46:57 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 10.7 Several proposals aimed at simplifying the rules for residential property developers, whilst also encouraging land to be developed and sold sooner (generally within 36 months). 10.8 As well, the paper also contains s everal minor changes to the apportionment and adjustment rules that seek to reduce compliance costs for GST registered businesses. 11. The estimated overall fiscal impact of the potential solutions is uncertain as it d epends on which options are progressed and how they compare to current taxpayer practices. 12. Subject to Cabinet’s approval, officials will release the issues paper to seek feedback o n these potential solutions. Following public consultation, I will report back to Cabinet with recommended policy decisions and their estimated fiscal implications. These decisions could apply from the 2022/23 fiscal year onwards. Background 13. Goods and Services Tax is a 15% consumption tax on most goods and services su pplied to New Zealand consumers by registered persons (such as businesses). To ensure GST is not a cost on business production, businesses can claim back GST input tax deductions on purchases of goods and services they use in their business. 14. However, where the asset is used both for business use (known as taxable use), su ch as a van delivering packages during the week, and for private use, such as recreational use of the van in the weekend (or making exempt supplies), then the taxpayer must apportion (by way of a percentage) the total deduction, based on their estimate of the percentage of taxable use. This is to ensure GST is collected on the portion of the asset’s private use, as would be the outcome if it was bought outright for non-business use. 15. Once the taxpayer has apportioned their input tax deduction based on their e stimated business use of the asset, they are required to monitor their actual use over time. If there is a difference in the actual use, then an adjustment to the original apportionment percentage is required and the change included in their GST return. 16. Public submissions received on the February 2020 G ST Policy Issues: an officials’ issues paper explained that in many situations, the current rules are complex and impose unreasonable compliance costs. The recent stewardship review of the GST system identified the apportionment and adjustment rules as the number one issue that needed revision. Stakeholders were clear that the existing apportionment rules needed to change. A redesign of the existing rules is required to ensure they support emerging commercial practices, such as the gig and sharing economy. 17. Last year, my officials met with key stakeholders such as private sector GST a dvisors to discuss what simpler, practical options could be further explored, for inclusion into an officials’ issues paper. 3 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 12:46:57 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 18. Several reform options have been identified and are further explained below. Many of the proposed options seek to remove most assets from the apportionment rules and reduce the need for annual monitoring by GST registered businesses. 19. These policy options have been included in the attached officials’ issues paper, G ST apportionment and adjustment rules. Resolving these issues would reduce compliance costs for taxpayers while ensuring GST is continues to be collected on the private consumption of goods and services. GST apportionment and adjustment rules: An officials’ issues paper The election method 20. The UK and Singapore’s GST rules allow taxpayers to exclude assets from being subject to the apportionment rules, and GST on sale, by choosing not to claim an input tax deduction at the time of purchase. The issues paper proposes a similar election method could be introduced in New Zealand. Taxpayers would be electing to be taxed on the asset as if it only had private use. 21. Officials anticipate the method would mainly be applied to residential land and d wellings which may have some minor business use (e.g. a home office or workshop). This would ensure GST registered sole traders are not disadvantaged compared to other types of ownership structures where houses and other private assets are usually held by a different person to the entity which is GST registered. 22. It is anticipated that historically, many of the affected taxpayers (e.g. GST registered so le traders) have not claimed input tax deductions on assets that are predominantly private (e.g. the family home with a home office), and so this method could be applied retrospectively, that is, where no input tax deductions have been claimed on existing assets, then these assets would not be subject to GST on sale. This should be positively received by taxpayers that could otherwise, under the existing rules, be subject to GST on sale despite not previously claiming input tax deductions. 23. The issues paper also proposes an option whereby taxpayers that have previously cl aimed input tax deductions on their assets could repay these input tax deductions within 12 months of the reforms taking effect, and in return, their existing assets would not be subject to GST on sale in the future. Principal purpose test for assets less than $5,000 24. Another proposed option consulted on in the issues paper is that businesses could claim a full GST input tax deduction (rather than apportioning the deduction) for any asset costing less than $5,000 (GST exclusive) which they principally acquired for business purposes. 25. This test would reduce compliance costs for taxpayers by greatly reducing the n umber of assets subject to the apportionment and adjustment rules. Instead, a GST adjustment would only be made if the principal purpose that the asset was acquired for changed (which would be uncommon). 26. It is anticipated that many GST registered businesses may already be claiming full i nput tax deductions on low-value business assets (on the basis that these assets 4 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 12:46:57 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] have no or very little private use), rather than applying the existing apportionment and adjustment rules. 20% margin for assets above $5,000 27. For higher value assets it is proposed that rather than being required to make annual GST adjustments if there is any increase or decrease in business use, the taxpayer would only make an adjustment if the change in use of the asset was greater than 20%. 28. For example, if an asset had an initial apportionment of 66% business use, then an a djustment would only be made if the business use dropped below 46% (-20%) or increased above 86% (+20%). 29. A 20% threshold has been proposed as it is understood that for an asset to e xperience a 20% change in use, then it is likely a deliberate change in use of the asset has occurred, rather than an unintended change. Consequently, a 20% threshold should remove most compliance costs associated with closely monitoring the use of each asset, and from being required to file adjustments each year. Deeming rules for assets that are almost exclusively taxable or private 30. Another simplification option proposed is that where an asset that cost more $5,000 (GST exclusive) that has at least an 80% taxable use, it could be rounded up and deemed to have 100% taxable use. 31. This would be a taxpayer-friendly rule because businesses could receive full input tax deductions, whilst allowing a limited amount of private use (such as for most work-related vehicles). 32. Likewise, where an asset has 20% or less taxable use, then the asset would be d eemed to have no taxable use (0%) and therefore treated like a private asset (GST is collected on purchase, but not when the asset is subsequently sold). 33. Essentially, under both of these rules, qualifying assets would be effectively removed f rom the GST apportionment and adjustment rules entirely. Changes to the definition of residential and commercial accommodation services 34. GST apportionment issues can arise when the same premises is used to make both taxable supplies of commercial accommodation (e.g. a hotel) and non-taxable supplies such as private use or exempt supplies (e.g. a live-in hotel manager). 35. The GST treatment in such cases depends on the definitions of “dwelling” and “co mmercial dwelling” which can overlap and be uncertain. 36. The issues paper outlines several potential, technical-based amendments to the existing definitions, as well as seeking submissions on whether any alternative definitions could be developed which could provide more certainty or be easier to apply than the existing definitions. 5 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 12:46:57 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Special GST rules for sales of houses 37. The GST system does not tax most private assets such as houses and dwellings. This is because they are not usually used by a GST registered business to conduct their business. However, some GST registered sole traders may use part of their home such as a home office or workshop to conduct their business which can cause the sale of that home to become subject to GST, even though it is mostly used for private purposes. 38. One way that other countries have addressed this is by making the sale of houses (a nd other types of dwellings) an exempt supply, unless the house has been built or developed by a property developer for sale. 39. The issues paper discusses a potential exemption and notes that the other reform o ptions discussed above may be a simpler way to remove GST compliance costs and liabilities on private houses which have some business use. The feedback received from a small group of tax advisors, was that developing a specific exemption for houses may not be necessary and would require some new definitions to be developed which would add complexity and uncertainty to the GST rules for land. Land which is developed and sold by property developers 40. Land that is developed and sold by a GST registered property developer would remain subject to GST to ensure the GST system correctly taxes the value-added from this activity. This rule would apply regardless of any of the other proposals discussed in the issues paper. 41. However, the current GST apportionment rules are complex to apply if land that is b eing developed to be sold by a GST registered residential property developer, also has some non-taxable use (such as owner-occupation of the existing dwelling or an on-going residential tenancy) during the period of the registered person’s ownership. 42. The issues paper consults on a proposed simplification, whereby GST registered p roperty developers would claim a full input tax deduction for the purchase the land and for other capital development costs once their development activity had commenced, instead of applying the apportionment rules. 43. This proposal could encourage more efficient use of housing. For example, property d evelopers may currently prefer vacant properties (to get a full input tax deduction and simpler GST compliance) than letting the house to a residential tenant (e.g. by maintaining an existing tenancy or entering a new one) until the house is ready to be developed or sold (as this non-taxable use would mean GST apportionment would apply to the land). 44. Another issue is that under the current GST rules, Inland Revenue can have difficulty d istinguishing between registered persons who are bona fide property developers and those who intend to develop land. Both groups claim input tax deductions when purchasing the land but some ultimately don’t commence the development or don’t sell the land. This represents a fiscal risk as large GST deductions / refunds are claimed on purchase, but no subsequent GST is collected as the land is not ultimately developed or sold. 6 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 12:46:57 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 45. The issues paper consults on some potential timing and information changes which could reduce this risk, whilst also encouraging land to be developed and sold in a reasonable timeframe. 46. Currently, a GST registered person can claim an input tax deduction at the time they p urchase land. Under the proposed option, if a GST registered person had an existing business of developing land for sale they would still be able to claim an input tax deduction at the time of purchase. 47. However, if they did not have an existing land development business (e.g. a first time d eveloper) they would not initially be able to claim an input tax deduction for the cost of the land. Once they begin developing the property and have an intention to sell the property when they finish this development, they would then be able to claim a full input tax deduction on the purchase price of the property in their next GST return (rather than apportioning the deduction). 48. This proposed change could have negative cashflow implications for some smaller or f irst-time property developers as it would delay when they are able to claim a GST deduction from the date of purchase to the date development commenced. However, it could also encourage the development to commence sooner (rather than simply holding the land). 49. The issues paper also proposes a time limit could be introduced so if a registered person claims a full input tax deduction for land under the proposed new residential property development rules, they will generally need to sell the land within 36 months of the deduction being claimed. The GST registered developer could apply to Inland Revenue for an extension to this time limit if they can provide evidence that they have actually developed the property (or are continuing to develop it) and intend to sell the property within a certain timeframe. 50. To support compliance with the new rules, the issues paper also proposes that GST re gistered taxpayers would be required to provide certain information to Inland Revenue when they have claimed input tax deductions on land (as well as luxury yachts or aircraft) as this information will assist Inland Revenue to monitor if these taxpayers account for GST on any subsequent non-taxable use, or when the asset is sold. 51. Stakeholders may raise concerns with some of these proposals. The consultation p rocess will allow officials to better refine the proposals towards areas of concern, while mitigating unintended consequences. Other potential simplification changes to the existing rules 52. Finally, the issues paper contains several minor and incremental improvements to the existing apportionment rules. These include allowing taxpayers to make an adjustment for a permanent change in use in a wider range of circumstances and 12 months earlier than the current rules; and repealing certain special rules for land and mixed-use assets because the policy solutions contained in the officials’ issues paper would supersede them. 7 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 12:46:57 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Implementation 53. The proposals in the officials’ issues paper would require legislative amendments to the Inland Revenue Acts. Several proposals would also require the affected GST registered persons to disclose information to Inland Revenue on certain purchases of land. 54. The purpose of the issues paper is to seek feedback on the proposals, including i mplementation implications, which will be reported back to Cabinet when final policy decisions are sought. Financial Implications 55. There are no financial implications associated with releasing the GST apportionment a nd adjustment rules, officials’ issues paper. However, if following public consultation certain policy options are progressed, then their introduction will likely have an impact on forecast Crown revenue. If these options have a net fiscal cost, then consideration will be given to funding the changes through the Tax Policy Scorecard. Any final policy decisions are likely to be effective from the 2022/23 fiscal year onwards at the earliest. Legislative Implications 56. The decision to consult on the various GST proposals do not give rise to any i mmediate legislative implications. If, following consultation, Cabinet decides to implement the changes contained in the officials’ issues paper, enabling legislation will be required. Proposals could be included in an omnibus tax bill in late 2022. Impact Analysis Regulatory Impact Assessment 57. The Regulatory Impact Analysis panel at Inland Revenue has reviewed and confirmed that the GST apportionment and adjustment rules officials’ issues paper can substitute for an interim Regulatory Impact Statement. It will lead to effective consultation and support the eventual development of a quality Regulatory Impact Statement. Climate Implications of Policy Assessment 58. The Climate Implications of Policy Assessment (CIPA) team has been consulted and confirms that the CIPA requirements do not apply to this proposal as the threshold for significance is not met. Population Implications 59. Releasing the issues paper does not have any population implications. Any populations implications resulting from the proposals will be included in final policy advice to Cabinet following consultation. 8 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 12:46:57 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Human Rights 60. The issues contained in the officials’ issues paper and their policy solutions do not give rise to any human rights implications. Consultation 61. The attached officials’ issues paper has been prepared by Inland Revenue. 62. The Treasury and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development have been co nsulted about the policy options in this cabinet paper and the attached officials’ issues paper. Communications 63. Subject to Cabinet’s approval, I will direct officials as to when the officials’ issues p aper should be published for consultation on Inland Revenue’s website. Proactive Release 64. I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key a dvice papers, with appropriate redactions, within 30 working days of the release of the officials’ issues paper. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Committee: 1. Note t hat a number of policy issues have been identified with the existing GST apportionment and adjustment rules; 2. Note t hat the attached officials’ issues paper, consults on a range of options for simplifying the existing apportionment and adjustment rules, including: 2.1 Allowing GST registered businesses to elect capital assets not be subject to GST on purchase or sale (the election method) 2.2 Introducing a p rincipal purpose test for assets purchased for less than $5,000 (GST exclusive), where an asset that is principally acquired for business purposes would claim a full GST input tax deduction 2.3 Introducing a 20% margin rule, whereby GST registered businesses would no longer make annual adjustments unless their business or private use of the asset has significantly changed (by more than 20%) 2.4 Introducing r ounding-based rules for assets that are close to being either fully taxable (80% or more taxable use) or fully non-taxable (20% or less taxable use) 2.5 Potential options for improving the d efinitions of residential and commercial accommodation services 9 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 12:46:57 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 2.6 Discussing if special rules should apply to the sale of houses and other types of dwellings, where they are treated as fully private assets and GST exempt on sale by a registered person other than a property developer 2.7 Potential options for s implifying the GST apportionment rules for residential property developers whilst also encouraging land to be developed and sold sooner 2.8 Other m inor and incremental improvements that seek to reduce compliance costs for GST registered businesses and remove rules that are superseded by policy options outlined in the officials’ issues paper; 3.

This report seeks your agreement to the development of a discussion document which would consult on options for making it easier for operators in the sharing economy to comply with their tax obligations. The discussion document would consult on whether New Zealand should implement options identified by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in its recent work on the tax implications of the gig and sharing economy. The report also informs you of the OECD’s work and officials’ initial views in relation to some of the options identified. Background 2. In IR2021/060 we outlined the GST policy work programme to you. One of the items included on the GST policy work programme was reviewing New Zealand’s GST system in the context of the gig and sharing economy. We noted in that report that officials would review both the GST and income tax implications for those operating in the gig and sharing economy and whether there were any improvements which could be made. This project does not, however, consider the taxation of digital service providers (such as Google and Facebook) which is a separate piece of work. 3. There is no standardised definition of the gig and sharing economy. Broadly, the gig and sharing economy refers to economic activity which involves the connection of buyers and sellers through the internet (and more specifically, digital apps) that enable people or businesses to share, sell, or rent property, resources, time, or skills. 4. Common examples of sharing economy activities include the provision of short-stay accommodation through apps like AirBnb and Bookabach, ride-sharing services through apps like Uber and Ola, and personal services through apps like Airtasker and JobHop. Organisations that facilitate the connection between buyers and sellers through these services are known as digital platforms. 5. Under existing tax rules, those who earn income through the sharing economy are required to pay tax on their profits, and charge and collect GST on supplies of goods and services made in New Zealand provided they expect to turn over more than $60,000 in a 12-month period. In this regard, those who earn income through the sharing economy are treated no differently to those who conduct their business through other (more traditional) methods. 6. The rapid growth and popularity of the sharing economy has led the OECD to review the role of digital platforms as facilitators of the sharing economy, and the VAT/GST implications for those operating in the sharing economy. These reviews have manifested themselves in recent reports produced by the OECD, namely: 6.1 Model Rules for Reporting by Platform Operators with respect to Sellers in the Sharing and Gig Economy, and 6.2 The Impact and Growth of the Sharing and Gig Economy on VAT/GST Policy and Administration. IR2021/182: Taxation of the gig and sharing economy Page 2 of 5 7. These reports have recently been published (with the GST report being released in the last few weeks) and provide policymakers with options that could be considered in the context of their tax systems. We can provide your office with copies of these reports if you like, but we have summarised the main points below. 8. In terms of the policy problem and opportunity in the context of this work, there are two main drivers. First, we have concerns with the compliance of sellers on sharing economy platforms in terms of both their income tax and GST obligations. There are opportunities to improve compliance across the board if rules are implemented which provide Inland Revenue with greater access to information about the activities of taxpayers’ incomes through digital platforms. Second, the primary objective of New Zealand’s GST system is to raise revenue through the taxation of goods and services supplied in New Zealand. The emergence of the gig and sharing economy has resulted in a significant number of low-value suppliers who operate below the GST registration threshold. This results in a significant amount of untaxed consumption in New Zealand, which creates a competitive disadvantage for other suppliers of goods and services who are charging GST. Publications from the OECD Model Rules for Reporting by Platform Operators with respect to Sellers in the Sharing and Gig Economy – published in July 2020 9. The OECD developed and published Model Rules for Reporting by Platform Operators with respect to Sellers in the Sharing and Gig Economy (the Model Rules). These rules address an issue that tax administrations can usually only use their information request powers to obtain data held within their own jurisdiction, but most of the relevant data held by multinational digital platforms will be located in foreign jurisdictions. 10. We expect that most OECD countries will implement these rules in the next few years. If New Zealand were to implement the rules, Inland Revenue would collect, share, and receive information about sellers from tax administrations in other countries that had implemented the rules. 11. Inland Revenue would collect information from New Zealand headquartered digital platforms, and that information would relate to the activities of all sellers on that platform. Inland Revenue would then share this information with other tax administrations whose countries had also implemented the rules. Inland Revenue would also receive information from other countries, and this information could be used for compliance purposes – that is, Inland Revenue could cross-check taxpayers’ returns with the information provided by the digital platforms, to ensure that sales revenues were being declared. 12. The Model Rules were developed with input from major digital platforms, who recognised the benefit in an internationally agreed solution, which reduces compliance costs for platforms who do not want to develop different systems for all the various countries in which they operate. 13. Officials consider implementing the Model Rules in New Zealand would provide Inland Revenue with better information that could be used for compliance purposes. It is unlikely that the information could be used to pre-fill taxpayers’ returns because the information would be provided on a calendar-year basis. Implementation of the Model Rules in a New Zealand context would therefore arguably be less effective than bespoke rules, but bespoke rules would, in light of the OECD’s Model Rules, not likely be welcomed by the digital platforms due to the increased compliance costs associated. IR2021/182: Taxation of the gig and sharing economy Page 3 of 5 The Impact and Growth of the Sharing and Gig Economy on VAT/GST Policy and Administration - published in April 2021 14. The report on the Impact and Growth of the Sharing and Gig Economy on VAT/GST Policy and Administration identifies a broad range of options that countries could consider implementing in their domestic legislation. The report, which involved significant contributions from several digital platforms, focuses mainly on what role the digital platforms themselves could play in a GST context, with a focus being on platforms operating in the accommodation and transportation sectors. 15. The options are broad and range from requiring digital platforms to perform an educational role (which could see the platforms educate and assist sellers with their tax obligations), formal cooperation agreements (which would see protocols for information-sharing between platforms and tax administrations), through to requiring digital platforms to collect and withhold tax on behalf of their sellers. 16. Officials’ initial views are that there is a strong case for amending New Zealand’s GST rules so that digital platforms account for GST on behalf of the sales made through their platforms. This would put those operating through the sharing economy on a more even-footing with traditional suppliers of similar services (such as those in the taxi and hotel industries) and could reduce competition issues. Options would need to be developed to ensure that the sellers were able to claim back GST on their costs, as many sellers in the sharing economy may not be registered for GST because they operate below the $60,000 registration threshold. 17. This option of making the digital platforms account for GST would also be consistent with the marketplace rules that apply to digital platforms which arrange sales of remote services (such as smartphone apps and online streaming services) or low- value imported goods (such as AliExpress). These marketplace rules have been a key component to the success of these earlier 2016 and 2019 reforms in efficiently collecting GST. Other international developments 18. In light of the rise of the sharing economy, several countries have either announced an intention to make changes to their tax settings, or have already made changes. 19. In Austria, digital platforms are subject to documentation and notification requirements which require them to produce the Austrian tax administration with information about sellers’ activities on their platform on request. If digital platforms do not comply, they can be liable for the VAT obligations if the provider of the service does not comply with their VAT obligations. 20. Similarly, in Canada, all money made from participation in the sharing economy is subject to income tax and may be subject to GST. The Canadian Government recently announced changes to their GST rules which ensure that all short-stay accommodation provided through an online platform is subject to GST, with GST being charged and remitted to the Canadian tax authority by the online platform. Ride-sharing is already subject to GST in Canada under existing rules which require all ride-sharing drivers to register for GST. 21. The United Kingdom released a Call for Evidence in December 2020. It sought feedback from submitters on the UK Government’s assessment of the VAT challenges created by the sharing economy. No specific proposals were contained in the Call for Evidence. A summary of submissions and next steps is expected towards the end of the month. 22. Officials have had an initial discussion about the issues and options noted in this paper with the Australian Taxation Office. At this stage no announcements have been made by the Australian Government in light of the OECD’s recent work. IR2021/182: Taxation of the gig and sharing economy Page 4 of 5 Future discussion document 23. Subject to your agreement, officials will prepare a discussion document which would, subject to Cabinet approval, seek feedback on proposals to change New Zealand’s tax rules to make it easier for those operating in the gig and sharing economy to comply with their tax obligations. 24. In particular, the discussion document would also seek submitters’ views on amending New Zealand’s GST rules so that the digital platforms themselves would be liable to account for GST on sales made through their platforms (with GST on expenses incurred by the platform operators being claimable through the usual GST return process for the sellers). Officials consider this is justifiable from a GST policy perspective on the basis that it puts those operating in the gig and sharing economy on an equal footing with more traditional suppliers of the same kind of goods and services. 25. It would seek submitters’ views on whether New Zealand should implement the OECD’s Model Rules. Several prominent digital platforms were involved by the OECD in the development of the rules, and have stressed the benefits of keeping the rules consistent across countries which would reduce the compliance costs for digital platforms who do not want to build different reporting systems for each country that they operate in. 26. Officials consider implementation of the Model Rules in New Zealand would be an improvement over the status quo (where Inland Revenue only receives information from digital platforms on an ad-hoc, as-requested basis) but are of the view that implementation of the rules will not make taxpayer experiences as seamless as they could be in the event bespoke rules for New Zealand were developed. The discussion document would seek submitters’ views on their preferences, but we note that departure from internationally agreed rules would likely not be welcomed by the digital platforms. 27. The discussion document would also consult on whether there are any other opportunities which could be considered in the context of making it easier for those operating in the gig and sharing economy to comply with their income tax obligations. 28. Feedback following the discussion document could then be used to shape final policy recommendations which could be included in a future taxation bill. Officials note that based on experiences in implementing changes to the taxation of remote services and low-value imported goods, digital platforms need sufficient lead-in time to make changes to their systems to be compliant with any new rules. This was also stressed by the digital platforms in discussions at the OECD. 29. Officials note that any changes in this space are likely to be fiscally positive on the basis that they will contribute to improving the general tax compliance of those operating in the gig and sharing economy, and could result in an increase of GST if amendments were made to bring within the GST system all sales made through digital platforms.

This report seeks your agreement to the release of the attached discussion document on the role of digital platforms in the taxation of the gig and sharing economy. It follows Inland Revenue report IR2021/182 where you agreed officials report back this year with options to include in a discussion document in relation to the taxation of the gig and sharing economy. Background 2. The taxation of the gig and sharing economy is included on the Government’s current tax policy work programme. The gig and sharing economy refers to economic activity facilitated through digital platforms (commonly referred to as mobile apps) that connect buyers with sellers who share their skills, labour, and assets. Common examples include ridesharing services (through apps like Ola and Uber), short-stay accommodation (through apps like Airbnb and Bookabach), food delivery (through apps like Delivereasy), and freelance services (through apps like Fiverr). 3. There are no special tax rules for sellers in the gig and sharing economy. They are not employees, so have costs associated with complying with their tax obligations. These include being required to keep records of income and expenses, and potentially paying provisional tax and being required to account for GST. In this regard they are considered self-employed for tax purposes. 4. The gig and sharing economy is growing in popularity as it offers flexible working arrangements and an easy way to connect buyers and sellers. It is difficult to determine the size of the gig and sharing economy in New Zealand as Inland Revenue currently has no reliable data that confirms its size. This is a common problem for tax administrations globally. 5. Against this background, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) produced reports that outlined options for jurisdictions to consider implementing that would keep their tax systems fit -for -purpose. The attached discussion document includes discussion on these proposals. In particular, it seeks feedback on the following three areas: 5.1 Information reporting and exchange. The document seeks feedback on whether New Zealand should implement rules developed at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development or develop its own rules. The objective is to improve Inland Revenue’s visibility of income earned by New Zealand residents on (resident and non-resident) digital platforms. This is discussed further below. 5.2 How GST should apply. The document seeks feedback on whether GST should apply to all sales made through digital platforms in the gig and sharing economy. This is consistent with how GST applies to sales of remote services, and low-value imported goods, where electronic marketplaces have IR2021/460: Public release of a discussion document on the role of digital platforms in the taxation of the gig and sharing economy Page 2 of 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] an obligation to collect GST and return this to Inland Revenue. This supports the fairness and long-term sustainability of the GST system. 5.3 Measures to reduce compliance costs. Sellers who earn income through digital platforms in the gig and sharing economy have, when compared with employees, higher compliance costs associated with their tax affairs. The discussion document seeks feedback on measures that could be implemented which will reduce sellers’ compliance costs, such as whether it would be useful for Inland Revenue to determine standard cost deductions for sellers in particular industries. 6. The proposals discussed are consistent with measures being taken by other countries in this context. They are also consistent with the thinking included in outputs from the OECD. Information reporting and exchange 7. Inland Revenue receives regular income information from employers and financial institutions which it then uses to help pre-populate taxpayers’ income tax returns. This reduces taxpayers’ compliance costs, and also improves compliance because it reduces the likelihood that taxpayers will (either knowingly or not) not declare income. 8. Inland Revenue does not receive regular income information from digital platforms. It can, however, require digital platforms to provide income information using its information gathering powers. The use of these powers, however, lacks transparency and imposes high compliance costs on digital platforms. This problem is further exacerbated by the fact that many digital platforms operate in many different jurisdictions. This is a problem for tax administrations internationally. To address this problem the OECD, in consultation with several digital platforms, developed an information reporting and exchange framework. The OECD solution also ostensibly matches separate rules that European Union member countries are required to implement before the end of 2022. 9. The purpose of these rules is to improve tax administrations’ visibility of income earned by sellers on digital platforms, so that it can use this information for compliance purposes (for example, pre-filling taxpayer income tax returns), and to reduce compliance costs for digital platforms through a standardised set of rules that digital platforms can comply with instead of having to develop different information reporting systems for different jurisdictions. 10. If New Zealand implemented these rules, amendments to the Tax Administration Act would be needed to require digital platforms that were based in New Zealand to disclose to Inland Revenue income information about sellers on their platforms. The information being collected would relate to accommodation, personal and professional services, the sale of goods and vehicle rentals. 1 To the extent that this information related to New Zealand residents, Inland Revenue could use this information in its compliance functions. For accommodation, personal and professional services this could include pre-population of income tax returns. 2 11. Information relating to non-residents would need to be shared with that person’s tax administration, so they could use the information in their compliance functions. Inland Revenue would also receive information from other tax administrations in relation to income earned by New Zealanders on offshore digital platforms. 1 These areas were identified by the OECD as the largest areas of the gig and sharing economy internationally. 2 A person who sells goods (for example, a car or artwork) on a digital platform might not have a corresponding income tax obligation, so pre-population would not be proposed here. Officials understand vehicle rentals do not typically involve a buyer, a seller, and a digital platform in New Zealand, and so unless consultation suggests otherwise, this information also would not be used for pre-population of sellers’ income tax returns. IR2021/460: Public release of a discussion document on the role of digital platforms in the taxation of the gig and sharing economy Page 3 of 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 12. Income information would be reported on a calendar-year basis and the discussion document consults on several ways Inland Revenue could use the information, in particular given taxpayers are required to return income to a 31 March tax year. The options include an attribution method, which deems income earned through a digital platform to 31 December to be earned to 31 March; and a partial pre- population method, which would result in Inland Revenue pre-populating income tax returns for 9/12 months of the tax year. 13. In addition to consulting on whether New Zealand should implement the OECD rules, the discussion document also seeks feedback from submitters as to whether New Zealand should design and implement its own rules. Our current view is that the OECD rules are preferable to a bespoke reporting regime for New Zealand. How GST should apply 14. GST applies to the broadest possible range of goods and services supplied in New Zealand. This keeps GST fair, simple, and efficient. GST should apply to services provided through digital platforms in the gig and sharing economy like any other services. 15. However, in practice, because many who operate through digital platforms are expected to earn below the registration threshold of $60,000 per 12-month period, it is anticipated that there is a significant proportion of economic activity which is not currently subject to GST. This raises concerns from a fairness perspective, as same or similar services being provided through digital platforms have a different GST treatment to those same services being provided through other means (for example, motels and taxis). It also raises concerns from the perspective of the long- term sustainability of the GST base. 16. The discussion document notes that there are two main options to address these concerns. The first is lowering the GST registration threshold specifically for types of sellers on sharing economy platforms, and although submissions on this are sought, we expect most of the discussion will be on the second option. This is to involve digital platforms in the collection of GST. This could be achieved through extending existing marketplace rules that require platforms to collect GST in relation to supplies of remote services and low-value imported goods. The discussion document focuses on how the second option could work in practice, including the implications for digital platforms and sellers on those platforms. 17. When compared to the rules for remote services and low-value imported goods, the gig and sharing economy is more complex from a GST perspective. This is because unlike underlying suppliers of remote services and low-value imported goods, many of the sellers will be located in New Zealand and will be incurring New Zealand GST on the costs associated with operating through the digital platforms. For example, a New Zealand accommodation host will pay GST on their council rates and insurance premiums; and ridesharing drivers will pay GST on fuel and vehicle registration. One of the core principles of GST is that it is not a cost to businesses, and so in the scenario where digital platforms are returning GST on behalf of these sellers supplies through digital platforms, there should be a method for sellers to recover GST on costs incurred in producing their supplies. 18. To address this, the discussion document outlines three different options. All have advantages and disadvantages. These options include: 18.1 Requiring sellers to do a special GST registration to recover GST on their costs. This is the most obvious solution but increases compliance costs on sellers and administration costs on Inland Revenue. IR2021/460: Public release of a discussion document on the role of digital platforms in the taxation of the gig and sharing economy Page 4 of 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 18.2 Implementing a flat rate scheme. This involves collecting GST from buyers at the standard GST rate, with digital platforms returning, for example, 10 percent (instead of 15 percent) to Inland Revenue as GST, and the remaining 5 percent to the sellers. This 5 percent is intended to recognise (but not approximate) the GST embedded on sellers’ input costs. This method has the least accuracy in terms of recognising actual GST incurred, and as a result, stakeholders may suggest that if this method is chosen, sellers should have the option of a standard GST registration to prevent over- taxation. This method is intended to result in lower compliance costs for sellers. 18.3 Integration of GST refunds into the income tax return. This would see sellers claim, as part of their income tax return, the GST component of their income tax expenditure (ignoring expenditure for which there is no GST component) as a refundable income tax credit. As sellers will need to be completing income tax returns, this method should reduce their compliance costs when compared with a standard GST registration; however, from a cashflow perspective, as sellers would only be refunded GST once a year (compared to the ability for them to be refunded on a monthly basis, if they choose so, under a standard registration) they would be disadvantaged. 19. The chapter also discusses other technical amendments to the GST rules which are intended to reduce compliance costs for digital platforms and sellers. This includes rules digital platforms could apply to determine whether supplies made through their platform should be subject to GST: this is to prevent New Zealand GST from applying to services which are exported (for example, an Australian resident could purchase web design services through a digital platform in New Zealand and those services should not be subject to GST). It also includes considering the GST treatment of fees charged by digital platforms to sellers. Measures to reduce compliance costs 20. This chapter seeks feedback from submitters on whether it would be useful to require Inland Revenue to determine, and publish, standard cost deductions for income tax purposes. Inland Revenue currently determines standard cost deductions for certain purposes (for example, motor vehicle expenditure) and this simplifies the tax calculation for those who are eligible to use them by enabling them to claim a “standard cost” deduction instead of determining their actual expenditure. It is noted that determining standard cost deductions in the gig and sharing economy could be difficult, if not impossible, because different sellers will have different costs. For example, a ridesharing driver who leases the vehicle they use to provide ridesharing services will have different costs to a driver who has borrowed to purchase their own vehicle. 21. The chapter also refers to other consultation on the GST apportionment and adjustment rules. This is being consulted on in a proposed officials’ issues paper, but the option to exclude significant assets from the GST base is particularly relevant for sellers in the gig and sharing economy. Release of the discussion document 22. Subject to any further changes, including technical and editorial changes, a draft of the discussion document has been prepared for your approval to submit to the Cabinet Economic Development Committee for consideration for a public release. We have also included a draft paper for the Cabinet Economic Development Committee which outlines the core proposals and purpose of the discussion document. IR2021/460: Public release of a discussion document on the role of digital platforms in the taxation of the gig and sharing economy Page 5 of 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Consultation 23. The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment were consulted on the draft discussion document. The Treasury were also informed. No issues were identified during this consultation. 24. Officials have also had initial discussions with several accounting firms and signalled this was an area that would be the subject of further consultation. As the proposals are consistent with those discussed at the OECD, which involved consultation with digital platforms, we do not anticipate digital platforms will be surprised with the material included in the discussion document. We intend to meet with digital platforms once the discussion document, which seeks feedback on these proposals, is released. Next steps 30. If you agree to the material in the discussion document, the next step would be to submit it to Cabinet for approval to release. 31. Legislative changes would be required to give effect to the options included in the discussion document. These changes could be included in an omnibus taxation bill next year, subject to your agreement and final policy recommendations being taken by Cabinet. We will report to you with final policy recommendations following consultation. s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2021/460: Public release of a discussion document on the role of digital platforms in the taxation of the gig and sharing economy Page 6 of 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Recommended action We recommend that you: Recommendations Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue (a) note the contents of the attached draft Cabinet paper and draft discussion document “The role of digital platforms in the taxation of the gig and sharing economy” Noted Noted (b) note the draft discussion document is subject to minor technical and editorial changes Noted Noted (c) (d) (e) approve and lodge the attached Cabinet paper and draft discussion document with the Cabinet Office by 10am on Thursday 3 February 2022, for consideration by the Cabinet Economic Development Committee on Wednesday 9 February 2022.

\[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of the Minister Revenue Chair, Cabinet Economic Development Committee PUBLIC CONSULTATION ON THE ROLE OF DIGITAL PLATFORMS IN THE TAXATION OF THE GIG AND SHARING ECONOMY Proposal 1. This paper seeks the Cabinet Economic Development Committee’s agreement to the re lease of the discussion document “The role of digital platforms in the taxation of the gig and sharing economy”. Relation to Government Priorities 2. The Government’s current tax policy work programme has an item on the taxation of t he gig and sharing economy. This is intended to include this public consultation on possible changes to the tax system that are intended to ensure the tax system remains fit-for-purpose given the growing popularity of digital platforms that facilitate economic activity in the gig and sharing economy. The discussion document: The role of digital platforms in the taxation of the gig and s haring economy 3. The gig and sharing economy refers to economic activity which is facilitated by so ftware applications (often referred to as “apps”) which connect buyers and sellers of skills, labour, and assets. Common examples of activities in the gig and sharing economy include ridesharing services, short-stay accommodation, professional services, and free-lancing services. 4. The rapid growth of the gig and sharing economy poses challenges for tax a dministration and GST systems internationally. This has led the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to review options available for countries to consider implementing in response to the rise of the gig and sharing economy. This has also led to countries taking steps to make changes to their tax administration and GST systems to ensure they remain appropriate. 5. Against this background, the discussion document seeks feedback on three main a reas of the tax system. These areas are: 5.1 Improving Inland Revenue’s visibility on sellers’ income information 5.2 How GST should apply to sales made through digital platforms in the gig and sh aring economy, and 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 12:50:23 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 5.3 Other opportunities to reduce compliance costs for sellers on digital platforms in the gig and sharing economy. 6. The options discussed are consistent with international trends and thinking by the O ECD. Improving Inland Revenue’s visibility on income information 7. Inland Revenue receives regular income information in relation to employment and investments for taxpayers. This information is used to help taxpayers comply with their tax obligations by including this information in income tax returns. This helps ensure that people pay the right amount of tax. 8. In relation to income earned on digital platforms in the gig and sharing economy, I nland Revenue does not receive regular income information. It can use information powers to request information from digital platforms, but this process lacks transparency and imposes compliance costs on digital platforms. This results in Inland Revenue not being able to assist those on digital platforms in the same way it assists employees and investors with pre-filling of income information in income tax returns. 9. To address this gap, the discussion document seeks feedback on whether New Z ealand should design its own information disclosure rules or implement the Model Reporting Rules for Digital Platforms with Respect to Sellers in the Gig and Sharing Economy which were developed at the OECD. These rules leverage existing frameworks that enable information sharing between tax administrations of information that is useful for tax administrations in a compliance context. That is, implementing these rules would: 9.1 Require New Zealand digital platforms to report to Inland Revenue information a bout incomes earned on these platforms. This information would then either be used by Inland Revenue (if the sellers were based in New Zealand) or Inland Revenue would share information about non-residents with jurisdictions where they were tax resident. 9.2 Result in Inland Revenue receiving information from other tax administrations a bout incomes earned by New Zealand residents on offshore digital platforms. This information could then be used for compliance purposes and pre-filling of income tax returns. How GST should apply to sales made through digital platforms in the gig and sharing economy 10. New Zealand’s GST applies to the broadest possible range of goods and services. This keeps GST simple to understand, fair, and efficient at raising revenue. GST is required to be charged when a person is carrying on a taxable activity, and the consideration received for their supplies of goods and services is expected to exceed the registration threshold of $60,000 in a 12-month period. 11. Electronic marketplaces currently have a role in collecting GST on supplies of remote se rvices and low-value imported goods to New Zealand resident consumers. These changes were made to ensure that the GST system remains fair and sustainable. 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 12:50:23 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 12. The discussion document notes that to further improve fairness and support the long- term sustainability of the GST system, there is a strong case for GST applying to sa les of services made through digital platforms in the gig and sharing economy. The discussion document explores how digital platforms could collect GST, and how sellers could recover GST on costs incurred in operating through digital platforms. Other technical proposals to the GST rules are discussed in this context. Other compliance cost reduction measures 13. The paper also seeks feedback on other changes to the tax system that would make it easier for sellers to comply with their tax obligations. Examples include a simplified approach to determining deductions and an option to exclude significant assets from the GST base, where those assets are used in the gig ad sharing economy activity. Implementation 14. The proposals in this discussion document would require legislative changes to the I nland Revenue Acts. The proposals would also affect digital platforms in New Zealand, taxpayers who operate on digital platforms, and Inland Revenue. The purpose of the discussion document is to seek feedback on the proposals, including implementation implications, which will be reported back to Cabinet at the time final policy decisions are sought. Financial Implications 15. There are no financial implications associated with releasing this discussion document. 16. The options included in the discussion document will have financial implications if implemented. These will be reported to Cabinet at the time final policy approvals are sought. Legislative Implications 17. There are no legislative implications associated with releasing this discussion d ocument. The proposals in this paper would require changes to the Inland Revenue Acts, if implemented. The legislative vehicle for any such changes would be determined at the time final policy decisions are taken by Cabinet in the future. Impact Analysis Regulatory Impact Assessment 18. The Regulatory Impact Analysis panel at Inland Revenue has reviewed and confirmed that “The role of digital platforms in the taxation of the gig and sharing economy” discussion document can substitute for an interim Regulatory Impact Statement. It will lead to effective consultation and support the eventual development of a quality Regulatory Impact Statement. 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 12:50:23 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Climate Implications of Policy Assessment 19. The Climate Implications of Policy assessment (CIPA) team has been consulted and confirms that the CIPA requirements do not apply to this proposal as the threshold for significance is not met. Population Implications 20. Releasing the consultation document does not have any population implications. Any p opulation implications resulting from the proposals will be included in final policy advice to Cabinet following consultation. Human Rights 21. The proposals discussed in the consultation document are not inconsistent with the N ew Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 or the Human Rights Act 1993. Consultation 22. Inland Revenue officials consulted with the Treasury the Ministry of Business, I nnovation and Employment in developing the proposals included in this discussion document. 23. The proposals discussed in the discussion document are consistent with proposals t hat were consulted on at the OECD. This included discussion with digital platforms and tax specialists. The intent of this discussion document is to seek feedback from digital platforms on the workability of proposals in a New Zealand context. This feedback will be used to determine final policy recommendations for Cabinet to take in the future. Communications 24. The discussion document would be released on Inland Revenue’s tax policy website. Proactive Release 25. I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key a dvice papers in whole within 30 working days of the release of the discussion document. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Committee: 1. note that the Government’s tax policy work programme currently includes an item on t he taxation of the gig and sharing economy 2. approve the release of the attached discussion document “The role of digital platforms in the taxation of the gig and sharing economy” 3. authorise the Minister of Revenue to determine the date the discussion document will be released 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 12:50:23 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 4. authorise the Minister of Revenue to make further changes to the discussion document that are of a minor, editorial, or technical nature before it is released.

\[SENSITIVE\] POLICY AND REGULATORY STEWARDSHIP Tax policy report: Integrity of the 39% top personal income tax rate Date: 30 September 2021 Priority: High Security level: Sensitive Report number: T2021/277 IR2021/063 Action sought Action sought Deadline Minister of Finance Discuss this report with officials Agree to recommendations Minister of Revenue Discuss this report with officials Agree to recommendations Contact for telephone discussion (if required) Name Position Telephone Paul Young Principal Policy Advisor, Policy and Regulatory Stewardship, Inland Revenue 021 340 064 Stephen Bond Acting Manager, Tax Strategy, The Treasury 021 244 6007 s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) S ensitive IR2020/454; T2020/3412: Introducing a new top personal income tax rate Page 1 of 13 \[SENSITIVE\] 30 September 2021 M inister of Finance Minister of Revenue Integrity of the 39% top personal income tax rate Executive summary Purpose of report 1.You previously directed officials to report back to you 1 with advice on measures to mitigate integrity risks associated with companies, trusts and PIEs arising from the new top personal income tax rate \[IR2020/454; T2020/3412 refers\]. This report seeks your agreement to the possible integrity measures that will be worked on, and timeframes. 2.Different integrity measures complement each other to varying degrees. For example, some support integrity for investments made through controlled entities, some for portfolio investments, and some for earning personal services income through entities. 3.Coherence, integrity and fairness considerations would support progressing all the streams of work to reduce the distortions in the system; the streams of work are complex, have broader implications, and would require significant work. However, some streams of work are more important than others in relation to integrity, and some depend on policy decisions to be made in the future (such as whether the trustee rate should be raised). 4.This report, therefore, recommends that the streams of work be progressed in separate tranches. Officials recommend the first tranche comprise a package of primarily company integrity measures. This would include dividend integrity and income attribution measures. The other company and the trust integrity measures could then be delivered as a subsequent tranche once a decision is made on whether or not to raise the trustee tax rate to 39%. You could also consider whether to increase the portfolio investment entity ( PIE) tax rate as a possible third tranche. The three proposed tranches are summarised below. First tranche: Dividend integrity and income attribution measures 5.Officials recommend that the following package of measures be introduced firs t: •Di vidend integrity: Officials have been working on a series of potentia l m easures to counter some specific mechanisms that allow shareholders o f c losely-held companies to receive distributions from these companies withou t p aying tax at their personal income tax rate. Some of these measures are currently on the published tax policy work programme. The proposed measures would: -deem a dividend to be paid to a shareholder when a company with undistributed income is sold; 1 This report has been delayed due to the high priority given to housing issues in the last few months. Se nsitive IR2020/454; T2020/3412: Introducing a new top personal income tax rate Page 2 of 13 \[SENSITIVE\] -improve the reliability of information used to determine whether a taxable dividend amount could arise from a share cancellation or liquidation in the future 2 . •Income attribution: There is a risk that high rate taxpayers may use trusts and companies to obtain a lower tax rate on what is really personal services income. Officials recommend that the current personal income attribution rules be broadened to prevent this. •Trust information gathering measures: Officials recently reported to you on the trust information gathering measures. This information will be very useful in allowing us to determine whether trusts are being used to avoid the 39% rate. This information should start be coming available from July 2023. Officials will also continue to monitor whether trusts are being used to avoid the 39% rate. 6.Further, there are already some dividend integrity rules in the legislation. Inland Revenue is planning some operational work to improve compliance with these existing rules. 7.These company tax integrity measures are unlikely to have major negative economic effects. By making the tax treatment of income earned in different ways more neutral, the measures are likely to be raising revenue at a relatively low economic cost per dollar raised. 8. 9.Officials propose preparing a consultation document on these measures. Changes to the taxation of housing investments are now the priority for tax policy resources, but we should be able to complete this document in early 2022. This would allow for introduction of a bill later in 2022, with an application date of 1 April 2023. Se cond tranche: Company and Trust integrity measures Trust integrity measures 10.The integrity risk from trusts arises because income retained in a trust is taxed as trustee income at a 33% final tax. There is no additional tax when the income is subsequently distributed to a higher tax rate beneficiary. So high rate taxpayers who earn income through a trust will only pay tax at 33% under the current rules. 11.This is the most significant issue for en suring the 39% personal income tax rate applies to high income individuals. For example, under the current settings any company integrity measures adopted would have limited effect if taxpayers own companies through trusts. 12. 2 This would include information regarding available subscribed capital and net capital gains and net capital gains. Available subscribed capital is basically the amount of capital contributed to the company by shareholders less any untaxed returns of capital on a share repurchase or cancellation. s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f) (iv) Sensitive IR2020/454; T2020/3412: Introducing a new top personal income tax rate Page 3 of 13 \[SENSITIVE\] 13. Officials note that Cabinet decided in December 2020 to defer the decision on whether to increase the trustee income tax rate to 39%, pending information on whether there has been a behavioural response by taxpayers to avoid paying the new personal income tax rate. A decision to raise the trustee rate would make the other measures unnecessary. Because of this, officials recommend that the decision on introducing alternative trust measures be deferred to when the decision on whether to increase the trustee income tax rate is made. 14. Finally, the Government has announced that it will introduce new information gathering powers to determine whether trusts are being used to avoid the 39% rate. This means that even if the decision is made to leave the trustee rate at 33%, waiting will allow us to use this information to improve the design of the alternative measures. Further, taxpayers might question why the alternative measures are being progressed before Inland Revenue had collected the information required to determine their necessity. Further company integrity measures 15. Further integrity issues also arise in relation to companies. Shareholders can leave earnings in a company and pay the company income tax rate (currently 28%) on any returns from investments made by the company with those earnings. Even if those investment returns are later paid out as a dividend (and so taxed at the shareholder’s marginal tax rate), shareholders get a deferral benefit as a result of the lower company rate. Officials could report to you on possible options to mitigate this issue. 16. . 17. 18. A further issue concerns shareholder loans. In practice, shareholders can receive funds from a company without paying tax by receiving the funds as a loan. s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2) (f)(iv) Sensitive IR2020/454; T2020/3412: Introducing a new top personal income tax rate Page 4 of 13 \[SENSITIVE\] Timing 19. Officials propose reporting back on whether trusts are being used to avoid the 39% tax rate in the second half of 2023. We will report to you on the second tranche at this time. Third tranche: Possible future measures – PIE rates 20. There is an overlap between the 39% tax rate and how PIEs, including KiwiSaver, are taxed. PIEs are typically widely-held managed funds. This means a person cannot easily divert income they control through a PIE. Instead PIEs are an alternative way people can save. The issue with PIEs is whether it is appropriate for this form of saving to be taxed at a lower rate for high income earners than other forms of saving. Accordingly this is less of an integrity issue and more an issue about the coherence of our policy settings for taxing savings. 21. Whether the taxation of PIEs should be changed is partly dependent on whether a decision is made on taxing trusts at 39%. If trusts are not taxed at 39%, then there is a much weaker case to tax PIEs at 39%. You may also wish to treat KiwiSaver PIEs differently from other PIEs (to recognise the fact that KiwiSaver funds are generally “locked in” until retirement age). So the decision of whether to raise the top PIE tax rate is not straightforward. 22. For these reasons, officials recommend deferring any decisions on PIEs until after the first and second tranches have been agreed. 23. The table in the attached appendix sets out all the potential integrity measures in more detail. Recommended action 24. We recommend that you: a. Direct officials to draft a consultation document (for release in early 2022) on the proposed first tranche of integrity measures to: a.1 in appropriate circumstances, treat as a dividend some amounts relating to the sale of shares in a company with undistributed income; a.2 improve the reliability of information used to determine whether a taxable dividend amount could arise from a share cancellation or liquidation in the future; and a.3 broaden the existing income attribution rules, to prevent the use of trusts and companies to obtain a lower tax rate on what is really personal services income. Agreed/Not Agreed Agreed/Not Agreed b. Note that Inland Revenue is planning to take operational measures to improve taxpayer compliance with existing dividend integrity rules. c. Note that officials will also continue to monitor whether trusts are being used to avoid the 39% rate. d. Note that officials will report to you in the second half of 2023 on: Sensitive IR2020/454; T2020/3412: Introducing a new top personal income tax rate Page 5 of 13 \[SENSITIVE\] d.1 whether trusts are being used to avoid the 39% tax rate, and if so, what measures should be taken to prevent this; and d.2 a second tranche of company-focussed integrity measures. e. Note that officials could report to you on changing PIE tax rates once tranche one and tranche two have been agreed.

The purpose of this report is to get your agreement on the schedule of work to address integrity issues arising from the introduction of the new top personal tax rate of 39%. Background 26. The level of taxes paid on income from an investment or activity can vary depending on the entity structure used. This means taxpayers can arrange their affairs in ways that may compromise the Government’s tax objectives. In particular, high income taxpayers can reduce the amount of their income that is subject to either the 33% tax rate or the new 39% tax rate. This possibility has been called the i ntegrity issue. 27. This report: • outlines the differences in taxation of income earned through different entities compared to income earned directly by individual taxpayers; • demonstrates how this can compromise integrity by reducing effective tax burdens on some types of income; • provides advice on measures to support the integrity of the 39% personal income tax rate; and • discusses possible next steps in this area. Tax treatment varies for different entities 28. The tax treatment of income earned through different entities can vary significantly. The tax differences can be temporary or permanent. A temporary benefit allows a deferral of tax. Even if the cumulative tax burden is eventually the same, a deferral over an extended period can result in a significant difference in funds available at the end of the period. 29. The tax treatment of distributions from entities to individuals also varies by entity type. In some cases, there are permanent differences in taxes paid. 30. The following table summarises the tax treatment of different types of entity as income is earned, and as accumulated funds are distributed to individuals. The table assumes that the individual is subject to the top personal income tax rate. Sensitive IR2020/454; T2020/3412: Introducing a new top personal income tax rate Page 7 of 13 \[SENSITIVE\] Table 1: Tax treatment of different entity structures Entity Tax rate on income as it is earned Tax treatment of distributions to high rate individuals Individual 39% n/a Company 28% Imputation tops up tax to 39% Trust 33% No top up on income if retained until the following year Company owned by trust 28% Top up to 33%, if income retained in trust until following year Company with accumulated income realised by owner through a sale of its shares rather than a distribution 28% No tax as dividend is avoided Multi-rate PIE Capped at 28% No tax on distribution 31. The following table shows the effective tax burden paid on income earned in an entity and distributed to an individual with a 39% marginal rate. Table 2: Effective tax burden on different entity structures Entity Year accumulated funds distributed 1 10 30 Individual 39% 39% 39% Company 39% 38% 35% Trust 33% 33% 33% Company owned by trust 33% 32% 31% Company with accumulated income realised by owner through a sale of its shares rather than a distribution 28% 28% 28% Multi-rate PIE 28% 28% 28% 32. A number of observations can be made from this table. • A company on its own gives rise only to a deferral of tax because of the imputation system. Quite long deferral periods are necessary to significantly lower the effective tax rate. • Using a trust allows the new top tax rate to be avoided entirely, meaning 39% rate individuals pay only 33%. • The combination of a company and a trust (the usual structure) can achieve an even greater reduction in the effective tax burden if profits are held in the company for a longer period of time to defer the application of trustee tax. • When the taxation of dividends is avoided through a share sale, only the 28% company tax is paid. • A 28% tax rate can also be obtained by investing in a PIE. Sensitive IR2020/454; T2020/3412: Introducing a new top personal income tax rate Page 8 of 13 \[SENSITIVE\] 33. The biggest area of concern relates to closely-held companies and trusts that are used to earn income on behalf of high wealth individuals. Inland Revenue analysed 350 high wealth individuals (individuals and families with more than $50 million in net assets) and found that they used or controlled 8,468 companies and 1,867 trusts. For 2018, individuals paid $26 million in tax while companies and trusts paid $639 million and $102 million respectively, showing a significant amount of income earned through lower tax rate entities. The policy options considered in this report would not attribute all of this income to individuals and tax it at their individual personal tax rates, but would create the potential for a significant amount of income (that is derived by comparatively few individuals and families) to be recharacterised and taxed at the appropriate rate. 34. There is much les s concern with widely-held and listed companies. This is because they are not under the control of an individual, and so generally cannot be used as a conduit to achieve a lower tax rate on what is really the individual’s own income. 35. There are some integrity issues for taxpayers on a 33% tax rate however, the scale of the tax benefit for 33% rate taxpayers compared to taxpayers on 39% is significantly smaller in relation to companies (5% versus 11%) and it does not exist at all for trusts (which are taxed at 33%). Further, individuals on a 33% rate are likely to have less total income to divert through other entities than individuals on a 39% rate. Accordingly, the integrity issues are much greater for taxpayers on a 39% rate than for other taxpayers. For this reason, this report focuses on integrity measures to address potential avoidance by 39% rate taxpayers. Integrity measures 36. During the 2020 election, the Labour Party announced an intention to establish a new personal income tax rate of 39% for income over $180,000. Tax rates on other types of taxpayers, including companies and trusts, would remain unchanged at 28% and 33% respectively. 37. Officials understand the motivation for this reform is to raise extra revenue in a way that is progressive and does as little as possible to increase taxes on low to middle income earners. 38. The current tax policy settings are a 39% top personal marginal tax rate with a 28% company income tax rate, a 33% trustee rate (pending a later review of the use of trusts to avoid the top personal rate) and no general capital gains tax. Any integrity measures should be consistent with these broader settings. 39. This means the integrity measures should focus on mechanisms that divert the income of a 39% rate taxpayer through channels that allow it to be taxed at a lower rate. The measures should not, for example, result in companies being taxed at 39%. 40. The income diverted can be either personal services income or income from investments. Officials consider that the integrity measures should apply to both types of income. Otherwise, one type of income will effectively receive a preferential tax treatment. This would reduce the effectiveness of the 39% tax rate and create horizontal inequity between taxpayers earning labour income and taxpayers earning investment income. 41. With this in mind, officials recommend that the integrity measures focus on limiting the ability of individuals to avoid the 39% rate by diverting their income through entities taxed at a lower rate. A combination of measures that could achieve this are: • Attributing personal services income earned through a company or trust (unless the trustee income tax rate is increased to 39%) by a controlling Sensitive IR2020/454; T2020/3412: Introducing a new top personal income tax rate Page 9 of 13 \[SENSITIVE\] shareholder or significant beneficiary to that individual and taxing it at their personal tax rate. • Ensuring income is taxed at the recipient’s personal income tax rate when distributed by a company or trust. • 42. 43. However the trust related integrity measures and any changes to PIE taxation are dependent on the Government’s decision on whether to increase the top trustee rate to 39%. 44. For these reasons, officials recommend progressing the combined integrity package in three tranches: • Tranche one, comprising dividend integrity, information gathering, and income attribution measures. • Tranche two, comprising trust integrity and income retention measures. • A possible tranche three, comprising changes to PIE taxation. 45. Each tranche is discussed below. First tranche – dividend integrity measures and income attribution measures 46. This tranche would include the following measures. Amounts received when selling shares in a controlled company with undistributed earnings 47. When a shareholder sells shares in a company with undistributed earnings, some of the purchase price received is compensation for those retained earnings. The purchase price is typically treated as a capital receipt and is not subject to tax in the hands of the shareholder. If the earnings were instead distributed as a dividend, the dividend would have been taxed at the shareholder’s personal income tax rate (and the buyer would have paid less for the shares). Officials’ proposal is to treat the sale proceeds received by a controlling shareholder as a dividend to the extent of the undistributed earnings. Improving the reliability of available subscribed capital and similar information 48. Distributions by a company are not taxable to the extent that they are: • a return of capital subscribed by shareholders (referred to as “available subscribed capital”) on a liquidation or share cancellation; or • net capital gain of the company distributed in a liquidation. 49. When there is a share repurchase or liquidation, determining the dividend amount requires subtracting the available subscribed capital amount and the capital gain amount (in the case of a liquidation). Because a company may be in existence for a long time before liquidation, and these amounts may not be relevant before then, s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) Sensitive IR2020/454; T2020/3412: Introducing a new top personal income tax rate Page 10 of 13 \[SENSITIVE\] it is sometimes difficult for the company to determine them (going through historical records) and for Inland Revenue to verify them. 50. There are different ways to improve the reliability of this information. One possible option is to require that the amounts be determined annually and reported to Inland Revenue. Alternately, taxpayers could be required to record the information to evidence that they have calculated the dividend amount correctly (with Inland Revenue determining the amounts in the absence of reliable evidence). The goal is to improve the accuracy of the dividend amount calculated in cases of share cancellations and liquidations (without imposing unnecessary compliance costs) and thus to prevent a possible source of revenue leakage. 51. There are advantages and disadvantages to the different options which officials would like to explore further through consultation on the discussion document for tranche one. We would report back to you on our recommended option following this consultation. Income attribution 52. There is a risk that high rate taxpayers will use trusts and companies to obtain a lower tax rate on what is really personal services income. This is typically done by incorporating a company to contract for services. The company contracts with the client, and pays the 28% corporate tax rate on its fee income. The company then employs (or sub-contracts with) the taxpayer to provide the service (often at below market rates). The company can either retain its profit or pass the profit back to the taxpayer in a tax advantaged manner (for example, as a loan or through a trust). This is an issue both for taxpayers providing services to a single client, and for taxpayers that provide services to multiple clients. 53. In this case, the economic reality is that the taxpayer is providing services and being paid for them. Consequently the taxpayer should be taxed at its marginal rate on the fee income. However, the legal structure used allows tax to be paid at the lower corporate rate. Accordingly there are strong grounds for attributing the services income to the taxpayer and taxing it at the taxpayer’s marginal rate. 54. The Income Tax Act 2007 currently includes some personal services attribution rules, but these are narrowly targeted at taxpayers that are dependent on a single client (and so are closer to employees). The proposal would expand these rules so they apply more broadly, including where the taxpayer has multiple clients. The intention is to attribute to a taxpayer income earned by an entity if that entity is effectively just a conduit for the taxpayer’s activities. Accordingly, the proposal would apply to income earned through a company or trust that is under the control of the taxpayer and its associates (or possibly a small number of taxpayers). Second tranche – Trust and income retention integrity measures Trust integrity 55. The integrity risk from trusts arises because income retained in a trust is taxed as trustee income at 33% as a final tax. There is no additional tax when the income is subsequently distributed to a higher personal income tax rate beneficiary, so they do not need to pay the top personal income tax rate on the income. Sensitive IR2020/454; T2020/3412: Introducing a new top personal income tax rate Page 11 of 13 \[SENSITIVE\] Figure 1: Trustee and beneficiary income since 1994 Source: Inland Revenue 56. Figure 1 shows how significant amounts of income were diverted into trusts when the personal income tax rate was raised to 39% in 2000 while the trustee income tax rate remained at 33%. 3 Many of the trust structures that were set up around that time are still being used and provide a structure that could be used now to reduce tax unless the trustee income tax rate is aligned with the highest personal income tax rate. 57. In addition to the above data, Inland Revenue will be receiving more specific information from trustees under provisions in the recently enacted new personal income tax rate legislation. This additional information could help to inform in more detail how trusts are used and what measures could be considered to prevent under-taxation from the use of trusts. 58. Addressing the integrity issue with the trustee income tax rate is probably the most significant issue to en sure the 39% personal income tax rate is imposed for high income individuals. Even if other integrity measures are adopted (for example, countering the use of company structures and dividend arrangements to reduce tax), these measures will be limited in their effect if taxpayers are taxed at only 33% on income earned through a trust. 59. 60. 3 The spike in 2013 was due to the expiration of an imputation credit transitional rule which allowed dividends to be imputed at a higher rate. The spike is from dividends of companies owned by the trust that were distributed to the trust. s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) Sensitive IR2020/454; T2020/3412: Introducing a new top personal income tax rate Page 12 of 13 \[SENSITIVE\] Income retention integrity 61. As noted above, 39% rate taxpayers can get a deferral benefit from investing through a company or trust even if distributions are taxed at 39%. This deferral benefit can be significant if income is retained in the entity for a long time. 62. Officials could report to you on possible options to mitigate this issue. Shareholder loans 63. 64. Officials could consider approaches to address this issue such as those that have been adopted in Canada and the UK. These countries deem a loan to a controlling shareholder that is outstanding at the end of the year to be a dividend in some circumstances. We could also consider improving the rules that treat the forgiveness of a loan owed by a shareholder to a company as a dividend (relevant in those cases where the loan has not already been treated as a dividend). In considering this issue, we need to be careful that any solution does not overreach and penalise valid commercial arrangements. Possible third tranche – portfolio investment entities (PIEs) 65. Portfolio investment entities (PIEs) are vehicles that hold portfolio investments for investors. These include multi-rate PIEs (that is, managed funds including KiwiSaver funds) which pay tax on behalf of their investors using a progressive scale. The tax rates approximately follow the personal income tax scale except the top PIE tax rate is capped at 28%. There is no further tax on distribution to the investor. This means higher rate taxpayers can obtain the benefit of the capped rate by investing in a PIE. 66. While the difference between the top PIE rate and top personal income tax rate already existed prior to the introduction of the 39% top personal tax rate, moving from a five percentage point difference to an 11 percentage point difference could s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) Sensitive IR2020/454; T2020/3412: Introducing a new top personal income tax rate Page 13 of 13 \[SENSITIVE\] result in a greater diversion of investment into PIEs. This would result in reduced revenue collection and a small economic cost 4 and mean that higher income taxpayers could circumvent the new 39% income tax rate on their investment income. 67. The taxation of PIEs is not an integrity issue per se. PIEs are widely-held investment funds, meaning an individual taxpayer cannot easily divert their income from a particular source through a PIE. Further, the taxpayer loses control of their funds if they invest in a PIE – their funds are combined with those of other members and invested at the direction of an independent fund manager. So the PIE cannot be regarded as simply a conduit for the taxpayer. 68. Consequently, the issue with PIEs relates more to the general coherence of New Zealand’s rules for taxing savings than to the integrity of the tax system. Accordingly this issue overlaps with our savings policy generally, including KiwiSaver. In particular it may not be desirable to increase tax rates on locked in KiwiSaver PIEs, even if the decision is made to increase rates on other types of PIEs. 69. For this reason officials recommend that PIE-related measures only be considered once tranches one and two have been progressed. Fiscal impact 70. 71. We will report to you on the fiscal impact of the other possible measures when we report on them in more detail. Process and next steps 72. Officials recommend the following timeframes: • First tranche (dividend integrity and income attribution): Officials would release a discussion document in early 2022 and consult during that year. We would report back to you on the consultation and on our final policy recommendations in the middle of 2022. Depending on the availability of a bill, it could be introduced later in 2022 and enacted with application from 1 April 2023. • Second tranche (trust integrity proposals and further company integrity proposals): Given the need to review the information gathered from the trust disclosure project, we propose reporting back to you on recommended measures in the second half of 2023. Consultation would follow in 2023 or early 2024, with a bill later in 2024. 73. We could also report to you on possible PIE changes in 2024, following development of the policy for the trust measures. 4 For example, PIEs are often managed funds that charge fees to the investors. Some investors might normally choose to invest directly and not pay these fees, but a significant tax advantage may result in them using managed funds and paying the fees they would have otherwise saved. s 9(2)(f)(iv) Sensitive IR2020/454; T2020/3412: Introducing a new top personal income tax rate Page 1 of 6 \[SENSITIVE\] Annex: Description of possible integrity measures Sensitive IR2020/454; T2020/3412: Introducing a new top personal income tax rate Page 2 of 6 \[SENSITIVE\] Entity Integrity issue Measure Type of income Comment Earliest feable application date Trusts and companies Personal services income Expand the personal services attribution rule Labour There is currently a personal services attribution rule that applies when personal services income is earned through a trust or company.

Amounts distributed out of retained earnings of a company are intended to be taxed at the shareholder’s personal income tax rate with imputation credits. There are some ways a shareholder can receive these earnings without paying any tax. Tax a portion of receipts related to retained earnings when selling shares in a controlled company All This would tax a portion of the receipts in more limited circumstances (shares of controlled companies only, and only to the extent of retained earnings). Some countries have measures that do this. This can be viewed as a dividend anti- avoidance measure which is consistent with the policy framework of not taxing capital gains. This project is already underwa y under the work programme and we recommend that it continue as a high priority next year. 1 April 2023 s 9(2)(f)(iv) Sensitive IR2020/454; T2020/3412: Introducing a new top personal income tax rate Page 3 of 6 \[SENSITIVE\] s 9(2)(f)(iv) Sensitive IR2020/454; T2020/3412: Introducing a new top personal income tax rate Page 4 of 6 \[SENSITIVE\] s 9(2)(f)(iv) Sensitive IR2020/454; T2020/3412: Introducing a new top personal income tax rate Page 5 of 6 \[SENSITIVE\] s 9(2)(f)(iv) Sensitive IR2020/454; T2020/3412: Introducing a new top personal income tax rate Page 6 of 6 \[SENSITIVE\] s 9(2) (f)(iv)

The report recommended that the streams of work on possible integrity measures be progressed in separate tranches, with the first tranche comprising primarily company integrity measures. This includes dividend integrity and income attribution measures, as well as proposals around recording available subscribed capital (ASC) 1 and net capital gain amounts. This report, therefore, attaches a draft discussion document and Cabinet paper on these measures for your consideration. Officials are in the process of finalising the discussion document, so the document is still subject to minor editorial changes. Proposals in the discussion document The draft discussion document proposes: • That any sale of shares in a company by the controlling shareholder be treated as giving rise to a dividend to the shareholder to the extent that the company (and its subsidiaries) has retained earnings. This will trigger a residual tax liability for the shareholder. The company should also have an increase in its ASC. This ASC increase will address a current inequity in the imputation credit continuity rules and prevent double taxation upon liquidation. • That companies be required, on a prospective basis, to maintain a record of their ASC and net capital gains, so that these amounts can be more easily and accurately calculated at the time of any share cancellation or liquidation. These accounts would be similar to the imputation credit accounts already required to be kept. • That the “80 percent one buyer” test for the personal services attribution rule (that is, at least 80 percent of the associated entity’s income from personal services during the income year is derived from the supply of services to one buyer in particular and/or an associate of the buyer) be removed.

This report attaches a draft discussion document and Cabinet paper on dividend integrity and income attribution measures for your consideration. Context and background 2. Officials previously reported to you with advice on measures to mitigate integrity risks associated with companies, trusts and Portfolio Investment Entities (PIEs) arising from the new top personal income tax rate (T2021/277; IR2021/063 refers). The report recommended that the streams of work on the possible integrity measures be progressed in separate tranches, with the first tranche comprising primarily company integrity measures. The attached discussion document contains proposed measures arising out of officials’ work on tranche one, and includes dividend integrity and income attribution measures. 3. Officials are in the process of finalising the discussion document, so the document is still subject to minor editorial changes. Dividend integrity 4. The document firstly considers two issues with the current law and practice regarding income of companies received by shareholders. Distributions from companies are intended to be taxable income to the shareholders (dividends), unless excluded because they are either returns of contributed capital or a distribution on liquidation of net capital gains. Under the imputation system, taxable distributions from New Zealand companies can carry with them a credit for New Zealand income tax paid by the company. However, because the corporate tax rate is lower than the top personal tax rate and the trustee rate, there is often a residual tax liability for the shareholder (or the paying company, where Resident Withholding Tax is imposed). 5. Current law and practice offer a number of routes for shareholders to directly or indirectly realise cash (or other property) relating to earnings of a company without triggering any tax liability. The first issue considered in the document is sales of shares. A sale of shares offers an alternative way for a shareholder to realise cash, often but not always representing the earnings or capital gains of the company, with no, or a substantially deferred, tax cost. 6. When a company is sold, the purchaser’s payment to the vendor includes the value of assets funded by retained earnings. Under current law, this payment is generally on capital account (non-taxable). Because a change of ownership will eliminate imputation credits, any subsequent distribution of the retained earnings will be taxable to the purchaser. However, if the purchaser adopts the simple expedient of acquiring 100 percent of the target using a holding company, this taxation is permanently eliminated by the inter-corporate dividend exemption. 7. Secondly, practical issues arise when a company cancels shares or is liquidated. At this point, the company’s available subscribed capital (ASC) 2 and (in the case of a liquidation) net capital gains need to be determined, in order to determine the amount of the dividend on liquidation. However, there is currently no requirement for a company to have kept any record of these amounts during its life. This can make accurately determining the amount of a dividend on a share cancellation or liquidation highly problematic. 2 “Available subscribed capital” refers to a company’s paid-up share capital and can be distributed tax free to shareholders on liquidation. IR2022/013; T2022/106: Discussion document – Dividend integrity and personal services income attribution Page 4 of 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Personal services income attribution 8. The document also considers the scope of the personal services attribution rule and whether it may need to be expanded in light of recent developments such as the introduction of the new top personal tax rate of 39%. 9. The personal services attribution rule prevents an individual avoiding the top personal tax rate by diverting income to an associated entity. A typical scenario is where an individual incorporates a company to contract for services. The company contracts with the customer and pays the 28% corporate tax rate on its fee income. The company then employs or sub-contracts with the individual to provide the service, often at a below-market rate. The company can either retain its profit or pass the profit back to the taxpayer in a tax-advantaged manner (for example, through a trust). 10. The attribution rule for income from personal services applies when an individual (the working person), who performs personal services, is associated with an entity (the associated entity) that provides those personal services to a third person (the buyer). The rule only applies when various threshold tests are met, most notably: 10.1 At least 80 percent of the associated entity’s income from personal services during the income year is derived from the supply of services to the buyer or an associate of the buyer (or some combination thereof). This is referred to in the document as the “80 percent one buyer” rule. 10.2 At least 80 percent of the associated entity’s income from personal services during the income year is derived from services that are performed by the working person or a relative of theirs (or some combination thereof). This is referred to as the “80% one natural person supplier” rule. 10.3 “Substantial business assets” 3 are not a necessary part of the business structure that is used to derive the associated entity’s income from personal services. 11. The combination of these tests targets the rule at individuals who, using an interposed entity, sell their labour to a buyer in the specific situation where these individuals would likely have traditionally supplied their labour as employees, rather than as independent contractors. 12. There is a risk that other taxpayers on the 39% personal tax rate who are not currently subject to the personal services attribution rule will use trusts and companies to obtain a lower tax rate on what is in fact personal services income. This is an issue both for taxpayers providing personal services to a single customer and taxpayers providing personal services to multiple customers. In each case, the economic reality is that the taxpayer is performing work and being paid for it – the entity is in effect a conduit for the taxpayer’s income-earning activity. Consequently, the taxpayer should be taxed on their services income at the applicable marginal rate. However, the legal structure used allows tax to be paid at a lower rate. 3 “Substantial business assets” means depreciable property that has a total cost of more than either $75,000 or 25 percent of the associated entity’s total income from services for the income year. In the specific case of depreciable property subject to a finance lease or hire purchase agreement, the cost of the property includes the consideration provided to the lessee, including expenditure or loss incurred by the lessee in installing the asset for use (unless the lessee is allowed a deduction for the expenditure or loss). IR2022/013; T2022/106: Discussion document – Dividend integrity and personal services income attribution Page 5 of 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Proposals in the discussion document 13. The draft discussion document proposes measures to address the issues described above and improve the integrity of the 39% personal tax rate and the dividend definition. In particular, it proposes: 13.1 That any sale of shares in a company by the controlling shareholder be treated as giving rise to a dividend to the shareholder to the extent that the company (and its subsidiaries) has retained earnings. This would trigger a residual tax liability for the shareholder. The company should also have an increase in its ASC. This ASC increase would address a current inequity in the imputation credit continuity rules and prevent double taxation upon liquidation. 13.2 That companies be required, on a prospective basis, to maintain a record of their ASC and net capital gains, so that these amounts can be more easily and accurately calculated at the time of any share cancellation or liquidation. These accounts would be similar to the imputation credit accounts already required to be kept, but would have fewer entries. 13.3 That the “80 percent one buyer” test for the personal services attribution rule be removed. As outlined above, the 80 percent one buyer test narrowly targets the personal services attribution rule at taxpayers that are dependent on a single customer (and so are closer to employees). However, as stated above, the problem is not limited to just those taxpayers that are dependent on a single customer. Therefore, there may be a good argument for removing the 80 percent one buyer rule altogether. 14. Each of these proposals is independent of the others, though the second would be a useful support for the first, as well as for current law. 15. The discussion document also canvasses the following issues in relation to the personal services attribution rule: 15.1 In some circumstances, the “80 percent one natural person supplier” test might be seen as too restrictive. Conceivably, there may be another individual (unrelated to the working person from whose efforts most of the associated entity’s income from personal services is derived) whose labour contributes more than 20 percent of the associated entity’s income from personal services. There is a question as to whether it is correct from a policy perspective that attribution does not apply even if the associated entity’s income from personal services is mostly derived by the efforts of one person and/or a relative of theirs, simply because the entity’s income from services is not almost entirely derived by the person’s and/or a relative’s efforts. This is essentially a question about where the threshold for attribution should be for the level of contribution from the working person, rather than a significant change in intended scope. 15.2 The threshold for the substantial business assets test has not changed since the introduction of the personal services attribution rule in 2000. There is a question as to whether the $75,000 threshold in this test should be revised upward so that it is set at a level that more accurately reflects the cost of business assets today. Officials note that any increase in the threshold will not affect taxpayers whose business assets cost more than 25% of their income. The effective threshold will therefore only be greater than $75,000 where the income from personal services for the income year is greater than $300,000. IR2022/013; T2022/106: Discussion document – Dividend integrity and personal services income attribution Page 6 of 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 16. The draft discussion document suggests two possible options for increasing the threshold: 16.1 Option one: The lower of $200,000 or 25% of the associated entity’s income from services for the income year, excluding the cost of passenger or luxury vehicles unless the entity’s business is a transportation business. 16.2 Option two: The lower of $150,000 or 25% of the associated entity’s income from services for the income year, excluding the cost of passenger or luxury vehicles unless the entity’s business is a transportation business. Financial implications 17. The fiscal impact of the changes will depend on the options that are proceeded with following consultation. Officials will provide an estimate of the fiscal impact in the report on submissions due in May. The report will seek final policy approval of the options developed and will include a draft Cabinet paper. Regulatory Impact Assessment 18. A Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) is being prepared to assist Cabinet’s consideration of the proposals in the discussion document. Consequently, the Impact Analysis section of the Cabinet paper will change once the quality assurance review of the RIS has been completed. Officials will provide you with the finalised RIS and Cabinet paper in the week beginning 21 February. Next steps 19. Officials propose the following timeline for releasing the discussion document and obtaining approval of the final policy following public consultation: • 9 March – Cabinet Economic Development Committee (DEV) considers discussion document release. • 14 March – Cabinet approval of discussion document release. • 29 April – Submissions on discussion document close. • 26 May – Officials report to Ministers on submissions and final policy recommendations. • 22 June – Consideration by DEV. • 27 June – Cabinet approval of final policy. • July/August – Cabinet approval for including proposals in omnibus tax bill.
\[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of the Minister of Finance Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Economic Development Committee RELEASE OF DISCUSSION DOCUMENT – DIVIDEND INTEGRITY AND PERSONAL SE RVICES INCOME ATTRIBUTION Proposal 1. This paper seeks the Cabinet Economic Development Committee’s agreement to the re lease of a discussion document, Dividend integrity and personal services income attribution. Relation to Government Priorities 2. During the 2020 election, the Labour Party announced an intention to establish a new top personal income tax rate of 39% for income earned over $180,000, which has since been implemented by this Government. Tax rates on other types of taxpayers, including companies and trusts, remain unchanged at 28% and 33% respectively. 3. The motivation for this reform was to raise extra revenue in a way that is progressive a nd does as little as possible to increase taxes on low to middle income earners. The integrity measures proposed in the discussion document will help to support this objective by limiting the ability of individuals to avoid the 39% rate by diverting their income through entities taxed at a lower rate. Executive Summary 4. The Government’s work on integrity measures to support the 39% personal income t ax rate is being progressed in tranches. Tranche one, which comprises the subject matter of the discussion document, concerns dividend integrity and income attribution measures relating to the use of closely-held companies and trusts by relatively high income individuals. Tranches two and three will consider trust integrity and company income retention issues and integrity issues with the taxation of portfolio investment income. 5. The discussion document proposes: 5.1 That any sale of shares in a company by the controlling shareholder be t reated as giving rise to a dividend to the shareholder to the extent that the company (and its subsidiaries) has retained earnings. 1 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 08:25:27 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 5.2 That companies be required, on a prospective basis, to maintain a record of their available subscribed capital (ASC) 1 and net capital gains, so that these amounts can be more easily and accurately calculated at the time of any share cancellation or liquidation. 5.3 That the “80 percent one buyer” test for the personal services attribution rule b e removed. 6. I propose that the period for submissions be open for approximately six weeks until F riday 29 April. Background 7. The level of taxes paid on income from an investment or activity can vary depending o n the entity structure used. This means taxpayers can arrange their affairs in ways that may compromise the Government’s objectives in relation to fairness and economic efficiency. In particular, high income taxpayers can reduce the amount of their income that is subject to either the 33% personal income tax rate or the new top personal income tax rate of 39%. 8. The tax differences arising from the use of different entities as vehicles for deriving i ncome can be temporary or permanent. A temporary benefit allows a deferral of tax. Even if the cumulative tax burden is eventually the same, a deferral over an extended period can result in a significant difference in funds available at the end of the period. 9. The tax treatment of distributions from entities to individuals also varies by entity t ype. In some cases, there are permanent differences in taxes paid. 10. The biggest area of concern relates to closely-held companies and trusts that are used to earn income on behalf of relatively high income individuals, particularly those who earn income that is taxed at the top personal tax rate of 39% (or who would have income taxed at the top personal rate if they earned the income directly rather than through an entity). Increased structuring by individuals to avoid the 39% rate may have unintended impacts on: 10.1 Revenue: Tax collected is reduced by increased structuring activity. This is d ue to the direct impact of taxpayers being able to earn their income through lower-taxed entities, such as trusts and companies. It is also because an inconsistent rate structure makes it harder for courts to find tax avoidance when the different rates mean it is difficult to determine whether a structure undermines what Parliament contemplated. 10.2 Social capital and the integrity of the tax system: Perceptions of arbitrary o utcomes, such as when some taxpayers can structure to avoid the 39% rate, will erode public confidence in the integrity of the tax system and the perception that all taxpayers are treated fairly. 1 “Available subscribed capital” refers to a company’s paid-up share capital and can be distributed tax free to shareholders on liquidation. 2 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 08:25:27 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 10.3 Horizontal and vertical equity: In the absence of integrity measures, more income of high-wealth individuals and others with substantial capital income is likely to flow to lighter-taxed entities. This suggests that the impact of the 39% personal tax rate will disproportionately fall on less wealthy salary and wage earners. 11. There is much less concern with widely-held and listed companies. This is because t hey are not under the control of an individual, and so generally cannot be used as a conduit to achieve a lower tax rate on what is really the individual’s own income. 12. The scale of the tax benefit for 33% marginal rate taxpayers is significantly smaller t han for taxpayers on the top rate of 39% (a differential of five percentage points versus 11 percentage points). Individuals on the 33% personal tax rate also typically have less total income to divert through other entities than individuals on the top rate, and hence the integrity concerns in relation to the latter group are greater. While the Government’s main concern is the integrity of the 39% tax rate, the proposals in the discussion document can affect taxpayers at any personal tax rate in situations where some of or all their income is being earned through entities. Scope of potential reforms and previous decisions 13. The current tax policy settings are a top personal income tax rate of 39%, a 28% company income tax rate, a 33% trustee rate (pending an upcoming review of the use of trusts to avoid the top personal tax rate) and no general capital gains tax. Any integrity measures should be consistent with these broader settings. This means that the measures should focus on mechanisms that divert the income of a taxpayer on the 39% rate through channels that allow it to be taxed at a lower rate. The measures should not, for example, result in companies being taxed at 39%. 14. On the advice of officials from The Treasury and Inland Revenue, the Ministers of F inance and Revenue previously decided to progress the work on integrity measures in tranches. Tranche one, which comprises the subject matter of the discussion document, concerns dividend integrity and income attribution measures relating to the use of closely-held companies and trusts by high income individuals. 15. The policy options considered in the discussion document for tranche one would not a ttribute all income earned through companies and trusts to individuals and tax it at their individual personal tax rates. Rather, they would create the potential for a significant amount of income (that is derived by comparatively few families and individuals) to be recharacterised and taxed at the appropriate rate. 16. Tranche two will consider trust integrity and company income retention issues. Inland R evenue will be receiving more specific information from trustees for the 2021–22 and later income years under provisions in the recently enacted amendments to the personal income tax rate legislation. This additional information could help to inform in more detail how trusts are used and what measures could be considered to prevent under-taxation from the use of trusts. 17. Income retention measures would address the deferral benefit taxpayers can get f rom investing through a company (including in cases where eventual distributions are taxed at the 39% rate). 3 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 08:25:27 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 18. A possible tranche three could consider integrity issues for the taxation of portfolio investment income, such as Portfolio Investment Entity (PIE) taxation. However, given that PIEs are used by large numbers of low and middle income New Zealanders, and their taxation is a component of savings policy as well as tax policy, this is not as urgent a concern as the tranche one and tranche two issues. Dividend integrity 19. The discussion document firstly considers two issues with the current law and practice regarding income of companies received by shareholders. Distributions from companies are intended to be taxable income to the shareholders (dividends), unless excluded because they are either returns of contributed capital or a distribution on liquidation of net capital gains. Under the imputation system, taxable distributions from New Zealand companies can carry with them a credit for New Zealand income tax paid by the company. However, because the corporate tax rate is lower than the top personal tax rate and the trustee rate, there is often a residual tax liability for the shareholder (or the paying company, where Resident Withholding Tax is imposed). 20. Current law and practice offer a number of routes for shareholders to directly or i ndirectly realise cash (or other property) relating to earnings of a company without triggering any tax liability. The first issue considered in the document is sales of shares. A sale of shares offers an alternative way for a shareholder to realise cash, often but not always representing the earnings or capital gains of the company, with no, or a substantially deferred, tax cost. 21. When a company is sold, the purchaser’s payment to the vendor includes the value o f assets funded by retained earnings. Under current law, this payment is generally on capital account (non-taxable). Because a change of ownership will eliminate imputation credits, any subsequent distribution of the retained earnings will be taxable to the purchaser. However, if the purchaser adopts the simple expedient of acquiring 100 percent of the target using a holding company, this taxation is permanently eliminated by the inter-corporate dividend exemption. 22. Secondly, practical issues arise when a company cancels shares or is liquidated. At t his point, the company’s ASC and (in the case of a liquidation) net capital gains need to be determined, in order to determine the amount of the dividend on liquidation. However, there is currently no requirement for a company to have kept any record of these amounts during its life. This can make accurately determining the amount of a dividend on a share cancellation or liquidation highly problematic. Personal services attribution 23. The discussion document also considers the scope of the personal services attribution rule and whether it may need to be expanded in light of recent developments such as the introduction of the new top personal tax rate of 39%. 24. The personal services attribution rule prevents an individual avoiding the top personal tax rate by diverting income to an associated entity. A typical scenario is where an individual incorporates a company to contract for services. The company contracts with the customer and pays the 28% corporate tax rate on its fee income. The company then employs or sub-contracts with the individual to provide the 4 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 08:25:27 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] service, often at a below-market rate. The company can either retain its profit or pass the profit back to the taxpayer in a tax-advantaged manner (for example, through a trust). 25. The attribution rule for income from personal services applies when an individual (the working person), who performs personal services, is associated with an entity (the associated entity) that provides those personal services to a third person (the buyer). The rule only applies when various threshold tests are met, most notably: 25.1 At least 80 percent of the associated entity’s income from personal services d uring the income year is derived from the supply of services to the buyer or an associate of the buyer (or some combination thereof). This is referred to in the document as the “80 percent one buyer” rule. 25.2 At least 80 percent of the associated entity’s income from personal services d uring the income year is derived from services that are performed by the working person or a relative of theirs (or some combination thereof). This is referred to as the “80 percent one natural person supplier” rule. 25.3 “Substantial business assets” 2 are not a necessary part of the business structure that is used to derive the associated entity’s income from personal services. 26. The combination of these tests targets the rule at individuals who, using an i nterposed entity, sell their labour to a buyer in the specific situation where these individuals would likely have traditionally supplied their labour as employees, rather than as independent contractors. 27. There is a risk that taxpayers on the 39% personal tax rate will use trusts and companies to obtain a lower tax rate on what is in fact personal services income. This is an issue both for taxpayers providing personal services to a single customer and taxpayers providing personal services to multiple customers.

As outlined above, the 80 percent one buyer rule narrowly targets the personal services attribution rule at taxpayers that are dependent on a single customer (and so are closer to employees). However, as stated above, the problem is not limited to just those taxpayers that are dependent on a single customer. Therefore, there may be a good argument for removing the 80 percent one buyer rule altogether. 29. In relation to the personal services attribution rule, the discussion document also a sks submitters whether the thresholds under the “80 percent one natural person supplier” and substantial business assets tests should be revised or updated. Financial Implications 30. Releasing the discussion document will not have any fiscal implications. Any fiscal implications resulting from the proposals will be included in final policy advice to Cabinet following consultation. Legislative Implications 31. The release of the discussion document will not give rise to any immediate legislative i mplications. Legislative changes will be necessary to implement the proposals. It is proposed that any resulting changes are included in an omnibus taxation bill to be introduced in the second half of 2022. Impact Analysis Regulatory Impact Assessment 32. An interim Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) has been completed and is attached in appendix two. 33. The Quality Assurance reviewer from Inland Revenue has reviewed the D ividend integrity and personal services income attribution interim RIS prepared by Inland Revenue and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the RIS partially meets the quality assurance criteria. This is because the impacts on the affected taxpayers are currently unknown. Consultation on the proposals may help to inform the likely magnitude of the impacts and to refine the design of the proposals to minimise or reduce compliance costs. Inland Revenue will report back to Cabinet 6 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 08:25:27 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] with a final RIS with further information on these impacts when final policy decisions are sought following public consultation. Climate Implications of Policy Assessment 34. A Climate Implications of Policy Assessment (CIPA) is not required for the proposals in the discussion document. Population Implications 35. Releasing the discussion document will not have any population implications. Any p opulation implications resulting from the proposals will be included in final policy advice to Cabinet following consultation. Human Rights 36. The proposals contained in the discussion document are not inconsistent with the N ew Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993. Consultation 37. The Treasury and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) were co nsulted on this paper. 38. A key priority for New Zealand is lifting productivity including through establishment o f high growth firms and innovative start-ups. MBIE agrees with the intention of the policy to remove certain abuses and tax avoidance behaviour of individuals, particularly where they invoice via a company simply to avoid the higher personal tax rate, and/or retain earnings rather than paying themselves a dividend, so as to realise these earnings upon selling the company. However, MBIE is concerned that an unintended consequence of this policy may be to disincentivise the establishment of and investment in start-ups by founders and investors. 39. We would like to understand better whether the tax liability associated with the re tained earnings that founders/investors face upon the sale of shares is likely to be higher than that faced in comparable jurisdictions where capital gains taxes would apply and are significantly lower than personal income tax rates (or where tax incentives are in place for such businesses). If so, this could impact both entrepreneurs and early stage investors and the strong positive externalities they bring, or result in unintended consequences where companies rather than keep retained earnings, spend cash at hand immediately prior to the sale (on unproductive assets/uses). 40. MBIE also notes that this policy may have high compliance costs for small business a round record keeping and reporting of ASC and capital gains. MBIE would welcome further assessment of potential impacts on, and incentives for, small business and start-ups created by this policy as it is further developed and implemented. Communications 41. Communications will be undertaken by Inland Revenue. The goal is to gain detailed f eedback from the tax and business communities. Key stakeholders will be contacted 7 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 08:25:27 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] and encouraged to make a submission. The discussion document will be hosted on Inland Revenue’s tax policy website, with the consultation period open for six weeks until Friday 29 April. 42. Media enquiries will be sent to Inland Revenue’s policy communications staff, who will work with Ministers’ Offices to coordinate responses. Proactive Release 43. I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key a dvice papers with appropriate redactions within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Recommendations The Ministers of Finance and Revenue recommend that the Committee: 1. note that the Ministers of Finance and Revenue previously decided to progress the w ork on measures to support the integrity of the 39% personal income tax rate in tranches, with tranche one comprising the subject matter of the discussion document titled Dividend integrity and personal services income attribution; 2. agree to the release of the abovementioned discussion document; 3. invite the Ministers of Finance and Revenue to report back to Cabinet on the outcome of the consultation and final policy recommendations in June.

1 In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Economic Development Committee UPDATE ON THE OPERATION OF INLAND REVENUE’S NEW INFORMATION COLLECTION PROVISIONS Proposal 1. The Taxation (Income Tax Rate and Other Amendments) Act 2020 introduced the new top personal tax rate of 39%. The Act also introduced new disclosure requirements for trusts and clarified that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue can collect information for tax policy purposes. 2. Cabinet invited me to report back on the operation of these information-collection provisions (CAB-20-MIN-0490 refers). Relation to Government priorities 3. The introduction of a new top personal tax rate of 39% formed part of the Labour Party’s manifesto for the 2020 General Election. New disclosure requirements were introduced for trusts to help evaluate the effectiveness of the 39% rate and gain insight into the use of structures and entities by trustees in New Zealand. 4. The amendment to clarify that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue can collect information for tax policy development purposes supports the integrity of the tax system and recognises that such information is critical to the development of tax policy. 5. Together with other parts of the Government’s Tax Policy Work Programme, these initiatives will contribute, in different ways, to greater transparency concerning the integrity and fairness of the tax system. Executive Summary 6. In November 2020, Cabinet invited me to report back on the operation of the new trust disclosure rules and the power to collect information for tax policy purposes (CAB-20- MIN-0490 refers). 7. The trust disclosure rules apply for the 2021–22 and later income years and require trustees to prepare financial statements and disclose details of settlements, settlors, distributions, beneficiaries and appointers. The rules were introduced to support the integrity of the 39% tax rate and to provide better information to understand and monitor the use of structures and entities by trustees. 1lp2bvftqb 2022-05-26 09:07:02 2 8. An Order in Council was made in March 2022 to set minimum requirements for financial statements prepared by trustees subject to the new rules. 1 The Order provides increased certainty for trustees regarding their reporting obligations, supports compliance with the disclosure rules, and improves the quality of data collected. 9. The provision to collect information for tax policy purposes has been used twice to date, with a further use planned in June 2022. All of these uses of the provision are for Inland Revenue’s current project to measure effective tax rates for a group of high net worth individuals (the High-Wealth Individuals Research Project). While Inland Revenue has been able to collect the inf ormation it has sought to date, some concerns have been raised by stakeholders regarding the extent to which information collected under this provision may be sufficiently separated from Inland Revenue’s compliance and enforcement functions and its confidentiality protected. Background 10. In November 2020, Cabinet agreed to implement a new personal income tax rate of 39% for income over $180,000 for the 2021–22 and later income years (CAB-20-MIN- 0484 refers). 11. Cabinet also agreed to a legislative amendment to clarify that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue can collect information for tax policy development purposes. There was some uncertainty about whether the collection of such information was permitted under existing law. The amendment was introduced to remove this uncertainty, in recognition that such information is critical to the development of good tax policy. 12. Cabinet also agreed to introduce new disclosure requirements for trusts for the 2021– 22 and later income years. Cabinet deferred the decision on whether to increase the trustee income tax rate to 39% to a later date pending information on whether there is a behavioural response to paying the new top personal income tax rate. The new disclosure requirements are expected to inform that decision by providing better information to understand and monitor the use of structures and entities by trustees. 13. The new 39% tax rate and the information collection amendments were introduced by the Taxation (Income Tax Rate and Other Amendments) Act 2020, which was enacted on 7 December 2020. 14. In November 2020, Cabinet invited the Minister of Revenue to report back to Cabinet on the operation of the new information collection provisions (CAB-20-MIN-0490). Collecting information for tax policy purposes 15. The Taxation (Income Tax Rate and Other Amendments) Act 2020 enacted section 17GB of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This section clarified that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue can collect information for tax policy development purposes. 16. This provision has been used twice to date, both times within Inland Revenue’s current project to measure effective tax rates for a group of high net worth individuals (HWIs). Inland Revenue lacks important knowledge about economic gains that fall outside the 1 Tax Administration (Financial Statements—Domestic Trusts) Order 2022. 1lp2bvftqb 2022-05-26 09:07:02 3 tax system and contribute to wealth accumulation, as noted by the 2019 Tax Working Group. This information gap limits Inland Revenue’s ability to assess the progressivity and integrity of the tax system. 17. This project is an extensive exercise, intended to result in a report in 2023. It acknowledges concerns relating to privacy and compliance costs through decisions made on the design of the process. 18. The first use of section 17GB was in October/November 2021. This involved seeking information from each of the selected individuals in the project population on the identity of their domestic partner, if any, and any dependent children, so that appropriate family units could be established for measurement purposes. This proceeded successfully, with a response rate in excess of 85%. 19. The second use of the provision was in February 2022, when Inland Revenue sought details of entities, such as trusts and companies, to which each household is materially connected. At the date of this paper, over 75% of the households have responded. 20. The key, and final, survey of financial data relating to the high-wealth families, and their identified entities, is expected to begin in June 2022. The information obtained will be analysed along with existing data held by Inland Revenue, as well as information from other public data sources. The full report will then be prepared. It is expected that the section 17GB provision will be used again for this exercise. Stakeholder concerns 21. In discussions with stakeholders, Inland Revenue has identified some concerns regarding section 17GB. Aside from expected issues with compliance costs, which Inland Revenue has sought to mitigate where possible, these concerns mainly relate to the extent to which collected information may be sufficiently separated from Inland Revenue’s compliance and enforcement functions and its confidentiality protected. 22. To date, these concerns have been addressed by careful planning of the project processes and by the Commissioner using her care and management powers to specifically prohibit the re-use of the information collected under this provision for non- policy analytical or risk assessment use. 23. Inland Revenue officials consulted the Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC) during the development of section 17GB and throughout the HWI research project. A Privacy Impact Assessment has been completed and the OPC is comfortable with Inland Revenue’s approach. 24. Inland Revenue officials will give further consideration over the next year to the concerns raised by stakeholders and will report back to me again on the operation of the provision once they have more experience with its use. Collecting information from trusts 25. The Taxation (Income Tax Rate and Other Amendments) Act 2020 introduced new disclosure rules for trusts for the 2021–22 and later income years. The rules apply to trusts that derive assessable income. Trustees with tax agents (approximately 94%) 1lp2bvftqb 2022-05-26 09:07:02 4 will have until 31 March 2023 to file their first return under the increased disclosure requirements. Trustees without tax agents must file by 7 July 2022. 26. The Privacy Commissioner was consulted during the development of the trust disclosure rules, and he considered that the proposed collection of personal information of beneficiaries of trusts posed a low privacy risk. 27. Since the rules were introduced in December 2020, minor amendments have been made to exempt certain categories of trusts from the disclosure rules and to carve out non-cash, minor distributions incidental to the operation of the trust from the disclosure requirements. 28. The disclosure rules include the requirement to prepare financial statements. An Order in Council was made on 7 March 2022 to set minimum standards for these financial statements (DEV-22-MIN-0016 refers). 29. Inland Revenue also published an Operational Statement on 6 April 2022, providing practical guidance on the trust disclosure requirements. Inland Revenue undertook a targeted marketing campaign in April 2022 to inform affected trustees of their reporting obligations. 30. Inland Revenue’s START system allows for real-time monitoring of compliance with the new rules as returns are filed. A post-implementation review of the operation of the disclosure rules and the Order in Council will be undertaken after 31 March 2023, once all returns have been filed for the 2021–22 income year. Retrospective information collection 31. The Taxation (Income Tax Rate and Other Amendments) Act 2020 also introduced a retrospective information collection provision. It allows the Commissioner to request a trustee of a trust to provide information that relates to the trust for a period beginning after the end of the 2013–14 income year (after 31 March 2014 for taxpayers with standard balance dates) and ending before the 2021–22 income year. 32. Inland Revenue officials have not yet made any decisions regarding the use and operation of this provision. Financial Implications 33. This paper has no financial implications. Legislative Implications 34. This paper has no legislative implications. Impact Analysis Regulatory Impact Assessment 35. This paper is not recommending any regulatory options or proposals. 1lp2bvftqb 2022-05-26 09:07:02 5 Climate Implications of Policy Assessment 36. This paper is not recommending any regulatory options or proposals. Population Implications 37. This paper has no population implications. Human Rights 38. This paper has no human rights implications. Consultation 39. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Treasury were consulted during the development of this paper. HWI research project 40. In preparing for the use of section 17GB for the HWI research project, Inland Revenue consulted the Crown Law Office, the New Zealand Law Society, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CA ANZ), the Corporate Taxpayers Group, and a number of tax professionals. Trust disclosure rules 41. Inland Revenue undertook targeted and public consultation in 2021 on the setting of minimum standards for financial statements by domestic trusts. Officials also consulted on operational guidance for the disclosure rules to address practical matters for trustees. 42. In addition to consulting with members of the tax and accounting community, Inland Revenue consulted with the External Reporting Board, the Department of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, the Ministry of Justice, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, Statistics NZ and the Treasury during the development of the minimum standards for financial statements prepared by domestic trusts. Proactive Release 43. I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers in whole within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Committee: 1. Note that, on 23 November 2020, Cabinet agreed to: 1.1 clarify the law to ensure that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has the power to collect information for tax policy purposes; and 1lp2bvftqb 2022-05-26 09:07:02 6 1.2 make amendments to require the collection of information from trustees to test compliance with the new 39% top personal income tax rate and provide better information to understand and monitor the use of structures and entities by trustees (CAB-20-MIN-0484 refers). 2. Note that, on 30 November 2020, Cabinet invited the Minister of Revenue to report back to Cabinet on the operation of the information-gathering provisions referred to in paragraphs 1.1 and 1.2 above (CAB-20-MIN-0490 refers). Collection of information for tax policy purposes 3. Note that the provision to collect information for tax policy purposes has been used twice to date, with a further use planned in June 2022, within Inland Revenue’s current project to measure effective tax rates for a group of high net worth individuals for the years 2016 to 2021. 4. Note that concerns have been raised by the private sector regarding the confidentiality of information obtained under this provision. 5. Note that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has used her care and management powers to specifically prohibit the use of information obtained under this provision against third parties or for non-policy analytical or risk assessment use. Collection of information from trusts 6. Note that Inland Revenue will undertake a post-implementation review of the disclosure rules in 2023, after all the returns for the 2021–22 year have been filed (31 March 2023).

1 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Offi ce of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Economic Development Committee Regular dataset collection from payment service providers Proposal 1 This paper seeks the Cabinet Economic Development Committee’s agreement to the final policy recommendations in relation to the Order in Council for the Regular dataset collection from payment service providers. Relation to Government Priorities 2 This proposal is part of the information collection and use workstream on the Government’s current tax policy work programme. The efficient and effective collection and use of information helps to support voluntary compliance with tax obligations and ensures that compliance and administration costs are minimised. The proposal also supports wider Government priorities of minimising opportunities for avoidance and evasion. Executive Summary 3 In this Cabinet paper, I am seeking agreement on the final policy recommendations in relation to the Order in Council for the Regular dataset collection from payment service providers (PSPs). Changes to the draft Order in Council will ensure the scheme works as intended and reduces the compliance costs to PSPs where appropriate. 4 The final policy recommendations are based on the feedback that was provided to Inland Revenue on the discussion document and the draft Order in Council that was released for consultation between 6 July 2021 and 20 August 2021 and the recommendations of officials. 5 If Cabinet agrees to these final policy recommendations, the appropriate amendments will be made to the draft Order in Council that was released for consultation. The final draft Order in Council will then be taken to the Cabinet Legislation Committee later in 2022. 2qddsziq5 2022-11-18 15:37:42 Doc 1 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Background 6 New legislation was enacted in 2019 to address the need for the regular dataset collection of large datasets. On 10 March 2021, Cabinet authorised the drafting of the Order in Council for the Regular dataset collection from payment service providers by Parliamentary Counsel Office and agreed to the release of a discussion document and the draft Order in Council for consultation (refer DEV- 21-MIN-0020). 7 Consultation took place between 6 July 2021 and 20 August 2021 and officials have considered the feedback that was submitted. This paper outlines the final policy decisions that are recommended by officials to be made to the draft Order in Council that was prepared by Parliamentary Counsel Office for the consultation on the proposal. 8 It is expected that the Order in Council will come into force December 2022, but the first reporting period is set to commence on 1 April 2023. Next steps 9 If Cabinet agrees with the recommendations in this paper, I will instruct the Parliamentary Counsel Office to make the appropriate amendments to the draft Order in Council for the Regular dataset collection from payment service providers. 10 A Cabinet paper will then be presented at the Cabinet Legislation Committee with the amended Order in Council which will then be sent to Cabinet for final approval. Feedback from consultation and final policy recommendations Income threshold of merchants 11 To reduce compliance costs for PSPs, it was initially proposed that reporting would only be required from PSPs on merchants whose income was below $30 million. The $30 million threshold falls in line with international requirements set by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). 12 Feedback from consultation was that this threshold would increase the compliance costs of PSPs, with many of the submitters suggesting the threshold be removed. I recommend that the $30 million threshold be removed as it will have the opposite impact on the compliance costs of PSPs than what was intended. Format of the datasets reported to Inland Revenue 13 The datasets that PSPs are to provide to Inland Revenue can be in either a raw (for example, each transaction), or an aggregated (for example, total electronic sales), format. This was not specified in the draft Order in Council. The feedback from stakeholders was mixed regarding which format would reduce compliance costs of PSPs. 2qddsziq5 2022-11-18 15:37:42 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 14 I recommend that PSPs must provide the outlined datasets in an aggregated format to Inland Revenue. Officials consider that the best way for Inland Revenue to receive the data is in an aggregate format as it reduces the costs involved to process and store the data. Frequency of reporting the data to Inland Revenue 15 It was initially proposed that PSPs would be required to supply merchants’ data every quarter, with the datasets being due to be reported to Inland Revenue 20 working days after the final day of the reporting period. 16 The general consensus from submitters w as that supplying the data quarterly was too frequent and the due date of reporting the data to Inland Revenue 20 working days after the end of the reporting period was not enough time. 17 One benefit from the introduction of the regular dataset collection is early intervention such as education and identifying non-compliance earlier. To secure these, the datasets need to be provided soon enough for Inland Revenue to act on any potential non-compliance. 18 Australia has annual reporting requirements for PSPs, but officials consider that this will be too infrequent for Inland Revenue to effectively capture and act on any potential non-compliance. I recommend that the reporting period be six months and that the datasets are to be provided to Inland Revenue one month and seven days after the end of the reporting period. 19 I recommend that the six-monthly reporting periods align with the end of the financial year. The reporting periods should be 1 April to 30 September and 1 October to 31 March. The subsequent dates the datasets would be required to be reported to Inland Revenue is proposed to be 7 November and 7 May. Application date of the Order in Council 20 I recommend that the application date of the Order in Council is 1 April 2023 with the first of the six-month datasets due to Inland Revenue on 7 November 2023. This should give PSPs enough time to amend their systems to collect and report the required datasets. 21 I recommend that the PSPs who require more time to amend their systems to collect and provide the datasets to Inland Revenue should be able to apply to the Commissioner for an extension to the first required reporting date of 7 November 2023. The PSP will need to provide adequate reasoning to why they require the extension. 22 Although an extension is available to the PSPs that absolutely need it, I recommend that all PSPs must comply with the 7 May 2024 reporting date as this should provide sufficient time for all PSPs to implement any necessary systems changes. 2qddsziq5 2022-11-18 15:37:42 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] The supply of merchant identifying data by PSPs 23 It was proposed that PSPs would be required to report merchants’ IRD numbers because this information is the best way for Inland Revenue to correctly identify merchants. Some of the submitters stated that the identification information of merchants is infrequently captured, and when it is captured, it may be incorrect. 24 I recommend that the IRD numbers and NZBN of merchants are to be reported by PSPs if they hold the information. However, there will be no sanctions imposed if the PSP does not hold this information or supplies incorrect information that has been provided to them by a merchant without their knowledge. Definitions included in the Order in Council 25 The draft Order in Council currently includes definitions for merchant, payment, and payment service provider. 26 The proposed definition of a PSP was wide to allow for future changes in the market and the state of payment system technology. Submitters were concerned that the definition was too broad and ambiguous, which could lead to Inland Revenue receiving duplicate information when there is more than one PSP involved in the same transaction. 27 I recommend that the definition of a PSP should remain broad to account for future changes in the market and the state of payment system technology. To support PSPs, on the introduction of these rules, Inland Revenue will advise each PSP on whether they are required to report or not. 28 In response to feedback, it is suggested that inserting new and amending existing definitions in the draft Order will increase clarity and to ensure the scheme will work as intended. I recommend that amendments are made to the definitions of “merchant” and “payment” and that a definition of “acquirer” is added to the Order in Council. Exemption of PSPs 29 The initial proposal allowed an exemption to be granted to a PSP who had subcontracted another PSP to undertake payments processing where the required information is held by the contracted provider. Submitters were concerned that the exemption provision was too ambiguous as it could refer to an exemption applying to a specific merchant rather than to a PSP or part of the PSPs business. 30 I recommend the exemption provision be amended to clearly reflect that it applies to all of or some of a PSP’s business only and does not apply to specific merchants. I also recommend that the exemption should be applied for through a prescribed form and that the Commissioner may revoke and exemption at any time if there are changes in the payment system or the PSP’s business. 2qddsziq5 2022-11-18 15:37:42 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Penalties that apply to non-compliance 31 It was initially proposed that criminal sanctions, ranging from fines to imprisonment, for failure to provide information would apply to PSPs compliance with the obligations in the Order in Council. 32 The feedback from submitters was that criminal penalties for non-compliance with reporting obligations was unduly harsh. 33 I recommend that the steps that Inland Revenue will take before criminal penalties are imposed on PSPs be clearly outlined in the Order in Council so PSPs have certainty of the process that will be taken before criminal penalties are considered or imposed. 34 These steps include: 34.1 notify the payment service provider of the due date for the provision or the information; and 34.2 communicate with the payment service provider to find out why the information has not been provided, and in particular if there are impediments delaying or preventing its provision; and 34.3 advise the payment service provider of the consequences of not providing the information to the Commissioner. 35 I recommend that criminal sanctions should apply for the failure to provide information. However, on the enactment of the Order in Council, Inland Revenue will advise all existing PSPs whether they are required to report. New PSPs that enter the market will be able to ask Inland Revenue to confirm whether they are required to report, which should provide certainty to the PSPs. 36 Any substantial change to the penalties regime would require changes to primary legislation. The publication of PSP’s names 37 Originally, it was proposed that the names of the PSPs that were required to report were to be publicised. Submitters were concerned that the publication of names could potentially create unfair market competition, especially with international providers that are not captured by these reporting rules. 38 I recommend that the names of PSPs that will be captured under the reporting rules not be publicised. Future information requests 39 Inland Revenue can request information under the proposed Order in Council and under existing production order powers under the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). 2qddsziq5 2022-11-18 15:37:42 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 40 Submitters raised concerns that they may be required to provide the same information repeatedly to Inland Revenue, once as part of this PSP initiative, and as part of a production order issued by the Commissioner. The submitters sought assurance that production orders would not be used in the future for the same PSP information. 41 I recommend that Inland Revenue may continue to request information from PSPs using a production order as allowed under the TAA for any further information that is not captured under the Order in Council. To provide assurance to PSPs, Inland Revenue will provide an operational understanding that the information already collected under this Order in Council will not subsequently be requested under a production order under the TAA. Who is required to report 42 If the PSP meets Inland Revenue’s definition of being a third-party business who facilitates payment for goods and services between customers and merchants, they may be required to report. Inland Revenue wants to ensure that there is no double-up reporting of data, but also need to ensure that all merchant data is reported by a PSP. 43 I recommend that a PSP may apply to the Commissioner for an exemption from reporting the datasets required under the Order in Council. The PSP would need to provide evidence supporting their application that another PSP captures the same data and would be more suitable to report the required datasets. The Commissioner will determine whether the PSP will be captured under the Order in Council. 44 I recommend that if a PSP is the sole facilitator and data holder, they will be required to report the datasets holding the merchant’s transactions to Inland Revenue. Fiscal Implications 45 It is expected that the financial impacts of the implementation of this Order in Council to be fiscally neutral. This is because the implementation will simply change the legislative mechanism through which this information is collected. 46 The Order in Council is allowing for the regular collection of the datasets Inland Revenue currently collect on an ad hoc basis from some of the largest PSPs. This means the Order in Council is not collecting new datasets or facilitating the detection and collection of new revenue from the hidden economy. 47 From a previous production order request, as allowed under the TAA, Inland Revenue were able to collect datasets from some of the large PSPs. The information gathered from former measurement systems on the benefits from using PSP data showed better targeting of Inland Revenue resources, an increased strike rate (identifying non-compliant taxpayers), increased tax revenue for the Government of $37.5M, a 20% reduction in staff hours being spent on each case, and an 11% increase on return on investment. 2qddsziq5 2022-11-18 15:37:42 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Legislative Implications 48 An Order in Council will be necessary to give effect to the regular collection of payment service provider data. Impact Analysis Regulatory Impact Assessment 49 The Quality Assurance panel at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Regular dataset collection from payment service providers Regulatory Impact Assessment prepared by Inland Revenue and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Regulatory Impact Assessment meets the quality assurance criteria. Climate Implications of Policy Assessment 50 The Ministry for the Environment has been consulted and confirms that the Climate Implications of Policy Assessment (CIPA) requirements do not apply to this proposal, as the threshold for significance is not met. Population Implications 51 This proposal has no population implications. Human Rights 52 I consider that the proposals contained in the discussion document are consistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993. Consultation 53 The Treasury and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet have been consulted and agree with the contents of this paper. 54 The Parliamentary Counsel Office, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment were consulted on these issues. 55 A public discussion document was released for consultation alongside the draft Order in Council. Inland Revenue received responses from 12 stakeholders. 2qddsziq5 2022-11-18 15:37:42 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Communications 56 I will make an announcement on the enactment of the Order in Council advising that information can now be collected from payment service providers. Also, Inland Revenue will be releasing information on their website and will be engaging with affected payment service providers. Proactive Release 57 I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers with appropriate redactions within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Recommendations I recommend that the Cabinet Economic Development Committee: 1 invite the Minister of Revenue to instruct the Parliamentary Counsel Office to make the appropriate amendments to the draft Order in Council. 2 agree that the reporting threshold of $30 million be removed and that PSPs are required to report on the transactions of all merchants. 3 agree that PSPs must report the datasets on each merchant in an aggregated format to Inland Revenue. 4 agree that the reporting frequency is to be set at six-monthly periods of 1 April to 30 September and 1 October to 31 March. 5 agree that the due date for reporting the datasets to Inland Revenue be one month and seven days after the end of the reporting period being 7 November and 7 May. 6 agree that the application date of the Order in Council will be 1 April 2023 with the first datasets to be reported by PSPs to Inland Revenue by 7 November 2023. 7 agree that a PSP can apply for an extension to the Commissioner with sufficient reasoning to the first reporting date but must comply with the 7 May 2024 reporting date. 8 agree that if the PSP holds the specified merchant data, such as the IRD number, it must be provided to Inland Revenue. 9 note that sanctions will not be imposed if the PSP does not hold the merchant identifying information or supplies incorrect merchant identifying information that was provided to them by a merchant without their knowledge. 10 agree that the definition of PSP should remain broad. 2qddsziq5 2022-11-18 15:37:42 9 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 11 agree that definitions in the Order in Council are amended or added to ensure the scheme works as intended. 12 agree that PSPs are required to apply for an exemption that applies to some of, or all of, the PSPs business using a form prescribed by the Commissioner. 13 agree that the Commissioner may revoke an exemption at any time. 14 note that criminal sanctions will be used as a last resort and will continue to apply to PSPs. 15 agree that the steps that will be taken by Inland Revenue before criminal sanctions are considered be clearly outlined in the Order in Council. 16 agree that Inland Revenue will advise all existing PSPs on whether they are required to report. 17 agree that the names of PSPs are not to be published. 18 note that Inland Revenue can use production orders under the TAA for any further information that is required from PSPs that is not captured under the repeat dataset collection. 19 agree that if the PSP is the sole facilitator and data holder, they will be required to report the datasets holding the merchant’s transactions to Inland Revenue. 20 agree that a PSP can apply through a prescribed form for an exemption from the reporting requirements by providing sufficient evidence that another PSP is more suitable to provide the required datasets to the Commissioner.

Doc 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Previously Inland Revenue could only practically access information from a small number of PSPs using the information gathering power in the Tax Administration Act 1994. This information gathering power provided for one-off requests to PSPs but not ongoing provision of information. The data collected related to approximately 16,000 merchants in the hospitality industry. This data identified 1,825 high risk merchants which were investigated and resulted in 1,200 merchants being assessed for under reporting their income for both Income tax and GST. The information gathered from former measurement systems on the benefits from using PSP data showed better targeting of Inland Revenue resources, an increased strike rate (identifying non- compliant taxpayers), increased tax revenue for the Government of $37.5M, a 20% reduction in staff hours being spent on each case, and an 11% increase on return on investment. What is the policy problem or opportunity? Inland Revenue’s ability to access good quality, accurate information is essential to the smooth running of the tax system. Such information allows Inland Revenue to see whether the correct amount of tax has been paid and provide quicker, simpler, and more accurate services to taxpayers. Unlike taxpayers who have tax deducted at source, such as employees or recipients of interest income, merchants who sell goods and services receive income prior to it being taxed. This gives them the ability to decide whether to declare this income for tax purposes. Also, information obtained from a small number of PSPs in the past on a subset of merchants has demonstrated non-compliance by some merchants and this is expected to be the case when compliance by all merchants is checked. The policy problem is that information is not collected on all merchants in a consistent and ongoing basis to enable Inland Revenue to ensure compliance by all merchants. The opportunity is that accessing this information would increase the integrity of the tax system by ensuring merchants comply with their obligations and increased perception of fairness and equity between taxpayers. Inland Revenue considers there are around 50 organisations in the financial service market providing services to an estimated 180,000 merchants. What objectives are sought in relation to the policy problem? The objective is to protect the integrity of the tax system by identifying merchants who are not complying with their tax obligations as well as identifying merchants who need assistance to enable them to comply. Section 2: Deciding upon an option to address the policy problem What criteria will be used to compare options to the status quo? The criteria used to assess the proposal to collect information against the status quo are as follows: • Administration costs – the effort required to administer the proposal should be kept to a minimum to maximise the benefits to the Government. • Compliance costs – The costs in complying with this intervention for PSPs and merchants should be kept to a minimum. • Fairness or equity – all taxpayers should comply with their tax obligations. Those businesses who do not comply enjoy a competitive advantage over those businesses who do. • Integrity of the tax system or perceptions of integrity – Inland Revenue should have access to information necessary to ensure taxpayer compliance and taxpayers are incentivised to voluntarily comply with their obligations. In general, these criteria work together and do not require significant trade-offs. However, the criterion of integrity, as defined in section 6 of the Tax Administration Act, includes the “rights of taxpayers to have their affairs kept confidential”. When it comes to exceptions to confidentiality, 2qddsziq5 2022-10-05 10:40:44 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] including information sharing, there is an inherent trade-off between confidentiality and fairness or equity. It should be noted however, particularly in relation to disclosures for tax-related purposes, that the statutory concept of integrity also includes the responsibility of taxpayers to comply with the law. What scope will options be considered within? The existing legislative settings provide the scope that the options will be considered within. These settings enable Inland Revenue to collect information more regularly from groups of people by way of a regulation. What options are being considered? There are three options being considered in this RIS. The first is the status quo of not collecting the information. The other two options are to collect merchant sales information from PSPs by way of a regulation either collecting aggregated merchant data (option 2) or raw merchant data (option 3). Not all PSPs will be required to report as some of their information is held by other associated PSPs and some do not provide the services that this policy is targeting, for example, those who provide software services to PSPs. Inland Revenue will be discussing with PSPs what services they provide and therefore whether they will be required to report on or not. Consultation was undertaken with the industry and other interested parties on the detailed features of the proposals to collect information from PSPs. Those who submitted on the discussion document generally wanted changes to the proposal to reduce the compliance costs that PSPs would face. Officials consider that most of the changes suggested by submitters would reduce compliance costs while ensuring the objective is met. These include removing the threshold on which merchants need to be reported on, extending the reporting period, and filing date, clarifying the exemption process and the definitions. Appendix 1 outlines the feedback from submitters and officials’ response to the issues raised. The following table compares the three options against the criteria and provides an overall assessment of the options. 2qddsziq5 2022-10-05 10:40:44 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Criteria Status quo Collection of aggregated merchant data from PSPs Collection of raw merchant data from PSPs Administration costs There are some administrative costs for Inland Revenue in trying to identify non- compliant merchants and in issuing ad hoc information requests to some PSPs - Administration costs of processing and analysing information increase - Reduction in current costs of identifying non- compliant merchants + Overall assessment is neutral Receiving a very large number of transactions for all merchants in NZ would impose high administration costs in storing and using the information and poses risks to Inland Revenue’s IT systems. - Compliance costs No additional compliance costs + Compliance costs are imposed on PSPs (-) For those PSPs that favoured the collection of aggregated data, compliance costs would be kept to a minimum. (+) For those PSPs that favoured the collection of raw data, compliance costs would not be reduced. (-) Overall assessment is (-) Collection costs are imposed on PSPs. (-) For those PSPs that favoured the collection of raw data, compliance costs would be kept to a minimum. (+) Other PSPs that favour the collection of aggregated data, compliance costs would not be reduced. (-) Overall assessment is (-) Fairness and Equity Compliant merchants face higher costs (Revenue and compliance) than non- compliant merchants. - Greater merchant compliance increases actual and perceived fairness and equity of the tax system. Collecting information on all merchants and from a wider group of PSPs will increase perceptions of fairness and equity + Greater merchant compliance increases actual and perceived fairness and equity. + Integrity of the tax system Undermines the integrity of the tax system Pressure on other sources of revenue to provide funds for public services - Improved merchant compliance improves the integrity of the tax system + Improved merchant compliance improves the integrity of the tax system + Overall score -- + Neutral 2qddsziq5 2022-10-05 10:40:44 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] What option is likely to best address the problem, meet the policy objectives, and deliver the highest net benefits? The proposal to collect aggregate merchant sales information from PSPs, option 2, is the preferred option. It achieves the objective of increased compliance with tax obligations, whilst the incorporation of a lot of the suggestions from submitters during the consultation process should keep compliance costs for PSPs to a minimum. What are the marginal costs and benefits of the option? The preferred option for i mproved compliance by businesses improves tax revenue collected, increases the fairness and equity of the tax system, and contributes to maintaining the integrity of the tax system. The pr eferred option will impose some compliance costs on PSPs. PSPs have not given an indication of the quantum of these costs, and this was not unexpected as these costs are commercially sensitive. PSPs may pass these costs onto merchants by way of increased charges. However, in Inland Revenue’s consultations with the industry on the features of the proposal, many of the suggested changes proposed by submitters to reduce compliance costs have been included in the design of the proposal and this should keep compliance costs to a minimum. Although the administration costs of processing and the evaluation of merchant information will increase, the existing administrative costs associated with identifying struggling or non-compliant merchants is likely to reduce. Benefits of pr o posal to PSP Levels the playing field which increases fairness: information will be collected from a greater number of PSPs thereby increasing fairness. Due to legislative constraints and resource demands in the past, information was only requested from a small number of PSPs, resulting in unequal obligations across the industry and potentially placing reporting PSPs at a competitive disadvantage. Certainty of legal authority which reduces compliance costs: The proposed regulation will provide greater detail and certainty to PSPs around what information is required, the due date for reporting information, and the format for providing the information to Inland Revenue. Certainty enables PSPs to automate what used to be an ad hoc manual reporting process, thereby reducing compliance costs. Benefits to the tax system Obtaining data and having the ability to analyse it more regularly benefits both Inland Revenue and merchants. It allows Inland Revenue to identify and provide support to merchants earlier where they are at risk of non-compliance. It also allows Inland Revenue to identify and understand the signs/triggers of non-compliant behaviour so that it can develop effective solutions more easily. There should be positive effects on merchants’ compliance as they understand how the changes will close opportunities for under-reporting. Inland Revenue will benefit from a more extensive and timelier source of data to support its role of administering the Revenue Acts and protecting the integrity of the tax system. The public will benefit through improved tax compliance. More of the tax collected that should be increases the Government’s options to improve public services for New Zealanders and reduces the pressure on other parts of the tax system to fund these public services. Examples of the benefits of the proposed collection of merchant sales information for both merchants and the integrity of the tax system were included in the discussion document 2qddsziq5 2022-10-05 10:40:44 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Section 3: Delivering an option How will the new arrangements be implemented? Consultation with PSPs The outcome from consultation with PSPs will be considered by Ministers prior to the proposal being considered by Cabinet. The issues raised and officials’ responses are outlined in appendix 1. Feedback from submitters was that to assist them to comply with their obligations PSPs would like certainty on whether they would be required to report. Officials agree and propose that submitters be able to seek clarification from Inland Revenue on whether they are required to report. Submitters felt that the imposition of only criminal penalties for a PSPs non-compliance with reporting obligations was harsh. Instead, they suggested that either the legislation be amended to provide for both civil and criminal sanctions or provide clarity on when criminal sanctions would be applied. Additionally, submitters stated that PSPs should not be penalised for inaccurate information provided by the merchant that was subsequently reported to Inland Revenue. Other taxpayers who do not comply with tax obligations may face criminal penalties. The ability to alter the tax penalties regime to also impose civil penalties on PSPs would require changes to primary legislation and involves a fundamental review of how non-compliance by taxpayers is penalised and is not considered further in this RIS. How ever, Inland Revenue’s existing administrative practice and processes around penalising non- compliance generally reserves criminal penalties for the most serious cases of non-compliance. Communicating this administrative practice when implementing the collection proposal should address submitters’ concerns. Officials are also considering whether the Order in Council could be amended to outline this practice and processes. Regulation The Tax Administration Act enables regulations to be enacted specifying a person or class of person who are required to provide information for tax administration purposes. If Ministers agree with the preferred proposal, a regulation will be enacted to provide for the collection of information. The outside the tax system. It also improves verification of reported GST taxable supplies. Increased compliance by businesses improves the fairness and equity of the tax system and relieves the pressure elsewhere in the tax system to collect the revenue required by the Government. Previous evidence from obtaining information from PSPs shows benefits to the tax system. systems on the benefits from using PSP information showed a 20% reduction in audit case hours, an 11% increase in audit return on investment and overall increase of $37.5M in revenue. Total monetised benefits N/A N/A Non-monetised benefits Low Medium 2qddsziq5 2022-10-05 10:40:44 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] regulation will also specify the type of information requested, the reporting method, the frequency of collection, and the form the information is required in. Implementing the pr oposal An Inland Revenue manager is responsible for this proposal and has a project team currently in place to develop and deliver the implementation of the proposed regulation. As well as the policy process, there are several streams of work that need to be undertaken: (1) Engagement with the PSPs, (2) Data specifications and requirements, (3) Ingesting the data, (4) Matching and analysis of the data, (5) Insights and use of the data to inform interventions, (6) Ongoing operational and compliance support. The areas within Inland Revenue that have responsibility to deliver the above streams of work are part of the project. Once implemented these streams of work will become part of each area’s business as usual work. For example, the data matching will be part of the existing data matching programme and the engagement with PSPs will be incorporated into the external relationship area to manage. The insights gained from collecting this information will inform and be used in the compliance programme. Managing the external data will follow Inland Revenue’s existing processes. The Inland Revenue manager responsible for delivering this stream of work and the technical specialists have oversight of the project and are responsible for it being implemented and then utilised. How will the new arrangements be monitored, evaluated, and reviewed? This data and insights will inform a stream of work sitting within the compliance programme. The data on merchant sales will be a significant source of information and insights that will be used to support the achievement of the vision for addressing income suppression. There will be a lead person with responsibility and oversight, with a planned approach for utilising this data and information. Both the business owner and the lead person will have oversight of monitoring the regulation, ensuring compliance with it, and ultimately seeking an evaluation of the outcomes being achieved with the use of the data. 2qddsziq5 2022-10-05 10:40:44 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Appendix 1 the outcome of consultation with PSPs and other submitters and officials’ responses. Proposed Feedback from submitters Officials recommend Threshold It was proposed that reporting would be required on merchants whose income was below $30m. There was an overwhelming amount of feedback from submitters that the threshold would create compliance costs in identifying which merchants to report on. To remove the threshold, therefore requiring PSPs to report on the transactions of all merchants. Data Merchant data provided to Inland Revenue is either raw (each transaction) or aggregated. There was a mixed response from submitters as to which option would reduce compliance costs. Some submitters consider it is easier to provide the raw data to IR or that the raw data would enable Inland Revenue to identify duplicate information which it receives from two PSPs. Aggregate data is currently the best way for Inland Revenue to receive data due to the costs involved with processing and storing raw data. In identifying which PSPs are required to report, consideration is given to reducing duplicate information. Officials recommend that PSPs provide aggregate data on each merchant to Inland Revenue. Frequency of reporting Data to be provided to Inland Revenue every 3 months. There was overwhelming feedback from submitters for the frequency to be extended to reduce compliance costs. Although Australia has annual reporting, officials recommend 6- monthly reporting to maximise benefits from early intervention initiatives. For example, education and assistance initiatives as well as identifying non-compliance earlier. The 6-monthly reporting periods would be 1 April to 30 September and 1 October to 31 March to align with the end of the tax year. Due date for reporting Due date to be 20 working days following the end of the reporting period. Some submitters wanted more time to file the information after the reporting period. There is a trade-off between providing more time for PSPs to report and Inland Revenue being able to act on the information sooner. Officials recommend moving the due date for reporting to a month and seven days from the end of the reporting period, namely, 7 November and 7 May. Merchant identifying data A merchant’s IRD number is required to identify the merchant. Submitters commented that merchant IRD numbers were infrequently captured and could not be relied on to be correct. Merchant IRD numbers or NZBN remain the best way to correctly identify merchants. Officials recommend that PSPs be required to provide merchant IRD number/NZBN where the information is available. No 2qddsziq5 2022-10-05 10:40:44 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] sanction will apply if information is not provided or is incorrect. PSPs will be encouraged to capture and supply the IRD number/NZBN. Publication of PSPs’ names Inland Revenue to publish the names of those PSPs required to report and the types of information reported. Submitters were concerned that publication could create unfair market competition, especially with international providers who are not captured by these rules. Officials agree that the names of PSPs should not be published. Note that the publication of the types of information being reported is set out in the regulation and no further publication is necessary. Definition of PSP The current definition of a PSP is wide to take account of market and technology changes in the future. Submitters were concerned that the definition is too broad and ambiguous, and Inland Revenue would receive duplicate information where multiple PSPs are involved in the same transaction. Also, submitters wanted certainty regarding whether a PSP is required to report or not. Officials recommend that the definition of a PSP remain broad to cater for future changes in the payments industry. Also, if requested, Inland Revenue will confirm whether a PSP is required to report as well as notifying those PSPs that are exempt from the reporting requirements. This should reduce duplication of information where multiple PSPs are involved in the same transaction and provide certainty to PSPs of their obligations. Exemption of PSPs PSPs be exempt from requirement to provide information about a merchant if the information is gathered by another PSP. Submitters suggested that the current exemption provision is ambiguous as it could refer to an exemption applying to a specific merchant rather than to a PSP or part of the PSPs business. Officials agree and recommend that the exemption provision be amended so that the exemption applies to a PSP only and not to certain merchants. The exemption can apply to all or some of the PSP’s business. Officials also recommend that the exemption application should be on a prescribed form to ensure all the relevant information is provided to the Commissioner to assist in deciding whether to exempt a PSP. The Commissioner may revoke an exemption at any time if there are changes in payments system or with the PSP’s business. Penalties that apply to non- compliance. The standard penalties regime applies to PSPs compliance Submitters felt that criminal penalties being imposed on PSPs for non-compliance with reporting obligations was harsh. Officials consider that criminal penalties would apply to PSP non- compliance. A criminal sanction would only be imposed as a last 2qddsziq5 2022-10-05 10:40:44 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] with the obligations in the regulation. They wanted certainty on whether they were required to report. Also, PSPs should not be penalised for inaccurate information provided by the merchant that was subsequently reported to Inland Revenue. resort when all other avenues have been exhausted or where the severity of the offence warrants it. Also, on commencement of the regulation, all existing PSPs will be advised whether they are required to report. New PSPs will be able to ask Inland Revenue to confirm whether they are required to report. This should provide certainty. Where merchant information is available PSPs are required to report that information. However, PSPs will not be penalised for reporting inaccurate information that was provided to them by a merchant. Future information requests Inland Revenue can request information under the proposed regulation and under existing production order section 17B of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Submitters raised concerns that they may be required to provide the same information repeatedly to Inland Revenue, once as part of this PSP initiative, and as part of a pr oduction order issued by the Commissioner. Submitters sought assurance that production orders would not be used in the future for the same PSP information. Inland Revenue will provide an operational understanding to PSPs that information already requested under the regulation will not subsequently be requested under a production order. However, Inland Revenue may need further information than provided under this Order and therefore a production order may be used. Definitions The regulation defines a merchant, and a payment service provider. Submitters and officials have suggested inserting new or amending existing definitions in the Order to ensure the scheme will work as intended. Officials recommend minor changes to the definitions for clarity. 2qddsziq5 2022-10-05 10:40:44

IR2021/321: Amendments to commencement dates in the Child Support Amendment Act 2021 Page 1 of 4 28 July 2021 Minister of Revenue Amendments to commencement dates in the Child Support Amendment Act 2021 Summary Purpose 1. This report seeks your agreement to amend by Order in Council the commencement dates for recent child support amendments to align with the move of child support to Inland Revenue’s new technology platform START. Background 2. The Child Support Amendment Act 2021 (CSAA) was enacted on 24 March 2021. Its purpose was to make amendments to further improve the administration of the child support scheme. This took advantage of the opportunity offered by the modernisation of Inland Revenue’s system. 3. When the Child Support Amendment Bill was introduced, it was intended that the child support scheme would move to Inland Revenue’s new system (START) in April 2021. However, due to COVID-19, this move was delayed until the second half of 2021. Because of this delay, the commencement dates of many the proposals in the CSAA were changed to 1 April 2022 or an earlier date as set by Order in Council. Proposal 4. Moving child support to START is now set for Labour Weekend 2021. As such, commencement dates for provisions relating to the administration of the scheme will need to be amended. Officials recommend that generally the dates be amended to 26 October 2021 to align with the move. However, for provisions relating to penalty changes, such as the introduction of the grace period, it is preferable that they apply from the beginning of a month. Officials therefore propose such provisions apply from 1 November 2021. The affected sections and the commencement date for each are listed in Appendix A to this report. 5. Provisions relating to the annual assessment of child support, such as the changes to what is included as income, will apply from 1 April 2022 being the start of the next child support year. Consultation 6. The Treasury was consulted in the preparation of this report. Next steps 7.

IR2021/397: Cabinet paper – Orders in Council setting child support amendent’s commencement dates Page 1 of 2 21 September 2021 Minister of Revenue Cabinet paper – Orders in Council setting child support amendment’s commencement dates Purpose 1. This report asks you to approve the attached draft Cabinet paper and accompanying Orders in Council for lodgement with the Cabinet Office by 10am on Thursday, 23 September 2021, for consideration at the Cabinet Legislation Committee meeting on Thursday, 30 September 2021. Background 2. The Child Support Amendment Act 2021 was enacted on 24 March 2021. Its purpose was to make amendments to improve the administration of the child support scheme. This took advantage of the opportunity offered by the modernisation of Inland Revenue’s system. 3. When the Child Support Amendment Bill was introduced, it was intended that the child support scheme would move to Inland Revenue’s START system in April 2021. However, due to COVID-19, this move was delayed until the second half of 2021. Because of this delay, the commencement dates of many the proposals in the Child Support Amendment Act were changed to 1 April 2022 or an earlier date as set by Order in Council (as were the child support amendments in the Taxation (Budget 2021 and Remedial Measures) Act 2021). 4. Moving child support to START is now set for Labour Weekend 2021. As such, commencement dates for provisions relating to the administration of the scheme need to be amended. 5. To achieve these commencement dates, officials recommend that you seek a waiver of the 28-day rule, which requires regulations to be notified in the New Zealand Gazette 28 days prior to their coming into effect. 6. You have previously agreed to amend the commencement dates by Order in Council \[report IR2021/321 refers\]. 7. The Parliamentary Counsel Office have drafted two Orders in Council. One sets the commencement dates for amendments in the Child Support Amendment Act 2021 and the other sets the commencement dates for amendments in the Taxation (Budget 2021 and Remedial Measures) Act 2021. Consultation 8. The Treasury was consulted in the preparation of this report. Next steps 9. A draft Cabinet paper and associated Orders in Council are attached for you to take to the Cabinet Legislation Committee on Thursday, 30 September 2021. IR2021/397: Cabinet paper – Orders in Council setting child support amendent’s commencement dates Page 2 of 2 10. Inland Revenue officials will provide speaking notes for taking the paper through the Cabinet Legislation Committee. Specifically, these will identify what the proposed changes are, the purpose for these changes, and address key concerns which may arise. 11. Officials recommend you sign the attached Order in Council “goatskin” cover sheets, for submission to Cabinet office with the Cabinet paper. 12. Officials consider that the attached Cabinet paper should be proactively released within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions, subject to minor redactions under the Official Information Act 1992. Recommended action We recommend that you: 13. note you have agreed to amend by Order in Council the commencement dates of specific amendments to the Child Support Act 1991; Noted 14. agree to seek a waiver of the 28-day rule so that the commencement of specific provisions is aligned with the move of child support to Inland Revenue’s new technology platform START; Agreed /Not agreed 15. approve for lodgement the attached Cabinet paper and the Orders in Council to the Cabinet Legislation Committee by 10am Thursday 23 September 2021 for consideration at the Cabinet Legislation Committee meeting on Thursday 30 September 2021; Approved/Not approved 16. sign and refer the attached Orders in Council “goatskin” cover sheets, for submission to Cabinet Office with the Cabinet paper; and Signed and referred/Not signed and referred 17. agree to the release of the attached Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers, within 30 days of Cabinet making final decisions, subject to minor redactions under the Official Information Act 1992. Agreed/Not agreed C arolyn Elliott Policy Lead Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Hon David Parker Minister of Revenue / /2021 s 9(2)(a) In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee AMENDMENT TO APPLICATION DATES IN THE CHILD SUPPORT AMENDMENT ACT 2021 AND THE TAXATION (BUDGET 2021 AND REMEDIAL MEASURES) ACT 2021 Proposal 1.This paper seeks the Cabinet Legislation Committee’s to agree to the submission of th e two accompanying Orders in Council to the Executive Council: the Child Support Amendment Act 2021 Commencement Order 2021 and the Taxation (Budget 2021 and Remedial Measures) Act Commencement Order 2021. The Orders will amend the commencement dates of specific amendments in the Child Support Amendment Act 2021 and the Taxation (Budget 2021 and Remedial Measures) Act 2021. Relation to government priorities 2.The amendments will align the commencement dates for recent child support ame ndments with the move of child support to Inland Revenue’s new technology platform, START. This is an operational amendment that requires Cabinet approval. Background 3.The Child Support Amendment Act 2021 was enacted on 24 March 2021. Its pu rpose was to make amendments to the principal Act in order to improve the administration of the child support scheme. This took advantage of the opportunity offered by the modernisation of Inland Revenue’s system as part of Business Transformation. 4.When the Child Support Amendment Bill was introduced, it was intended that the chi ld support scheme would move to Inland Revenue’s START system in April 2021. However, due to COVID-19, this move was delayed until the second half of 2021. Because of this delay, the commencement dates of many of the proposals in the Child Support Amendment Act were changed to 1 April 2022 or an earlier date set by Order in Council (as were the child support amendments in the Taxation (Budget 2021 and Remedial Measures) Act 2021). Policy 5.Moving child support to START is now set for Labour Weekend 2021. As such, comme ncement dates for provisions relating to the administration of the scheme will need to be amended. I recommend the following: 5.1 for provisions relating to the administration of the scheme their comm encement dates be amended to 26 October 2021 to align with the move; and 1 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-09 02:17:08 3. 5.2 for provisions relating to penalty changes, such as the introduction of the grace period, it is preferable that they apply from the beginning of a month. Therefore, I propose these provisions apply from 1 November 2021. 6. The affected sections and the commencement date for each are listed in Appendix A t o this report. 7. Amending the commencement dates will be done by way of two Orders in Council – t he Child Support Amendment Act 2021 Commencement Order 2021 and the Taxation (Budget 2021 and Remedial Measures) Act Commencement Order 2021. 8. Provisions relating to the annual assessment of child support, such as the changes t o what is included as income, will continue to apply from 1 April 2022, being the start of the next child support year. Financial implications 9. There are three provisions where amending the commencement date will have fiscal i mplications. These are:  the introduction of the grace period,  the repeal of the rule which requires that the penalty be at least $5, and  the imposition of the second stage of the penalty (formerly known as the initial p enalty) from the 7th day after the due date to the 27th day after the due date. The costs of these changes are immaterial, -$25,000. The fiscal impact of the new co mmencement dates falls within rounding of annual forecasts. Timing and 28-day rule 10. If Cabinet agrees to the recommendations in this paper at the Cabinet meeting on 3 0 September 2021, the amendments will come into force on 26 October 2021 and 1 November 2021. 11. To achieve commencement dates for provisions relating to the administration of the child support scheme to coincide with the move of child support to START, I recommend that the 28-day rule, which requires regulations be notified in the New Zealand Gazette28 days prior to their coming into effect, be waived. Impact analysis Regulatory Impact Assessment 12. The Regulatory Impact Analysis Team at the Treasury has determined that the re gulatory proposal to amend the application dates in the Child Support Amendment Act 2021 is exempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statement on the basis that it has no or minor impacts on businesses, individuals or not-for- profit entities. 2 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-09 02:17:08 Climate Implications of Policy Assessment 13. The Climate Implications of Policy Assessment (CIPA) team has been consulted and co nfirms that the CIPA requirements do not apply to this proposal as the threshold for significance is not met. Communications 14. I propose to issue a media statement once the Order in Council is made by the Exe cutive Council. Inland Revenue will publish an article about these changes in its Tax Information Bulletin. Proactive release 15. I propose to proactively release the policy report, this Cabinet paper and associated O rders in Council in full shortly following the publication of the signed Orders in Council in the New Zealand Gazette, subject to redactions under the Official Information Act 1982. Consultation 16. The Treasury has been consulted on the amendments to the commencement dates. 17. The Treasury and the Parliamentary Counsel Office have been informed of the co ntents of this paper. Recommendations I recommend that the Cabinet Legislative Committee: 1. agree t o bring forward the commencement dates for the specified sections of the Child Support Amendment Act 2021 and the Taxation (Budget 2021 and Remedial Measures) Act 2021 from 1 April 2022 to 26 October 2021 or 1 November 2021 as set out in Appendix A; 2. note t hat the Child Support Amendment Act 2021 Commencement Order 2021 and the Taxation (Budget 2021 and Remedial Measures) Act Commencement Order 2021will give effect to the decision referred to in paragraph 1 above; 3. note that a waiver of the 28-day rule is sought so that the regulations can come into force to coincide with the move of child support to Inland Revenue’s new technology platform START 4. agree t o waive the 28-day rule so that the regulations can come into force on 26 October 2021 and 1 November 2021 to coincide with the move of child support to START; 5. authorise t he submission to the Executive Council of the Child Support Amendment Act 2021 Commencement Order 2021 and the Taxation (Budget 2021 and Remedial Measures) Act Commencement Order 2021; 3 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-09 02:17:08 Authorised for lodgement Hon David Parker Minister of Revenue 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-09 02:17:08 4 Appendix A: Sections of the Child Support Amendment Act 2021 and the Taxation (Budget 2021 and Remedial Measures) Act 2021 that require an Order in Council to amend the date of commencement Section being amended in the Child Su pport Act 1991 Section in the Child Support Amendment Act 2021 Proposed new c ommencement date Section 5 (Children who qualify for child su pport) 5 26 October 2021 Sections 19(3) to (7) (When liability to pay ch ild support starts) 6 26 October 2021 Section 81A (Amendments of assessments a rising from living circumstances existing at time initial assessment made) 18 26 October 2021 Section 87(7) (Amendment of a ssessments) 19 26 October 2021 Section 87A (Four-year time bar for a mendment of certain assessments) 20 26 October 2021 Section 88(3A) (Notice of assessment of f ormula assessment of child support) 21 26 October 2021 Section 89A(1)(aa) (Outline) 22 26 October 2021 Section 89B (Definitions for this Part) 23(2) to (4) 26 October 2021 Subpart 2 heading in Part 5A – “persons su ffering from long-term periods of illness” 24 26 October 2021 Cross-heading above section 89C - “p ersons suffering from long-term periods of illness” 25 26 October 2021 Section 89C(1)(a)(ii) (Exemption for long- term hospital patients) 26 26 October 2021 Section 89CA (Exemption for persons su ffering from long-term periods of illness) 27 26 October 2021 Section 89D(1)(a)(ii) (Exemption for long- term prisoners) 28 26 October 2021 Sections 89F(1)(a)(i), (1)(a)(ia), (1)(a)(ii), (2 A), (3)(aa) relevant period (Exemption does not apply at any time during child support year if income criteria not met at any time during relevant period) 29 26 October 2021 Sections 89G(1)(aa), (3)(aa) (Other re strictions on application of exemptions) 30 26 October 2021 Sections 89H(1)(b)(ia), (1)(ca), (2)(aa) (Ap plications for exemptions under this 31 26 October 2021 5 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-09 02:17:08 subpart) Subpart 3 heading in Part 5A “persons su ffering from long-term periods of illness” 32 26 October 2021 Section 96BA (Four-month time limit for ce rtain applications that are time-barred under section 87A) 34 26 October 2021 Section 96D(1)(bb) (Determinations that ma y be made) 35 26 October 2021 Section 105(2)(e) and heading (Matters as t o which court must be satisfied before making order) 36 26 October 2021 Section 106B (Further provision on orders f or offsetting of liabilities situations) 37 26 October 2021 Section 129(1) (Right to choose voluntary a utomatic deductions or other payment method) 40 26 October 2021 Section 129A (Newly liable persons to pay f inancial support by automatic deduction) 41 26 October 2021 Section 134AAA (Sixty-day grace period b efore penalties apply) 43 1 November 2021 Sections 152B(1), (1A), (2) to (4) (O ffsetting child support payments) 55 26 October 2021 Section being amended in the Child Su pport Act 1991 Section in the Taxation (Budget 2021 and Remedial Measures) Act 2021 Proposed new c ommencement date Sections 134(2) and (3) (Penalties for late p ayment of financial support debts) 8(2) and (4) 1 November 2021 Part 5 - Schedule 1 - Clause 23 (Ame ndments to section 134 (Penalties for late payment of financial support debts) 9(2) 1 November 2021 6 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-09 02:17:08 I N C O N F I D E N C E LEG-21-MIN-0156 Cabinet Legislation Committee Minute of Decision This document contains information for the New Zealand Cabinet.

This report seeks your approval of the attached Cabinet paper for lodgement with the Cabinet Office by 10am 11 February 2021, consideration by the Cabinet Legislation Committee (LEG) at its meeting of 18 February 2021, and then by Cabinet at its meeting of 22 February 2021. The Cabinet paper seeks approval for submission of a draft Order in Council to the Executive Council. 2. The Order in Council will add New Caledonia to New Zealand's existing list of 96 ‘reportable jurisdictions’, for the purposes of the G20/OECD Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters, commonly referred to as the AEOI Standard, or AEOI. New Caledonia has recently joined the AEOI initiative. 3. Adding jurisdictions to the reportable jurisdictions list is non-controversial and is largely a mechanical exercise, which needs to be repeated periodically as jurisdictions continue to join the AOEI initiative and complete implementation. We are endeavouring to limit such updates to no more than one per year. International developments in 2020 have been slow, due to COVID-19, and this year’s update only consists of one addition. 4. A draft of the Order in Council is attached for your information. The Parliamentary Counsel Office will forward the signature and certification copies of the Order direct to Cabinet Office, for association with the Cabinet paper. Background 5. AEOI is an international initiative, led by the G20 and OECD, for cooperation between jurisdictions in the detection and prevention of ‘offshore tax evasion’. Offshore tax evasion occurs when people hide their wealth from tax authorities by locating it in offshore accounts. To counter this, AEOI rules require financial institutions worldwide to (i) identify accounts held or controlled by non-residents and (ii) annually report information on those non-residents and accounts to tax authorities. The tax authorities then exchange the information under tax treaties, to ensure that each country receives the relevant information needed to be able to verify that its residents are correctly reporting income for tax purposes. 6. Reportable jurisdictions are those that Inland Revenue can provide AEOI information to (in accordance with our tax treaty and international obligations). Pursuant to section 226D of the Tax Administration Act 1994, any additions to and removals from the list must be confirmed by Order in Council. 7. The Order in Council will authorise Inland Revenue to provide AEOI information to New Caledonia. For the majority of New Zealand financial institutions, this change will have no implications. In any case, international expectations are such that New Zealand would need to be able to clearly justify to the G20 and OECD any decision not to add jurisdictions to the list as they complete implementation. We are not aware of any reasons to consider refusing to exchange with New Caledonia. In Confidence IR2021/004: Order in Council: amending New Zealand’s list of AEOI Reportable Jurisdictions Page 2 of 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Consultation 8. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade has been consulted and agrees with the proposal. 9. The Treasury does not need to be consulted but has been informed. Next steps 10. The attached Order in Council cover sheet (‘goatskin’) should be signed and submitted to the Cabinet Office along with the Cabinet paper. The Parliamentary Counsel Office (PCO) will forward the signature version of the Order in Council along with the requisite number of copies direct to the Cabinet Office for association with the Cabinet paper before it is submitted to LEG. However, a copy of the draft Order is attached to this report for your information. Recommended action We recommend that you: 11. sign t he attached Order in Council cover sheet; Signed/Not signed 12. note that the PCO will provide the signature version of the Order in Council, along with the requisite number of copies, direct to Cabinet Office; Noted 13. authorise the lodgement of the attached Cabinet paper and the signed Order in Council cover sheet with the Cabinet Office, by 10am Thursday 11 February 2021.

\[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee Order in Council: Tax Administration (Reportable Jurisdictions for Application of CRS Standard) Amendment Regulations 2021 Proposal 1. This paper seeks approval to submit a draft Order in Council, the Tax Administration (Reportable Jurisdictions for Application of CRS Standard) Amendment Regulations 2021, to the Executive Council. 2. The Order, to be made under section 226D of the Tax Administration Act 1994, will a dd New Caledonia to the existing list of 96 ‘reportable jurisdictions’ that New Zealand maintains for the purpose of the Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information for Tax Purposes (AEOI) rules. 3. Reportable jurisdictions are those that Inland Revenue is authorised to share financial information with under the AEOI rules. Policy 4. The making of the proposed Order is a routine matter and has not required any new p olicy decisions. 5. AEOI is an international initiative, led by the G20 and OECD, for cooperation between jurisdictions in the detection and prevention of ‘offshore tax evasion’. Offshore tax evasion occurs when people hide their wealth from tax authorities by locating it in offshore accounts. To counter this, AEOI rules require financial institutions worldwide to (i) identify accounts held or controlled by non-residents and (ii) annually report information on those non-residents and accounts to tax a uthorities. The tax authorities then exchange the information under tax treaties, to ensure that each country receives the relevant information needed to be able to verify that its residents are correctly reporting income for tax purposes. 6. New Zealand incorporated the AEOI rules into the Tax Administration Act 1994 in 2 017 and Inland Revenue has been conducting annual exchanges of AEOI information since then. The original list of reportable jurisdictions established in 2017 for the initial exchanges has grown each year as additional jurisdictions joined the initiative. Covid-19 appears to have slowed developments this year, and only New Caledonia stands to be added in this year’s update to the list. Adding New Caledonia will help to further close off opportunities for tax evasion as well as helping New Zealand meet its international obligations. Exchanges with New Caledonia will be 1 2r4hxlcklw 2021-03-03 20:17:42 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] made under the Multilateral Convention for Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters. 7. The AEOI rules, as enacted, authorise Inland Revenue to provide AEOI information to jurisdictions approved by Order in Council as ‘reportable jurisdictions’. The Order in Council mechanism was included because AEOI involves exchange of highly sensitive personal and financial information with other jurisdictions. Government oversight and the ability to refuse exchange with particular jurisdictions is a safeguard. It is, however, a safeguard of last resort as it co-exists with many other international and domestic safeguards that are designed to ensure information is only exchanged, held and used as intended. 8. I consider the addition of New Caledonia to the list of reportable jurisdictions to be u ncontroversial and am not aware of any reasons why the Government should consider refusal. Timing and 28-Day Rule 9. I propose that the Order be in force by 1 April 2021, to coincide with the beginning of t he next AEOI reporting/exchange cycle. This timing can be met without any need for a waiver of the 28-day rule. Compliance 10. The proposed Order complies with: 10.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 10.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and theHuman Rights Act 1993; 10.3 relevant international standards and obligations; and 10.4 the Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the L egislation Design and Advisory Committee. 11. The proposed Order generally complies with principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993. However, all exchange of information under tax treaties inherently conflicts with some of the privacy principles set out in that Act (such as the limitation imposed, at section 6 of the Act, on the disclosure of personal information). For this reason, section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 authorises the Privacy Act 1993 to be overridden for exchanges of information under tax treaties. The Privacy Commissioner was consulted during the enacting of New Zealand’s AEOI implementation legislation and indicated support for that legislation. Review Committee 12. I am not aware of any grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the O rder in Council to the attention of the House of Representatives under Standing Order 319. 2 2r4hxlcklw 2021-03-03 20:17:42 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 13. The Parliamentary Counsel Office has certified that the Order is ready to be submitted to Cabinet. Impact Analysis 14. A Regulatory Impact Assessment is not required as this Order in Council will not i nvolve creating, amending or repealing legislation and provides solely for the operation of existing legislative provisions. Communications 15. As for previous updates, Inland Revenue will advise by email all financial institutions a nd others registered as an AEOI stakeholder of the change to the reportable jurisdictions list. Inland Revenue will also publish information about the change in its monthly Tax Information Bulletin publication. Proactive release 16. I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key a dvice papers (except for officials’ names) within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Consultation 17. Public and agency consultation on the reportable jurisdictions list was undertaken during the development of the initial list of reportable jurisdictions in 2017. When the list was first amended, financial institutions and AEOI stakeholders were asked to provide feedback on whether adding additional reportable jurisdictions would create any difficulties or concerns. No issues were raised with us during either of these consultation rounds. 18. Given the lack of any concern during these prior rounds, no additional public co nsultation was undertaken on this occasion. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade was consulted on whether the addition of New Caledonia to the list raises any concerns and did not identify any. The Treasury and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet were informed. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Committee: 1. note that the T ax Administration (Reportable Jurisdictions for Application of CRS Standard) Amendment Regulations 2021 is a routine annual update made under section 226D of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and that no new policy decisions were required; 2. note that this update adds New Caledonia to the existing list of 96 reportable j urisdictions that Inland Revenue is authorised to provide financial account information to under the OECD Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information for Tax Purposes initiative; 3 2r4hxlcklw 2021-03-03 20:17:42 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 3. authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Tax Administration (Reportable Jurisdictions for Application of CRS Standard) Amendment Regulations 2021; 4. note that the T ax Administration (Reportable Jurisdictions for Application of CRS Standard) Amendment Regulations 2021 will come into force on 1 April 2021.

This report seeks your agreement to implement compulsory direct crediting of refunds of unclaimed money , casino duty, lottery duty, and totalisator duty to a bank account nominated by a taxpayer. These tax types are moving to START, 1 Inland Revenue’s software platform, as part of Business Transformation Stage 4. Background 2. This proposal can be implemented through an Order in Council. There is an existing legislative framework in the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“TAA”) which provides for progressive implementation of compulsory direct crediting for tax types that Inland Revenue administers. This framework was enacted with effect from 1 April 2000 to benefit taxpayers by eliminating time delays associated with the postal system and costs related to the banking of cheques. Inland Revenue also benefits from reduced administration costs. 3. Progressive implementation of compulsory direct crediting of refunds for the various tax types through Orders in Council allows Inland Revenue the necessary flexibility to determine the dates , in terms of system readiness, for implementing direct crediting. This approach gives taxpayers more time to provide Inland Revenue with up-to-date bank account details and (for taxpayers with complex business activities) to plan and adapt their processes. 4. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue would eventually be required to direct credit all refunds into taxpayers’ bank accounts. 5. The meaning of “tax” for the purpose of direct crediting of refunds is not limited to income tax. It extends to other products Inland Revenue administers. Compulsory direct crediting of refunds already applies to donation tax credits, goods and services tax, and student loan deductions as part of moving the administration of these tax types to START. 6. Unclaimed money, c asino duty, lottery duty, and totalisator duty are considered tax types for the purpose of making refunds. A refund of a duty or interest paid in error or in excess can be made by direct credit in accordance with the requirements of section 184A of the TAA. 7. Officials recommend making the following tax types refundable by direct credit under section 184A of the TAA: 7.1 unclaimed money ; 7.2 casino duty; 7.3 lottery duty; and 7.4 totalisator duty. 1 Simplified Tax and Revenue Technology In Confidence IR2021/017: Business Transformation Stage 4: refunding tax types by direct credit Page 2 of 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 8. The administration of the above tax types will be moved to the START system from March 2021 as part of Business Transformation Stage 4, and direct crediting of refunds should therefore apply 28-days after an Order in Council is issued in this regard. Implementation 9. Where refunds are required to be direct credited, an exemption will be available for taxpayers who would experience undue hardship or for circumstances where it is impracticable to refund through direct credit. 10. The proposed changes will have no fiscal impact. Any administrative costs of implementing the proposed change will be accommodated within the Business Transformation programme funding. Consultation 11. Treasury has been informed of the contents of this report. Next steps 12. If you agree, we will invite the Parliamentary Council Office to draft an Order in Council to implement direct crediting under section 184A of the TAA for unclaimed money , casino duty, lottery duty, and totalisator duty. 13. If you agree with the recommendations in this report, officials will provide you and the Minister of Revenue a draft Cabinet Legislation Committee paper and draft regulations by 18 February 2021 so that the direct crediting of refunds of unclaimed money, casino duty, lottery duty, and totalisator duty can commence 28 days after gazetting.

This report asks you to consider and authorise the lodgement of the attached draft Cabinet Legislation Committee (“LEG”) paper. The paper seeks approval to submit an Order in Council to the Executive Council, to enable Inland Revenue to implement compulsory direct crediting to taxpayers of refunds of totalisator duty, lottery duty, casino duty, and unclaimed money. Context and Background 2. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary to the Minister of Revenue has previously agreed to implementing compulsory direct crediting of refunds of totalisator duty, lottery duty, casino duty, and unclaimed money, and for officials to instruct the Parliamentary Counsel Office (“PCO”) to draft an Order in Council to give effect to the policy change ( IR2021/017 refers). 3. The Tax Administration Act 1994 provides for the progressive implementation, through Orders in Council, of compulsory direct crediting for the tax types that Inland Revenue administers. Progressive implementation ensures Inland Revenue has the necessary flexibility to prepare its systems before direct crediting is implemented. It also gives taxpayers more time to provide Inland Revenue with up- to-date bank account details and (for taxpayers with complex business activities) to plan and adapt their processes. The intent is that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will eventually be required to direct credit all refunds into taxpayers’ bank accounts. 4. PCO have drafted the Tax Administration (Direct Credit of Totalisator Duty, Lottery Duty, Casino Duty, and Unclaimed Money) Order 2021 (“the Order in Council”). Officials have prepared a draft LEG paper for your consideration and (if you agree) for lodgement with the Cabinet Office by 11 March 2021 and for consideration at the LEG meeting of 18 March 2021. Implementation 5. As with other tax types such as donation tax credits, goods and services tax, and student loan deductions where refunds are required to be direct credited, an exemption will be available for taxpayers who would experience undue hardship or for circumstances where it is impracticable to refund through direct credit. An example of this is where a taxpayer does not have a New Zealand bank account, so Inland Revenue cannot direct credit any tax refunds to the taxpayer. 6. The proposed changes will have no fiscal impact. Any administrative costs of implementing the proposed change will be accommodated within existing Business Transformation programme funding.

\[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee Tax Administration (Direct credit of Totalisator Duty, Lottery Duty, Casino duty, and Unclaimed Money) Order 2021 Proposal 1. This paper seeks the Cabinet Legislation Committee’s agreement to submit the Tax Administration (Direct Credit of Totalisator Duty, Lottery Duty, Casino Duty, and Unclaimed Money) Order 2021 to the Executive Council. 2. It is proposed that the Order in Council applies to implement refunds of totalisator duty, lottery duty, casino duty, and unclaimed money by direct credit from 28 days after the gazetting of the Order. Policy 3. I recommend that refunds of totalisator duty, lottery duty, casino duty, and unclaimed money be made by direct credit from March 2021. Refunds would be made by direct credit unless they would result in undue hardship or be impracticable (for example, if a taxpayer does not have a New Zealand bank account, so it is not possible to provide a direct credit). The administration of these tax types has moved to a new technology platform from 1 March 2021. 4. To implement this proposal, the Parliamentary Council Office has drafted the Tax Administration (Direct Credit of Totalisator Duty, Lottery Duty, Casino Duty, and Unclaimed Money) Order 2021. This is in accordance with an existing legislative framework in the Tax Administration Act 1994. The framework provides for the progressive implementation of compulsory direct crediting for tax types that Inland Revenue administers through Orders in Council and was enacted with effect from 1 April 2000. It benefits taxpayers by eliminating the time delays and costs associated with posting cheques and reflects that the processing of cheques is being phased out by the banks. Inland Revenue also benefits from reduced administration costs. 5. Progressive implementation of compulsory direct crediting of refunds through Orders in Council ensures Inland Revenue has the necessary flexibility to prepare its systems before implementing direct crediting. It also gives affected taxpayers time to provide Inland Revenue with up-to-date bank account details and (for taxpayers with complex business activities) more time to plan and adapt their processes. The intent is that the Commissioner will eventually be required to direct credit all refunds into taxpayers’ bank accounts. 1 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-07 10:50:26 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 6. Compulsory direct crediting has been implemented for refunds of gaming machine duty, income tax, goods and services tax, employees’ child support deducted by employers, and student loan deductions. This implementation has occurred as part of moving the administration of these tax types to Inland Revenue’s new technology platform. Timing and 28-Day Rule 7. I propose that direct crediting of refunds for totalisator duty, lottery duty, casino duty, and unclaimed money under section 184A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 applies to refunds made from 28 days after the gazetting date. The Order would therefore be in accordance with the rule that regulation must not come into force until at least 28 days after the public have been notified in the New Zealand Gazette. Compliance 8. The Order complies with: 8.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 8.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993; 8.3 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993; 8.4 relevant international standards and obligations; and 8.5 the Legislation Guidelines, which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. 9. No statutory prerequisite exists for making this Order. Regulations Review Committee 10. There are no anticipated grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Order in Council to the attention of the House under Standing Order 319. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 11. The Parliamentary Counsel Office has certified that the Order in Council is in order for submission to Cabinet. Impact Analysis 12. The Regulatory Quality Team at the Treasury has determined that the regulatory decisions sought in this paper are exempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Assessment as they have no or minor impacts on businesses, individual or not for profit entities. 2 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-07 10:50:26 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Publicity 13. The new Order in Council will be published in the New Zealand Gazette and on Inland Revenue’s website. Inland Revenue will also publish an article about these changes in its Tax Information Bulletin.

\[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee Income Tax (Employment Income—Meaning of Accommodation) Regulations 2021 Proposal 1. This paper seeks the Cabinet Legislation Committee’s agreement to submit the Income Tax (Employment Income—Meaning of Accommodation) Regulations 2021 to the Executive Council. Policy 2. The employment income rules define accommodation in broad terms, with some targeted exclusions to exempt accommodation provided in certain circumstances from tax. 3. The starting position under the employment income rules is that the value of accommodation provided to a person in relation to their employment is treated as employment income and subject to tax. This is because it is effectively an alternative to receiving more salary or wages, which would normally be taxed. 4. Accommodation is inherently private in nature since it provides a private benefit. In some cases, however, the private benefit is either incidental to a business objective or is minimal or hard to measure. For these reasons, certain types of accommodation are excluded from the accommodation definition and exempt from tax. 5. I recommend that the Committee agrees that a new exclusion is added to the definition of accommodation, to exempt accommodation that is provided to allow an employee to isolate due to the risk of the outbreak or spread of COVID-19. Accommodation provided for this purpose has a primary business objective of protecting employees, as well as the wider community, from COVID-19 infection. The private benefit is incidental to this business objective. 6. Examples of types of accommodation that would be exempt from tax under this exclusion are accommodation provided to isolate: 6.1 airline crew on their return to New Zealand; 6.2 harvest worker teams in separate bubbles during a lockdown, to manage the risk of COVID-19 transmission through a workforce during a harvest window; and 6.3 front-line workers from vulnerable family members. 1 2bnpvvfw8u 2021-07-27 08:46:06 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 7. The criteria for the new exclusion are that where the accommodation is provided, it is: 7.1 to enable an employee to isolate due to the risk of the outbreak or spread of COVID-19; 7.2 not normally provided as part of the employee’s remuneration package for their role or for a similar role; 7.3 not provided in substitution for a greater amount of employment income; 7.4 provided for a period of 3 months or less; and 7.5 provided between 22 April 2021 and 30 June 2022. 8. An existing power provides for additional types of accommodation to be excluded from the accommodation definition by Order in Council. Timing and 28-Day Rule 9. I propose that the change should apply from the date the New Zealand Gazette is published giving notice of the Order in Council, and that the 28-day rule is waived in this case, as the new exclusion will confer only benefits to the public. Compliance 10. The Order in Council complies with: 10.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 10.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993; 10.3 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993; 10.4 relevant international standards and obligations; 10.5 the Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. 11. No statutory prerequisite exists for making the Order in Council. Regulations Review Committee 12. There are no anticipated grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Order in Council to the attention of the House of Representatives under Standing Order 319.

The Regulatory Impact Analysis Team at the Treasury has determined that the regulatory proposal in this paper is exempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statement on the basis that it has no or minor impacts on businesses, individuals or not-for-profit entities. 15. The Climate Implications of Policy Assessment (CIPA) team has been consulted and confirms that the CIPA requirements do not apply to this proposal as the threshold for significance is not met. Revenue Implications 16. This change will have no fiscal impact. Communications 17. Inland Revenue will publish an article about the change in its Tax Information Bulletin. Proactive Release 18. I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper and associated minutes in whole within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Consultation 19. The proposal has been developed in response to queries raised by employers and various stakeholders have been consulted informally during the design process. 20. The Treasury has been consulted in the preparation of this paper and supports the change. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Committee: 1. agree to a new exclusion from the definition of accommodation in the employment income rules, by Order in Council, for accommodation that is provided for the purpose of enabling an employee to isolate due to the risk of the outbreak or spread of COVID-19; 2. note that the Income Tax (Employment Income—Meaning of Accommodation) Regulations 2021 will give effect to the decision referred to in paragraph 1 above; 3. authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Income Tax (Employment Income—Meaning of Accommodation) Regulations 2021; 4. note that a waiver of the 28-day rule is sought: 4.1 so that the regulations can come into force as soon as possible; 4.2 on the grounds that they will confer only benefits to the public; 3 2bnpvvfw8u 2021-07-27 08:46:06 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 5. agree to waive the 28-day rule so that the regulations can come into force when the next New Zealand Gazette is published on 22 April 2021.

This report informs you about the required annual change to the deemed rate of return on attributing interests in foreign investment funds. A Cabinet paper is attached that recommends an Order in Council be made to set the deemed rate of return for the 2020–21 income year. Background 2. The Income Tax Act 2007 (the Act) requires the deemed rate of return under the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules for each income year to be set by Order in Council. 3. New Zealand’s FIF rules tax New Zealand residents on attributed income from non- controlling investments in foreign companies, life insurance policies, and certain superannuation schemes. Since 1 April 2014, most interests in foreign superannuation schemes are taxed on transfer, rather than under the FIF rules. 4. The Act provides a number of different methods to calculate FIF income (or loss) for tax purposes, one of which is the deemed rate of return method. An investor must use the deemed rate of return where: 4.1 The interest consists of certain non-ordinary shares that have debt characteristics; and 4.2 The comparative value method cannot be used because the end-of -year market value of the interest cannot be determined. 5. Under the deemed rate of return method, income from a FIF is calculated each year by multiplying the opening book value of the investment by the rate set annually by Order in Council. 6. An Order in Council is now required to set the deemed rate of return for the 2020– 21 income year. Calculation 7. The method for calculating the annual deemed rate of return was established and approved in 1994 (CAB (94) M 35/3 C(vi) refers) and published in Inland Revenue’s October 1994 Tax Information Bulletin. The calculation involves taking an average of the five-year “risk-free” Government bond rates at the end of each quarter of the income year and adding a risk premium margin of four percentage points. If the last day of a quarter falls on a weekend or statutory holiday, the rate on the next business day is used. IR2021/176: Cabinet paper: Income Tax (Deemed Rate of Return on Attributing Interests in Foreign Investment Funds, 2020–21 Income Year) Order 2021 Page 2 of 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 8. Officials recommend that the current method for calculating the deemed rate of return be used again for the 2020–21 income year. It is a simple way of approximating the expected return on foreign equities, incorporating a risk premium of four percentage points above the return on “risk-free” debt such as Government bonds. The method has been used for every income year since 1994. 9. The average of the quarterly five-year Government bond interest rates for the 2020–21 income year is 0.43%. This means that the deemed rate of return for the 2020–21 income year will be 4.43% (0.43% plus four percentage points). This is a decrease from last year’s deemed rate of return, which was 5.05 %. Regulatory Impact Analysis 10. A Regulatory Impact Analysis is not required for this Cabinet paper because no policy decision is being sought. The deemed rate of return has been calculated in accordance with a formula that was approved by Cabinet in 1994 (CAB (94) M 35/3 C(vi) refers). Timing 11. Because the deemed rate of return is based on five-year Government bond rates from across the year for which the rate applies, it must always be calculated after the end of the income year but apply retrospectively from the beginning of that year. 12. This Order in Council will enable taxpayers using the deemed rate of return method to calculate their FIF income for the 2020–21 income year and therefore needs to apply retrospectively from 1 April 2020. 13. Officials recommend that a waiver of the 28-day rule for regulations is sought for this Order in Council. Taxpayers that use the deemed rate of return are not able to use the old rate to file a return for the 2020–21 year; they must wait for the new rate to come into force. A waiver would be taxpayer-friendly and beneficial to the Government, as (without a waiver) some taxpayers would have to wait an extra 28 days to be able to file a return solely because they are waiting on the rate to come into force. 14. The attached Cabinet paper is drafted on the basis that a waiver is sought for the Order in Council. This will mean the Order comes into force on 20 June 2021. If you do not agree to recommend a waiver, we will supply you with an updated Cabinet paper. Cabinet paper and associated materials 15. The Cabinet paper and the advice sheet for the Order in Council are attached to this report. These should be signed and referred to the Cabinet Office by 10am, Wednesday 2 June 2021, for consideration at the Cabinet Legislation Committee’s meeting on Thursday 1 0 June 2021. 16. The Parliamentary Counsel Office will provide copies of the finalised Order in Council directly to the Cabinet Office. 17. A media statement will be issued once the Order in Council has been made. Consultation 18. The Treasury was consulted on the Cabinet paper and agrees with its recommendations.

\[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee INCOME TAX (DEEMED RATE OF RETURN ON ATTRIBUTING INTERESTS IN FOREIGN INVESTMENT FUNDS, 2020–21 INCOME YEAR) ORDER 2021 Proposal 1. This paper proposes that Cabinet Legislation Committee authorise the submission to t he Executive Council of the attached Order in Council, which will set the deemed rate of return on attributing interests in foreign investment funds at 4.43% for the 2020–21 income year. Background 2. New Zealand’s foreign investment fund (FIF) rules tax New Zealand residents on i ncome from certain foreign investments. There are several methods for calculating the taxpayer’s income or loss from these investments, as set out in legislation. One of these methods is the deemed rate of return method. 3. The deemed rate of return method is used to calculate FIF income or loss from non- ordinary shares with debt-like properties, such as shares that guarantee a return. The method can only be used if the market value of the foreign investment cannot be determined at the end of the income year. Under the deemed rate of return method, income from a FIF is calculated each year by multiplying the opening book value of the investment by a deemed rate set annually by Order in Council. 4. The method for calculating the annual deemed rate of return was established and a pproved in 1994 (CAB Min (94) 35/3 C(vi) refers) and published in Inland Revenue’s October 1994 Tax Information Bulletin. The calculation involves taking an average of the five-year “risk-free” Government bond rates at the end of each quarter of the income year and then adding a risk premium margin of four percentage points. The current method is a suitable way of approximating the expected return on foreign equities and has been used for every income year since 1994. Comment 5. The average of the quarterly five-year Government bond interest rates for the 2020– 2 1 income year is 0.43%. The attached Income Tax (Deemed Rate of Return on Attributing Interests in Foreign Investment Funds, 2020–21 Income Year) Order 2021 therefore sets the deemed rate of return for the 2020–21 income year at 4.43% (0.43% plus four percentage points) in accordance with the current method of calculation. This is a decrease from last year’s deemed rate of return, which was 5.05%. 1 2r4hxlcklw 2021-07-29 16:20:22 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Timing 6. The new deemed rate of return should come into force as soon as practicable to allow taxpayers using this rate to file their tax returns as soon as they can. I therefore recommend that the new rate comes into force on 18 June 2021. 7. To ensure a commencement date of 18 June 2021, I recommend that the 28-day ru le be waived for the coming into force of this Order. This will ensure that taxpayers using the deemed rate of return method for calculating their income are able to promptly file their tax return using the correct rate for the 2020–21 income year. 8. If a waiver is not agreed to, then taxpayers that use the deemed rate of return me thod will not be able to file a return until the 28-day period has been satisfied. Taxpayers in this situation are unable to use last year’s deemed rate of return to file for the 2020–21 income year and must wait for the current year’s rate to come into force. 9. It is of no benefit to taxpayers or the Government to require taxpayers using the d eemed rate of return to wait an extra 28 days to be able to file their tax return. This would be a source of frustration for taxpayers who want to file their tax returns quickly but are unable to do so. Therefore, I recommend that the 28-day rule be waived. Consultation 10. The Treasury has been consulted in the preparation of this paper and agrees with its re commendations. Compliance 11. The Order complies with each of the following: 11.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 11.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 a nd the Human Rights Act 1993; 11.3 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993; 11.4 relevant international standards and obligations; and 11.5 the Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the L egislation Design and Advisory Committee. Legislative Implications 12. The proposal of this Cabinet paper is that the attached Order in Council be submitted to the Executive Council. 2 2r4hxlcklw 2021-07-29 16:20:22 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Impact Analysis 13. A Regulatory Impact Analysis is not required because no policy decision is being sought. The deemed rate of return has been calculated in accordance with a formula that was approved by Cabinet in 1994 (CAB Min (94) 35/3 C(vi) refers). Regulations Review Committee 14. There are no anticipated grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the O rder in Council to the attention of the House. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 15. The Parliamentary Counsel Office has certified that the attached Order in Council is i n order for submission to Cabinet. Publicity 16. Once the Order in Council is made, Inland Revenue will publish the new rate on their w ebsite. Proactive Release 17. I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key a dvice papers within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions, subject to minor redactions under the Official Information Act 1982. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Cabinet Legislation Committee: 1. note t hat the attached Order in Council sets the deemed rate of return on attributing interests in foreign investment funds at 4.43% for the 2020–21 income year; 2. note that a waiver of the 28-day rule is sought: 2.1 so that the Order can come into force on 18 June 2021; 2.2 on the grounds that taxpayers using the deemed rate of return method for ca lculating their income must wait for the 2020–21 rate to come into force, and that it is of no benefit to taxpayers or the Government to require taxpayers using the rate to wait an extra 28 days to be able to file their tax return; 3. agree t o waive the 28-day rule so that the Order comes into force on 18 June 2021; 4. authorise t he submission to the Executive Council of the Income Tax (Deemed Rate of Return on Attributing Interests in Foreign Investment Funds, 2020–21 Income Year) Order 2021. 3 2r4hxlcklw 2021-07-29 16:20:22 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Authorised for lodgement Hon David Parker Minister of Revenue 4 2r4hxlcklw 2021-07-29 16:20:22
POLICY AND STRATEGY Tax policy report: Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and other forms of Family Maintenance: entry into force Date: 23 July 2020 Priority: Medium Security level: In Confidence Report number: IR2020/351 Action sought Action sought Deadline Minister of Revenue Agree to recommendations 12 August 2020 Contact for telephone discussion (if required) Name Position Telephone Emma Hamilton Senior Policy Advisor Samantha Aldridge Principal Policy Advisor Carolyn Elliott Policy Lead s 9(2)(a) In Confidence IR2020/351: Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and other forms of Family Maintenance: entry into force Page 1 of 3 23 July 2020 Minister of Revenue Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and other forms of Family Maintenance: implementation timing Purpose 1. This report seeks your agreement to align the date that the Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and other forms of Family Maintenance (the Convention) comes into force in New Zealand with the new timing for the transfer of child support into Inland Revenue’s new systems, as part of its Business Transformation programme. Originally this was planned for April 2021 but will now occur in October 2021. Background The Convention 2. The Convention is a multilateral treaty that provides for the recovery of child support and other forms of maintenance (such as spousal support) when the liable person resides in a different country to where the maintenance payment was raised. 3. New Zealand is currently in the process of taking the necessary steps to ratify the Convention and bring it into force. The Social Services and Community Committee has completed the Parliamentary treaty examination process and reported back to the House recommending ratification. 4. An Order in Council is needed to recognise and give effect to the Convention under New Zealand Law and once this has been completed New Zealand will be in a position to ratify the Convention. Timing of the entry into force of the Convention and Business Transformation child support changes 5. The original intent was that the Convention would enter into force in New Zealand at the same time child support transfers into Inland Revenue’s new systems as part of Business Transformation \[CAB-MIN-0447\]. This was ex pected to be in April 2021. 6. However, due to the impacts of COVID-19, it has recently been confirmed that the transfer of child support to Inland Revenue’s new systems will be moved to October 2021. 7. In light of this, officials recommend that the date for the Convention to enter into force be moved to October 2021 to align with Business Transformation. Customer implications 8. The proposal to move the date that the Convention enters into force would have an impact on some New Zealand carers. This is because it would mean a delay in Inland Revenue’s ability to send cases to other member countries for collection under the Convention. It would also prevent other member countries from sending cases to In Confidence IR2020/351: Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and other forms of Family Maintenance: entry into force Page 2 of 3 New Zealand for collection. This would affect the timing of when cases could be sent or received, but not the amount of child support being referred for collection. Administrative implications 9. Alignment means the required systems and processes could be designed and built alongside the Business Transformation child support changes in the new system. There would be no need to develop any temporary processes or changes to the heritage system, FIRST. 10. There are some significant challenges with an April 2021 date for the Convention to enter into force. It would require some change in Inland Revenue’s heritage system, FIRST (including ongoing system support), which has not been factored into Inland Revenue’s work programme. It would also require the development of temporary manual processes to allow Inland Revenue to accept and send cases under the Convention. It would add additional risk to the Business Transformation programme if Inland Revenue were required to divert specialist resources to deliver that additional scope. 11. An April 2021 implementation in Inland Revenue’s heritage system would be sub- optimal and could result in an inefficient administration and fewer cases able to be referred than if implementation were to be in our new systems. This could also create a reputational risk for Inland Revenue because there may be an expectation that as soon as the Convention enters into force, cases would be sent for collection, and this may not be immediately feasible. 12. Many of the preparatory activities required prior to ratification, such as consultation with other countries have been delayed because of COVID-19. These activities have now recommenced but may not be able to be completed in time for an April 2021 entry into force. Costs 13. There would be no additional costs associated with the proposal to move the date for entry into force to October 2021 to align with the child support Business Transformation changes. Implementation and administration costs would continue to be met within existing baselines. 14. However additional costs would be incurred if the date for the entry into force for the Convention were not aligned with the child support Business Transformation changes. These increased costs would primarily result from implementing and supporting the administration of the Convention in Inland Revenue’s heritage system, FIRST for a limited period. 15. There are no fiscal costs associated with ratifying the Convention and bringing it into force in New Zealand. Consultation 16. Officials have consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade to confirm there are no impacts on the timing of the submission of the instrument of ratification that would result from moving the implementation date from April 2021 to October 2021. 17. Treasury has been consulted and is comfortable with the proposal. 18. The Ministry of Justice has also been informed about this proposal. In Confidence IR2020/351: Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and other forms of Family Maintenance: entry into force Page 3 of 3 Next steps 19. If you agree to the proposal, officials will prepare the Order in Council necessary for the necessary domestic law change with the amended date. 20. Following the Order in Council being made, New Zealand’s instrument of ratification and list of confirmed declarations and reservations will be deposited with the Convention depositary. This is required to be completed at least three months be fore the Convention comes into force in New Zealand and will be completed by June 2021. Recommended action We recommend that you: 21. agree to align the date the Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and other forms of Family Maintenance comes into force with the timing of Inland Revenue’s child support Business Transformation changes; Agreed/Not agreed 22. note that it is expected that the child support Business Transformation changes will occur in October 2021.

This report seeks your agreement to amend one of New Zealand’s declarations in relation to the Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and other forms of Family Maintenance (the Convention). The declaration, which provides for an alternative process to be followed when an application is received, is no lon ger required. It has been identified that the standard process is preferable. Background The Convention 2. The Convention is a multilateral treaty that provides for the recovery of child support and other forms of maintenance (such as spousal support) when the liable person resides in a different country to where the maintenance payment was raised. 3. New Zealand is currently in the process of taking the necessary steps to ratify the Convention and bring it into force. The Social Services and Community Committee completed the International Treaty Examination in March 2020 and reported back to the House recommending ratification. 4. An Order in Council is needed to recognise and give effect to the Convention under New Zealand law and once this has been completed New Zealand will be in a position to ratify the Convention. Reservations and declarations 5. Any permitted reservations or declarations under the Convention must be made at the time of ratification. New Zealand’s proposed reservations and declarations were attached to the extended National Interest Analysis approved by Cabinet \[CAB-19 MIN-0447\] and were included as part of the International Treaty Examination process. 6. Article 23 of the Convention details the standard process that needs to be followed for recognition and enforcement when an application made under the Convention is received. Article 24 details an alternative procedure that may be followed. A State must make a declaration if they intend to use the alternative procedure set out in Article 24. One of New Zealand’s proposed declarations was to follow the Article 24 process, rather than the standard Article 23 process. 7. As part of more detailed work completed in preparation for implementation, it has been identified that the standard Article 23 process would be preferable to the alternative Article 24 process. This is because it would enable Inland Revenue to process applications more expeditiously and aligns with how it already processes other domestic and international applications. IR2021/186: Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance: Amendment to declaration Page 2 of 6 8. The primary difference between the processes detailed in Article 23 and 24 is the order in which actions take place. Under the standard Article 23 process shown in figure 1, the decision is made and becomes enforceable before any challenge can be made. In contrast, under the alternative Article 24 process shown in figure 2, the recognition and enforcement of the decision only occurs after the applicant and respondent have been given an opportunity to make a submission. Figure 1 – Article 23 process for recognition and enforcement IR reviews child support application IR declares decision enforceable or registers it for enforcement Notice is given to parties of declaration or registration If decision is manifestly inconsistent with public policy – IR advises requesting State and closes file Enforcement of decision may begin Respondent can challenge or appeal the declaration within 30 days Decision is made by IR regarding challenge or appeal IR notify applicant and respondent of the outcome of the challenge or appeal Further appeal may be allowed through New Zealand’s Court No stay of enforcement unless there are exceptional circumstances IR completes the Status Report Form and sends to requesting State IR2021/186: Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance: Amendment to declaration Page 3 of 6 Figure 2 – Article 24 process for recognition and enforcement 9. The standard Article 23 process would be preferable to the Article 24 process because it would allow Inland Revenue to register cases and commence collection more quickly. This should result in faster transfer of payments to receiving carers. Authority to amend declaration 10. Cabinet delegated authority to the Minister of Revenue to make adjustments to the reservations and declarations that were needed in advance of ratification, if those changes were the result of changes in other jurisdictions’ position. 11. However, since the change proposed is in New Zealand’s position, rather than an overseas jurisdiction’s po sition, it is not clear that the delegated authority would apply in this case. 12. Inland Revenue has consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) on the appropriate process to follow to amend the declaration. MFAT advised that the authority to amend the reservations and declarations is not clear in this situation. They consider that because the change is minor, a full Cabinet paper is Notify respondent of request for recognition of maintenance decision Ex-Officio grounds for review raised by IR Grounds raised by respondent Grounds raised by applicant Grounds evident on the ‘face’ of documents Objections considered by IR Objections dismissed IR makes decision as to recognition and enforceability Maintenance decision is enforceable Notice to applicant and respondent of recognition of decision Further appeal through the Court system IR2021/186: Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance: Amendment to declaration Page 4 of 6 not required. I nstead, they recommend the change be taken to Cabinet as an oral item. 13. Alternatively, removing the declaration could be included in the LEG paper accompanying the Order in Council which will give effect to the Convention under New Zealand law. This is officials’ preferred option as it would clearly record the change and therefore be more transparent. 14. MFAT also recommend a letter be sent to the Social Service and Community Committee to explain the proposed change, as they were the Committee who completed the International Treaty Examination. A draft letter is attached to this report. Customer implications 15. The proposal would significantly reduce the timeframe for registering Convention cases. The Article 23 process allows for collection to commence immediately instead of allowing up to 60 days for a challenge to be received and any additional time required to make a decision on that challenge. This means that Inland Revenue should be able to pass maintenance on to receiving carers in a more timely manner. It is expected that only a small proportion of registrations will be challenged, so it is not practical to delay all cases. Administrative implications 16. Following the standard Article 23 process would be administratively simpler for Inland Revenue. This is because it aligns with current practice for processing existing domestic and international applications and can be incorporated into current systems relatively simply. Following the Article 24 process would require development of new systems and processes which involves additional resources to create and implement. Costs 17. There would be no additional costs associated with the proposal. Implementation and administration costs would continue to be met within existing baselines. 18. There are no fiscal costs associated with ratifying the Convention and bringing it into force in New Zealand. Consultation 19. Officials have consulted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade about this proposal. 20. Treasury has been informed about this report. 21. The Ministry of Justice has also been informed about this proposal. Next steps 22. If you prefer to take an oral item to Cabinet, officials will prepare speaking notes. 23. If you prefer that the item be specifically included in the Cabinet Legislation Committee paper accompanying the Order in Council, officials will include this as a recommendation. IR2021/186: Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance: Amendment to declaration Page 5 of 6 24. Following the Order in Council being made, New Zealand’s instrument of ratification and list of confirmed reservations and declarations will be deposited with the Convention depositary. This is required to be completed at least three months before the Convention comes into force in New Zealand and is expected to be completed by July 2021, to align with the move of child support to Inland Revenue’s new technology system, START. Recommended action We recommend that you: 25. agree to removing the declaration under Article 24 of the Convention by either 25.1 taking an oral item to Cabinet, or Agreed/Not agreed 25.2 including the removal in the Cabinet Legislation Committee paper \[officials’ preferred option\] Agreed/Not agreed 26. agree that you send a letter to the Social Services and Community Committee explaining the proposal Agreed/Not agreed Carolyn Elliott Policy Lead Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Hon David Parker Minister of Revenue / 05 /2021 s 9(2)(a) Hon David Parker BCom, LLB Attorney-General Minister for the Environment Minister for Oceans and Fisheries Minister of Revenue Associate Minister of Finance Angie Warren-Clark Chair of the Social Services and Community Committee Parliament Buildings Wellington Dear Ms Warren-Clark Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and other forms of Family Maintenance: Amendment to declaration The Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and other forms of Family Maintenance ("the Convention") is a multilateral treaty that provides for the recovery of child support and other forms of maintenance when the liable person resides in a different country to where the maintenance payment was raised. New Zealand is currently in the process of taking the necessary steps to ratify the Convention and bring it into force. As part of the ratification process, the reservations and declarations pertaining to the Convention are approved by Cabinet. One of New Zealand's declarations provides for an alternative process to be followed when an application is received by Inland Revenue. Officials have reported to me that this declaration is no longer required. It has been identified that the standard process would be preferable. This is because it would enable Inland Revenue to process applications more efficiently and aligns with how it already processes other domestic and international applications. The Social Services and Community Committee completed the Parliamentary treaty examination process on 24 March 2020 and reported back to the House recommending ratification. Therefore, I am writing to you to inform you of the proposed change to the declaration. I intend to include this change in the Cabinet Legislation Committee paper accompanying the Order in Council that is required to recognise and give effect to the Convention under New Zealand law. Once the Order in Council has been completed New Zealand will be in a position to ratify the Convention. The Convention is expected to enter into force later this year.

This report asks you to approve for lodgement the attached Cabinet paper and accompanying Order in Council with the Cabinet Office by 10am Thursday 1 July 2021 for consideration at the Cabinet Legislation Committee meeting on Thursday 8 July 2021. 2. The Child Support (Reciprocal Agreement with Hague Countries) Order 2021 is needed to recognise and give effect to the Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and other forms of Family Maintenance (the Convention) under New Zealand law. Once this has been completed New Zealand will be in a position to ratify the Convention. The Order will modify the application of the Child Support Act 1991 for cases administered under the Convention relating to child support and domestic maintenance. 3. This Order in Council is a domestic step towards entry into force, which is intended for 1 November 2021. Background 4. The Convention is a multilateral treaty that provides for the recovery of child support and other forms of maintenance (such as spousal support) when the liable person resides in a different country from that in which the maintenance payment is raised. 5. New Zealand signed the Convention on 26 November 2019. The Social Services and Community Committee completed the Parliamentary treaty examination on 24 March 2020 and reported back to the House recommending ratification. New Zealand is now taking the necessary steps to ratify the Convention and to bring it into force for New Zealand. 6. The Convention is intended to be in force in New Zealand on 1 November 2021 when child support transfers into Inland Revenue’s new systems as part of Business Transformation. Reservations and declarations 7. Any permitted reservations or declarations under the Convention must be made at the time of ratification. New Zealand’s proposed reservations and declarations were approved by Cabinet \[CAB-19 MIN-0447 refers\] and were also considered as part of the Parliamentary Treaty Examination process. 8. Officials originally considered that New Zealand should make a declaration that New Zealand will use the Article 24 procedure rather than the Article 23 procedure on receipt of applications for recognition and enforcement. This is reflected in the reservations and declarations, as considered by Cabinet and in the Parliamentary Treaty Examination process. 9. However, as part of more detailed work completed in preparation for implementation, it has been identified and agreed that the standard Article 23 process would be preferable to the alternative Article 24 process \[IR2021-186 refers\]. This is because it IR2021/283: Draft Cabinet paper – Child Support (Reciprocal Agreement with Hague Convention Countries) Order 2021 Page 2 of 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] would enable Inland Revenue to process applications more expeditiously and aligns with how it already processes other domestic and international applications. Using the procedure set out in Article 23 does not require New Zealand to make a declaration. 10. We will provide your office with suggested talking points for taking the paper through the Cabinet Legislation Committee. Specifically, these will identify why there has been a change to New Zealand’s declarations in relation to the Convention. Next steps 11. Treaty-making with respect to Tokelau is carried out by the New Zealand Government in consultation with the Government of Tokelau. In accordance with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s recommendations, New Zealand is consulting with Tokelau on whether the Convention should also extend to Tokelau. Tokelau is expected to respond to the consultation documents provided by 30 June 2021. If Tokelau responds in the affirmative by that date, officials will update the requisite documents. 12. A draft Cabinet paper and associated Order in Council are attached for you to take to the Cabinet Legislation Committee on Thursday 8 July 2021. The certificate and signature copies of the Order will be sent direct to Cabinet office by the Parliamentary Counsel Office, for associating with the Cabinet paper. 13. Officials recommend you sign the attached Order in Council “goatskin” cover sheet, for submission to Cabinet office with the Cabinet paper. 14. Officials recommend you refer a copy of this report to the Minister of Foreign Affairs for her information. 15. Following agreement to the Order in Council, New Zealand’s instrument of ratification and list of confirmed declarations and reservations will be deposited with the Convention depositary. The Convention will enter into force for New Zealand on the first day of the month following the expiration of three months after the deposit of its instrument of ratification. Therefore, New Zealand must deposit our instrument of ratification by 31 July 2021 in order for the entry into force date to align with child support moving to Inland Revenue’s new system START. 16. Normal practice is to release a press statement at the time the Convention enters into force rather than on the making of the Order in Council. We will discuss appropriate publicity with your office. 17. Officials consider that the attached Cabinet paper should be proactively released within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions, subject to minor redactions.

\[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee CHILD SUPPORT (RECIPROCAL AGREEMENT WITH HAGUE CONVENTION COUNTRIES) ORDER 2021 Purpose 1. This paper proposes that Cabinet agree to the submission of the accompanying Order in Council to ratify and bring into force, the Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and other Forms of Family Maintenance (the Convention) 2021, to the Executive Council. 2. This will give effect to policy decisions made by Cabinet on 2 September 2019 \[CAB- 19-MIN-0447 refers\] when it approved the signing and ratification of the Convention and the ensuing steps for entry into force. 3. Once made, the Order will recognise and give effect to the Convention under New Zealand law. The Order will modify the application of the Child Support Act 1991 for cases administered under the Convention to ensure reciprocity in respect of matters relating to child support and domestic maintenance. 4. The finalised list of declarations and reservations will need to be deposited alongside New Zealand’s instrument of ratification. It should be noted that one of New Zealand’s original declarations, regarding the procedure used on receipt of applications, is no longer required and that the standard process is preferable. It is proposed that Cabinet agree that New Zealand no longer makes a declaration to Article 24 of the Convention. Background 5. The Convention is a multilateral treaty that provides for the recovery of child support and other forms of maintenance (such as spousal support) when the liable person resides in a different country to where the maintenance payment was raised. It: 5.1. enables the recognition and collection of both administrative and court-ordered maintenance between member countries; 5.2. includes rules on judicial and administrative co-operation that should improve New Zealand’s ability to assess and collect child support when liable parents are residing in member countries; and 5.3. enables Inland Revenue to assess child support for New Zealand children whose liable parent is not a New Zealand citizen or resident and who lives in a member country. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-07-29 15:23:28 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 6. As at 30 April 2019, there were approximately 16,720 parents with New Zealand- assessed child support liabilities who live overseas, with the majority of them residing in Australia (about 12,500). Inland Revenue is currently reliant on voluntary compliance in collecting child support from parents living overseas outside of Australia (those in Australia are covered by an existing bilateral agreement) and voluntary compliance is very low. The Convention can be implemented with minimal administrative cost to Inland Revenue and should facilitate the recovery outstanding child support payments from liable parents living outside of Australia. Benefits of ratifying the Convention 7. The main benefit of ratifying the Convention is the ability to refer assessments administered under the Child Support Act 1991 (and other forms of maintenance, such as spousal support) to other member countries for collection. This is a key advantage over other maintenance arrangements, which only allow for the collection of court- ordered maintenance. 8. The Convention will also enable Inland Revenue to carry out a formula assessment of child support for New Zealand children whose liable parent is not a New Zealand citizen or resident, so that more children receive the appropriate support. By doing this under the Convention, Inland Revenue could progress these cases outside of the court system via its more efficient administrative assessment processes. Previous consideration 9. As noted, Cabinet approved the signing of the Convention in September 2019. In particular, Cabinet: • noted that the Convention will be incorporated into New Zealand domestic law through an Order in Council made pursuant to section 215 of the Child Support Act 1991; • invited the Minister of Revenue, following signature and completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, to instruct the Parliamentary Counsel Office to draft an Order in Council to give effect to the Convention; • authorised officials, following promulgation of the Order in Council, to bring the Convention into force by depositing New Zealand’s instrument of ratification and list of confirmed declarations and reservations with the Convention depositary. Entry into force of the Hague Convention 10. The Convention was signed by New Zealand on 26 November 2019. It has undergone Parliamentary treaty examination, with the Social Services and Community Committee who recommended ratification on 24 March 2020. The remaining steps are to: 10.1. make an Order in Council recognising and giving effect to the Convention under New Zealand law; and 2r4hxlcklw 2021-07-29 15:23:28 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 10.2. to deposit New Zealand’s instrument of ratification, and statement of declarations and reservations, with the official Depository. 11. The original intent was for the Convention to enter into force in New Zealand at the same time child support transfers into Inland Revenue’s new system as part of Business Transformation. This was expected to be in April 2021. 12. However, due to the impacts of COVID-19, it has been confirmed that the transfer of child support to Inland Revenue’s new systems will be in October 2021. Therefore, the former Minister of Revenue agreed to align the date for the Convention to enter into force with Business Transformation. 13. I consider that the Order should take effect from 1 November 2021. Reservations and Declarations 14. Any permitted reservations or declarations under the Convention must be made at the time of ratification. New Zealand’s proposed reservations and declarations were attached to the extended National Interest Analysis approved by Cabinet \[CAB-19 MIN-0447 refers\] and were included as part of the Parliamentary Treaty Examination process. 15. Officials originally considered that New Zealand should make a declaration that New Zealand will use the Article 24 procedure rather than the Article 23 procedure on receipt of applications for recognition and enforcement. This is reflected in the reservations and declarations, as considered by Cabinet and the Parliamentary Treaty Examination process. 16. However, as part of more detailed work completed in preparation for implementation, it has been identified that the standard Article 23 process would be preferable to the alternative Article 24 process. This is because it would enable Inland Revenue to process applications more expeditiously and aligns with how it already processes other domestic and international applications. Cabinet’s approval is required to confirm that New Zealand no longer makes a declaration to Article 24 of the Convention. Tokelau 17. Treaty-making with respect to Tokelau is carried out by the New Zealand Government, in consultation with the Government of Tokelau. In accordance with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s recommendations, New Zealand is consulting with Tokelau on whether the Convention should also extend to Tokelau. Timing and 28-day rule 18. The 28-day rule requires that regulations be notified in the New Zealand Gazette 28 days prior to their coming into effect. No waiver of the 28-day rule is proposed. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-07-29 15:23:28 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Regulatory Impact Analysis 19. A regulatory impact statement is not required for the order. The Child Support (Reciprocal Agreement with Hague Convention Countries) Order 2021 implements an international treaty for which an extended National Interest Analysis (incorporating the requisite regulatory impact analysis elements) has previously been approved by Cabinet. Publicity 20. The new order will be notified in the New Zealand Gazette. I will arrange the appropriate additional publicity to announce the entry into force of the Order. The text of the Convention and the NIA are available to the public on Inland Revenue’s Tax Policy website. The Social Services and Community Committee’s report following Parliamentary treaty examination is available to the public on Parliaments website. Proactive Release 21. I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions, subject to minor redactions under the Official Information Act 1982. Consultation 22. The Parliamentary Counsel Office drafted the Order in Council and have been provided with this paper. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Treasury were consulted in the consideration of the Convention. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade have also been consulted on this paper. Recommendations I recommend that the Cabinet Legislation Committee: 1. note that following previous consideration of and approval by Cabinet (CAB-19-MIN- 0447), the Hague Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and other Forms of Family Maintenance (the Convention) was signed by New Zealand on 26 November 2019. 2. note that the Child Support (Reciprocal Agreement with Hague Convention Countries) Order 2021 will recognise and give effect to the Convention under New Zealand law. 3. authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the attached Child Support (Reciprocal Agreement with Hague Convention Countries) Order 2021. 4. note the Convention will enter into force for New Zealand on the first day of the month following the expiration of three months after New Zealand has deposited its instrument of ratification. 5. note the Convention will enter into force for New Zealand from 1 November 2021. 2r4hxlcklw 2021-07-29 15:23:28 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 6. note this date aligns with the transfer of child support to Inland Revenue’s new systems. 7. agree New Zealand no longer makes a declaration to Article 24 of the Convention. Authorised for lodgement Hon David Parker Minister of Revenue 2r4hxlcklw 2021-07-29 15:23:28

This report seeks your agreement to amend by Order in Council the commencement dates for recent child support amendments to align with the move of child support to Inland Revenue’s new technology platform START. Background 2. The Child Support Amendment Act 2021 (CSAA) was enacted on 24 March 2021. Its purpose was to make amendments to further improve the administration of the child support scheme. This took advantage of the opportunity offered by the modernisation of Inland Revenue’s system. 3. When the Child Support Amendment Bill was introduced, it was intended that the child support scheme would move to Inland Revenue’s new system (START) in April 2021. However, due to COVID-19, this move was delayed until the second half of 2021. Because of this delay, the commencement dates of many the proposals in the CSAA were changed to 1 April 2022 or an earlier date as set by Order in Council. Proposal 4. Moving child support to START is now set for Labour Weekend 2021. As such, commencement dates for provisions relating to the administration of the scheme will need to be amended. Officials recommend that generally the dates be amended to 26 October 2021 to align with the move. However, for provisions relating to penalty changes, such as the introduction of the grace period, it is preferable that they apply from the beginning of a month. Officials therefore propose such provisions apply from 1 November 2021. The affected sections and the commencement date for each are listed in Appendix A to this report. 5. Provisions relating to the annual assessment of child support, such as the changes to what is included as income, will apply from 1 April 2022 being the start of the next child support year. Consultation 6. The Treasury was consulted in the preparation of this report. Next steps 7. If you agree to the date changes, officials will draft a Cabinet Legislative Committee paper for your consideration and submission to the Cabinet Office. IR2021/321: Amendments to commencement dates in the Child Support Amendment Act 2021 Page 2 of 4 Recommended action We recommend that you: 8. agree to bring forward the commencement dates for the specified sections of the Child Support Amendment Act 2021 from 1 April 2022 to 26 October 2021 or 1 November 2021 as set out in Appendix A, Agreed/Not agreed 9. note t hat officials will draft a Cabinet Legislative Committee paper.

Because of this delay, the commencement dates of many the proposals in the Child Support Amendment Act were changed to 1 April 2022 or an earlier date as set by Order in Council (as were the child support amendments in the Taxation (Budget 2021 and Remedial Measures) Act 2021). 4. Moving child support to START is now set for Labour Weekend 2021. As such, commencement dates for provisions relating to the administration of the scheme need to be amended. 5. To achieve these commencement dates, officials recommend that you seek a waiver of the 28-day rule, which requires regulations to be notified in the New Zealand Gazette 28 days prior to their coming into effect. 6. You have previously agreed to amend the commencement dates by Order in Council \[report IR2021/321 refers\]. 7. The Parliamentary Counsel Office have drafted two Orders in Council. One sets the commencement dates for amendments in the Child Support Amendment Act 2021 and the other sets the commencement dates for amendments in the Taxation (Budget 2021 and Remedial Measures) Act 2021. Consultation 8. The Treasury was consulted in the preparation of this report. Next steps 9. A draft Cabinet paper and associated Orders in Council are attached for you to take to the Cabinet Legislation Committee on Thursday, 30 September 2021. IR2021/397: Cabinet paper – Orders in Council setting child support amendent’s commencement dates Page 2 of 2 10. Inland Revenue officials will provide speaking notes for taking the paper through the Cabinet Legislation Committee. Specifically, these will identify what the proposed changes are, the purpose for these changes, and address key concerns which may arise. 11. Officials recommend you sign the attached Order in Council “goatskin” cover sheets, for submission to Cabinet office with the Cabinet paper. 12. Officials consider that the attached Cabinet paper should be proactively released within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions, subject to minor redactions under the Official Information Act 1992.

In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee AMENDMENT TO APPLICATION DATES IN THE CHILD SUPPORT AMENDMENT ACT 2021 AND THE TAXATION (BUDGET 2021 AND REMEDIAL MEASURES) ACT 2021 Proposal 1. This paper seeks the Cabinet Legislation Committee’s to agree to the submission of the two accompanying Orders in Council to the Executive Council: the Child Support Amendment Act 2021 Commencement Order 2021 and the Taxation (Budget 2021 and Remedial Measures) Act Commencement Order 2021. The Orders will amend the commencement dates of specific amendments in the Child Support Amendment Act 2021 and the Taxation (Budget 2021 and Remedial Measures) Act 2021. Relation to government priorities 2. The amendments will align the commencement dates for recent child support amendments with the move of child support to Inland Revenue’s new technology platform, START. This is an operational amendment that requires Cabinet approval. Background 3. The Child Support Amendment Act 2021 was enacted on 24 March 2021. Its purpose was to make amendments to the principal Act in order to improve the administration of the child support scheme. This took advantage of the opportunity offered by the modernisation of Inland Revenue’s system as part of Business Transformation. 4. When the Child Support Amendment Bill was introduced, it was intended that the child support scheme would move to Inland Revenue’s START system in April 2021. However, due to COVID-19, this move was delayed until the second half of 2021. Because of this delay, the commencement dates of many of the proposals in the Child Support Amendment Act were changed to 1 April 2022 or an earlier date set by Order in Council (as were the child support amendments in the Taxation (Budget 2021 and Remedial Measures) Act 2021). Policy 5. Moving child support to START is now set for Labour Weekend 2021. As such, commencement dates for provisions relating to the administration of the scheme will need to be amended. I recommend the following: 5.1 for provisions relating to the administration of the scheme their commencement dates be amended to 26 October 2021 to align with the move; and 1 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-09 02:17:08 5.2 for provisions relating to penalty changes, such as the introduction of the grace period, it is preferable that they apply from the beginning of a month. Therefore, I propose these provisions apply from 1 November 2021. 6. The affected sections and the commencement date for each are listed in Appendix A to this report. 7. Amending the commencement dates will be done by way of two Orders in Council – the Child Support Amendment Act 2021 Commencement Order 2021 and the Taxation (Budget 2021 and Remedial Measures) Act Commencement Order 2021. 8. Provisions relating to the annual assessment of child support, such as the changes to what is included as income, will continue to apply from 1 April 2022, being the start of the next child support year. Financial implications 9. There are three provisions where amending the commencement date will have fiscal implications. These are:  the introduction of the grace period,  the repeal of the rule which requires that the penalty be at least $5, and  the imposition of the second stage of the penalty (formerly known as the initial penalty) from the 7th day after the due date to the 27th day after the due date. The costs of these changes are immaterial, -$25,000. The fiscal impact of the new commencement dates falls within rounding of annual forecasts. Timing and 28-day rule 10. If Cabinet agrees to the recommendations in this paper at the Cabinet meeting on 30 September 2021, the amendments will come into force on 26 October 2021 and 1 November 2021. 11. To achieve commencement dates for provisions relating to the administration of the child support scheme to coincide with the move of child support to START, I recommend that the 28-day rule, which requires regulations be notified in the New Zealand Gazette28 days prior to their coming into effect, be waived. Impact analysis Regulatory Impact Assessment 12. The Regulatory Impact Analysis Team at the Treasury has determined that the regulatory proposal to amend the application dates in the Child Support Amendment Act 2021 is exempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statement on the basis that it has no or minor impacts on businesses, individuals or not-for - profit entities. 2 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-09 02:17:08 Climate Implications of Policy Assessment 13. The Climate Implications of Policy Assessment (CIPA) team has been consulted and confirms that the CIPA requirements do not apply to this proposal as the threshold for significance is not met. Communications 14. I propose to issue a media statement once the Order in Council is made by the Executive Council. Inland Revenue will publish an article about these changes in its Tax Information Bulletin. Proactive release 15. I propose to proactively release the policy report, this Cabinet paper and associated Orders in Council in full shortly following the publication of the signed Orders in Council in the New Zealand Gazette, subject to redactions under the Official Information Act 1982. Consultation 16. The Treasury has been consulted on the amendments to the commencement dates. 17. The Treasury and the Parliamentary Counsel Office have been informed of the contents of this paper. Recommendations I recommend that the Cabinet Legislative Committee: 1. agree to bring forward the commencement dates for the specified sections of the Child Support Amendment Act 2021 and the Taxation (Budget 2021 and Remedial Measures) Act 2021 from 1 April 2022 to 26 October 2021 or 1 November 2021 as set out in Appendix A; 2. note that the Child Support Amendment Act 2021 Commencement Order 2021 and the Taxation (Budget 2021 and Remedial Measures) Act Commencement Order 2021will give effect to the decision referred to in paragraph 1 above; 3. note that a waiver of the 28-day rule is sought so that the regulations can come into force to coincide with the move of child support to Inland Revenue’s new technology platform START 4. agree to waive the 28-day rule so that the regulations can come into force on 26 October 2021 and 1 November 2021 to coincide with the move of child support to START; 5. authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Child Support Amendment Act 2021 Commencement Order 2021 and the Taxation (Budget 2021 and Remedial Measures) Act Commencement Order 2021; 3 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-09 02:17:08 Authorised for lodgement Hon David Parker Minister of Revenue 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-09 02:17:08 4 Appendix A: Sections of the Child Support Amendment Act 2021 and the Taxation (Budget 2021 and Remedial Measures) Act 2021 that require an Order in Council to amend the date of commencement Section being amended in the Child Support Act 1991 Section in the Child Support Amendment Act 2021 Proposed new commencement date Section 5 (Children who qualify for child support) 5 26 October 2021 Sections 19(3) to (7) (When liability to pay child support starts) 6 26 October 2021 Section 81A (Amendments of assessments arising from living circumstances existing at time initial assessment made) 18 26 October 2021 Section 87(7) (Amendment of assessments) 19 26 October 2021 Section 87A (Four-year time bar for amendment of certain assessments) 20 26 October 2021 Section 88(3A) (Notice of assessment of formula assessment of child support) 21 26 October 2021 Section 89A(1)(aa) (Outline) 22 26 October 2021 Section 89B (Definitions for this Part) 23(2) to (4) 26 October 2021 Subpart 2 heading in Part 5A – “persons suffering from long-term periods of illness” 24 26 October 2021 Cross-heading above section 89C - “persons suffering from long-term periods of illness” 25 26 October 2021 Section 89C(1)(a)(ii) (Exemption for long- term hospital patients) 26 26 October 2021 Section 89CA (Exemption for persons suffering from long-term periods of illness) 27 26 October 2021 Section 89D(1)(a)(ii) (Exemption for long- term prisoners) 28 26 October 2021 Sections 89F(1)(a)(i), (1)(a)(ia), (1)(a)(ii), (2A), (3)(aa) relevant period (Exemption does not apply at any time during child support year if income criteria not met at any time during relevant period) 29 26 October 2021 Sections 89G(1)(aa), (3)(aa) (Other restrictions on application of exemptions) 30 26 October 2021 Sections 89H(1)(b)(ia), (1)(ca), (2)(aa) (Applications for exemptions under this 31 26 October 2021 5 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-09 02:17:08 subpart) Subpart 3 heading in Part 5A “persons suffering from long-term periods of illness” 32 26 October 2021 Section 96BA (Four-month time limit for certain applications that are time-barred under section 87A) 34 26 October 2021 Section 96D(1)(bb) (Determinations that may be made) 35 26 October 2021 Section 105(2)(e) and heading (Matters as to which court must be satisfied before making order) 36 26 October 2021 Section 106B (Further provision on orders for offsetting of liabilities situations) 37 26 October 2021 Section 129(1) (Right to choose voluntary automatic deductions or other payment method) 40 26 October 2021 Section 129A (Newly liable persons to pay financial support by automatic deduction) 41 26 October 2021 Section 134AAA (Sixty-day grace period before penalties apply) 43 1 November 2021 Sections 152B(1), (1A), (2) to (4) (Offsetting child support payments) 55 26 October 2021 Section being amended in the Child Support Act 1991 Section in the Taxation (Budget 2021 and Remedial Measures) Act 2021 Proposed new commencement date Sections 134(2) and (3) (Penalties for late payment of financial support debts) 8(2) and (4) 1 November 2021 Part 5 - Schedule 1 - Clause 23 (Amendments to section 134 (Penalties for late payment of financial support debts) 9(2) 1 November 2021 6 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-09 02:17:08

This report outlines the process for increasing the student loan repayment threshold for New Zealand-based borrowers from 1 April 2022 and recommends you take a paper to Cabinet on this matter. 2. The current policy is to adjust the loan repayment threshold for movement in the Consumer Price Index – all groups excluding cigarettes and other tobacco products (CPI-ex tobacco) every year. 3. The current repayment threshold is $20,280. Under the current policy the new threshold would be $21,268 and would apply from 1 April 2022. This would allow New Zealand-based student loan borrowers to earn an additional $988 of income per year (or $19 per week) before they must begin to make loan repayments. 4. The impacts of adjusting the repayment threshold are already accounted for in the forecast. However, the Parliamentary Counsel Office will need to be instructed to draft the necessary regulations to increase the threshold and Cabinet authorisation is needed for the regulations to go to the Executive Council. 5. Any new repayment threshold needs to be included into payroll software in time for the 2022/23 income year. To provide payroll providers time to make and test changes to payroll software, Inland Revenue starts issuing payroll specifications about 4 months before the start of the next income year. We therefore recommend aiming to have this matter considered by Cabinet Legislative Committee on 11 November. Recommended action We recommend that you: 6. Note that under the current policy, the student loan repayment threshold is adjusted for inflation annually. Noted 7. Agree that the Parliamentary Counsel Office be instructed to draft the necessary regulations to increase the student loan repayment threshold to $21,268 and that the threshold apply from 1 April 2022. Agreed/Not Agreed 8. Agree to take the attached paper to the Cabinet Legislation Committee on 11 November, which asks for authority to submit the Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold) Regulations 2020 to the Executive Council, following consultation with the Minister of Revenue.

The student loan repayment threshold sets the amount of annual income at which a New Zealand-based borrower is required to begin making loan repayments. The threshold is a mechanism to reduce the likelihood that a low-income borrower would be placed into financial hardship as a consequence of their student loan repayment obligations. 13. The student loan repayment threshold is prescribed by regulation through an Order in Council. 14. The Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold) Regulations 2020 set the annual repayment threshold for the 2021/22 tax year at $20,280. This was an increase from $20,020 for the 2020/21 tax year. Process for calculating the threshold adjustment 15. Since 2016, Government policy has been that the student loan repayment threshold is adjusted annually in line with the CPI-ex tobacco (September quarter) \[CAB-16- MIN-0655 refers\]. Adjusting the repayment threshold for inflation maintains the real value of the amount of income someone can earn before they are required to begin repaying their student loan. The threshold for the 2022/23 tax year 16. The CPI-ex tobacco for the quarter ending 30 September 2021 was up 4.7% on the September 2020 quarter. Applying the CPI-ex tobacco value to the formula set out in the Appendix to this report produced a new annual threshold of $21,268. This would mean that New Zealand-based student loan borrowers could earn an additional $988 per year (or $19 per week) before being required to make loan repayments. Regulations to be made by Order in Council 17. To increase the student loan repayment threshold to $21,268 per year from 1 April 2022, the Parliamentary Counsel Office needs to be instructed to draft regulations under s 215(a) of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011. 18. Ideally, the Order in Council should be made before the end of 2021. This provides sufficient certainty and time for payroll providers to build and test any new repayment threshold amount into payroll software in time for the 1 April 2022 application date. Financial implications 19. The impacts of adjusting the threshold from 1 April 2022 using the current methodology are already accounted for in the forecast \[CAB-16-MIN-0655 refers\]. Administrative and system implications 20. Threshold adjustments need to be built into payroll specifications for the relevant tax year and tested. Inland Revenue issues a number of draft specifications to allow payroll users to gauge the impacts of payroll changes well in advance of their application. These specifications are normally published in December to apply for the following tax year. IR2021/486: Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold) Regulations 2021 Page 3 of 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Proactive release considerations 21. If the student loan repayment threshold is adjusted, officials recommend that the Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers be proactively released within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Next steps 22. We recommend the attached Cabinet paper be lodged with the Cabinet Office by 4 November for consideration at the Cabinet Legislation Committee meeting on 11 November. IR2021/486: Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold) Regulations 2021 Page 4 of 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Appendix Method Application from 1 April 2022 The formula to calculate the student loan repayment threshold for the 2022/23 tax year is: Tnew = RU (19084 x CPIexcl2 / 986.6778) Where: Tnew is the new threshold to be effective from 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2022 Ru() is a function which rounds its argument up to the next multiple of 52 CPIexcl2 is the value of the Consumer Price Index excluding cigarettes and tobacco products for 30 September Y-1 19084 is the repayment threshold for the year ending 31 March 2017 And 986.6778 is the All groups less cigarettes and tobacco subgroup (series SE9NS14800) for September 2015 CPIexcl2 = 1099 (index for September 2021) Tnew = Ru (19084 x CPIexcl2 / 986.6778) Ru (19084 x 1099/986.6778) Ru (19084 x 1.11384) Ru ($21,256.50) The next multiple of 52 above 21256.50 is 21268 (52 x 409). 21256.50 is therefore rounded up to 21268. Tnew = $21,268 Proposed threshold from 1 April 2022 is $21,268. IR2021/486: Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold) Regulations 2021 Page 5 of 5
1 In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee STUDENT LOAN SCHEME (REPAYMENT THRESHOLD) REGULATIONS 2021 Proposal 1. I propose that the Cabinet Legislation Committee authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the attached Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold) Regulations 2021 (the Regulations). The Regulations increase the income threshold at which New Zealand based borrowers must begin to repay their student loan, from $20,280 to $21,268, for the tax year beginning 1 April 2022. Policy 2. Section 215(a) of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 allows the Governor-General to make regulations setting the annual repayment threshold, or a means by which it may be calculated or ascertained via Order in Council. 3. The current policy is to adjust the student loan repayment threshold for inflation yearly. The inflation adjustment is based upon the September quarter Consumer Price Index – all groups excluding cigarettes and other tobacco products (CPI-ex tobacco). This approach was agreed to in 2016 under the previous National Government \[CAB-16- MIN-0655 refers\]. 4. Under the current policy, the student loan repayment threshold will increase from $20,280 a year to $21,268 for the tax year beginning 1 April 2022. 5. The repayment threshold limits the likelihood that a low-income borrower would be placed in financial hardship as a consequence of having to meet student loan repayment obligations. This year’s adjustment would mean New Zealand-based borrowers could earn an additional $988 of income per year (or $19 per week) before being required to make repayments on their outstanding student loan balance. Financial Implications 6. The impacts of adjusting the student loan repayment threshold, using the current methodology, are already accounted for in the forecast \[CAB-16-MIN-0655 refers\]. Administrative Implications 7. Threshold adjustments need to be built into payroll specifications for the relevant tax year. Inland Revenue issues specifications to allow payroll users to gauge the impacts of payroll changes on software well in advance of their application. These specifications are normally published in December to apply for the new tax year. 2 Impact Analysis 8. Treasury's Regulatory Impact Analysis team has determined that the Student Loan Repayment Threshold Adjustment 2021 proposal is exempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statement on the grounds that it has no or only minor impacts on businesses, individuals, and not-for-profit entities. Consultation 9. Inland Revenue has consulted with the Ministry of Education on the proposal to increase the repayment threshold for the 2022/23 tax year. Timing and 28-Day Rule 10. A waiver of the 28-day rule is not required as the Regulations are not proposed to come into force until 1 April 2022 and will apply for the 2022/23 tax year. Publicity 11. Inland Revenue will publish information about the new threshold and its impact on the student loan section of its website. 12. Inland Revenue will publish an article about this change in its Tax Information Bulletin. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 13. The Regulations have been certified by the Parliamentary Counsel Office (PCO) as being in order for submission to Cabinet. Regulations Review Committee 14. Officials consider that as the adjustment is of a minor and routine nature, it is unnecessary to refer the Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold) Regulations 2020 to the House of Representatives under Standing Order 319. Compliance 15. The Regulations comply with: 15.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 15.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993; 15.3 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993; 15.4 relevant international standards and obligations; 3 Proactive Release 16. I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers, in line with the provisions of the Official Information Act 1982, within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Recommendations I recommend that the Cabinet Legislation Committee: 1. note that the policy is for the student loan repayment threshold to be adjusted for inflation every year. 2. note that an Order in Council is required under section 215(a) of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 to adjust the repayment threshold. 3. note that the Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Threshold) Regulations 2021 increase the student loan repayment threshold to $21,268 for the 2022/23 tax year and come into force on 1 April 2022. 4. authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Student Loan Scheme (Repayment threshold) Regulations 2021.

POLICY AND REGULATORY STEWARDSHIP Tax policy report: Order in Council: minimum standards for financial statements prepared by domestic trusts Date: 21 January 2022 Priority: High Security level: In Confidence Report number: IR2022/002 Action sought Action sought Deadline Minister of Revenue Agree to recommendations 28 January 2022 Authorise the lodgement of the attached Cabinet paper 10 am Thursday 24 February 2022 Contact for telephone discussion (if required) Name Position Telephone Stewart Donaldson Principal Policy Advisor s 9(2)(a) Carl Harris Policy Advisor s 9(2)(a) 21 January 2022 Minister of Revenue Order in Council: minimum standards for financial statements prepared by domestic trusts Executive summary Purpose 1. In September 2021 you gave approval for officials to consult on minimum financial reporting standards for domestic trusts (BN2021/319). Consultation is now complete. T his report seeks your agreement to set the minimum standards by Order in Council (OIC). Background 2. The Taxation (Income Tax Rate and Other Amendments) Act 2020 introduced increased disclosure requirements for trusts to support the Commissioner’s ability to assess compliance with the new 39% personal income tax rate and assist the Commissioner in understanding and monitoring the use of structures and entities by trustees. 3. The new rules require trustees of a trust that derives assessable income, and does not fall within a specific exclusion category, to prepare financial statements. This is in addition to requirements to disclose settlors, settlements, distributions and appointer details. 4. An OIC will set minimum standards for the financial statements. This will provide certainty regarding the level of detail to which the statements must be prepared and will impact on the quality of data collected. Consultation 5. Policy officials undertook targeted and public consultation on the content of the OIC from June to December 2021. Officials also consulted on operational guidance to address practical matters for trustees, which is planned to be issued in an operational statement in March 2022. 6. The main themes arising from the OIC consultation involved a concern about high compliance costs, a preference for a one-year deferral of all disclosure requirements, general support for the OIC, recommendations concerning the definition and extent of relief for small trusts, and suggestions concerning various technical matters including related legislative amendments. Analysis 7. Officials acknowledge that the trust disclosure rules will result in increased compliance costs. T his was addressed in the 2020 Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) “Introducing a new top personal income tax rate”. The RIA included the recommendation to conduct a post-implementation review of the new disclosure rules. An appropriate time would be in 2023, after trustees using agents have filed IR2022/002: minimum standards for financial statements prepared by domestic trusts Page 1 of 11 their first returns under the new rules (these trustee s have until 31 March 2023 to file their returns for the 2021-22 year). 8. Throughout the OIC consultation process in 2021, policy officials attempted to strike a balance between ensuring the OIC does not generate unnecessary compliance costs and ensuring the Commissioner will have sufficient financial information to meet the objectives of the disclosure rules. We believe the proposed OIC content will achieve this. 9. The proposed key features of the OIC are: 9.1 Date of application: Officials propose that the OIC will apply for the 2021- 22 and future income years. 9.2 OIC requirements: Officials propose that the OIC specifies core requirements for financial statements that must be met by all trusts and additional requirements that must be met for trusts that are not small trusts. 9.3 Limited relief for small trusts: Officials propose limited relief in the OIC for small trusts. This would simplify their reporting obligations and significantly reduce compliance costs. However, all trusts will provide the same financial information in forms prescribed by the Commissioner to ensure the Commissioner has sufficient financial information to meet the objectives of the disclosure rules. Small trusts would be defined as having less than $100,000 assessable income, $100,000 tax deductions, and $5 million total assets in the relevant income year. The income and deduction thresholds would exclude income and expenditure relating to the residential property bright-line rules. Officials estimate that these thresholds will provide limited relief for approximately 75% or 135,000 out of 180,000 trusts subject to the new disclosure rules. 9.4 Asset valuation: Valuations will be market value, cost or tax adjusted value, at the discretion of the trustees. 9.5 Associated person disclosures: Associated person transactions must be disclosed in the financial statements if not disclosed in prescribed forms. Disclosures will not be required for transactions at market value. The definition of associated person will be the general definition to be consistent with prescribed forms, however the Commissioner’s operational statement will accept a best endeavours approach to reporting all associated persons transactions in the first year if information is not available. 10. Officials have recommended three legislative amendments to the trust disclosure rules in the separate policy report for including amendments to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2021-22, GST, and Remedial Matters) Bill at the Finance and Expenditure Committee stage (IR2022/017 refers). Timing 11. Officials recommend that the OIC come into force by 31 March 2022. Subject to Cabinet Committee and Cabinet meeting dates, this will require a waiver of the 28- day rule. 12. Officials have been liaising with the Parliamentary Counsel Office (PCO) regarding the drafting of this OIC. Due to the compressed timeframes, there is not sufficient time to obtain Cabinet approval to provide drafting instructions to PCO, and then separately obtain Cabinet Legislation Committee approval to submit the OIC to Executive Council. Officials recommend seeking policy and legislative approval for the OIC in the same Cabinet paper. PCO will begin drafting the OIC following your agreement to the minimum standards set out in this paper. IR2022/002: minimum standards for financial statements prepared by domestic trusts Page 2 of 11 Background 14. The Taxation (Income Tax Rate and Other Amendments) Act 2020 introduced increased disclosure requirements for trusts to support the Commissioner’s ability to assess compliance with the new 39% personal income tax rate and assist the Commissioner in understanding and monitoring the use of structures and entities by trustees. Amendments to reduce compliance costs for some trusts were subsequently enacted in March 2021 in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020-21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2021. 15. The increased disclosure requirements apply to trustees of trusts that derive assessable income and are not subject to specific exclusions. These new rules apply for the 2021–22 and later income years and require trustees to include with their annual return: 15.1 A statement of profit or loss and a statement of financial position 15.2 The amount and nature of settlements received 15.3 Settlor details, including details of previous settlors if not previously supplied to the Commissioner 15.4 The amount of distributions made and details of beneficiaries who received the distributions 15.5 Appointer details. 16. Officials propose setting minimum standards for the financial statements by an Order in Council made under section 21C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). In the absence of minimum standards, there would be uncertainty regarding the level of detail the statements must be prepared to. This would affect the quality of data collected. 17. Two similar Orders have been made under the same section in the past: 17.1 The Tax Administration (Financial Statements) Order 2014 sets out the minimum standards for financial statements of companies, and 17.2 The Tax Administration (Financial Statements—Foreign Trusts) Order 2017 sets out the minimum standards for financial statements of foreign trusts. Impact 18. The total volume of New Zealand trusts has been estimated to be up to 500,000. Inland Revenue records indicate that approximately 180,000 domestic trusts report assessable income each year and may be affected to some extent by the new disclosure requirements. The financial statement disclosure requirements will primarily affect approximately 55,000 of these domestic trusts. These are trusts that report assessable income to Inland Revenue but do not currently report business income or file any financial statements. Objectives 19. Officials proposed minimum standards that are consistent with the following objectives: • Minimise compliance costs while supporting policy objectives. The minimum standards will strike a balance between minimising unnecessary compliance costs and ensuring the Commissioner will have sufficient financial information to meet the objectives of the disclosure rules. IR2022/002: minimum standards for financial statements prepared by domestic trusts Page 4 of 11 • Improve the quality of data. The minimum standards will positively impact on the quality of data collected. • Ensure consistency with existing frameworks. Th e minimum standards will be consistent with previous minimum standards set for companies and foreign trusts and they will align with accounting principles where appropriate. • Follow the proportionality principle. The minimum standards will be tailored to the size of the trust. Small trusts will not be required to meet all of the minimum standards set for large trusts. Consultation 20. Policy officials undertook targeted and public consultation on the content of the OIC from June to December 2021. Officials also consulted on operational guidance to address practical matters for trustees. The main themes arising from the OIC consultation were: 20.1 High compliance costs. The new disclosure rules will result in some trusts incurring significant compliance costs. Submitters suggested this could be addressed by legislating a one-year deferral of all of the trust disclosure rules, to allow trustees to structure out of the rules or give them more time to prepare for implementation of the rules. In addition, legislative amendments could provide small trusts an exemption from all of the trust disclosure rules. 20.2 Support for OIC. The proposal to enact an OIC to set minimum financial reporting standards was supported, as it would provide guidance for trustees. 20.3 OIC relief for small trusts. Submitters engaged on how small trusts should be defined for the purposes of the OIC relief and the scope of that relief. 20.4 Technical matters. Submitters engaged on a range of technical matters that should be required in the OIC, the most significant relating to valuation, associated person disclosures, and disclosures relating to beneficiary accounts. Analysis 21. The proposed key features of the OIC content, largely supported by submitters and outlined below and in detail in Appendices A and B, are: 21.1 Date of application: Officials propose that the OIC will apply for the 2021- 22 and future income years. There are several areas where compliance for the first year (2021-22) could be on a ‘best endeavours’ basis and these will be addressed in the Commissioner’s operational statement. For example, the calculation of opening balances and the reporting of transactions with associated persons. Compliance with the OIC will not impact on the financial information the Commissioner will collect in prescribed forms. 21.2 OIC requirements: Officials propose that the OIC specifies core requirements for financial statements that must be met by all trusts and additional requirements that must be met for trusts that are not small trusts. 21.3 Limited relief for small trusts: Officials propose limited relief in the OIC for small trusts which would be defined using income, expense and asset thresholds. The proposal is to set these thresholds at $100,000 assessable income, $100,000 tax deductions, and $5 million total assets. The income IR2022/002: minimum standards for financial statements prepared by domestic trusts Page 5 of 11 and deduction thresholds would exclude income and expenditure relating to the residential property bright-line rules. Officials estimate that these thresholds will result in 75% (135,000 out of 180,000) of trusts will be classified as small trusts for the purpose of OIC relief. This means small trusts will have to meet fewer minimum requirements for their financial statements set out in the OIC, but the information they provide to the Commissioner in prescribed forms will remain the same for all trusts (information to be collected in prescribed forms is summarised in Appendix A). 21.4 Asset valuation: Valuations will be market value, cost or tax adjusted value, at the discretion of the trustees. The valuation method for certain assets must be disclosed. 21.5 Associated person disclosures: Associated person transactions must be disclosed in the financial statements if not disclosed in prescribed forms. Disclosures will not be required for transactions at market value. The general definition of associated persons will be applied, however for practical purposes the Commissioner’s operational statement will accept a best endeavours approach to reporting associated persons transactions in the first year if information is not available to trustees. 21.6 Beneficiary account movements: Beneficiary account movement details will not be set out in the OIC but movements disclosed in prescribed forms would, at a minimum, be part of the materials supporting the financial statements. 22. Officials have recommended three legislative amendments to the trust disclosure rules in the separate policy report for including amendments in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2021-22, GST, and Remedial Matters) Bill at the Finance and Expenditure Committee stage (IR2022/017 refers). These proposed changes will: 22.1 Exclude non-cash distributions that are minor services incidental to the operation of the trust from the disclosure requirements. 22.2 Clarify that the new rules require trusts to disclose the nature of each distribution made by the trustee of the trust. 22.3 Exempt all foreign trusts from the new domestic disclosure rules. Administrative implications 23. Implementation and on-going administration costs will be met through baseline funding. IR2022/002: minimum standards for financial statements prepared by domestic trusts Page 6 of 11 Appendix A – Summary of proposed minimum requirements for the preparation of financial statements by domestic trusts subject to section 59BA of the Tax Administration Act 25. The OIC will contain minimum requirements for the preparation of financial statements by trusts subject to section 59BA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA), as summarised below. For the purpose of the OIC, the term “financial statements” includes any notes and other supporting materials forming part of the financial statements. Tier 1: Core requirements – for all trusts subject to s 59BA i. Prepare a statement of financial position and a profit and loss statement. ii. Apply the double-entry method of recording financial transactions. iii. Use the prescribed valuation principles and disclose the valuation method adopted for shares/ownership interests, land and buildings. iv. Financial statements must contain all relevant amounts that any forms prescribed by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue under section 35 of the TAA require to be copied from the company’s financial statements (for example, the IR10 Financial Statements Summary and the financial statement disclosure section in the IR6 income tax return and the IR6B movement in beneficiary accounts). Tier 2: Additional requirements for trusts that are not “small trusts” v. Apply the principles of accrual accounting. vi. Provide a statement of accounting policies. vii. Disclose comparable figures for the previous income year to the extent that the trustee has that information. viii. Disclose several specific items: -A reconciliation between the profit or loss in the statement of profit and loss to taxable income; -An appropriately detailed schedule of the trust’s fixed assets and depreciable property used for tax purposes; -Matters relating to trusts with forestry and livestock businesses: information about the cost of timber as at the end of the income year and a reconciliation of movements in the cost of timber during the income year; if the trust is a specified livestock owner, details of livestock valuation methods, valuations, and calculations for tax purposes. ix. Disclose associated persons transaction details. For the purposes of the disclosure rules: -The disclosure should include details of transactions between the trust and any associated person of the trustee, unless the transaction is minor and incidental to the activities of the trustee; -Transaction details include names of the associated persons, the nature of the association, the nature of the transactions and the amounts involved; -Disclosures are not required if transactions are at a market rate; -If associated person disclosures have been made separately in any forms prescribed by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, this information does not need to be duplicated in the financial statements. -Associated persons are as defined in subpart YB of the Income Tax Act 2007. IR2022/002: minimum standards for financial statements prepared by domestic trusts Page 7 of 11 26. Officials note that from the 2021-22 and later years, the following financial information will be collected by the Commissioner in prescribed forms for all domestic trusts subject to section 59BA: Income Tax Return for trusts i. Total accounting profit before tax ii. Tax adjustments to reconcile accounting income with assessable income in tax return iii. Untaxed realised gains iv. Total assets v. Associated persons financial arrangements vi. Shares/ownership Interests vii. Land viii. Buildings ix. Total liabilities x. Associated persons financial arrangements xi. Total equity xii. Drawings xiii. Closing current account balances Trust beneficiary form Beneficiary account movements i. Opening balance + Distributions ii. Accounting income and other distributions iii. Corpus iv. Capital v. Use of trust property for less than market value vi. Distribution of trust assets vii. Forgiveness of debt - Withdrawals viii. Amounts withdrawn from the trust during the income year ix. Closing balance IR2022/002: minimum standards for financial statements prepared by domestic trusts Page 8 of 11 Appendix B – Summary of policy recommendations 27. The policy recommendations following discussions with stakeholders are summarised below. 28. Minimum standards: Officials propose the OIC will state it contains ‘minimum’ standards for trustees of trusts required to comply with the disclosure requirements set out in section 59BA of the TAA. Financial statements may be prepared to any level above the minimum specified by the OIC. These minimum standards will not directly affect other disclosures required under section 59BA(2), which include details of settlements, settlors, distributions and appointers. 29. Date of application: Officials propose the OIC be enacted by 31 March 2022 and apply it to the 2021-22 income year for balance dates ending 31 March or later. There are several areas where compliance for the first year (2021-22) could be on a ‘best endeavours’ basis and these will be addressed in the Commissioner’s operational statement rather than the OIC. Changes proposed as a result of consultation remove significant compliance costs so there is no advantage in deferring its application. Making the OIC before 31 March 2022 and applying it for the 2021-22 year onwards will provide useful guidance for trustees. Setting out in an operational statement where the Commissioner will accept a ‘best endeavours’ approach for the first year will reduce transition costs for many trusts. Early balance-date trusts will not be required to follow the OIC (approximately 400 out of 180,000 trusts with assessable income are early balance date trusts and about half will be able to access the OIC small trust concessions). 30. Financial statement notes and supporting materials: Officials propose the domestic trust OIC will clarify that, for the purposes of the OIC, the term ‘financial statements’ includes any notes and other supporting materials. Section 59BA(2)(a) requires trusts to provide “a statement of profit or loss and a statement of financial position”. Where the OIC refers to financial statements it will align with the companies OIC which states that the term financial statements “includes any notes and other supporting materials forming part of the financial statements”. This is an important compliance cost savings measure – making it clear that items required in the OIC can simply be supporting materials rather than in the actual financial statements. 31. Non-standard balance date reporting: Officials propose that financial statements may be prepared to a non-standard balance date (i.e. a balance date that is not 31 March) used for accounting purposes, provided the trust does not derive business income which would require Commissioner approval for non- standard balance date reporting. This concession will relieve passive investment trusts from having to re-state their financial statements to the 31 March tax year if they have non-standard balance dates for accounting purposes. 32. Small trust thresholds: Officials propose that small trust relief thresholds be as follows: i. To qualify as a small trust, a trustee must report, for the relevant income year: • less than $100,000 assessable income (before allocation); and • less than $100,000 deductible expenditure; and • total assets (including assets that are not in the tax base) valued at less than $5m as at balance date. ii. The $100,000 assessable income and deductible expenditure figures used for the purpose of determining whether a trust is small will not include income assessed under the bright-line rules or related deductible expenditure. IR2022/002: minimum standards for financial statements prepared by domestic trusts Page 9 of 11 iii. Assets will be valued using the valuation principles in the OIC and must be consistent with financial statements. 33. Officials estimate that raising these thresholds will provide relief for approximately 75% or 135,000 out of 180,000 trusts subject to the new disclosure rules. Threshold increases remove significant compliance costs but allow IR to continue to collect sufficient information in prescribed forms. 34. Officials considered suggestions from submitters to minimise trusts ‘flipping’ in and out of the disclosure rules if they have one-off transactions which would put them above the thresholds. Officials recommend the approach suggested by some submitters that the calculation be limited to assessable income (and deductible expenditure) in the current year but that assessable income derived from the bright- line residential property sale rules (and related deductible expenditure) be excluded to avoid anomalies involving residential property sales. 35. Small trust scope of relief: Officials propose the scope of relief for small trusts will mean only four minimum standards will apply to small trusts: i. Prepare a statement of financial position and a profit and loss statement. ii. Apply the double-entry method of recording financial transactions. iii. Use the prescribed valuation principles and disclose the valuation method adopted for shares/ownership interests, land and buildings. iv. Financial statements must contain all relevant amounts that any forms prescribed by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue under section 35 of the TAA require to be copied from the company’s financial statements (for example, the IR10 Financial Statements Summary and the financial statement disclosure section in the IR6 income tax return and the IR6B movement in beneficiary accounts). These increases in the scope of the relief for small trusts remove significant compliance costs but allow the Commissioner to continue to collect sufficient information in prescribed forms. 36. Valuations: Officials propose the valuation method will be left to the judgement of the trustees. 37. The OIC will clarify that for the purposes of calculating market value of properties, the use of rating valuations is an acceptable proxy. 38. In order to prevent inappropriate use of a ‘tax value’ option, this option will be restricted to assets and liabilities that are in the tax base. 39. Associated person disclosures: Officials propose: i. Trustees must disclose associated persons transaction details, with the exception of trustees of small trusts who must only disclose associated person transactions when required to do so in prescribed forms. ii. Transaction details include names of the associated persons, the nature of the association, the nature of the transactions and the amounts involved. iii. Associated persons are defined in subpart YB of the Income Tax Act 2007. iv. The disclosure should include details of transactions between the trust and any associated person of the trustee, unless the transaction is minor and incidental to the activities of the trustee. v. Disclosures are not required if transactions are at a market rate. IR2022/002: minimum standards for financial statements prepared by domestic trusts Page 10 of 11 vi. If associated person disclosures have been made separately in any forms prescribed by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, this information does not need to be duplicated in the financial statements. 40. The approach will reduce duplication with disclosures in prescribed forms, provide more clarity as to what disclosure is required, and reduce the extent of disclosures required (for example, by excluding minor and incidental transactions). 41. Beneficiary account movements: Officials propose there will be no requirement in the OIC to provide a line-by -line reconciliation in beneficiary accounts. Instead, the OIC will clarify that financial statements must contain all relevant amounts that any forms prescribed by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue including the IR6B movement in beneficiary accounts. The beneficiary account movements disclosed in the prescribed form will be sufficient for the purpose of the OIC. This will save compliance costs. 42. Gross-up options: Officials propose the OIC will not prescribe dividend gross-up for imputation credits and interest/dividend gross-up for RWT. The gross-up option will be left to the judgement of the trustees. 43. Trusts Act 2019: Officials propose the OIC will explicitly note that there are requirements for trustees to keep records under section 45 of the Trusts Act 2019. Section 45 of the Trusts Act 2019 requires each trustee of a trust to keep, so far as is reasonable, records of the trust property that identify the assets, liabilities, income, and expenses of the trust and that are appropriate to the value and complexity of the trust property. 44. This requirement differs from the OIC as it does not explicitly require trustees to compile financial statements and it allows the trustee to exercise judgement as to what is reasonable and appropriate in respect of record keeping. However, it is a legislative provision that could be usefully referenced in the OIC, while clarifying that the minimum reporting standards in the OIC are more prescriptive and in some cases apply income tax concepts (for example, the use of tax valuations). 45. Fixed asset schedule: Officials propose the financial statements will include an appropriately detailed schedule of the trust’s fixed assets and depreciable property used for tax purposes. Fixed assets with a tax value are typically tracked through a tax fixed assets register. For the purpose of the OIC it will only be required to be included in financial statements as supporting materials.

In 2020, Cabinet agreed to increase the disclosure requirements for trusts, including the requirement to prepare financial statements for the 2021–22 and later income years (CAB-20-MIN-0484 refers). This paper seeks Cabinet’s approval of the minimum level of detail required in those financial statements. Approval is also sought for the Order in Council required to bring the minimum standards into law, and for authority to submit the Order directly to the Executive Council. Relation to Government Priorities 2. The Taxation (Income Tax Rate and Other Amendments) Act 2020 introduced a new t op personal income tax rate of 39% on income exceeding $180,000 for the 2021–22 and later income years. The introduction of a 39% tax rate formed part of the Labour Party’s manifesto for the 2020 General Election. Labour campaigned explicitly that we would not increase the trustee income tax rate but would monitor behaviour around avoidance and the success of enforcement measures. 3. The Act also introduced additional information reporting and disclosure obligations f or trustees for the 2021–22 and later income years. The objective of these obligations is related to the integrity of the tax system. The disclosure rules will help evaluate the effectiveness of the new 39% rate and gain insight into the use of structures and entities by trustees in New Zealand. Executive Summary 4. The increased trust disclosure requirements include a requirement to prepare a st atement of profit or loss and a statement of financial position. This requirement does not specify what level of detail the statements must be prepared to. 5. I propose to set, by Order in Council, minimum requirements for financial statements prepared by trusts subject to the new disclosure rules. This will provide increased certainty for trustees regarding their reporting obligations, support compliance with the disclosure rules and will improve the quality of data collected. The proposed Order would apply for the 2021–22 and later income years for most trusts. 6. Inland Revenue officials undertook targeted and public consultation on the proposed co ntent of the Order in 2021. Submitters supported setting minimum standards by Order in Council, as it would provide certainty regarding trustees’ reporting obligations and help mitigate the compliance costs imposed by the disclosure rules. 1 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 11:05:11 7. The proposed Order has been designed based on feedback received in consultation and is aimed at striking a balance between supporting the Government’s objectives for the disclosure rules and minimising compliance costs for trusts. The proposed minimum standards provide simplified reporting requirements for certain trusts. Background 8. On 23 November 2020, Cabinet decided to defer the decision on whether to increase t he trustee income tax rate to 39% to a later date pending information on whether there is a behavioural response to avoid paying the new 39% top personal income tax rate. Cabinet agreed to collect information from trustees to test compliance and effective operation of the new 39% rate and provide better information to understand and monitor the use of structures and entities by trustees (CAB-21-MIN-0484 refers). 9. The Taxation (Income Tax Rate and Other Amendments) Act 2020 was enacted on 7 D ecember 2020 and introduced increased disclosure requirements for trusts that derive assessable income. The rules apply for the 2021–22 and later income years and require trustees to prepare a statement of profit or loss and a statement of financial position. Trustees must disclose the following information to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue: 9.1 the amount and nature of settlements received (settlements do not need to be d isclosed if they are minor services incidental to the activities of the trust and are provided to the trustee at less than market value); 9.2 settlor details, including details of previous settlors if not previously supplied to t he Commissioner of Inland Revenue; 9.3 the amount of distributions made and details of beneficiaries who received the distributions; and 9.4 appointer details. 10. Certain trusts are excluded from these rules. These exclusions largely relate to trusts t hat already have reporting requirements under other regimes. Examples include non-active trusts, trusts eligible to be Māori authorities, foreign trusts and charitable trusts. 11. The total volume of trusts in New Zealand has been estimated to be over 400,000. I nland Revenue records indicate that approximately 180,000 domestic trusts report assessable income each year and may be affected to some extent by the new disclosure requirements. The financial statement disclosure requirements will primarily affect approximately 55,000 of these domestic trusts. These are trusts that report assessable income to Inland Revenue but do not currently report business income or file any financial statements. 12. There would be uncertainty regarding the level of detail the financial statements must b e prepared to if minimum standards were not set. This would affect the quality of data collected and possibly lead to non-compliance with the rules. 13. Section 21C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) provides that the Governor- General can prescribe minimum requirements for financial reporting. Before 2 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 11:05:11 recommending the making of an Order under this section, the Minister of Revenue must consult with professional accounting bodies. This requirement has been satisfied by consultation undertaken by officials in 2021, as detailed below. Objectives 14. The minimum standards should be consistent with the following objectives: 14.1 Minimising compliance costs: T he minimum standards should strike a balance between ensuring the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will have sufficient financial information to meet the objectives of the disclosure rules and minimising unnecessary compliance costs. 14.2 Achieving the Government’s objectives: T he minimum standards should positively impact on the quality of data collected to help evaluate the effectiveness of the new 39% rate and gain insight into the use of structures and entities by trustees. 14.3 Ensuring consistency with existing frameworks: T he minimum standards should be consistent where possible with previous minimum standards set for companies and foreign trusts and should align with accounting standards and principles where appropriate. 14.4 Proportionality: T he minimum standards should be tailored to the size of the trust. Smaller trusts should have simplified reporting requirements. Consultation 15. Inland Revenue officials undertook targeted and public consultation on the proposed mi nimum standards in 2021. Officials also consulted on operational guidance for the disclosure rules to address practical matters for trustees. The main themes arising from consultation were: 15.1 High compliance costs: T he new disclosure rules will result in some trusts incurring significant compliance costs. Submitters suggested this could be addressed by legislating a one-year deferral of all the trust disclosure rules, to allow trustees to restructure out of the rules or give them more time to prepare for implementation of the rules. In addition, legislative amendments could provide smaller trusts an exemption from all the disclosure requirements. 15.2 Support for Order in Council: T he proposal to set minimum financial reporting standards by Order in Council was supported, as it would increase certainty for trustees regarding reporting obligations. 15.3 Relief for small trusts: S ubmitters engaged on how small trusts should be defined for the purposes of the Order in Council relief and the scope of that relief. 15.4 Technical matters: S ubmitters engaged on a range of technical matters that should be covered by the Order in Council, the most significant relating to valuation methods, associated person disclosures, and disclosures relating to beneficiary accounts. 3 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 11:05:11 16. In addition to consulting with members of the tax and accounting community, the External Reporting Board, the Department of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, the Ministry of Justice, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, Statistics NZ and the Treasury were consulted during the development of the proposed minimum standards. Minimum standards 17. The key features of the proposed Order are set out below. These features have been d eveloped based on feedback received in consultation and the objectives set out above. The annex contains further detail on the proposed minimum requirements. Application date 18. A small number of trusts have an early balance date and will have already filed their annual return before the Order is proposed to come into force. Inland Revenue data indicates approximately 0.2% (400 out of 180,000) of trusts subject to these rules are in this situation. 19. To prevent retrospectively imposing requirements on these trusts, I propose that the mi nimum standards apply for income years that end after the Order comes into force. This will be 2021–22 and future income years for the large majority of trusts that do not have an early balance date. 20. There are several areas where compliance for the first year (2021–22) could be on a ‘best endeavours’ basis and these are expected be addressed in the Commissioner’s Operational Statement on the disclosure rules. For example, this could include the calculation of opening balances in the first year and the reporting of transactions with associated persons. Simplified reporting requirements for certain trusts 21. The proposed Order provides simplified reporting requirements for certain trusts. A trust with less than $100,000 assessable income, less than $100,000 tax deductions and less than $5 million total assets in an income year will have simplified reporting requirements. These thresholds would exclude income and expenditure relating to the residential property brightline rules to reduce the risk of trusts not qualifying for the simplified reporting requirements due to large one-off transactions. 22. Officials estimate that these thresholds will result in 75% (135,000 out of 180,000) of t rusts qualifying for simplified reporting requirements. 23. While these trusts will have to meet fewer requirements for their financial statements, all trusts will provide the same financial information in forms prescribed by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. This helps reduce compliance costs for a significant number of trusts, while continuing to support the objectives of the disclosure rules of evaluating the effectiveness if the new 39% rate and gaining insight into the use of structures and entities by trustees in New Zealand. 4 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 11:05:11 Asset valuation 24. Assets will be valued at either market value, cost or tax adjusted value, at the discretion of the trustees. For the purposes of calculating the market value of properties, the use of rating valuations will be an acceptable proxy. This helps ensure trustees are not forced to re-value assets, or engage valuers, to comply with the disclosure rules. 25. The valuation method for certain assets must be disclosed. This helps support the q uality of the data collected. Associated person disclosures 26. Trustees must disclose associated persons transaction details, except for trustees of “simplified reporting trusts” who only need to disclose associated person transactions when required to do so in prescribed forms. 27. Disclosures will not be required for transactions at market value. Disclosure of t ransactions with associated persons not at market value is important to assess compliance with the 39% personal income tax rate. Financial Implications 28. This proposal has no financial implications. Timing and 28-Day Rule 29. The proposed Order will come into force on 31 March 2022, the end of the 2021–22 income year for trustees with standard balance dates. The minimum standards set by the Order will apply for income years ending on or after the Order comes into force. That is, the Order will not retrospectively impose requirements on trustees with balance dates prior to the Order coming into force. 30. A waiver of the 28-day rule is sought to allow the Order to come into force by 31 Ma rch 2022 on the grounds that the Order needs to be in force before the end of the 2021–22 income year for trustees with standard balance dates, to provide increased certainty regarding reporting obligations for the 2021–22 and later income years. Compliance 31. The Order in Council complies with: 31.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 31.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 a nd the Human Rights Act 1993; 31.3 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 2020; 31.4 relevant international standards and obligations; 31.5 the Legislation Guidelines (2021 edition), which are maintained by the L egislation Design and Advisory Committee. 5 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 11:05:11 Regulations Review Committee Application date 32. The short time between the proposed making of this Order and the application date of the minimum standards may be a basis for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Order to the attention of the House of Representatives under Standing Order 327. Officials consider this risk to be low and that the application date is appropriate for the following reasons: 32.1 The disclosure rules were enacted in December 2020. Trustees have had a re asonable amount of notice regarding the requirements in the disclosure rules in section 59BA of the TAA. 32.2 Trustees will have until 7 July 2022 to file returns for the 2021–22 income ye ar. Trustees with tax agents (the large majority) will be able to file returns as late as 31 March 2023. 32.3 During consultation in 2021, submitters broadly supported applying the m inimum standards for the 2021–22 income year. Submitters considered that this would provide increased certainty regarding trustees’ reporting obligations. Deferring the application of the Order to a later date would provide no relief from the requirement in section 59BA to prepare financial statements for the 2021–22 income year. 32.4 Inland Revenue has been engaged with tax agents, accountants and software p roviders regarding the implementation of the disclosure requirements. Sub-delegation issue 33. Clause 1(e) of the Schedule to the Order requires that the financial statements must include all relevant amounts that are required to be copied from financial statements into a form prescribed by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (for example, the IR10 form – financial statements summary). 34. There is a low risk that this clause may be a basis for the Regulations Review C ommittee to draw the Order to the attention of the House of Representatives under Standing Order 327. This is because there is a risk that the Order could be seen to sub-delegate to the Commissioner the legislative power to set requirements for financial statements for domestic trusts. 35. Taxpayers that derive business income are required to either file an IR10 form or p rovide a set of financial statements to Inland Revenue. Clause 1(e) of the Schedule is an important integrity measure to ensure that taxpayers cannot avoid the requirements in the IR10 form by filing a set of financial statements prepared to a lower standard. This clause ensures that the financial statements are an appropriate proxy for the IR10 form. This approach follows the precedent set by the minimum standards for financial reporting for companies. 1 36. Clause 1(e) of the Schedule to the Order only relates to forms that the Commissioner is already authorised to prescribe under section 35 of the TAA. To ensure the 1 Clause 1(e) of the Schedule to Tax Administration (Financial Statements) Order 2014. 6 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 11:05:11 financial statement requirements are workable, it is important that they interface with these forms. In these circumstances, officials are satisfied that this approach is within the scope of the regulation making power contemplated by Parliament. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 37. The Order in Council has been certified by the Parliamentary Counsel Office as b eing in order for submission to Cabinet. Impact Analysis Regulatory Impact Statement 38. A Regulatory Impact Statement has been completed and is attached. 39. The Quality Assurance reviewers at Inland Revenue have reviewed R egulatory Impact Statement: Minimum standards for financial statements prepared by domestic trusts and consider that the information and analysis summarised in it meets the quality assurance criteria of the Regulatory Impact Statement framework. Climate Implications of Policy Assessment 40. The Climate Implications of Policy Assessment (CIPA) team has been consulted and confirms that the CIPA requirements do not apply to this proposal as the threshold for significance is not met. Population Implications 41. There are no population implications arising from these proposals. Human Rights 42. The proposals do not give rise to any human rights implications. Communications 43. I will publish a press statement regarding the minimum standards for financial st atements prepared by domestic trusts before the end of the 2021–22 income year. 44. The Order will be published in the G azette and Inland Revenue will include details of the new minimum standards in a Tax Information Bulletin after the Order is made. 45. To date a number of submitters and media articles have focused on the increased compliance costs for trustees as a result of the new domestic trust disclosure rules. They have noted these rules go further than reporting requirements under the Trusts Act 2019 and suggested that because the disclosure rules were enacted in December 2020 with no consultation it would be preferrable to defer their application for a year. While the proposed Order goes some way to reducing compliance costs based on submitter feedback, it is likely that concerns about the timing and the amount of information being collected will continue to be raised. 7 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 11:05:11 Proactive Release 46. I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key a dvice papers with appropriate redactions within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Committee: 1. note t hat the Taxation (Income Tax Rate and Other Amendments) Act 2020 introduced increased disclosure requirements for certain trusts, including the requirement to prepare financial statements for the 2021–22 and later income years. 2. note t hat section 21C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows the Governor- General to prescribe, by Order in Council, minimum requirements for preparing financial statements for certain classes of taxpayers. 3. note t hat before recommending the making of an Order in Council under section 21C of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the Minister of Revenue must consult with professional accounting bodies. Targeted and public consultation undertaken by officials in 2021 satisfies this requirement. 4. agree to the minimum financial reporting requirements as set out in the attached Order, Tax Administration (Financial Statements—Domestic Trusts) Order 2022. 5. agree t hat the proposed Order should apply to all trusts subject to the disclosure rules introduced by the Taxation (Income Tax Rate and Other Amendments) Act 2020. 6. agree that the proposed Order should apply for income years that end on or after 31 March 2022. 7. authorise t he submission to the Executive Council of the Tax Administration (Financial Statements—Domestic Trusts) Order 2022. 8. note that the Tax Administration (Financial Statements—Domestic Trusts) Order 2022 will come into force on 31 March 2022, the end of the 2021–22 income year for trusts with standard balance dates. 9. note t hat a waiver of the 28-day rule is sought so that the Order in Council can come into force by 31 March 2022 on the ground it needs to be in force before the end of the 2021–22 income year. 8 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 11:05:11 10. agree to waive the 28-day rule so that the Order in Council can come into force by 31 March 2022. Authorised for lodgement Hon David Parker M inister of Revenue 9 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 11:05:11 Annex – minimum standards for financial statements prepared by domestic trusts For the purposes of the Order in Council, the term “financial statements” includes any notes a nd other supporting materials forming part of the financial statements. The standards set out below are “minimum” standards. Financial statements may be p repared to any level above these minimum requirements. Financial statements may be prepared to a non-standard balance date (i.e. a balance date that is not 31 March) used for accounting purposes, provided the trust does not derive business income (which would require approval from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue for non-standard balance date reporting – section 38 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA)). Valuation Valuation of assets and liabilities can be either at market value, cost or tax adjusted value, a t the discretion of the trustee. The use of ‘tax value’ will be limited to assets and liabilities that are in the tax base (i.e., assets and liabilities that are used in the production of assessable income). Simplified reporting trusts A trust is a “simplified reporting trust” for a relevant income year if the trustee reports:  less than $100,000 assessable income, AND  less than $100,000 deductible expenditure, AND  total assets reported in the statement of financial position (including both private and i ncome producing assets) valued at less than $5 million as at balance date. The $100,000 assessable income and deductible expenditure thresholds used in this test d o not include income assessed under the brightline rules or related deductible expenditure. Assets will be valued using the valuation principles set out above and must be consistent with the prepared financial statements. Core requirements for all trusts The following minimum standards apply to all trusts subject to the disclosure rules. The financial statements must consist of:  A statement of financial position setting out the assets, liabilities, and net assets of t he trust as at the end of the return year; and  A statement of profit or loss statement showing income derived, and expenditure i ncurred, by the trust during the return year. Financial statements must be prepared using the double-entry method of recording financial t ransactions. Financial statements must use the prescribed valuation principles (set out above) and d isclose the valuation method adopted for land, buildings, and shares/ownership interests. 10 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 11:05:11 A trustee can choose to adopt a different valuation method for each of these categories. If there are multiple assets within one category (e.g., multiple buildings), each asset may be valued using a different method. Financial statements must contain all relevant amounts that any forms prescribed by the C ommissioner under section 35 of the TAA require to be copied from the company’s financial statements. Additional requirements for trusts that are not “simplified reporting trusts” For trusts that do not qualify for simplified reporting for an income year, the financial st atements must:  Be prepared applying the principles of accrual accounting.  Include a statement of accounting policies  Disclose comparable figures for the previous income year to the extent that the t rustee has that information.  Disclose several specific items: o a reconciliation between the profit or loss in the statement of profit or loss to t axable income; o an appropriately detailed schedule of the trust’s fixed assets and depreciable p roperty used for tax purposes; o matters relating to trusts with forestry and livestock businesses:  information about the cost of timber as at the end of the income year and a reconciliation of movements in the cost of timber during the income year;  i f the trust is a specified livestock owner, details of livestock valuation methods, valuations, and calculations for tax purposes. o Disclose details of transactions between the trust and any associated person of the trustee, unless the transaction is minor and incidental to the activities of the trust.  T ransaction details include the names of the associated persons, the nature of the association, the nature of the transactions and the amounts involved.  D isclosure is not required if the transaction is at a market rate.  I f associated person disclosures have been made separately in any forms prescribed by the Commissioner, this information does not need to be duplicated in the financial statements. 11 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 11:05:11

This report seeks your agreement to make an Order in Council to extend a COVID- 19 scheme that allows Inland Revenue to remit use of money interest (UOMI). 2. If you agree to an extension of the scheme, then officials also seek your agreement to a remedial legislative amendment that will enable the scheme to be extended only for taxpayers in existing instalment arrangements who are currently receiving UOMI suppression. Background 3. On 25 March 2020, the Government implemented a scheme that allows f or UOMI to be remitted for taxpayers that are facing difficulties in paying their tax in full and on time due to COVID-19. This meant that taxpayers could apply to have Inland Revenue write off the interest on their late tax payments once that core tax was paid. 4. As part of this relief measure, Inland Revenue implemented an option to allow UOMI to be suppressed for taxpayers in instalment arrangements. Suppression of interest means that interest is being charged but at a special rate of zero percent (as opposed to being charged at the UOMI underpayment rate, which is currently seven percent). Once a taxpayer’s arrangement is complete, their amount of suppressed interest is then remitted. The suppression option was implemented to simplify the administrative impact of the scheme and provide a better customer experience. 5. If a taxpayer does not comply with the terms of their instalment arrangement, UOMI is charged back to the date that the original tax was overdue at. 6. The scheme is due to expire two years after the scheme began, so the last day for remission is 24 March 2022. However, an Order in Council can be made to extend the scheme if desired. Problem definition 7. When the scheme was developed, officials did not contemplate that UOMI suppression would be made available. This creates a distinction between taxpayers who have paid all their tax and ha ve had their UOMI remitted (written off) versus taxpayers who have not yet paid all their tax and are having their UOMI suppressed (charged at zero percent). 8. Officials have concluded that the legislation only permits an extension by Order in Council of the scheme as a whole. It does not allow an extension only for those taxpayers currently in instalment arrangements that are having UOMI suppressed. IR2021/249: Extending use of money interest relief during COVID-19 Page 1 of 10 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 9. Making an Order in Council to give effect to an extension requires the Minister of Revenue to be satisfied that taxpayers’ ability to pay their tax on time is likely to continue to be significantly adversely affected by COVID-19 beyond the current expiry date of 24 March 2022. As time passes, the links between COVID-19 and any associated financial hardships become weaker, barring any further pandemic events or restrictions. Options 10. The status quo is to not extend the scheme for anyone (Option 1). If you wish for the scheme to end at its current expiry date of 24 March 2022, then taxpayers in existing instalment arrangements who are having UOMI suppressed will start being charged interest at 25 March 2022 on the balance going forward as well as having their suppressed interest recalculated back to the point at which the tax became overdue. This will be unfair on taxpayers who have acted in good faith to manage their payments of outstanding amounts within the incentive of UOMI remission. Officials do not recommend this option. 11. Instead, you may wish to extend the scheme for all taxpayers (Option 2A). Under this option, no legislative amendment will be required, and an Order in Council can be made to give effect to extending the scheme generally. Officials consider that this sort of general extension is not currently warranted given the positive economic outlook. 12. However, if you wish to extend the scheme only for taxpayers in existing instalment arrangements who are having UOMI suppressed (Option 2B), a remedial legislative amendment will be required, and an Order in Council can then be made accordingly. Recommendation 13. Officials recommend Option 2B, which is to extend the scheme by making an Order in Council, but only for taxpayers that will be in existing instalment arrangements with interest supressed when the scheme expires on 24 March 2022. This will ensure that these people are not hit by an interest spike at expiry. We recommend that the scheme be extended until 31 March 2024. 14. The 2021 baseline forecasts should be adjusted to account for revenue gained when interest is backdated under the status quo. This will have a positive impact of $3.7 million. The proposed extension will then remit UOMI for taxpayers that would otherwise have not received remission, with a cost of $2.9 million. The net impact of the proposal relative to 2021 Budget baseline forecasts is therefore $0.7 million. Consultation 15. The Treasury was consulted on this report. Next steps 16. If you agree to extending the scheme, officials will issue drafting instructions to the Parliamentary Counsel Office so that the Order in Council can be drafted. 17. If you also agree to a legislative amendment that specifies this extension can be made only for people in existing instalment arrangements, then officials will progress this change within the upcoming omnibus tax Bill scheduled for introduction in August 2021.

The purpose of this report is to seek your agreement to extend the scheme that allows Inland Revenue to remit use of money interest (UOMI) for taxpayers that have been significantly adversely affected by COVID-19. 27. If you agree to an extension of the scheme, then officials also seek your agreement to a remedial legislative amendment that will enable the scheme to be extended only for taxpayers in existing instalment arrangements who are currently receiving UOMI suppression. Context 28. The purpose of UOMI is to compensate the government for the loss of use of money from taxpayers underpaying their tax. It applies to all tax types administered by Inland Revenue as well as Working for Families debt. The UOMI rates track against market indices published by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. The UOMI rate charged on underpayments of tax is currently seven percent. 29. As part of the Government’s response to the economic impacts of COVID-19, a legislative amendment was made to allow Inland Revenue to write off UOMI for taxpayers that were significantly adversely affected by COVID-19 in their ability to pay tax. This is applicable to interest that has accrued after 14 February 2020 and was made available to taxpayers from 25 March 2020. To be eligible for UOMI remission, a taxpayer must have asked for the remission as soon as practicable and made the payment of tax as soon as practicable. 30. This became a useful measure to allow taxpayers affected by COVID-19 to manage their tax debt. Comments from tax practitioners have noted that the imposition of UOMI on late/unpaid tax during COVID-19 would have compounded hardship for taxpayers, and so UOMI remission was a welcome development. 31. It was initially intended that this remission was made available to those taxpayers that had paid their tax owing but had accrued UOMI due to late payment. However, to assist other taxpayers who were struggling to pay their tax in full, another option was implemented whereby taxpayers who had not yet paid all their tax could enter into an instalment arrangement with Inland Revenue and have their interest suppressed at zero percent. Interest is still calculated in the background during the arrangement, but it is remitted at the end of the arrangement if the taxpayer was compliant with its terms. 32. The practical difference between UOMI remission and UOMI suppression is that suppressed interest can be reversed if necessary. For example, a taxpayer may currently be in an arrangement where their interest is suppressed, but if they fail to meet their obligations under the arrangement, that suppressed interest can be recalculated at the UOMI underpayment rate such that they no longer get any UOMI relief. In contrast, remitting interest under this scheme is only available once the tax owing has been fully paid so the compliance issue does not arise for remission as it does for suppression. 33. As of 8 June 2021, the UOMI figures under the scheme are as follows: 33.1 $14.4 million of interest has been remitted for 86,409 taxpayers (who have paid all their tax), and 33.2 $58.7 million of interest has been suppressed for 21,727 taxpayers (who are in instalment arrangements to pay down the remainder of their tax owing). IR2021/249: Extending use of money interest relief during COVID-19 Page 5 of 10 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 34. Suppression has the benefit of being administratively simple and customer friendly, as taxpayers do not see the interest accruing while they are meeting their obligations. Problem definition 35. The ability for Inland Revenue to remit UOMI expires on 24 March 2022. Extending this scheme would be done for the purposes of continuing to provide UOMI relief to taxpayers who are significantly adversely affected in their ability to pay their tax because of COVID-19. It is a requirement in the legislation that an extension can only be made if the Minister of Revenue believes that taxpayers’ obligations will continue to be affected by COVID-19. As time passes, the links between the pandemic and any associated financial hardships become weaker, barring any further pandemic events or restrictions. 36. The other issue to consider is whether recipients of UOMI remission or UOMI suppression are equally deserving of an extension, or should one group be prioritised over the other. When the scheme was developed, officials did not contemplate that UOMI suppression would be made available. This creates a distinction between taxpayers who have paid all their tax and have had their UOMI remitted (written off) versus taxpayers who have not yet paid all their tax and are having their UOMI suppressed (charged at zero percent). 37. Officials have concluded that the legislation only permits an extension by Order in Council of the scheme as a whole. It does not allow an extension only for those taxpayers currently in instalment arrangements that are having UOMI suppressed. If you would like to extend the scheme solely to allow those in existing instalment arrangements to finish their arrangements without having interest charged, then a remedial legislative amendment would be required. If an extension is not granted for those taxpayers, UOMI will be charged back to the original due date for payment once the remission power expires. Options 38. Officials have considered the options in two steps: 38.1 Whether the scheme should be extended at all (Option 1 versus Option 2), and 38.2 If the scheme is extended, whether it should be extended for everyone (Option 2A versus Option 2B). 39. Option 1 is the status quo, which is to not extend the scheme. This means that Inland Revenue’s ability to remit UOMI will expire on 24 March 2022. 40. Option 2 is to extend the scheme and has two versions. Note that taking either of these options to extend the scheme requires that the Minister of Revenue is satisfied that the ability of taxpayers to pay tax on time is likely to continue to be significantly adversely affected by COVID-19 beyond the current expiry date. 41. Option 2A is to extend the scheme for all taxpayers. 42. Option 2B is to extend the scheme only for taxpayers in existing instalment arrangements who are having UOMI suppressed. Option 1: Do not extend the scheme 43. This option is the status quo. It does not require a legislative amendment and will result in the scheme expiring on 24 March 2022. IR2021/249: Extending use of money interest relief during COVID-19 Page 6 of 10 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 44. Taxpayers who have had UOMI remitted before expiry have already received the benefit of the scheme. 45. Taxpayers who are in instalment arrangements with interest suppressed at the time of expiry will see UOMI charged on the overdue tax. This balance will increase from zero to an amount recalculated using the prevailing UOMI underpayment rate. 46. Note that this will be backdated to the point at which the tax payment was initially due, rather than being prospective from expiry of the scheme. This means that, although the taxpayer was not obliged to pay interest for the duration of the arrangement until the scheme’s expiry, they will now be liable for the UOMI that would have been charged if not for the UOMI relief. This means that they will have received no benefit from the scheme apart from deferring an amount of UOMI. This was not an intended outcome of the scheme, as officials considered that those eligible for UOMI relief during the period of the scheme should not have that relief reversed once the scheme ends. 47. We do not recommend this option as we consider the backdating of the interest charge to be excessively punitive. This is because taxpayers have, in good faith, entered into instalment arrangements with the expectation that UOMI would be remitted if they comply with the terms of that arrangement. Option 2A: Extend the scheme for all taxpayers 48. The first option for extending the scheme is a general extension for all taxpayers. This requires an Order in Council to be passed but does not require a legislative amendment. Under this option, we recommend extending the scheme for a duration of two years until 31 March 2024. 49. This is the most generous option to taxpayers of those proposed in this report. It will allow taxpayers to have interest remitted on tax accrued on and after 25 March 2022. It will also allow people in existing instalment arrangements to have their interest suppressed beyond the expiry date, and will allow anyone to set up a new instalment arrangement with suppressed interest after that date. 50. Officials consider that the link between COVID-19 and taxpayers’ ability to pay their tax in full and on time is much weaker now than it was during 2020. We expect that this link will have weakened further by March 2022. We accept that COVID-19 still creates and will continue to create difficulties for some industries in particular, but we do not recommend targeting this measure at specific sectors. Option 2B: Extend the scheme only for taxpayers in existing instalment arrangements 51. The second option for extending the scheme is a targeted extension for the group of taxpayers who are already in instalment arrangements with interest suppressed. Because the existing legislation only allows for a general extension of the scheme, a legislative amendment would be required. This would allow for an Order in Council to be made that specifies a group of people for which the scheme is extended for. 52. As per Option 2A, we recommend extending the scheme for a duration of two years until 31 March 2024. This is long enough to ensure that the majority of taxpayers in instalment arrangements running past the current expiry date are able to complete their arrangement and therefore have their interest fully remitted. We do not consider it appropriate to extend the scheme until all instalment arrangements are finished, which is not until at least 2030. 53. Option 2B allows taxpayers in existing instalment arrangements with suppressed interest to complete their tax payments and ultimately receive the benefit of IR2021/249: Extending use of money interest relief during COVID-19 Page 7 of 10 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] remission. However, it does not allow taxpayers to set up new instalment arrangements or make new applications for remission after the current expiry date. This option is therefore more generous than Option 1 but less generous than Option 2A. 54. This option is less concerned with the question of whether taxpayers are still being significantly adversely affected by COVID-19 compared to Option 2A. The intention of this option is to ensure that those who are receiving a benefit under the scheme are able to lock that benefit in, rather than to continue to provide COVID-19-related relief for everyone. This is consistent with the original policy intent, which means this would be a remedial amendment. This option also eliminates the main disadvantage of Option 1 concerning the backdating of UOMI. Conclusion 55. Officials recommend proceeding with Option 2B to extend UOMI relief only for taxpayers in existing instalment arrangements with interest being suppressed. We believe this strikes a balance between ensuring that those affected by COVID-19 are able to benefit from the scheme (and are not hit with an interest spike at the scheme’s expiry) while also recognising that UOMI relief must be tied to taxpayers being significantly adversely affected by COVID-19. 56. As of 3 June 2021, 12,794 instalment arrangements with $46.6 million of suppressed UOMI are not scheduled to be completed before the current expiry of the scheme. However, 11,733 of those arrangements (92 percent) would be completed within a two-year extension, with current suppressed interest of $44.4 million. The actual number completed will depend on how compliant taxpayers are with the terms of their arrangements. 57. Note that these figures are snapshots and do not capture any instalment arrangements with UOMI suppression set up between 3 June 2021 and 24 March 2022. Financial implications 58. When the UOMI remission scheme was originally developed, no fiscal impact was estimated. This was because the baselines at the time did not contemplate COVID- 19 and its implications for making it difficult for taxpayers to pay their tax in full and on time. Consequently, extra UOMI was predicted to become payable that had not previously been anticipated, and so writing that UOMI off simply returned revenue to what was originally expected. 59. Over a year has passed since the scheme was set up and Inland Revenue now has data on figures concerning remission and suppression under the scheme. However, the Budget 2021 baseline forecasts do not include any positive revenue impact arising from UOMI being recalculated and payable at the end of the scheme. 60. A fiscal impact can be calculated for the cost of extending the scheme for taxpayers in existing instalment arrangements, since Inland Revenue holds information about the arrangements that exist. This is made up of two changes: 60.1 The first change to existing baselines arising from the fact that UOMI remission has been allowed but will end on 24 March 2022, resulting in some taxpayers having UOMI backdated (status quo); and 60.2 The second change to those adjusted baselines arising from the current recommendation to extend the scheme for taxpayers in existing instalment arrangements. IR2021/249: Extending use of money interest relief during COVID-19 Page 8 of 10 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 61. The first change recognises that a number of taxpayers have arrangements running past the current expiry date and, without an extension, will lose the benefit of their UOMI being suppressed as the interest will be recalculated back to when the tax became due. This will result in a forecasting adjustment upward in the 2021/22 year of $3.7 million. If you do not agree to an extension, this adjustment will still be required. $m – increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 & outyears Tax Revenue: Interest 0 18.4 0 0 0 Expense: Impairment of debt and bad debt write-offs 0 14.7 0 0 0 Total Operating 0 (3.7) 0 0 0 62. The second change then recognises that a two-year extension for taxpayers in existing instalment arrangements will allow those taxpayers with an arrangement falling between 25 March 2022 and 31 March 2024 to receive remission of UOMI at the end of their arrangements, when they otherwise would have had interest recalculated and backdated to when tax became overdue if not for the extension. This has a fiscal cost of $2.9 million. $m – increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 & outyears Tax Revenue: Interest 0 (14.7) 0 0 0 Expense: Impairment of debt and bad debt write-offs 0 (11.8) 0 0 0 Total Operating 0 2.9 0 0 0 63. The net impact of these adjustments relative to Budget 2021 baselines is therefore $0.7 million in the 2021/22 year. 64. This costing relies on a number of assumptions, including: 64.1 UOMI suppressed a year from now will be close to double the current amounts; 64.2 If there is no extension, people with arrangements ending soon after the current expiry date are more likely to take actions to finish their arrangement early to receive the benefit of remission compared to taxpayers whose arrangements end later; and 64.3 UOMI figures are impaired at 80 percent. 65. If you wish to extend the scheme for everyone (Option 2A), there will be a cost to the Government that officials have been unable to quantify. This is because Inland Revenue does not hold information on the number of taxpayers who may enter into future instalment arrangements or make a new application for remission after the current expiry date. IR2021/249: Extending use of money interest relief during COVID-19 Page 9 of 10 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 66. Based on current uptake of the scheme and extrapolation , there could be an upper bound on the cost of this option of $22 million. This assumes that all suppressed interest is eventually remitted, and that uptake of the scheme over the extension period is the same as uptake over the original period. Both of these assumptions are conservative and highly unlikely to be true. Administrative implications 67. Implementing the recommendation outlined in this report is straightforward and will require communication to taxpayers and tax agents, as well as education for Inland Revenue staff. There are no systems changes required and existing processes will continue. Any implementation costs that arise can be met through baseline funding. Consultation 68. The Treasury was consulted on this report. Next steps 69. Subject to your approval of an extension, we will issue drafting instructions to the Parliamentary Counsel Office to draft the required Order in Council. 70. If you agree to the extension only applying to taxpayers in existing instalment arrangements, then a remedial legislative change will need to be made prior to the drafting of the Order in Council. We will include this in the drafting of the upcoming omnibus taxation Bill scheduled for introduction in August 2021. IR2021/249: Extending use of money interest relief during COVID-19 Page 10 of 10

This report seeks your agreement to remedial amendments to the safe harbour concession for provisional taxpayers and to use of money interest relief for COVID- 19 and emergency events. Proposed amendments Safe harbour concession 2. The safe harbour concession for provisional tax is available to standard method provisional taxpayers whose residual income tax (RIT) is less than $60,000, provided they meet the requirements in the Tax Administration Act 1994. To qualify as a safe-harbour taxpayer the person must have paid their provisional tax instalments in full and on time. 3. Qualifying as a safe harbour taxpayer prevents use of money interest (UOMI) being charged for underpaid provisional tax during the income year. A safe harbour taxpayer will only be charged UOMI after the terminal tax due date. 1 4. In 2017, when incremental late payment penalties were removed from the late payment of income tax (including provisional tax), an amendment was made to the safe harbour concession to require all payments to be paid in full and on time. At the time the change was made the number of taxpayers who pay one or two days late unintentionally was underestimated . Since the change a large number of taxpayers have been caught out by this issue resulting in incurring UOMI, in addition to late payment penalties. I n these circumstances the application of UOMI and late payment penalties is not considered to be proportionate to the offence committed. 5. Recently, a change was made to the ‘payment in full’ requirement to enable flexibility for taxpayers who underpay their provisional tax within $20. This accounted for those who underpaid their tax bill by a small amount. Removing the requirement for taxpayers to pay ‘on time’ is consistent with this approach, removing the arbitrariness of this requirement. 6. We consider it appropriate to allow taxpayers to retain the safe harbour concession even if they miss a payment, as late payment penalties 2 should be a sufficient penalty to incentivise taxpayers to continue to make their payments on time. 7. This initiative is taxpayer friendly because it removes disproportionate amounts charged as UOMI for minor mistakes of small provisional taxpayers. This change will support small provisional taxpayers who may not be as familiar with their tax obligations, by encouraging them to pay on time without disproportionately penalising them. Instead, late payment penalties will remain operational and be sufficient to encourage taxpayers to pay on time. 1 The terminal tax date is generally 7 February (or 7 April if the person has a tax agent) the year following the income year. 2 Late payment penalties are imposed at 1% of the amount due the day after the due date and 4% 7 days later. IR2021/428: Amendments to provisional tax and use of money interest remission Page 1 of 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Extending use of money interest relief during COVID-19 8. One of the tax system responses to COVID-19 was to enable Inland Revenue to remit UOMI for taxpayers that were significantly adversely affected by COVID-19 and were unable to pay their tax in full and on time. This power was originally due to expire on 24 March 2022. 9. In June 2021, joint Ministers agreed to extend the UOMI remission scheme for taxpayers in existing instalment arrangements until 31 March 2024 (IR2021/249 refers). This specific group is of concern because, under current settings, those taxpayers whose existing instalment arrangements have not finished when the scheme expires will have their interest charged back to when the original tax became due rather than from when the scheme expires. Officials considered this to be unfair for taxpayers that acted in good faith to arrange to repay their tax and receive the benefit of UOMI remission. 10. At the time those original recommendations were made, officials indicated that a general extension of the scheme for everyone was not warranted due to the positive economic outlook. However, officials now consider that the previously agreed changes should be expanded because of the extended Alert Level restrictions in effect from August 2021 and the effect of those restrictions on smaller businesses in particular. 11. In addition to the previously agreed recommendations, officials consider that UOMI relief should be extended to a wider group of taxpayers due to the uncertainty that smaller taxpayers will encounter in forecasting their income tax liability for the 2021-22 income year. 12. We consider that general UOMI remission of income tax should be allowed for smaller provisional taxpayers that qualify for UOMI remission specifically due to being unable to accurately forecast their RIT because of COVID-19. 13. Under the existing provisions for this specific group, eligibility is restricted to provisional taxpayers with RIT of less than $1 million. We propose retaining this requirement when assessing the eligibility of taxpayers of this group for general UOMI relief. We propose that provisional taxpayers qualifying from this group for general remission should be able to seek relief until 7 April 2023 (the terminal tax date for the 2021–22 income year). 14. In summary, the COVID-19 interest remission rules would be as follows in Table 1: IR2021/428: Amendments to provisional tax and use of money interest remission Page 2 of 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Table 1: Summary of UOMI relief available due to COVID-19 Taxpayer Tax type Expiry for remission under the status quo Expiry for remission if current recommendations agreed to Taxpayers in instalment All tax types – Instalment Not affected by arrangements entered into deferred payment arrangement must current prior to 24 March 2022 due to COVID-19 issues be completed by 31 March 2024 (agreed in June 2021; IR2021/249 refers) recommendations Taxpayers who: • have RIT liability less than $1 million; and • COVID-19 has affected their ability to reasonably accurately forecast their RIT liability Income tax (including provisional tax) – late payment and underpayment due to COVID-19 issues 24 March 2022 (original legislation) 7 April 2023 (including payments for the 2021–22 income year) All other taxpayers All tax types – late payment due to COVID-19 issues 24 March 2022 (original legislation) Not affected by current recommendations 15. As per current legislation, this new recommendation does not limit the Minister of Revenue’s ability to recommend another extension of the scheme, either generally or for a specific group of people. Officials also expect that further consideration will need to be given to the group of taxpayers with instalment arrangements for income tax entered into after 24 March 2022 but extending past the 7 April 2023 expiry date. Broadening the use of money interest relief available during emergency events 16. The previous amendment describes the ability for UOMI to be remitted when a provisional taxpayer is significantly adversely affected in their ability to reasonably accurately forecast their RIT due to COVID-19. No equivalent provision is currently available in response to an emergency event, such as a flood or an earthquake. Technically, only interest incurred as a result of late payment due to the emergency event can be remitted. 17. Officials therefore recommend a change to the emergency events UOMI remission rules to ensure that UOMI can be remitted if it is charged as a result of a taxpayer being unable to reasonably accurately forecast their income tax due to an emergency event. This will further ensure that the same UOMI provisions available for COVID-19 reasons are also available during emergency events. 18. However, some settings should be changed compared to the relief available for COVID-19. Specifically, officials recommend that: 18.1 Relief in this situation is not limited to certain income years like the COVID- 19 provisions are, so that UOMI remission is fully available for any future emergency event; and IR2021/428: Amendments to provisional tax and use of money interest remission Page 3 of 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 18.2 A taxpayer with any amount of RIT can be eligible for UOMI relief of this sort, subject to meeting the other existing criteria (in the COVID-19 provisions, only taxpayers with RIT of $1 million or less can be eligible for this relief). Changing the eligibility test for use of money interest relief for emergency events 19. UOMI remission as a response to COVID-19 was largely modelled off UOMI remission available for emergency events. Separate provisions for COVID-19 UOMI remission were required as officials considered that the emergency events UOMI remission rules were not sufficient to be able to provide relief during COVID-19. 20. One of the main reasons for this is that UOMI remission is only available during an emergency event if the event “physically prevents the taxpayer from making a payment required by a tax law”. This would not deal with situations where a business was financially unable to make a tax payment due to being closed during COVID-19. As a result, eligibility for COVID-19 UOMI remission depends on whether “the taxpayer’s ability to make a payment required by a tax law... is significantly adversely affected by COVID-19”. This allows UOMI remission for a range of reasons during COVID-19, including being physically prevented from paying tax as well as financial hardship. 21. Officials now consider that the same test should be used for emergency events. We therefore recommend that taxpayers should be eligible for emergency events UOMI remission if they are significantly adversely affected by an emergency event as well as meeting the other existing criteria. Fiscal impacts Safe harbour concession 22. The fiscal impact of removing the requirement to pay in full, from the safe harbour concession is approximately -$ 2.7 million per year over the forecast period. This is represented by the gross interest charge of -$ 13.7 million per year and the corresponding saving in no longer having to impair this UOMI amount of $11 million per year leaving a net cost of -$2.7 million per year. 23. The fiscal impact is likely to depend upon taxpayer behaviour. There is sufficient space on the Tax Policy Scorecard to absorb this cost. 24. The Tax Policy Scorecard has historically been used only to manage the revenue impact of tax policy changes. By contrast, the Scorecard has not been used to manage the fiscal impacts of changes to appropriations. However, officials recommend that the positive impact on the impairment appropriation \[Impairment of Debt and Write-Offs\] in this instance should be managed through the Scorecard, as it is a direct consequence of the policy change. This is consistent with the Scorecard’s purpose, which is to enable tax policy changes to be managed outside the allowance framework. Extending use of money interest relief during COVID-19 25. The fiscal impact of extending COVID-19 UOMI relief to the additional group of provisional taxpayers (with RIT of less than $1 million) has a gross interest charge of -$700,000 that is impaired by $550,000, leaving a net fiscal cost of approximately -$150,000. 26. This fiscal impact is based on remission of income tax interest charges for small taxpayers relating to the 2021–22 year and assumes that any new arrangements are set up to finish by 7 April 2023 so they get the benefit of the proposed remission. IR2021/428: Amendments to provisional tax and use of money interest remission Page 4 of 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] The fiscal costing is further based on assumption of reduced demand for COVID-19 UOMI relief due to reduced likelihood over time of lockdowns impeding trading. 27. The Treasury has advised that this amendment meets the Minister of Finance’s criteria for charging the cost against the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund. Use of money interest relief for emergency events 28. For emergency events, the amendments relating to both broadening UOMI relief available to help provisional taxpayers and changing the eligibility test for UOMI relief have a nil fiscal impact. They will both increase the relief provided during each emergency event, which will lead to a negative but unquantifiable effect on revenue. However, any such amount is offset against the positive UOMI amounts resulting from the emergency event causing taxpayers to be unable to pay their tax, none of which is in baseline forecasts. Legislative implications 29. Legislative provisions relating to the extension of UOMI relief during COVID-19 have already been included in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2021–22, GST, and Remedial Matters) Bill, which is currently being considered by the Finance and Expenditure Committee. The revised recommendations in this report will not affect what has already been included in the Bill. 3 30. If you agree to the expanded COVID-19 UOMI remission recommendations, some of these will be reflected in the Order in Council extending the scheme to be made in March 2022. You have previously approved officials to issue drafting instructions to the Parliamentary Counsel Office to make this Order for the original extension (IR2021/249 refers). Some of the changes in this report, if agreed to, will be contained in the drafting instructions for the Parliamentary Counsel Office. 31. The remaining amendments in this report (the change to the safe harbour concession, part of the changes for COVID-19 UOMI relief for provisional taxpayers, and both the emergency events UOMI remission changes) can be included in the same Bill by way of inclusion in the officials’ report, which will be presented to the Finance and Expenditure Committee’s in early 2022. 32. As the proposals are all taxpayer friendly, we do not anticipate any issues with including these amendments in the Bill at this stage of the legislative process. Consultation 33. The Treasury has been consulted on this report. Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand have been consulted on the proposed amendments and is supportive of the changes. Next steps 34. As these are remedial amendments to legislation, your approval of the changes is sufficient for them to be progressed without requiring consideration by Cabinet. 35. Subject to your agreement to the amendments, officials will issue drafting instructions to prepare legislation giving effect to these changes. This will be considered by the Finance and Expenditure Committee prior to the Bill being reported back to the House. 3 The current provisions in the Bill will allow any future extension of the scheme to be targeted at a specific group of people; currently, the scheme can only be extended for everyone.

This report seeks joint Ministers’ agreement to a general extension of use of money interest (UOMI) relief in response to the ongoing economic impacts of COVID-19. 2. A general extension for all taxpayers expands on the targeted extensions that joint Ministers have previously agreed to. This report also notes the additional fiscal impacts of a broader extension. Background 3. One of the tax system responses to COVID-19 was to enable Inland Revenue to remit UOMI for taxpayers that are significantly adversely affected by COVID-19 and so are unable to pay their tax in full and on time. This power was originally due to expire on 24 March 2022. 4. In June 2021, and then again in November 2021, joint Ministers agreed to a series of targeted extensions of UOMI relief. These were for: 4.1 Taxpayers in existing instalment arrangements as at 24 March 2022, extended to 31 March 2024 (IR2021/249 refers); and 4.2 Provisional taxpayers with less than $1 million in residual income tax, extended to 7 April 2023 (IR2021/428 refers). 5. These targeted extensions served several purposes, such as to ensure that taxpayers that are compliant with their instalment arrangements are not subject to backdated UOMI, and to deliver targeted assistance at a specific group of taxpayers in response to the impacts on businesses resulting from the Delta outbreak. 6. However, given the ongoing concerns regarding the impacts of Omicron, officials consider that a more general extension of UOMI remission is now warranted. General extension of UOMI remission 7. The ability for Inland Revenue to remit UOMI for taxpayers affected by COVID-19 expires on 24 March 2022, but this date can be extended by an Order in Council made on the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue. Joint ministers have previously agreed to the making of an Order in Council to give effect to the targeted extensions described above. 8. Officials now recommend that the Order in Council is made to instead extend the scheme generally for all taxpayers. The new expiry date for UOMI remission would be 7 April 2024. 9. This would allow for continuation of UOMI remission once the applying taxpayer has paid the core tax on which the UOMI has been charged. The extension would also allow for continuation of UOMI suppression, where a taxpayer enters into an instalment arrangement and does not have to pay UOMI so long as the arrangement is complied with. IR2022/026: General extension of use of money interest relief during COVID-19 Page 1 of 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 10. Table 1 summarises the taxpayers affected by a general extension of UOMI relief in comparison to the targeted extensions previously agreed to: Table 1: Taxpayers affected by a general extension of COVID-19 UOMI relief Taxpayer Tax type Expiry date as previously agreed to Expiry date under a general extension (current recommendation) Taxpayers in instalment All tax types; Instalment 7 April 2024 arrangements entered into on deferred arrangement must be or before 24 March 2022 payment due to COVID-19 completed by 31 March 2024 (IR2021/249 refers) Taxpayers who: • Have a 2022 residual income tax liability of less than $1 million; and • COVID-19 has affected their ability to forecast their residual income tax liability Income tax; late payment and underpayment due to COVID- 19 7 April 2023, including payments for the 2021–22 income year (IR2021/428 refers) 7 April 2024 All other taxpayers All tax types; late/deferred payment due to COVID-19 24 March 2022 (no extension previously agreed to) 7 April 2024 11. Officials expect that the impacts of Omicron will result in reduced trading for a wide range of businesses. This will be for several reasons, including changes in the way some businesses operate under the COVID-19 Protection Framework, as well as an expected increase in employees taking sick leave due to the spread of Omicron. Ensuring that affected taxpayers are not charged with UOMI (when they otherwise would have paid their tax in full and on time) has been a proportionate targeted tax response to COVID-19 to date, and it should continue to be available in response to the impacts of Omicron. 12. A general extension of COVID-19 UOMI remission will also be significantly easier for Inland Revenue to administer, and for taxpayers to understand, than the targeted extensions previously agreed to. Financial implications 13. A general extension of COVID-19 UOMI relief until 7 April 2024 is estimated to have a gross interest charge of $5.82 million, which is impaired by $4.58 million. This results in a net fiscal cost of approximately $1.24 million over the forecast period. 14. However, the targeted extensions that were previously agreed to have a comparable net fiscal cost of $150,000. The changes to appropriations resulting from this fiscal impact have been agreed to but ha ve not yet been included in baselines. The general extension recommended in this report therefore has an additional cost of $1.09 million beyond the targeted extensions previously agreed to, since the new cost of $1.24 million replaces the previous cost of $150,000. 15. This fiscal impact assumes that any new instalment arrangements set up from now are scheduled to finish by 7 April 2024 so that they get the benefit of UOMI remission. It also assumes reduced demand for UOMI relief due to a reduction in the likelihood of measures like lockdowns further impeding trading. The economic IR2022/026: General extension of use of money interest relief during COVID-19 Page 2 of 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] effects of Omicron are also highly uncertain, which may affect the cost of this extension. 16. The Treasury has advised that, given the Omicron outbreak, there is a case for charging this cost to the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund (CRRF) as outlined below. Consultation 17. The Treasury has been consulted on this report and has provided the following comments. 18. In September 2021, the Treasury did not support funding to extend the power to suppress and remit UOMI for new instalment arrangements to 2024. This was because the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic appeared to be abating (especially as vaccination rates were improving and there was therefore less prospect of major disruptive outbreaks and the associated economic cost). The Minister of Finance had also made clear his view that the balance of the CRRF should be used only for “core economic response measures,” as well as other targeted, urgent, or essential costs. In the Treasury’s view, extending UOMI relief did not meet these criteria at that time. 19. Today, the criteria remain in force, but the situation has changed; given the likelihood of an Omicron outbreak and the economic harms that would result from it, the Treasury supports reconsidering the decision on UOMI relief. Extending UOMI relief is a cost-effective way to support affected taxpayers, especially smaller taxpayers. It would also usefully fill a gap in the range of support currently being considered, in that it encourages personalised instalment arrangements where these are appropriate. In short, there is now a stronger case for providing additional relief, funded through the CRRF. Next steps 20. Subject to your agreement to the general extension as recommended, officials will issue a drafting instruction to the Parliamentary Counsel Office to draft an Order in Council that gives effect to this extension. 21. Officials will report to the Minister of Revenue with a draft Cabinet paper an d a copy of the draft Order in Council to be considered at the Cabinet Legislation Committee on 10 March 2022. This will allow for consideration by Cabinet on 14 March 2022 and submission to Executive Council on the same day. 22. Assuming a waiver of the 28-day rule for Orders in Council to come into force, the general extension will be given effect before the current expiry date of 24 March 2022.

This report seeks your agreement to extend the current time limit on sharing information with other agencies for COVID-19 related activities to when the open- ended time limit comes into place. 2. This report also seeks your authority for Inland Revenue to provide drafting instructions to the Parliamentary Counsel Office to draft an Order in Council to extend the current information-sharing time limit on COVID-19 related activities to the 31 March 2022. Background 3. In March 2020, the COVID-19 Response (Taxation and Social Assistance Urgent Measures) Act 2020 introduced several urgent powers to enable government agencies to respond to the COVID-19 crisis. 4. These powers were related to the delivery of several key projects designed to support New Zealanders through the economic uncertainty that the pandemic introduced. Inland Revenue administered several of these initiatives as well as supporting other agencies in the delivery of their own projects. For this work to be possible, Inland Revenue needed to share information with other agencies. 5. Tax legislation requires Inland Revenue staff to keep taxpayer information confidential unless a specific legislative exception authorises the disclosure. There are several existing exceptions in tax legislation enabling Inland Revenue to share information with other agencies. 1 6. Inland Revenue did not have any existing information sharing arrangements, or found the existing arrangements were not flexible enough, to allow the required COVID-19 response sharing to occur with several relevant agencies. Consequently, an emergency provision was introduced to the Tax Administration Act 1994 that enabled Inland Revenue to share information with other agencies for the delivery of COVID-19 specific initiatives. 2 7. The information sharing provision includes a time limit, meaning it ceases to be in effect once 24 months have passed from the date of the clause commencing. The provision is currently due to expire on 17 March 2022. This time limit can be extended by Order in Council which must be made before the expiry of the 24- month period and requires the recommendation of the Minster of Revenue. This allows the Government to continue sharing information, if required, in response to COVID-19 after the initial two-year period. 8. The current information-sharing time limit is due to be removed on 31 March 2022 (IR2021/220 refers). An extension of the current time limit is required to ensure the sharing of information with other agencies for COVID-19 related activities can 1 Other agencies do not have equivalent requirements around secrecy, they share information with Inland Revenue under the Privacy Act 1993. 2 Schedule 7, clause 23B.

\[IN CONFIDENCE\] 6. In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee COVID-19: EXTENSION OF TAX MEASURES Proposal 1. This paper seeks the Cabinet Legislation Committee’s agreement to submit two Orders in Council to the Executive Council. 2. The Orders in Council relate to extensions of tax measures developed in response to COVID-19. These include: 2.1 Extending the ability for Inland Revenue to remit use of money interest for taxpayers that are significantly adversely affected by COVID-19; and 2.2 Extending the current time limit on Inland Revenue’s ability to share information with other government agencies for COVID-19 related activities. Relation to Government Priorities 3. Extending these tax measures is a continuation of the Government’s response to the impacts of COVID-19. As stated in the Labour 2020 Election Manifesto, a strong COVID-19 recovery plan is the Government’s top priority for all New Zealanders. 4. The Tax Policy Work Programme also features the COVID-19 response as one of its policy areas of focus. This includes ensuring Inland Revenue can work with other agencies to activate and adjust COVID-19 response measures as required. Executive Summary 5. Inland Revenue has been able to better respond to COVID-19 by using tax measures introduced by the Government in March 2020. Two of these include remitting use of money interest for taxpayers struggling to pay their tax because of COVID-19, and allowing the disclosure of information about a person or entity to a government agency regarding COVID-19 related activities. However, both of these measures are due to expire in March 2022. 6. To ensure Inland Revenue can continue to effectively respond to COVID-19, especially given the impact of Omicron, I propose that these tax measures be extended. The ability for Inland Revenue to remit interest should be extended until 8 April 2024, while the information sharing powers should be extended to 31 March 2022. 1 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 09:50:16 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 7. To make these extensions, I recommend the making of two Orders in Council. These are the Taxation (Extension of COVID-19 Interest Remission) Order 2022 and the Tax Administration (Extension of Power to Disclose Information Relating to COVID - 19 Response) Order 2022. I seek the agreement of the Cabinet Legislation Committee to submit these Orders in Council to the Executive Council to give effect to these extensions. Background 8. On 16 March 2020, Cabinet agreed to two new tax measures in response to COVID- 19 (CAB-20-MIN-0103 refers). These were introduced in the COVID-19 Response (Taxation and Social Assistance Urgent Measures) Act 2020 that came into force on 25 March 2020. 9. The first concerned Inland Revenue’s ability to remit use of money interest (UOMI) for taxpayers that are significantly adversely affected by COVID-19. Inland Revenue’s existing interest remission powers would not cover cases where businesses were struggling financially to pay their tax in full on time and were consequently charged with UOMI. Specific provisions were introduced to ensure that Inland Revenue could provide UOMI relief for affected taxpayers. 10. The second concerned Inland Revenue’s ability to share information about a person or entity with a government agency for activities in connection with COVID-19. Before the introduction of the specific provisions, Inland Revenue did not have the discretionary power to share information with a government agency about a person or entity which would allow the agency to provide or fulfil any duty or obligation in connection with COVID-19 related activities. 11. Both of these measures were originally due to run for two years, but they can be extended by an Order in Council made on the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue. Extension of tax measures Use of money interest remission 12. Inland Revenue’s framework for tax responses to COVID-19 is that unaffected taxpayers should continue to pay their tax and affected taxpayers should be supported to pay their tax when they are able to. 13. Allowing UOMI remission for taxpayers that are significantly adversely affected by COVID-19 is consistent with these principles. Ensuring that affected taxpayers are not charged with UOMI (when they otherwise would have paid their tax in full and on time) has been a proportionate targeted response to COVID-19 to date, and it should continue to be available in response to the impacts of Omicron. However, the ability to remit UOMI for COVID-19 reasons expires on 24 March 2022. 14. The impact of Omicron will result in reduced trading for a wide range of businesses going forward. This will be for several reasons, including changes in the way some businesses operate under the COVID-19 Protection Framework, as well as an expected increase in employees taking sick leave due to the spread of Omicron. 2 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 09:50:16 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 15. Therefore, I propose that the Cabinet Legislation Committee agrees to submit the Taxation (Extension of COVID-19 Interest Remission) Order 2022 to the Executive Council, which would extend the ability of Inland Revenue to remit UOMI until 8 April 2024. No other changes are required to this measure. COVID-19 information sharing power 16. The discretionary power allowing Inland Revenue to share information about a person or entity with government agencies in connection with COVID-19 related activities ensures these agencies can provide or fulfil certain duties and obligations. 17. There is currently an amendment in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2021–22, GST, and Remedial Matters) Bill that proposes the removal of the time limit of this provision from 31 March 2022. However, the current information sharing power is due to expire on 17 March 2022. It is important that an extension is granted to ensure the information sharing power remains in place until the time limit is removed. 18. Therefore, I propose that the Cabinet Legislation Committee agrees to submit the Tax Administration (Extension of Power to Disclose Information Relating to COVID - 19 Response) Order 2022 to the Executive Council, which would extend the ability of Inland Revenue to share information with government agencies in connection with COVID-19 related activities until 31 March 2022. No other changes are required to this measure. Timing and 28-day rule 19. I propose that the Order in Council giving effect to the extension of UOMI relief be in force from 25 March 2022. I also propose that the Order in Council giving effect to the extension of the COVID-19 information sharing power be in force from 17 March 2022. These commencement dates ensure that there are no periods for which UOMI relief and the power to share information are not available. 20. For both of these Orders in Council to be in force from the proposed dates, they each need to come into force within 28 days of being made. Waivers of the 28-day rule are sought on the basis that bringing the Orders in Council into force within 28 days is necessary to ensure the provisions do not expire. 21. The consequences of not waiving the 28-day rule for the Order in Council extending UOMI relief would be that UOMI cannot be remitted for a period of time. This would also adversely affect taxpayers in instalment arrangements as UOMI would be charged and backdated to the date that tax became due. This creates both compliance costs for taxpayers as well as administrative costs for Inland Revenue. 22. The consequences of not waiving the 28-day rule for the Order in Council extending the information sharing power would be that information about a person or entity in connection with COVID-19 related activities would not be able to be shared with government agencies for the two-week period between the current end date and the proposed implementation date of the open-ended period. Compliance 23. The Orders in Council comply with: 3 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 09:50:16 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 23.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 23.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993; 23.3 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 2020; 23.4 relevant international standards and obligations; 23.5 the Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. 24. The Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that these tax measures may be extended upon the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue if the Orders in Council are made within 24 months of the date that the respective clauses came into force. 25. I consider that both provisions should be extended as they are necessary to enable Inland Revenue to respond quickly to the impacts of Omicron. I consider the statutory requisites have been met. Financial Implications Use of money interest remission 26. The proposal to extend the power to remit UOMI for taxpayers affected by COVID-19 has a net fiscal cost of $1.24 million over the forecast period. This cost comprises: 26.1 A total gross interest charge of $5.82 million shown in the first table below, and 26.2 Total impairment of $4.58 million shown in the second table below: $m – increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue Mi nis ter of Revenue 2021/22 2022/2 3 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 & Outyears Tax Revenue (0.730) (2.910) (2.180) -- Operating Balance and N et C ore Crown Debt Impact 0.730 2.910 2.180 -- $m – increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 & Outyears Impairment of Debt and Debt Write-Offs (0.570) (2.290) (1.720) -- Operating Balance Only Impa ct (0.570) (2.290) (1.720) -- 4 2r4hxlcklw 2022-03-10 09:50:16 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 27. The fiscal impacts assume that any new instalment arrangements set up from now are scheduled to finish by the new expiry date of 8 April 2024 so that they get the benefit of UOMI remission. It also assumes reduced demand for UOMI relief due to a lower likelihood of measures like lockdowns further impeding trading. The economic effects of Omicron are also highly uncertain, which may affect the cost of this extension. 28. Given that this measure is being extended in response to the Omicron outbreak, I propose that this cost be charged to the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund. COVID-19 information sharing power 29. There are no fiscal costs related to the extension of the COVID-19 information sharing power. Legislative Implications 30. The legislative implications of this paper are that two Orders in Councils are to be made. This paper seeks the agreement of the Cabinet Legislation Committee to submit these Orders in Council to the Executive Council. Impact Analysis Regulatory Impact Assessment 31. The Minister of Revenue has approved the drafting of the Orders in Council without needing Cabinet approval because the proposal extends existing policy.

This report brings to your attention the outcome of the regular review of the use of money interest (UOMI) rates and FBT prescribed rate of interest. It seeks a decision on whether to change the UOMI rates now or defer changing the rates because of the current Omicron outbreak. The report also seeks your agreement to increasing the FBT prescribed rate of interest. Context and background 2. The UOMI rates and FBT prescribed rate of interest are reviewed regularly to ensure that they align with market interest rates. The rates are calculated using formulae based on the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) survey of interest rates. 3. The underpayment UOMI rate is currently 7. 00%, based on RBNZ figures from March 2020, while the overpayment UOMI rate is capped so that it cannot go below zero, where it currently is. The current FBT prescribed rate of interest is 4.50%. Principles for updating the rates 4. Longstanding administrative principles in setting the rates provide that: 4.1 Both UOMI rates should be adjusted if: 4.1.1 the RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate or the floating first mortgage new customer housing rate moves by 1% or more; or 4.1.2 one of these indexes moves by 0.2% or more and the UOMI rates have n’t been adjusted in the last 12 months. 4.2 The FBT prescribed rate of interest should be adjusted if the floating first mortgage new customer housing rate moves by 0.2% or more. 5. When regulations are made altering the UOMI rates, the adjustment is applied from the next standard provisional tax payment date. 6. When regulations are made declaring the FBT prescribed rate of interest, they apply to quarters starting at least 1 month following the date the regulations were made. 1 7. Based on RBNZ figures from December 2021, the FBT prescribed rate of interest should be increased to 4.78% and the underpayment UOMI rate to 7. 28%. The overpayment UOMI rate would remain below zero on the basis of the formula and so would not change. 1 Regulations that reduce the prescribed rate may apply to a quarter if made at least one month before the end of that quarter; however, this is not relevant because the proposed change increases the prescribed rate. IR2022/046: UOMI rates and FBT prescribed rate of interest review Page 1 of 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence UOMI rates 8. The underpayment rate is charged on underpaid tax, while the overpayment rate is paid on money paid to Inland Revenue above their tax liability. 9. Although more is charged on underpayments than is paid on overpayments, underpayments are impaired by 78.7% in the Crown accounts to reflect that most UOMI charged is never paid and must be written off. Increasing the underpayment rate thus also increases impairment expenditure. 10. While the timing and amount of rate change recommendations are determined by formula, they require your agreement so you could elect to defer the increase because of the current Omicron outbreak. Increasing the UOMI underpayment rate during the current Omicron outbreak could be viewed as punitive for taxpayers, even if the Government decides to extend UOMI remission. 11. Officials have therefore included two options for you to consider: 11.1 Option 1 is increasing the underpayment UOMI rate by following the standard formula. The overpayment UOMI rate would continue to be 0%. The new rates would take effect from 9 May 2022. 11.2 Option 2 is deferring any change to the UOMI rates for now. I nstead, officials would report to you on reviewing the rates in the middle of the year. Option 1: changing the UOMI rates from 9 May 2022 12. Option 1 will prevent misalignment of the UOMI rates with market rates and maintain continuity of administrative principles. Additionally, most UOMI accrued by taxpayers (78.7%) is impaired, and the Government is considering an extension of COVID-related UOMI remission policies which will increase that amount. The actual impact of raising the underpayment rate on taxpayers may thus be small. 13. Should you proceed with the UOMI rate change, the change to the operating balance for the 2021/22 fiscal year is estimated to be approximately net zero. The 2022/23 and later years are estimated to have a full year net saving of approximately $2 million per annum. 14. These savings comprise a revenue increase of approximately $1 million in 2021/22, $8 million in 2022/23, and $9 million per annum for 2023/24 and later years. As described above, this is partly counteracted by an increase in impairment expenditure of approximately $1 million in 2021/22, and $7 million per annum for 2022/23 and later years. This is shown in the table below: $millions - increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 & outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue 1. 137 8. 480 9.000 9.000 9.000 Non- Departmental Other Expense: Impairment of Debt and Debt Write-offs 0. 895 6. 674 7.0 83 7.0 83 7.0 83 Total Operating (0.242) (1.806) (1.917) (1.917) (1.917) IR2022/046: UOMI rates and FBT prescribed rate of interest review Page 2 of 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence 15. The Treasury advises that a decision to proceed with this option would have no impact on allowances, as it would be considered consistent with existing policy, and hence a forecast change. By contrast, a decision to defer changing the rates would have to be charged against an allowance (likely, the Tax Policy Scorecard). Any increase in the Impairment of Debt and Debt Write-offs appropriation for 2021/22 would also have to be met from Imprest Supply. 16. Separately, however, an extension to UOMI remission policies for businesses impacted by COVID-19 will be considered by Cabinet on 14 March. If Cabinet approves the proposal, it will affect the change to the operating balance as a result of the rate increase. We understand the extension is proposed to go to March 2024. 17. Extending UOMI remission polices will reduce the overall fiscal impact of changing the UOMI underpayment rate, resulting in a lesser increase of revenue and impairment compared to the effect of raising the rate without changes to UOMI remission (as shown in the table in paragraph 14). This reduced effect is shown in the table below: $millions - increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 & outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue 0.584 6.095 6. 819 9.000 9.000 Non- Departmental Other Expense: Impairment of Debt and Debt Write-offs 0.460 4. 797 5.367 7.083 7.083 Total Operating (0.124) (1.298) (1.452) (1.917) (1.917) Option 2: deferring changes to the UOMI rates 18. The primary consideration in favour of option 2 is reducing costs for taxpayers already struggling with the potential impact of the Omicron outbreak. While the additional cost to taxpayers if the rates were increased may not be all that high, it is nevertheless an increase in costs at a time when taxpayers may be struggling. 19. Should you defer the UOMI rate changes, leaving the rate unchanged will have no impact on projected future revenue. However, leaving the rates unchanged represents a departure from an existing policy (which is to change the UOMI rates when certain criteria are met). This will have to be charged against an allowance, which would likely be the Tax Policy Scorecard. 20. Officials estimate the impact on the Scorecard would be approximately the reverse of the changes noted in the table in paragraph 14, as represented in the table below. Note that the real effect might be larger or smaller depending on the movement of interest rates and when the eventual decision is made.

Additionally, if (as expected) interest rates increase in early 2022, the deferral may result in a higher UOMI underpayment rate at the next review than if you choose option 1. A deferral may also result, however, in the UOMI overpayment rate rising above 0%. Officials’ recommendation 22. Officials recommend Option 1. While a deferral may help some taxpayers, the overall effect is likely to be minimal, especially if COVID-related UOMI remission is extended. Moreover, UOMI plays an important role in incentivising compliance and mitigating the fiscal impacts of late payment. Not updating it would undermine these functions. Proceeding with Option 1 would also have no impact on the Scorecard. Officials have consulted with the Treasury, who concur with this recommendation. FBT prescribed rate of interest 23. The FBT prescribed rate of interest applies to loans by employers to employees on which the employer is charging a rate of interest that is below the market rate, and taxes the differential between the rate of interest charged and the prescribed rate. 24. Despite the Omicron outbreak, officials recommend that the FBT prescribed rate of interest be increased to 4.78%. While the UOMI rates affect all taxpayers with tax debit or credit, the FBT prescribed rate of interest affects relatively few. Additionally, the purpose of the prescribed rate is to lower the tax advantage of offering employment-related loans at low interest rates; if the rate were to fall too far out of step with market interest rates, its effectiveness may be reduced. 25. The rate increase would come into force on 1 July 2022, the start of the next available quarter. 26. Raising the FBT prescribed rate of interest is projected to have a net positive fiscal impact of approximately $0.59 million per annum, which amounts to $2.36 million over the current forecast period. This net increase consists of an increase of approximately $0.82 million per annum and a decrease in company tax paid of approximately $0.23 million per annum. This is demonstrated in the table below.

Inland Revenue has consulted with the Treasury, the Parliamentary Counsel Office (PCO), and the New Zealand Customs Service (Customs) on this report. They agree with the recommendations. 28. Customs advise that a change in the underpayment UOMI rate will have some small operational and financial impacts. Customs’ compensatory interest rate is aligned with the UOMI underpayment rate, and an increase in the underpayment rate will correspondingly result in an increase to the compensatory interest rate. 29. This increase will in turn have a very small financial impact on Vote Customs. Customs collected $595,752.09 compensatory interest in the 12 months to December 2021. They advise us that an additional 0.28% increase in the UOMI would collect an additional $1,668 compensatory interest. Next steps 30. Officials have advised PCO that draft Orders in Council changing the rates may need to be prepared depending on your decision. 31. Attached are two papers to the Cabinet Legislation Committee, recommending that it approve the Orders in Council and authorise their submission to Cabinet and the Executive Council. If you decide to increase the UOMI rates and/or the FBT prescribed rate of interest, the papers should be referred to Cabinet Office by 10am, Thursday 24 March 2022. This would enable the Cabinet Legislation Committee to consider the papers on 31 March 2022. 32. The Cabinet paper recommending the increase of the UOMI rates as written assumes that the extension to UOMI remission for businesses impacted by COVID- 19 is approved by Cabinet on 14 March. If this extension is not approved by Cabinet, officials will supply you with an alternative Cabinet paper before 24 March. 33. If you decide to defer changing the UOMI rates, officials will continue to monitor the appropriate RBNZ indices and report to you again in the middle of the year.

1 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee TAXATION (USE OF MONEY INTEREST RATES) AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2022 Proposal 1. This paper seeks the Cabinet Legislation Committee’s agreement to submit an Order in Council amending the Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates) Regulations 1998 to the Executive Council. 2. It is proposed to amend the regulation so the underpayment use of money interest (UOMI) rate is set at 7.28%, while the overpayment UOMI rate remains at 0%. Policy 3. The UOMI rates play an important role in the tax compliance rules. By moving in line with underlying market rates, the UOMI rates provide taxpayers with the incentive to pay the right amount of tax at the right time. The rates apply to all revenue and duties. 4. The Tax Administration Act 1994 provides for the UOMI underpayment and overpayment interest rates to be set by Order in Council. Once the rates are set, they remain the prescribed UOMI rates unless subsequently changed by Order in Council. 5. The methodology for calculating the rates is set out in the Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates Setting Process) Regulations 1997 (the Regulations). The Regulations provide that the interest rate for underpaid tax should be set at the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) floating first mortgage new customer housing rate plus 250 basis points. The floating first mortgage new customer housing rate reflects the variable interest rate offered by surveyed institutions to new borrowers for residential property, weighted by each surveyed institution’s total lending outstanding for housing purposes. 6. The Regulations provide that the interest rate for overpaid tax is set at the latest RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate less 100 basis points. The RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate is the monthly average of the daily standard rates. 7. The current underpayment and overpayment rates are 7.00% and 0% respectively. The UOMI rates were last changed by Order in Council with effect from 8 May 2020 and were based on the interest rates for March 2020. 8. The RBNZ interest rates for December 2021 indicate that the floating first mortgage new customer housing rate has changed by 28 basis points since the rates were last adjusted. I consider that an adjustment of the UOMI underpayment rate is necessary to avoid a long-term misalignment. Therefore, I recommend that the underpayment rate be increased to 7.28%. 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 9. The 90-day bank bill rate has changed by 20 basis points, to 0.91%, since the rates were last adjusted. This does not require a change to the UOMI overpayment rate as the 90-day bank bill rate less 100 basis points remains below zero, and therefore I recommend the rate continue to be set at 0%. Timing and 28-day rule 10. I propose to submit the Order in Council giving effect to the change in the UOMI underpayment rate to Cabinet for approval and submission to the Executive Council at its meeting on 4 April 2022. In order to minimise compliance costs, it is proposed that the new rate comes into force on 10 May 2022, the day after the due date for the third standard instalment of provisional tax. This also complies with the 28-day rule. Compliance 11. The regulations comply with the principles, Acts, guidelines, and requirements set out below as follows: 11.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi 11.2 the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 11.3 the Human Rights Act 1993 11.4 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993 11.5 relevant international standards and obligations 11.6 the Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee Regulations Review Committee 12. There are no anticipated grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Order in Council to the attention of the House under Standing Order 319. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 13. The Parliamentary Counsel Office has certified that the attached Order in Council is in order for submission to Cabinet. Impact Analysis 14. A regulatory impact assessment is not required as the proposal is of a minor and routine nature and does not substantially alter existing arrangements. Financial Implications 15. The proposal to increase the underpayment rate for taxpayers, with the effective date of 10 May 2022, is estimated to result in net positive revenue of approximately $7 million over the forecast period. The gross tax revenue increase of approximately $31.5 million arising from an increase in the underpayment rate is offset by an increase 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] in expenditure for impairment of debt and debt write-off costs of approximately $25 million. Revenue from the underpayment rate is impaired by 78.7% in the Crown accounts to reflect that most UOMI charged is never paid. These figures include the impact of the UOMI remission extension agreed by Cabinet on 14 March 2022. 16. This impact on appropriations is shown in the table below: $ millions increase / (decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 & out years Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue 0.584 6.095 6.819 9.000 9.000 Non-Departmental Other Expense: Impairment of debt and debt write-offs (funded by Revenue Crown) 0.460 4.797 5.367 7.083 7.083 Total Operating (0.124) (1.298) (1.452) (1.917) (1.917) Publicity 17.

This report brings to your attention the outcome of the regular review of the use of money interest (UOMI) rates and FBT prescribed rate of interest. It seeks a decision on whether to change the UOMI rates now or defer changing the rates because of the current Omicron outbreak. The report also seeks your agreement to increasing the FBT prescribed rate of interest. Context and background 2. The UOMI rates and FBT prescribed rate of interest are reviewed regularly to ensure that they align with market interest rates. The rates are calculated using formulae based on the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) survey of interest rates. 3. The underpayment UOMI rate is currently 7. 00%, based on RBNZ figures from March 2020, while the overpayment UOMI rate is capped so that it cannot go below zero, where it currently is. The current FBT prescribed rate of interest is 4.50%. Principles for updating the rates 4. Longstanding administrative principles in setting the rates provide that: 4.1 Both UOMI rates should be adjusted if: 4.1.1 the RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate or the floating first mortgage new customer housing rate moves by 1% or more; or 4.1.2 one of these indexes moves by 0.2% or more and the UOMI rates have n’t been adjusted in the last 12 months. 4.2 The FBT prescribed rate of interest should be adjusted if the floating first mortgage new customer housing rate moves by 0.2% or more. 5. When regulations are made altering the UOMI rates, the adjustment is applied from the next standard provisional tax payment date. 6. When regulations are made declaring the FBT prescribed rate of interest, they apply to quarters starting at least 1 month following the date the regulations were made. 1 7. Based on RBNZ figures from December 2021, the FBT prescribed rate of interest should be increased to 4.78% and the underpayment UOMI rate to 7. 28%. The overpayment UOMI rate would remain below zero on the basis of the formula and so would not change. 1 Regulations that reduce the prescribed rate may apply to a quarter if made at least one month before the end of that quarter; however, this is not relevant because the proposed change increases the prescribed rate. IR2022/046: UOMI rates and FBT prescribed rate of interest review Page 1 of 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence UOMI rates 8. The underpayment rate is charged on underpaid tax, while the overpayment rate is paid on money paid to Inland Revenue above their tax liability. 9. Although more is charged on underpayments than is paid on overpayments, underpayments are impaired by 78.7% in the Crown accounts to reflect that most UOMI charged is never paid and must be written off. Increasing the underpayment rate thus also increases impairment expenditure. 10. While the timing and amount of rate change recommendations are determined by formula, they require your agreement so you could elect to defer the increase because of the current Omicron outbreak. Increasing the UOMI underpayment rate during the current Omicron outbreak could be viewed as punitive for taxpayers, even if the Government decides to extend UOMI remission. 11. Officials have therefore included two options for you to consider: 11.1 Option 1 is increasing the underpayment UOMI rate by following the standard formula. The overpayment UOMI rate would continue to be 0%. The new rates would take effect from 9 May 2022. 11.2 Option 2 is deferring any change to the UOMI rates for now. I nstead, officials would report to you on reviewing the rates in the middle of the year. Option 1: changing the UOMI rates from 9 May 2022 12. Option 1 will prevent misalignment of the UOMI rates with market rates and maintain continuity of administrative principles. Additionally, most UOMI accrued by taxpayers (78.7%) is impaired, and the Government is considering an extension of COVID-related UOMI remission policies which will increase that amount. The actual impact of raising the underpayment rate on taxpayers may thus be small. 13. Should you proceed with the UOMI rate change, the change to the operating balance for the 2021/22 fiscal year is estimated to be approximately net zero. The 2022/23 and later years are estimated to have a full year net saving of approximately $2 million per annum. 14. These savings comprise a revenue increase of approximately $1 million in 2021/22, $8 million in 2022/23, and $9 million per annum for 2023/24 and later years. As described above, this is partly counteracted by an increase in impairment expenditure of approximately $1 million in 2021/22, and $7 million per annum for 2022/23 and later years. This is shown in the table below: $millions - increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 & outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue 1. 137 8. 480 9.000 9.000 9.000 Non- Departmental Other Expense: Impairment of Debt and Debt Write-offs 0. 895 6. 674 7.0 83 7.0 83 7.0 83 Total Operating (0.242) (1.806) (1.917) (1.917) (1.917) IR2022/046: UOMI rates and FBT prescribed rate of interest review Page 2 of 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence 15. The Treasury advises that a decision to proceed with this option would have no impact on allowances, as it would be considered consistent with existing policy, and hence a forecast change. By contrast, a decision to defer changing the rates would have to be charged against an allowance (likely, the Tax Policy Scorecard). Any increase in the Impairment of Debt and Debt Write-offs appropriation for 2021/22 would also have to be met from Imprest Supply. 16. Separately, however, an extension to UOMI remission policies for businesses impacted by COVID-19 will be considered by Cabinet on 14 March. If Cabinet approves the proposal, it will affect the change to the operating balance as a result of the rate increase. We understand the extension is proposed to go to March 2024. 17. Extending UOMI remission polices will reduce the overall fiscal impact of changing the UOMI underpayment rate, resulting in a lesser increase of revenue and impairment compared to the effect of raising the rate without changes to UOMI remission (as shown in the table in paragraph 14). This reduced effect is shown in the table below: $millions - increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 & outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue 0.584 6.095 6. 819 9.000 9.000 Non- Departmental Other Expense: Impairment of Debt and Debt Write-offs 0.460 4. 797 5.367 7.083 7.083 Total Operating (0.124) (1.298) (1.452) (1.917) (1.917) Option 2: deferring changes to the UOMI rates 18. The primary consideration in favour of option 2 is reducing costs for taxpayers already struggling with the potential impact of the Omicron outbreak. While the additional cost to taxpayers if the rates were increased may not be all that high, it is nevertheless an increase in costs at a time when taxpayers may be struggling. 19. Should you defer the UOMI rate changes, leaving the rate unchanged will have no impact on projected future revenue. However, leaving the rates unchanged represents a departure from an existing policy (which is to change the UOMI rates when certain criteria are met). This will have to be charged against an allowance, which would likely be the Tax Policy Scorecard. 20. Officials estimate the impact on the Scorecard would be approximately the reverse of the changes noted in the table in paragraph 14, as represented in the table below. Note that the real effect might be larger or smaller depending on the movement of interest rates and when the eventual decision is made.

Additionally, if (as expected) interest rates increase in early 2022, the deferral may result in a higher UOMI underpayment rate at the next review than if you choose option 1. A deferral may also result, however, in the UOMI overpayment rate rising above 0%. Officials’ recommendation 22. Officials recommend Option 1. While a deferral may help some taxpayers, the overall effect is likely to be minimal, especially if COVID-related UOMI remission is extended. Moreover, UOMI plays an important role in incentivising compliance and mitigating the fiscal impacts of late payment. Not updating it would undermine these functions. Proceeding with Option 1 would also have no impact on the Scorecard. Officials have consulted with the Treasury, who concur with this recommendation. FBT prescribed rate of interest 23. The FBT prescribed rate of interest applies to loans by employers to employees on which the employer is charging a rate of interest that is below the market rate, and taxes the differential between the rate of interest charged and the prescribed rate. 24. Despite the Omicron outbreak, officials recommend that the FBT prescribed rate of interest be increased to 4.78%. While the UOMI rates affect all taxpayers with tax debit or credit, the FBT prescribed rate of interest affects relatively few. Additionally, the purpose of the prescribed rate is to lower the tax advantage of offering employment-related loans at low interest rates; if the rate were to fall too far out of step with market interest rates, its effectiveness may be reduced. 25. The rate increase would come into force on 1 July 2022, the start of the next available quarter. 26. Raising the FBT prescribed rate of interest is projected to have a net positive fiscal impact of approximately $0.59 million per annum, which amounts to $2.36 million over the current forecast period. This net increase consists of an increase of approximately $0.82 million per annum and a decrease in company tax paid of approximately $0.23 million per annum. This is demonstrated in the table below.

Inland Revenue has consulted with the Treasury, the Parliamentary Counsel Office (PCO), and the New Zealand Customs Service (Customs) on this report. They agree with the recommendations. 28. Customs advise that a change in the underpayment UOMI rate will have some small operational and financial impacts. Customs’ compensatory interest rate is aligned with the UOMI underpayment rate, and an increase in the underpayment rate will correspondingly result in an increase to the compensatory interest rate. 29. This increase will in turn have a very small financial impact on Vote Customs. Customs collected $595,752.09 compensatory interest in the 12 months to December 2021. They advise us that an additional 0.28% increase in the UOMI would collect an additional $1,668 compensatory interest. Next steps 30. Officials have advised PCO that draft Orders in Council changing the rates may need to be prepared depending on your decision. 31. Attached are two papers to the Cabinet Legislation Committee, recommending that it approve the Orders in Council and authorise their submission to Cabinet and the Executive Council. If you decide to increase the UOMI rates and/or the FBT prescribed rate of interest, the papers should be referred to Cabinet Office by 10am, Thursday 24 March 2022. This would enable the Cabinet Legislation Committee to consider the papers on 31 March 2022. 32. The Cabinet paper recommending the increase of the UOMI rates as written assumes that the extension to UOMI remission for businesses impacted by COVID- 19 is approved by Cabinet on 14 March. If this extension is not approved by Cabinet, officials will supply you with an alternative Cabinet paper before 24 March. 33. If you decide to defer changing the UOMI rates, officials will continue to monitor the appropriate RBNZ indices and report to you again in the middle of the year.

1 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee INCOME TAX (FRINGE BENEFIT TAX, INTEREST ON LOANS) AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2022 Proposal 1. This paper seeks the Cabinet Legislation Committee’s agreement to submit an Order in Council amending the Income Tax (Fringe Benefit Tax, Interest on Loans) Regulations 1995 to the Executive Council. The proposal is to raise the fringe benefit tax (FBT) prescribed interest rate for low-interest, employment- related loans from 4.50% to 4.78%, in line with an increase in market interest rates. 2. Changes to the prescribed interest rate are a routine matter and do not involve a change of policy. The methodology used for setting the rate has been applied consistently since the early 1990s. Policy 3. The FBT rules tax non-cash benefits provided to employees. Included in the definition of ‘fringe benefit’ is any employment-related loan on which the employer is charging a rate of interest that is below the market rate. The interest differential is taxable. A prescribed rate set by regulations is used as a proxy for the market rate of interest to save employers the compliance costs associated with determining the market rate relevant to loans that they have provided to their employees. 4. The Income Tax Act 2007 (‘the Act’) allows regulations to be made to set the prescribed rate. Once a rate is set, it remains the prescribed rate of interest until changed by a subsequent Order in Council. The current FBT prescribed rate, which has applied since 1 July 2020, is 4.50%. 5. The prescribed rate of interest is based on a Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) survey of first mortgage housing interest rates on the last day of each month (‘floating first mortgage new customer housing rate’). This is calculated as the weighted average interest rate for the surveyed institutions, the weightings being based on each institution’s share of total lending for housing purposes. This RBNZ series is selected as the benchmark for setting the FBT prescribed rate because it is seen as a good indication of market interest rates. 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Timing 6. The Act provides that when regulations to increase the prescribed rate of interest are made, they apply to quarters starting at least one month following the date the regulations were made by Order in Council. Regulations that reduce the rate may apply for the current quarter if made at least one month before the end of the quarter. 7. In accordance with the Act, I recommend that the regulations to raise the rate have effect from 1 July 2022. As the Act requires that the regulations be made at least one month prior to the start of the quarter in which they come into effect, a waiver of the 28-day rule is unnecessary. Revenue implications 8. Raising the prescribed interest rate to 4.78% will increase the amount of FBT that will be collected by approximately $0.59 million per annum, which amounts to $2.36 million over the current forecast period (2022-23 to 2025-26). This is demonstrated in the table below (years beginning 1 July). $millions increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue (years ending 30 June) 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 & out years FBT Revenue 0.00 0.82 0.82 0.82 0.82 Company Tax 0.00 (0.23) (0.23) (0.23) (0.23) Net Revenue 0.00 0.59 0.59 0.59 0.59 Impact on Operating Balance - (0.59) (0.59) (0.59) (0.59) Compliance 9.

The material should be lodged with the Cabinet Office by 10am Thursday 5 May 2022 for consideration at the Cabinet Legislation Committee meeting on 12 May 2022. 2. The Cabinet paper seeks approval to introduce the Taxation ( Cost of Living Payments) Bill (the Bill) on 19 May 2022. Cabinet has previously agreed that the Bill be passed under urgency on Budget Day, to provide certainty and sufficient time for Inland Revenue to implement the changes in order to make the first payment on 1 August 2022. 3. A draft disclosure statement is attached to accompany the Cabinet paper in accordance with Cabinet guidelines. The draft statement is finalised by Inland Revenue with the Parliamentary Counsel Office shortly before the introduction of the Bill and is made public when the Bill is introduced. 4. A Regulatory Impact Assessment was not submitted at the time that Cabinet approval of the policy relating to the Bill was sought \[CAB-22-MIN-130 refers\]. This was due to time constraints. Instead, a Supplementary Analysis Report is being completed and will be included with the other documents accompanying the Cabinet paper. The Supplementary Analysis Report will be provided to your office on 4 May 2022. 5. The draft Bill contains provisions to implement the items listed below. Policy items approved by Cabinet 6. Cabinet has approved the introduction of a Cost-of -Living Payments scheme to provide short-term support for low-to-middle income individuals earning up to $70,000 (net income for the 2022 tax year), and who are not eligible for the Winter Energy Payment (WEP). 7. Under the scheme cos t-of -l iving payments, together totalling $350, will be made in three instalments from 1 August 2022. These payments are intended to support low-to-middle income individuals who: 7.1 may have been heavily impacted by the recent increase in the cost of living; 7.2 are less likely to have benefitted from changes on 1 April to support or increase incomes such as increases in main benefit rates, Working for Families tax credits, and the increase in the minimum wage; and 7.3 will not be receiving a temporary increase in income on 1 May due to the WEP, to support living costs over winter.

Sensitive Office of the Minister of Revenue Cabinet Legislation Committee Taxation (Cost of Living Payments) Bill: Approval for Introduction Proposal 1. This paper seeks the Cabinet Legislation Committee’s authorisation for the introduction of the attached Taxation (Cost of Living Payments) Bill (the Bill) under urgency on 19 May 2022. 2. The Bill introduces amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. Policy 3. The Bill will implement the policy agreed by Cabinet to make cost of living payments. The Bill is necessary as amendments to existing legislation are required for Inland Revenue to administer the payments. Cost of living payments 4. On 12 April 2022, Cabinet agreed to introduce new short-term cost-of-living payments to help households deal with the recent spike in inflation driven by COVID-19-related global supply chain issues and the war in Ukraine. This payment will provide transitional support as the government’s extended fuel excise duty reductions and half price public transport policies are phased out. 5. The $350 total payment amount will be made in three periodic instalments paid in August, September and October 2022. No application will be required from recipients. 6. The new cost-of-living payments will provide short-term support for low-to- middle income individuals who: 6.1 earned up to $70,000 in the 2021-22 tax year; 6.2 are aged 18 or over; 6.3 are New Zealand tax residents and present in New Zealand; 6.4 currently hold a New Zealand bank account; and 6.5 are not eligible to receive the Winter Energy Payment (WEP). 7. The payment will not be paid to individuals who are receiving a qualifying benefit (such as main benefit, New Zealand Superannuation or Veteran’s 2qddsziq5 2022-05-24 10:32:06 1 Pension) during the payment period. This is because these individuals will be receiving the WEP. The WEP provides between $450 and $700 to eligible recipients during the winter period. 8. The payment will be targeted using Inland Revenue data on individuals for the 2021-22 tax year, applying the following parameters: 8.1 the income threshold test based on net income (gross income less allowable deductions for that year, before losses) for the 2021-22 tax year; 8.2 individuals who have not filed an income tax return by the date of the first payment will begin receiving payments after they file (or as a lump sum after the monthly payment window closes); and 8.3 individuals with no tax assessment will be excluded. 9. The eligibility criteria for the payment and the design parameters are not required to be included in legislation. Instead, the Bill requires that they be published on Inland Revenue’s website. 10. The Bill proposes amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 that are necessary for Inland Revenue to be able to administer the cost-of-living payments. 11. The proposed amendments will allow Inland Revenue to: 11.1 include administration of the cost-of-living payments as one of the functions of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue; and 11.2 use the information it holds to determine eligibility and make payments; 11.3 recover the payments in cases of serious non-compliance, such as fraud. 12. The Bill also proposes that the cost-of-living payments be tax exempt and not included as income for Working Families tax credits. 13. It is also proposed that the payments will not be considered income or a cash asset for income support paid by MSD. This will be achieved by amending the Social Security Regulations 2018 and the Student Allowances Regulations 1998. MSD will progress these changes separately. Timeframes 14. Cabinet agreed that the Bill be introduced on 19 May 2022 and passed under urgency. This will provide certainty for Inland Revenue and will allow sufficient time to implement the required changes to make the first payment on 1 August 2022. 2qddsziq5 2022-05-24 10:32:06 2 Impact analysis 15. Due to time constraints a regulatory impact assessment was not submitted at the time that Cabinet approval of the policy relating to the Bill was sought \[CAB-22-MIN-130 refers\]. Instead, a Supplementary Analysis Report has been completed and submitted with this Cabinet paper. 16. The Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Panel has reviewed the Cost of living payments Supplementary Analysis Report (SAR) prepared by Inland Revenue and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the SAR partially meets the quality assurance criteria. 17. Analysis of the problem and potential options has been significantly constrained by shortened timeframes, Ministerial direction on options and lack of stakeholder consultation outside Government. Given this, the panel considers that the information in the RIS is as complete as could reasonably be expected and identifies the main judgements, risks and uncertainties within the policy. Compliance The Treaty of Waitangi 18. No formal steps have been taken to determine whether the provisions in the Bill are consistent with the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi. The New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993 19. The Bill has been provided to the Ministry of Justice to review whether it complies with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993. Departmental disclosure statement 20. The Bill complies with the departmental disclosure statement requirements. A draft departmental disclosure statement has been prepared and is attached. The Privacy Act 2020 21. The provisions in the Bill comply with the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 2020. The Privacy Commissioner was consulted on the provisions in the Bill that relate to the use of existing information to administer the payments scheme. Relevant international standards and obligations 22. No formal steps have been taken to determine whether the provisions in the Bill comply with New Zealand’s international obligations. The Legislation Guidelines 23. The Bill complies with the Legislation Guidelines (2021) which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. 2qddsziq5 2022-05-24 10:32:06 3 Consultation 24. Consultation on the provisions in this Bill with stakeholders (other than key government departments) did not occur due to time constraints and Budget sensitivities. Binding on the Crown 25. The Bill amends the Income Tax Act 2007, which is binding on the Crown, and the Tax Administration Act 1994, which is not currently binding on the Crown. Creating new agencies or amending law relating to existing agencies 26. The Bill will not create a new agency or amend law relating to existing agencies. Allocation of decision-making powers 27. The Bill does not allocate decision-making powers. Associated regulations 28. The Bill does not include associated regulations. Other instruments 29. The Bill does not include any provision empowering the making of other instruments that are deemed to be legislative instruments or disallowable instruments (or both). Definition of Minister/department 30. The Bill does not contain a definition of Minister, department (or equivalent government agency), or chief executive of a department (or equivalent position). Commencement of legislation 31. The amendments will take effect on the day after the day the Bill receives Royal assent. Parliamentary stages 32. The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Bill be introduced on 19 May 2022 and passed under urgency on the same day. Proactive Release 33. The Minister of Revenue proposes to release this paper proactively, subject to redaction as appropriate under the Official Information Act 1982, after Budget Day. 2qddsziq5 2022-05-24 10:32:06 4 Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Committee: 1 notethat the Bill proposes amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 that are necessary for Inland Revenue to be able to administer the cost-of-living payments; 2 notethat the Bill proposes the cost-of-living payments be tax exempt and not included as income for Working for Families tax credits purposes; 3 notethat the Bill does not include the eligibility criteria for the cost-of-living payments, but the Bill will require these criteria to be published on Inland Revenue’s website; 4 approvethe Taxation (Cost of Living Payments) Bill for introduction, subject to the final approval of the government caucus and sufficient support in the House of Representatives; 5 authorisethe Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue to approve any drafting changes to the Bill, including its title, before its introduction; 6 agreethat the Bill be introduced on 19 May 2022; 7 agreethat the Government propose that the Bill be passed under urgency.

On 11 April 2022, Cabinet agreed to introduce a new Cost of Living payment of $350 to provide short-term support for low-to-middle income individuals earning below $70,000 per annum and not eligible to receive the Winter Energy Payment (WEP) \[CAB-22-MIN-130 refers\]. 2. Cabinet also authorised the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue to ap prove detailed design changes to the payment scheme that might be needed ahead of implementation. In the process of designing the administration of the payment, we have identified two changes to the eligibility criteria. We consider these are needed to ensure consistency with policy intent and to prevent people who were not intended to receive the Cost of Living payment from doing so. Purpose 3. This report seeks your agreement to exclude individuals from eligibility for the payment in the following specific scenarios: 3.1 those whose only income is Portfolio Investment Entity (PIE) income; and 3.2 those who are not required to have an income tax assessment (because they have no assessable income from any source) but file a tax return or request an automatically ge nerated assessment for the sole purpose of trying to qualify for the payment. 4. The report also seeks your agreement to include the ability to opt out of receiving the payments if individuals do not wish to receive them. Individuals with PIE only income could inadvertently qualify for the Cost of Living payment 5. We have identified that some people who have only Portfolio Investment Entity (PIE) income (and no other income from any other source) could inadvertently qualify for the Cost of Living payment. 6. This could happen because: 6.1 there is no income floor to meet the income eligibility criterion for the Cost of Living payment so that someone with zero net income could qualify; and 6.2 the individual income tax assessment is used as the mechanism to calculate whether an individual has paid the correct amount of PIE tax. 7. These individuals would qualify under the current proposed criteria because their net 1 income (zero in these cases) will be below the income cap of $70,000 and they have a tax assessment for the 2022 tax year, even though that assessment has 1 Net income refers to a person’s gross income for the year, less any allowable deductions for the year, but before any losses from prior years are included. IR2022/198: Cost of Living payment: detailed design decisions Page 1 of 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] been generated for PIE tax purposes, not individual income tax purposes. Examples of individuals in this group could be those with no income who have a KiwiSaver account, or those who have no income other than that received from PIE investments. 8. PIE income is not included in an individual’s net income for the year and is taxed separately according to a person’s Prescribed Investor Rate (PIR). The individual income tax assessments are a mechanism used to determine if the person had applied the correct PIR rate to their PIE income and to determine if there is a PIE tax debit or refund owing. Any over or under paid PIE tax is included in the final income tax calculation as a credit or a debit. 9. Since PIE income is not included in an individual’s net income, it will be ignored when determining whether the person meets the income eligibility criterion for the Cost of Living payment. For example, if a person has $65,000 from salary and wages and $30,000 from PIE income, their net income will be $65,000. They will therefore be eligible fo r the Cost of Living payment. Number of individuals with PIE only income 10. We estimate that there could around 204,000 individuals who have PIE only income and receive an assessment for no other reason. This is based on the number of people in the 2022 tax year who had only PIE income and did not have an income tax assessment. 11. These individuals have not been included in the potentially eligible population data provided in previous advice, as the legislative change that assesses PIE income took effect only from the 2021 tax year. This meant that assessments were generated for everyone with PIE income, irrespective of whether it had been taxed correctly or not, allowing people who had overpaid PIE tax to get a refund. This was not the case for the 2020 year, 2 which was the administrative data used in advice on the Cost of Living payment to understand and describe the eligible population. Exclusion of those with PIE only income 12. Officials consider that allowing individuals with only PIE income to be eligible for the payment does not align with the policy intent of supporting low to middle income individuals whose income has struggled to keep up with the cost of living increases. 13. These individuals only have an income tax assessment because of the PIE income assessment and otherwise would not have an income tax assessment as they have no net income to report. 14. Other individuals who do not have any net income do not receive an individual tax assessment and would not be eligible for the Cost of Living payment. Excluding those who have only PIE income would be broadly consistent with the treatment for this group. That is, the only reason PIE only recipients have an income tax assessment is as an administrative convenience to assess PIE tax and to be able to include any debit or credit with the final tax to pay or refund due for the year. 15. This proposed change would not exclude Working for Families (WFF) recipients who have only PIE income from the Cost of Living payment as they are required to have an income tax assessment to determine their WFF entitlement for the year. Working for Families is a tax credit that is part of an individual’s overall income tax assessment and so they must have an income tax assessment to be able to claim WFF, along with any spouse or partner. 2 The 2020 tax year data was used as it is the latest year for which we hold complete data IR2022/198: Cost of Living payment: detailed design decisions Page 2 of 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Exclusion of individuals who file or request an unnecessary nil tax assessment 16. As part of work on detailed design, we recognised that there is a possibility that some people who have no net income may request an unnecessary nil assessment (i.e., an assessment containing no income from any source) to qualify for the Cost of Living payment. 17. We do not believe this behaviour is consistent with the policy intent. Those with no income and no assessment are already excluded and we consider that people who file or request an unnecessary nil assessment should be treated in the same way. 18. This proposed change would not affect stay at home parents who have no other income but receive Working for Families tax credits. This is because they are required to have an income tax assessment to determine their WFF entitlement, even if they have no income. The WFF calculation forms part of their individual income tax assessment along with the income tax assessment of any spouse or partner. 19. It would also not affect those who need to file an income tax assessment but have zero net income, such as self-employed people whose allowable deductions reduce their income to zero. It would also not affect people who file an assessment with very low but positive levels of net income. 20. To close this potential loophole, we recommend that those who are not required to request, confirm or file an income tax assessment for any reason and who have no income, should not be eligible for the payment if they request or file an assessment that contains no assessable income. Ability to opt out of payments 21. Eligibility for the Cost of Living payment will be determined by Inland Revenue based on information it holds. Individuals will not need to apply. 22. Since there is no application, which implies that the person wants the payment, we think that it is important that there a simple process available for people to opt out of the payment scheme if they choose to. 23. This process would be implemented within Inland Revenue’s authenticated online service, myIR. Individuals would also be able to opt out over the phone. However, once a person has opted out, they would not be able to change their mind and restart payments. This is because of the complexity this would introduce. Clear communications about this would be provided. 24. Having the ability to opt out of the payments would align with the WEP, which also includes an option to out of receiving the payments. Administrative impacts 25. Internal system design, and operational experts have confirmed that both the recommended changes to the eligibility criteria and providing an “opt out” process can be developed and implemented within the required timeframes. Inclusion of these changes will not add any additional risks to delivery. Financial implications 26. Unless Ministers decide otherwise, individuals with PIE income only will be eligible for the Cost of Living payment. However, this group was not included in the original estimates for the cost of the scheme. Consequently, the scheme is likely to be more IR2022/198: Cost of Living payment: detailed design decisions Page 3 of 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] expensive than previously reported. An additional 200,000 recipients would increase the cost of the payment by around $70 million. 27. The Cost of Living payment was initially forecasted at $747.600 million, based on a payment of $350 to 2,136,000 recipients. However, to allow for any uncertainty in the size of the recipient population, Inland Revenue sought an appropriation of $800 million. This means that there is already a buffer of around $50 million. Officials therefore do not consider this buffer sufficient to cover the additional cost of making the payment to individuals with PIE income only. 28. As noted above, however, officials do not recommend allowing individuals with PIE income only to receive the Cost of Living payment. If you agree with this decision, the cost of the payment will be as previously reported. 29. However, if you wish to extend the payment, officials propose to report back to you on the options for managing this additional cost. 30. There are no financial implications arising from the other issues raised in this report. Consultation 31. The Treasury has been consulted on this report. Next steps 32. If you agree to the recommendations to exclude individuals who have only PIE income, and those who request or file an unnecessary nil tax assessment, we will incorporate these into the design of the payment and will include the information in the eligibility criteria that will be published on Inland Revenue’s website.

This report informs you about the required annual change to the deemed rate of return on attributing interests in foreign investment funds. Attached is a Cabinet paper that recommends an Order in Council be made to set the deemed rate of return for the 2021-22 income year. Background 2. The Income Tax Act 2007 (the Act) requires the deemed rate of return under foreign investment fund (FIF) rules for each income year to be set by Order in Council. 3. New Zealand’s FIF rules tax New Zealand residents on attributed income from non- controlling investments in foreign companies, life insurance policies, and certain superannuation schemes. Since 1 April 2014, most interests in foreign superannuation schemes are taxed on transfer rather than under the FIF rules. 4. The Act provides different methods to calculate FIF income or losses for tax purposes, one of which is the deemed rate of return method. An investor must use the deemed rate of return where: 4.1 The interest consists of certain non-ordinary shares that have debt characteristics; and 4.2 The comparative value method cannot be used because the end-of -year market value of the interest cannot be determined. 5. Under the deemed rate of return method, income from a FIF is calculated each year by multiplying the opening value of the investment by the rate set annually by Order in Council. 6. An Order in Council is now required to set the deemed rate of return for the 2021- 22 income year. Calculation 7. The method for calculating the annual deemed rate of return was established and approved in 1994 (CAB (94) M 35/3 C(vi) refers). The calculation involves taking an average of the five-year “risk-free” Government bond rate at the end of each quarter of the income year and adding a risk premium margin of four percentage points. If the last day of a quarter falls on a weekend or statutory holiday, the rate on the next business day is used. 8. Officials recommend that the current method for calculating the deemed rate of return be used again for the 2021–22 income year. It is a simple way of approximating the expected return on foreign equities, incorporating a risk premium of four percentage points above the return on “risk-free” debt such as Government bonds. The method has been used for every income year since 1994. \[IN CONFIDENCE\] IR2022/186; Cabinet paper: Income Tax (Deemed Rate of Return on Attributing Interests in Foreign Investment Funds, 2021-22 Income Year) Order 2022 Page 2 of 3 9. The average of the quarterly five-year Government bond interest rates for the 2021–22 income year is 2.01%. This means that the deemed rate of return for the 2021–22 income year will be 6.01% (2.01% plus four percentage points). This is an increase from last year’s deemed rate of return, which was 4.43%. 10. Despite an increase of 1.58%, the deemed rate of return method is used by a very small number of taxpayers, therefore, this change will have no quantifiable fiscal impact. Regulatory Impact Analysis 11. A Regulatory Impact Analysis is not required for this Cabinet paper because no policy decision is being sought. The deemed rate of return has been calculated in accordance with a formula that was approved by Cabinet in 1994 (CAB (94) M 35/3 C(vi) refers). Timing 12. Because the deemed rate of return is based on five-year Government bond rates from across the year for which the rate applies, it must always be calculated after the end of the income year but apply retrospectively from the beginning of that year. 13. This Order in Council will enable taxpayers using the deemed rate of return method to calculate their FIF income for the 2021–22 income year and therefore needs to apply retrospectively from 1 April 2021. 14. Officials recommend that a waiver of the 28-day rule for regulations is sought for this Order in Council. Taxpayers that use the deemed rate of return are not able to use the old rate to file a return for the 2021–22 year; they must wait for the new rate to come into force. A waiver would be taxpayer-friendly and beneficial to the Government, as without a waiver some taxpayers would have to wait an extra 28 days to file a return because they are waiting on the rate to come into force. 15. The attached Cabinet paper is drafted on the basis that a waiver is sought for the Order in Council. This will mean the Order comes into force on 27 May 2022. If you do not agree to recommend a waiver, we will supply you with an updated Cabinet paper. Cabinet paper and associated materials 16. The Cabinet paper and the advice sheet for the Order in Council are attached to this report. These should be signed and referred to the Cabinet Office by 10am, Wednesday, 11 May 2022, for consideration at the Cabinet Legislation Committee’s meeting on Thursday 19 May 2022. 17. The Parliamentary Council Office will provide copies of the finalised Order in Council directly to the Cabinet Office. 18. The rate will be published on the Inland Revenue website once the Order in Council has been made. Consultation 19. The Treasury was consulted on the Cabinet paper and agrees with its recommendation. \[IN CONFIDENCE\] IR2022/186; Cabinet paper: Income Tax (Deemed Rate of Return on Attributing Interests in Foreign Investment Funds, 2021-22 Income Year) Order 2022 Page 3 of 3 Proactive release 20.

1 In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Office of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary, Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee I NCOME TAX (DEEMED RATE OF RETURN ON ATTRIBUTING INTERESTS IN FOREIGN INVESTMENT FUNDS, 2021-22 INCOME YEAR) ORDER 2022 Proposal 1.This paper proposes that Cabinet Legislation Committee authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the attached Order in Council, which will set the deemed rate of return on attributing interests in foreign investment funds at 6.01% for the 2021–22 income year. Background 2.New Zealand’s foreign investment fund (FIF) rules tax New Zealand residents on income from certain foreign investments. There are several methods for calculating a taxpayer’s income or loss from these investments, as set out in legislation. One of these is the deemed rate of return method. 3.The deemed rate of return method is used to calculate FIF income or loss from non- ordinary shares with debt-like properties, such as shares that guarantee a return. The method can only be used if the market value of the foreign investment cannot be determined at the end of the income year. Under the deemed rate of return method, income from a FIF is calculated each year by multiplying the opening book value of the investment by a deemed rate set annually by Order in Council. 4.The method for calculating the annual deemed rate of return was established and approved in 1994 (CAB Min (94) 35/3 C(vi) refers). The calculation takes an average of the five-year “risk-free” Government bond rates at the end of each quarter of the income year and then adds a risk p remium margin of four percentage points. The current method is a suitable way of approximating the expected return on foreign equities and has been used for every income year since 1994. Comment 5.The average of the quarterly five-year Government bond interest rates for the 2020– 21 income year is 2.01%. The attached Income Tax (Deemed Rate of Return on Attributing Interests in Foreign Investment Funds, 2021–22 Income Year) Order 2022 therefore sets the deemed rate of return for the 2021–22 income year at 6.01% (2.01% plus four percentage points) in accordance with the current method of calculation. This is an increase from last year’s deemed rate of return, which was 4.43%. 2 Timing and 28-Day Rule 6. The new deemed rate of return should come into force as soon as practicable to allow taxpayers using this rate to file their tax returns as soon as they can. I therefore recommend that the new rate comes into force on 27 May 2022. 7. To ensure a commencement date of 27 May 2022, I recommend that the 28-day rule be waived for the coming into force of this Order. This will ensure that taxpayers using the deemed rate of return method for calculating their income are able to promptly file their tax return using the correct rate for the 2021–22 income year. 8. If a waiver is not agreed to, then taxpayers that use the deemed rate of return method will not be able to file a return until the 28-day period has been satisfied. Taxpayers in this situation are unable to use last year’s deemed rate of return to file for the 2021– 22 income year and must wait for the current year’s rate to come into force. 9. It is of no benefit to taxpayers nor the Government to require taxpayers using the deemed rate of return method to wait an extra 28 days to file their tax return. This would be a source of frustration for taxpayers who want to file their tax returns quickly but are unable to do so. Therefore, I recommend that the 28-day rule be waived. Consultation 10. The Treasury has been consulted in the preparation of this paper and agrees with its recommendations. Compliance 11. The Order complies with each of the following: 11.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 11.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993; 11.3 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993; 11.4 relevant international standards and obligations; and 11.5 the Legislation Guidelines (2021 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. 3 Legislative Implications 12. The proposal of this Cabinet paper is that the attached Order in Council be submitted to the Executive Council. Impact Analysis 13. A Regulatory Impact Analysis is not required because no policy decision is being sought. The deemed rate of return has been calculated in accordance with a formula that was approved by Cabinet in 1994 (CAB Min (94) 35/3 C(vi) refers). Regulations Review Committee 14. There are no anticipated grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Order in Council to the attention of the House. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 15. The Parliamentary Counsel Office has certified that the attached Order in Council is in order for submission to Cabinet. Publicity 16. Once the Order in Council is made, Inland Revenue will publish the new rate on their website. Proactive Release 17. I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions, subject to minor redactions under the Official Information Act 1982. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Cabinet Legislation Committee: 1. note that the attached Order in Council sets the deemed rate of return on attributing interests in foreign investment funds at 6.01% for the 2021–22 income year; 2. note that a waiver of the 28-day rule is sought: 2.1 so that the Order can come into force on 27 May 2022; 2.2 on the grounds that taxpayers using the deemed rate of return method for calculating their income must wait for the 2021–22 rate to come into force, and that it is of no benefit to taxpayers or the Government to require taxpayers using the rate to wait an extra 28 days to be able to file their tax return; 4 3. agree to waive the 28-day rule so that the Order comes into force on 27 May 2022; 4. authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Income Tax (Deemed Rate of Return on Attributing Interests in Foreign Investment Funds, 2021–22 Income Year) Order 2022.

The report recommends you agree to an Order in Council that permits Inland Revenue to remit use of money interest (UOMI) charged on the late payment of tax. The proposed Order is a tax relief measure in response to the flooding and weather-related events experienced in several areas of New Zealand as a result of the severe storm fronts in the latter half of July 11 to 31 July 2022. The Order would declare the recent weather fronts as an emergency event for the purposes of the Inland Revenue Acts. 1 2. If you agree to the recommendations in this report, we also recommend you approve and lodge the attached paper to Cabinet approving the Order in Council. 3. We recommend that the proposal be submitted directly to Cabinet to ensure the relief is timely for those affected taxpayers. 4. The Order would give Inland Revenue flexibility to allow affected taxpayers to pay their tax obligations on a later day, other than that required by the Inland Revenue Acts, without incurring UOMI. Request from Federated Farmers New Zealand for tax payment date flexibility 5. Inland Revenue has been approached by Federated Farmers of New Zealand (on 27 July 2022) requesting some flexibility for due tax payment dates for rural and isolated communities. Federated Farmers note that the unusual sequencing of weather fronts for a prolonged period is creating stress particularly for primary industry communities in Northland, Gisborne district, Wairoa district, Canterbury, and Otago. These communities have, over the last fortnight been affected by fl ooding, high winds, and infrastructure disruptions, such as power and road outages. For example, Canterbury is said to have recorded more rain in July since records began. 6. The combination of the last fortnight’s weather fronts has resulted in flooding and disruption which has significantly adversely affected some taxpayers’ ability to meet their tax obligations. For example, PAYE payments, and FBT quarterly returns were due on 20 July. GST returns for taxpayers with taxable periods ending June were due on 28 July. Finally, some taxpayers would have had provisional tax payments due on 28 July. 7. Without relief, the late payment of these tax types results in the automatic statutory imposition of UOMI. 8. The current rate of interest on underpayments of tax is 7.28 percent. 1 An emergency event for the purpose of the Inland Revenue Acts is different from an emergency event declared under the Civil Defence Emergency Management Framework. The Order discussed in this report deals with provision of tax relief for taxpayers affected by the series of severe weather fronts that affected New Zealand between 11 July and 31 July 2022. In Confidence IR2022/377: Order in Council: Tax Administration (July Adverse Weather Event) Order 2022 Page 2 of 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] The case for providing UOMI relief 9. The Tax Administration Act 1994 2 provides for the making of an Order in Council to allow Inland Revenue to remit UOMI when: 9.1 an emergency event has or will significantly adversely affect a taxpayer’s ability to pay an amount of tax on time, or make an accurate forecast of provisional tax; 9.2 this non-payment results in the imposition of UOMI; and 9.3 the taxpayer is a member of a class of persons eligible for remission of UOMI if the Order in Council declaring the emergency event describes such a class of persons. 10. The practical effect of UOMI remission is that it allows affected taxpayers covered by the scope of the Order to focus on recovering from the event rather than on their tax affairs. Last year the statutory test for when an emergency event could be declared changed from considering whether taxpayers were “physically prevented” from paying tax, to whether the taxpayers have been “significantly adversely affected”. This change aligns the test for UOMI relief with the tests that were used in response to COVID-19, and allows for consideration of a wider range of factors that otherwise prevent taxpayers from paying tax by the statutory due dates. 11. We have discussed the request from Federated Farmers with the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI). 12. MPI support the tax relief measure recommended in this report, and note the following: 12.1 While there has been a series of severe weather fronts that have crossed New Zealand in July, they have not met the threshold for a response under the Primary Sector Recovery Policy administered by the Ministry of Primary Industries. 12.2 MPI are continuing to assess the impact of these weather events on rural communities across New Zealand. 12.3 Southern regions, such as South Canterbury and North Otago are currently under coverage of an adverse event declaration until October 2022 in response to the drought conditions that until recently existed. (We consider that this declaration made in March 2022 cannot be used to support the case for interest remission under the Tax Administration Act as it was for a drought, an event that did not prevent taxpayers from meeting their tax obligations.) 13. In support for providing interest remission relief, Federated Farmers have voiced the following concerns for those communities affected by the weather from the last fortnight: 2 Section 183ABA refers. s 9(2)(ba)(i) In Confidence IR2022/377: Order in Council: Tax Administration (July Adverse Weather Event) Order 2022 Page 3 of 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Suggested response 14. It is unusual for Inland Revenue to recommend a tax relief Order ahead of, or in the absence of, a formal declaration of an adverse event either under MPI’s Primary Sector Relief Policy, or a civil defence emergency – such as an earthquake. 3 However, we consider from a tax perspective that the totality of the various severe weather fronts since 11 July to 31 July and the wide impacts those fronts have had on all of New Zealand warrants a tax relief response. Our recommendation is based on: 14.1 MPI’s support for Inland Revenue’s response, 14.2 The recent rainfall from 11 July to 31 July in affected areas has either broken regional records, or has been well-above regional averages, and 14.3 Given the number of regions affected, there are administrative efficiencies if an Order is made. 15. The response would focus on UOMI relief in relation to the payment dates for PAYE/FBT, due 20 July, and GST, due 28 July. The relief would also apply to missed provisional tax payments due 28 July. The recommended Order would also engage Inland Revenue’s discretionary relief for remitting penalties for late filing and payment. 16. The proposed Order would describe the emergency event as being the series of weather fronts that crossed New Zealand between 11 July and 31 July 2022. Relief would, however, be restricted to taxpayers who have been significantly adversely affected in the Northland, Gisborne district, Wairoa district, Canterbury, and Otago regions. 17. The proposed Order gives affected taxpayers certainty (assuming timeliness) and allows Inland Revenue to respond to a “class of persons”. This ensures an efficient response for those communities. To ensure the relief is timely, we recommend that the attached paper be referred direct to Cabinet for its meeting on 8 August 2022. A later date for making the Order would reduce the overall benefit of the proposed relief measure. 18. Under the proposed Order, affected taxpayers would have up to two months to seek remission of UOMI on any underpayments of tax. 19. If you do not agree with our suggested approach, taxpayers would still be able to seek remission of late payment and late filing penalties (but not interest remission). Decisions would be made on a case-by -case basis and taxpayers would need to prove hardship. Comment 20. We consider an Order would allow Inland Revenue to best use its resources in determining where tax relief should be directed at and applying Inland Revenue’s existing relief discretions . While the main beneficiaries of the Order are expected to be those in rural and isolated communities, it is likely that other taxpayers in those regions will also benefit. For example, in cases where there has been urban and suburban flooding in Christchurch, Timaru, and Dunedin that has significantly adversely affected tax compliance. 21. As noted earlier, in the absence of the Order, some discretions can be exercised, but Inland Revenue would need to consider such requests on a case-by -case basis. 3 For example, an UOMI remission relief Order was made in response to the Hawke’s Bay gastroenteritis outbreak in 2016, which was neither an adverse event, or a civil defence emergency. In Confidence IR2022/377: Order in Council: Tax Administration (July Adverse Weather Event) Order 2022 Page 4 of 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Administrative implications 22. Notwithstanding that PAYE/FBT payments were due on 20 July, and GST and provisional payments were due 28 July, Inland Revenue has not detected a perceptible uplift in queries from taxpayers seeking relief as a result of being affected by the recent weather events. This is not surprising as we have been informed by Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand in respect of the respective emergency responses last year (2021) for the floods in Canterbury, and later for the top of the South Island, that taxpayers in these stressful circumstances often do not consider their tax obligations until after other priority tasks have been attended to. 23. The proposed Order in Council does not have any implications for Inland Revenue’s technology systems. Revenue implications 24. The baseline forecasts do not include the emergency event, nor the potential UOMI charges should the event trigger additional debt. Remission of UOMI for significantly adversely affected taxpayers in the Northland, Gisborne district, Wairoa district, Canterbury, and Otago regions will not affect existing fiscal baselines. Consultation 25. The Treasury and the Ministry for Primary Industries have been consulted as part of the preparation of this report and concur with its recommendation. MPI support the proposed tax relief measure recommended in this report. 26. We have also consulted with Fe derated Farmers New Zealand. If you agree to the recommendations in this report, we will inform Federated Farmers and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand about the proposed Order in Council, following Cabinet’s consideration on 8 August 2022. Next steps 27. If you agree to the recommendations in this report, we recommend you approve and lodge the attached paper for Cabinet for its meeting on 8 August 2022. For that paper to be considered at that meeting, it will need to be lodged with Cabinet office by 10am, Thursday, 4 August 2022. It is desirable to authorise the relief as soon as possible. The reasons for this are taxpayer certainty and equity, and the efficient use of Inland Revenue resources. 28. A copy of this report and attached Cabinet paper should be referred to the Minister of Finance and the Minister for Rural Communities for their information. Recommended action We recommend that you: (a) Agree to an Order in Council declaring the recent weather systems that crossed New Zealand from 11 July to 31 July 2022 to be an emergency event for UOMI relief purposes. Agree/Not agreed
1 In confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Tax Administration (July Adverse Weather Event) Order 2022 Proposal 1 I seek Cabinet’s agreement to allow Inland Revenue to remit interest charges on late payments for taxpayers who have been significantly adversely affected by a series of severe weather fronts that crossed New Zealand between 11 July and 31 July 2022. Allowing Inland Revenue to remit this interest requires an Order in Council. Policy 2 New Zealand has experienced an unusual sequence of severe weather fronts, with regions experiencing record-breaking, or well-above average, levels of rainfall between 11 July and 31 July. The cumulative effect of these fronts has resulted in flooding and disruption in a number of regions which has significantly adversely affected the ability of some taxpayers to meet their tax obligations, including filing, and paying tax on time. 3 Inland Revenue has the power to provide relief from late payment and late filing penalties for taxpayers affected by flooding, at the Commissioner’s discretion. However, this relief does not extend to the remission of interest (use-of-money interest) charged by Inland Revenue to compensate the Crown for the loss of the use of revenue. This is because the remission of interest requires a higher threshold, such as a natural disaster, and requires Cabinet approval before the relief can be provided. The current rate of interest on underpayments of tax is 7.28 percent. Without relief, the late payment of tax due on the statutory date results in the automatic statutory imposition of interest. 4 The Tax Administration Act 1994 provides for an Order in Council to allow Inland Revenue to remit interest where: 4.1 an emergency event significantly adversely affects a taxpayer from paying an amount of tax on time, or make an accurate forecast of provisional tax; 4.2 the non-payment of tax results in the imposition of interest; and 4.3 the taxpayer is a member of class of persons eligible for remission of interest if the Order in Council declaring the emergency event describes such a class of person. 5 While it is unusual for Inland Revenue to recommend a tax relief Order ahead of, or in the absence of, a formal declaration of an adverse event, my officials have advised that cumulative effects of the recent unsettled weather systems have been disruptive to a number of communities in Northland, Gisborne District, Wairoa District, Canterbury, Otago regions. These weather-related disruptions have affected some taxpayers from making their tax payments for PAYE and FBT, which was due on 2. 2 20 July, and GST, which was due on 28 July. Some provisional taxpayers also had instalment payments due on 28 July. 6 My officials consider that for taxpayers in these affected communities, the conditions for interest remission relief contemplated by the Tax Administration Act have been met. An Order in Council permitting the remission of interest on underpaid tax would also engage Inland Revenue’s discretionary relief for remitting penalties for late filing and payment. 7 The practical effect of interest remission is that it allows affected taxpayers covered by the scope of the Order to focus on recovering from the event rather than on their immediate tax affairs. 8 I consider an Order also allows Inland Revenue to best use its resources in terms of specifying where tax relief should be directed at, and applying Inland Revenue’s existing relief discretions. 9 The Order authorises Inland Revenue to remit use-of-money interest incurred by taxpayers whose ability to pay their tax on time was significantly adversely affected by the recent severe weather fronts. The event is defined as the severe weather fronts that crossed New Zealand from 11 July to 31 July 2022. Relief under the Order is directed at communities in Northland, Gisborne district, Wairoa district, Canterbury, and Otago. The Order will commence on its notification in the Gazette and will expire on 30 September 2022. Timing and 28-day rule 10 A waiver of the 28-day rule is sought, to enable the regulations to take effect from the day after their notification in the Gazette. Exercise of this power is taxpayer-friendly, and is not expected to affect anyone negatively. Further, the sooner the relief is effective the more certain taxpayers’ positions will be, and Inland Revenue’s processing of relief applications will be more efficient. Once in force, the Order will enable Inland Revenue to remit interest charged prior to the making of the Order. Compliance 11 Section 183ABA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides the statutory authority for the Governor-General to declare an event to be an emergency event and qualify for the making of an Order in Council. This event meets the Tax Administration Act’s qualifying criteria. 12 The Order in Council complies with the following: The principles of the Treaty of Waitangi Not applicable The rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993 Not applicable The principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993 Not applicable Relevant international standards and obligations Not applicable The Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee Compliant 3 Regulations Review Committee 13 Officials believe there are no grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Order in Council to the attention of the House under Standing Order 327 (2020). Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 14 The regulations have been certified by the Parliamentary Counsel Office as being in order for submission to Cabinet, except that they will come into force earlier than the 28 th day after the date of their notification in the Gazette. Impact Analysis Regulatory Impact Assessment 15 The Treasury's Regulatory Impact Analysis team has determined that this proposal is exempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statement on the grounds that it is intended to manage the direct actions taken to protect the public in response to a declared emergency event and intended to temporarily defer or extend legislative deadlines where a declared emergency has made compliance with the existing legislative requirements impossible, impractical or unreasonably burdensome. Climate Implications of Policy Assessment 16 The Climate Implications of Policy Assessment (CIPA) team has been consulted and confirms that the CIPA requirements do not apply to this proposal as the threshold for significance is not met. Publicity 17 I will announce Inland Revenue’s ability to remit use-of-money interest once the Order is in effect and notified in the Gazette. Proactive Release 18 I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers in whole within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Consultation 19 Inland Revenue officials have consulted with the Treasury and the Ministry for Primary Industries. They agree with the proposal in this paper. Federated Farmers were also consulted and agree with the proposed Order. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that Cabinet: 1 Note that the Tax Administration Act 1994 authorises the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to remit interest charged to taxpayers for late payment of tax, where the late payment was due to the effects of an emergency event declared by Order in Council. 4 2 Note that the event described as the July Adverse Weather Event meets the criteria specified in the Tax Administration Act 1994 for the declaration of an emergency event. 3 Authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Tax Administration (July Adverse Weather Event) Order 2022. 4 Note that this remission of interest is not expected to have an effect on fiscal baselines. 5 Note that a waiver of the 28-day rule is sought on the grounds that the exercise of the power will only positively affect taxpayers, and the power it confers will apply to events before the making of the Order. 6 Agree to the waiver of the 28-day rule so that the regulations can come into force after their notification in the Gazette.

1 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee TAX ADMINISTRATION (EXTENSION OF NOTIFICATION DEADLINE FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDITS) ORDER 2022 Proposal 1 This paper seeks the Cabinet Legislation Committee’s agreement to submit an Order in Council making the Tax Administration (Extension of Notification Deadline for Research and Development Tax Credits) Order 2022 to the Executive Council. 2 The Order would extend the deadline that some R&D businesses have for notifying Inland Revenue that there have been no material changes for their business for the 2021–22 income year to 30 April 2023. Relation to Government Priorities 3 This Order in Council is recommended to help administer the Research and Development Tax Incentive (RDTI), which provides a 15% tax credit to businesses for eligible R&D expenditure in New Zealand. 4 The Labour 2020 Election Manifesto indicated a continuation of investment in innovation through the RDTI as part of “preparing for the future” in Labour’s recovery plan. The Government also has a goal of increasing R&D expenditure to two percent of GDP by 2027. Background 5 Businesses enrolled in the RDTI normally require a general approval from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to be eligible for an R&D tax credit. A business that is approved for multiple years is currently required to notify Inland Revenue each year to confirm that there have been no material changes for their business for the relevant income year. 6 This requirement creates compliance costs for businesses as it obliges them to proactively contact Inland Revenue to confirm that their approval is still valid. It is an administratively intensive requirement for Inland Revenue to enforce as it requires manual checking of web messages by staff. 7 Consequently, I have agreed that a remedial amendment to remove this requirement should be included in the upcoming omnibus taxation Bill to be introduced in August 2022. It is more sensible to require businesses to notify Inland Revenue when there is a material change in their business rather than when there is not one. 2qddsziq5 2022-09-07 13:48:53 1. 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 8 This change is expected to be in force from March 2023. This means that the existing notification requirement is in force until then, and the RDTI cannot be processed for businesses that did not make the requisite notification on time for the 2021–22 income year (the first year the requirement is applicable for). The deadline for making the notification is normally the seventh day of the second month after the end of the income year (for example, a 31 March balance date taxpayer would be required to provide this notice by 7 May 2022 for the 2021–22 income year). Order in Council 9 The existing deadline for making the notification is problematic for the 2021–22 income year. For some taxpayers, it was impossible to make the notification on time even if they were willing to and knew they needed to do so. This is because of delays in the processing of general approvals for some businesses, which meant they could not confirm that there have no material changes for their business (relative to an approval that they did not yet have). 10 The Tax Administration Act 1994 includes a broad power to extend the time by Order in Council for doing something under the Act. This would include extending the deadline for businesses in the RDTI to make this notification. 11 I therefore recommend the making of the Tax Administration (Extension of Notification Deadline for Research and Development Tax Credits) Order 2022. This Order in Council would extend the deadline for the 2021–22 income year for notifying of no material changes for a business from the seventh day of the second month after the end of the income year to 30 April 2023. 12 Without this Order in Council, RDTI businesses that file their 2021–22 income tax return before March 2023 will experience a delay in receiving their tax credit. I consider that delaying R&D tax credits due to businesses not telling Inland Revenue that there have been no material changes for their business is harsh and counter to the intent of the RDTI, especially for businesses for which it was impossible to make the notification on time. Timing and 28-Day Rule 13 I propose that the Order in Council giving effect to this extension of an RDTI notification deadline comes into force on 1 September 2022. This would require a waiver of the 28-day rule for regulations coming into force. A waiver is sought on the grounds that it is in the best interests of both taxpayers and the Government. 14 Not waiving the 28-day rule will cause frustration for businesses that want to make the notification required of them but are legally prevented from doing so. The consequential delay in RDTI businesses being paid tax credits would add further frustration for affected businesses. No waiver would also mean Inland Revenue has to wait 28 extra days to fully process the income tax returns of affected RDTI businesses, which would increase the processing backlog. 2qddsziq5 2022-09-07 13:48:53 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Compliance 15 The Order in Council complies with: 15.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 15.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993; 15.3 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993; 15.4 relevant international standards and obligations; 15.5 the Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. Regulations Review Committee 16 There are no anticipated grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the attached Order in Council to the attention of the House. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 17 The Parliamentary Counsel Office has certified that the attached Order in Council is in order for submission to the Executive Council, provided that the 28-day rule is waived. Impact Analysis 18 The Treasury’s Regulatory Impact Analysis team has determined that the extension of the notification deadline for R&D tax credits is exempt from the requirements to provide a Regulatory Impact Statement on the grounds that it has no or only minor impacts on businesses, individuals, and not-for-profit entities. Communications 19 Inland Revenue will publish an article about this Order in Council in its Tax Information Bulletin. Proactive Release 20 I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers with appropriate redactions within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. 2qddsziq5 2022-09-07 13:48:53 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Consultation 21 Inland Revenue has been consulted in the preparation of this paper and agrees with its recommendations. The Treasury, Callaghan Innovation, and MBIE were informed of this paper. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Committee: 1 note that the Research and Development Tax Incentive (RDTI) currently requires businesses to notify Inland Revenue that there have been no material changes for their business for the relevant income year if they have general approval for multiple income years; 2 note that the normal deadline for making the notification referred to in recommendation 1 is the seventh day of the second month after the end of the income year; 3 note that the Tax Administration Act 1994 includes a broad power to extend the time by Order in Council for doing something under the Act; 4 note that the Tax Administration (Extension of Notification Deadline for Research and Development Tax Credits) Order 2022 would extend the deadline in recommendation 2 until 30 April 2022 for the 2021–22 income year; 5 agree that the Tax Administration (Extension of Notification Deadline for Research and Development Tax Credits) Order 2022 give effect to this extension of the deadline for making the requisite notification under the RDTI; 6 note that a waiver of the 28-day rule is sought: 6.1 so that the Tax Administration (Extension of Notification Deadline for Research and Development Tax Credits) Order 2022 can come into force on 1 September 2022; 6.2 on the grounds that not waiving the rule will: 6.2.1 cause frustration for RDTI businesses that want to comply with the law but are unable to for a further 28 days, resulting in a delay of receipt of R&D tax credits; and 6.2.2 increase the RDTI processing backlog for Inland Revenue due to not being able to process notifications for a further 28 days; 2qddsziq5 2022-09-07 13:48:53 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 7 agree to waive the 28-day rule so that the Tax Administration (Extension of Notification Deadline for Research and Development Tax Credits) Order 2022 can come into force on 1 September 2022; 8 authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Tax Administration (Extension of Notification Deadline for Research and Development Tax Credits) Order 2022.

Page 1 of 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 28 June 2022 Minister of Revenue Extending the Commissioner’s COVID-19 administrative flexibility 1. This report seeks your agreement to extend the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s (“Commissioner”) discretionary power to provide administrative flexibility for taxpayers affected by COVID-19 for one year, via an Order in Council. Background 2. The discretionary power allows the Commissioner to vary time related requirements (timelines, due dates, deadlines, and time periods), procedural or administrative requirements when taxpayers are likely to be impacted by COVID-19 and compliance with current requirements is impossible, unreasonable, or impractical. 3. This discretionary power was introduced on 30 April 2020 as part of a range of response measures to COVID-19. 1 The power was limited in application to an 18- month period ending 30 September 2021, unless extended by an Order in Council upon recommendation of the Minister of Revenue. This power was extended from 1 October 2021 to 30 September 2022. Officials recommended this initial extension to enable the Commissioner to respond quickly in the event taxpayers are further impacted by COVID-19 (IR2021/303 refers). 4. The purpose of the power is to provide more flexibility for taxpayers to comply with their tax obligations where they have been affected by COVID-19. The legislation enables the Commissioner to issue a COVID-19 variation to provide flexibility in the compliance obligations under the Inland Revenue Acts. Where taxpayers comply with a variation, they are treated as if they complied with the requirement set out in legislation. 5. When a taxpayer applies for a COVID-19 variation, the Commissioner must first consider whether the issue can be resolved using existing legislation, including the Commissioner’s care and management discretion. If the issue cannot be resolved, the Commissioner may only issue a variation if compliance is impossible, impractical, or unreasonable in circumstances arising from the imposition of COVID- 19 response measures or as a consequence of COVID-19. 6. Any COVID-19 variation issued by the Commissioner is optional for taxpayers to apply, taxpayers may choose to comply with the requirements set out in legislation rather than any variation issued. This is to ensure that taxpayers are not worse-off from the variation. 7. Since the power has been in force, the Commissioner has issued 12 variations in 2020, six variations in 2021 and 18 variations in 2022. Requests for additional variations would be declined if they are able to be resolved using the Commissioner’s care and management powers. 8. Generally, variations are targeted and time limited. For example, a variation published on 23 June 2022 extended the due date for filing statements of R&D loss 1 The COVID-19 Response (Taxation and Other Regulatory Urgent Measures) Act 2020 inserted the discretionary power into the Tax Administration Act 1994. IR2022/328: Extending the Commissioner’s COVID-19 administrative flexibility. Page 2 of 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] tax credits and R&D repayment tax from 1 April 2022 until 31 August 2022. The variation is limited to taxpayers for whom the impact of COVID-19 response measures or the consequences of COVID-19 had a material impact on them not filing the statements on time. An extension 9. The discretionary power may be extended by Order in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue, if it is reasonably necessary in the circumstances because of the continuing impact of COVID-19 related measures or circumstances. 10. We recommend the power be extended for another year from 1 October 2022 to 30 September 2023. We think it is necessary given the continued impact of COVID-19 and the threat of new variants in the future. 11. Although there is no longer such pressing urgency for variations, the continued impact of COVID-19 on taxpayer’s compliance obligations remains, demonstrated through the Commissioner recently issuing a variation on 23 June 2022. Retaining the power also ensures the Commissioner will be able to respond quickly in the event of future outbreaks and/or lockdowns which may impact taxpayer’s ability to meet their obligations. Administrative implications 12. There are no significant administrative implications, as the process for assessing and implementing variations under the COVID-19 administrative flexibility measure is already in place. Fiscal implications 13. Fiscal costs for the COVID-19 variation power are unquantifiable in advance because it depends how the power is exercised. However, the fiscal impact of the variations issued so far have been minor or immaterial as most variations related to the timing allowed for elections or applications to occur. 14. Each fiscal impact depends on the period affected by the variation. For example, two very similar GST variations had varying fiscal impacts depending on whether the variations effectively crossed fiscal years. 15. One variation allowed GST-registered persons to elect to change from six-monthly filing periods to one-monthly, enabling any refunds to be claimed earlier. In this instance the fiscal cost was approximately $4 million in 2019/20, as GST refunds were claimed in 2019/20 fiscal year instead of the 2020/21 year. In comparison, a similar GST variation had no June year fiscal impact for the government because it covered return periods which did not cross between June fiscal years. However, it was still beneficial from a taxpayers’ perspective because it allowed for refund claims earlier than would otherwise have occurred. Consultation 16.

This report asks you to consider and authorise the lodgement of the attached draft Cabinet Legislation Committee (LEG) paper. 2. The report seeks approval to submit an Order in Council to the Executive Council to extend the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s (Commissioner) discretionary power to provide administrative flexibility for taxpayers affected by COVID-19 by one year. Context and Background 3. You previously agreed to extend the COVID-19 administrative flexibility measure by one year (to 30 September 2023), and for officials to instruct the Parliamentary Counsel Office to draft an Order in Council to give effect to this change (IR2022/328 refers). 4. The administrative flexibility measure was introduced in 2020 in the Tax Administration Act 1994 to provide more flexibility for taxpayers to comply with their tax obligations where they have been affected by the impacts of COVID-19. 5. The measure was limited in application to an 18-month period ending 30 September 2021, unless extended by an Order in Council upon recommendation of the Minister of Revenue. The measure was extended from 30 September 2021 to 30 September 2022 to enable the Commissioner to act quickly in the event taxpayers are further impacted by COVID-19. We recommended the measure be extended for a further year given the continued impact of COVID-19 and the threat of new variants. 6. The Parliamentary Counsel Office are currently drafting the Tax Administration (COVID-19 Response Variations) Order 2022 (Order in Council). Officials have prepared a LEG paper for your consideration and, if you agree, for lodgement to the Cabinet Office by 18 August 2022, for consideration at the LEG meeting of 25 August 2022. Fiscal implications 7. The proposed change has an unqualifiable fiscal impact in advance because it depends how the power is exercised. However, the fiscal impact of the variations issued so far have been minor or immaterial as most variations related to the timing allowed for elections or applications to occur as noted in our previous report (IR2022/328 refers). Any administrative costs of implementing the change will be accommodated within existing processes for assessing and implementing COVID- 19 variations. Consultation 8.

1 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee Tax Administration (COVID-19 Response Variations) Order 2022 P roposal 1 This paper seeks the Committee’s agreement to extend the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s (Commissioner) COVID-19 administrative flexibility measure by one year (to September 2023). 2 It also seeks the Committee’s agreement to submit the Tax Administration (COVID-19 Response Variations) Order 2022, which gives effect to the extension, to the Executive Council. Policy 3 In 2020, greater administrative flexibility was granted to the Commissioner in the Tax Administration Act 1994 as part of the response to COVID-19. The discretion allows the Commissioner to vary time related requirements (such as timelines, due dates, deadlines, and time periods), procedural or administrative requirements when taxpayers are likely to be impacted by COVID-19 and compliance with current requirements is impossible, unreasonable, or impractical. 4 The discretionary power allows the Commissioner to issue variations to provide flexibility for taxpayers to comply with their tax obligations under the Inland Revenue Acts where they have been affected by COVID-19. Where taxpayers comply with a variation, they are treated as if they complied with the requirement set out in legislation. 5 Any COVID-19 variation issued by the Commissioner is optional for taxpayers to apply; taxpayers may choose to comply with the requirements set out in legislation rather than any variation issued. This is to ensure that taxpayers are not worse off from the variation. 6 This power was extended from 1 October 2021 to 30 September 2022 to enable the Commissioner to act quickly in the event taxpayers are further impacted by COVID-19. 7 This Order in Council extends the measure for a further year (from 1 October 2022 to 30 September 2023). This is necessary given the continued impact of COVID-19 and the threat of new variants in the future. 1lp2bvftqb 2022-09-07 13:45:49 3. 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 8 To implement this proposal, the Parliamentary Counsel Office has drafted the Tax Administration (COVID-19 Response Variations) Order 2022. This is in accordance with the empowering provision in the Tax Administration Act 1994. The section provides that the administrative flexibility measure was to be time limited to an 18-month period, unless extended by Order in Council upon the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue. Financial Implications 9 The fiscal costs for the administrative flexibility measure are unquantifiable in advance because it depends how the power is exercised. However, the fiscal impact of the variations issued so far have been minor or immaterial as most variations related to the timing allowed for elections or applications to occur. Timing and 28-Day Rule 10 I propose that the extension of the Commissioner’s administrative flexibility measure under section 6I of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is extended by one year (to 30 September 2023) and applies 28 days after the gazetting date. The Order would then be made in accordance with the rule that a regulation must not come into force, until at least 28 days after the public have been notified in the New Zealand Gazette. Compliance 11 The Order complies with: 11.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 11.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993; 11.3 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 2020; 11.4 relevant international standards and obligations; and 11.5 the Legislation Guidelines, which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. 12 Section 6H of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that the measure may be extended upon the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue if it is reasonably necessary in the circumstances because of the continuing impact of COVID-19 related measures or circumstances. 13 I consider that the discretionary power should be extended as it is necessary given the continued impact of COVID-19 and the threat of new variants. I consider the statutory requisites have been met. 1lp2bvftqb 2022-09-07 13:45:49 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Regulations Review Committee 14 There are no anticipated grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Order in Council to the attention of the House under Standing Order 319. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 15 The Parliamentary Counsel Office has certified that the Order in Council is in order for submission to Cabinet. Impact Analysis 16 The Treasury's Regulatory Impact Analysis Team has determined that the proposal to extend the Commissioner of Inland Revenue's discretionary power (section 6I of the Tax Administration Act 1994) to provide administrative flexibility for taxpayers affected by COVID-19 by one year (to September 2023) is exempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statement on the grounds that it has no or only minor impact on businesses, individuals, and not-for-profit entities. Communications 17 The new Order in Council will be published in the New Zealand Gazette and on Inland Revenue’s website. Inland Revenue will also publish an article about these changes in its Tax Information Bulletin. Proactive Release 18 I propose to release the policy report and this Cabinet paper in full, shortly following the notification of the signed Order in Council in the New Zealand Gazette, subject to redactions under the Official Information Act 1982. Consultation 19 The Treasury have been consulted on the extension. The Treasury and the Parliamentary Counsel Office have been informed of the contents of this paper. Recommendations I recommend that the Cabinet Legislation Committee: 1 agree to the extension of the Commissioner’s administrative flexibility measure from 1 October 2022 to 30 September 2023; 2 note that the Tax Administration (COVID-19 Response Variations) Order 2022 will give effect to the decision referred to in recommendation 1 above; and 1lp2bvftqb 2022-09-07 13:45:49 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 3 authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Tax Administration (COVID-19 Response Variations) Order 2022.

1 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee REGULAR DATASET COLLECTION FROM PAYMENT SERVICE PROVIDERS (LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL) Proposal 1 This paper seeks the Cabinet Legislation Committee’s agreement to submit the Tax Administration (Regular Collection of Bulk Data) Regulations 2022 to the Executive Council. 2 The Order in Council will allow for the regular collection of datasets from payment service providers. Policy 3 Inland Revenue has been periodically collecting large datasets on merchant sales data from a few major payment service providers operating in New Zealand for risk analysis and to facilitate taxpayer compliance. There were concerns that the legislation granting the power for this dataset collection was not intended to allow repeat collection of datasets. 4 In 2019, new legislation was enacted to address the need for the regular collection of large datasets. On 10 March 2021, Cabinet authorised the drafting of the Order in Council for the regular dataset collection from payment service providers by Parliamentary Counsel Office and agreed to the release of a discussion document and the draft Order in Council for consultation (DEV-21- MIN-0020 refers). 5 The Order will enable Inland Revenue to collect datasets from payment service providers on a regular basis. The datasets consist of aggregated data of merchants’ sales and are used to detect non-compliance including hidden economy activity. The datasets are used for risk analysis and to ensure compliance through education, marketing and targeted campaigns including investigation of high-risk cases. Macro-analysis of this information is also used in research and to inform policy. 6 Consultation took place between 6 July 2021 and 20 August 2021 with feedback received from 12 stakeholders (including the Privacy Commissioner). Final policy recommendations were made by officials based on this feedback with attempts to reduce the compliance costs for payment service providers where appropriate. 2qddsziq5 2022-11-18 15:34:04 Doc 4 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 7 On 28 September 2022, the Cabinet Economic Development Committee (DEV- 22-MIN-0229 refers): 7.1 invited the Minister of Revenue to instruct the Parliamentary Counsel Office to make the appropriate amendments to the draft Order in Council; and 7.2 agreed to all recommended final policy changes to be made to the draft Order in Council. 8 The Parliamentary Counsel Office have amended the draft Order in Council that was released for consultation with the final policy changes. 9 This paper seeks authorisation to submit the Order in Council to Cabinet and the Executive Council. Financial Implications 10 It is expected that the financial impacts of the implementation of this Order in Council will be fiscally neutral. This is because the implementation only changes the legislative mechanism through which this information is collected. Timing and 28-Day Rule 11 I propose that the Tax Administration (Regular Collection of Bulk Data) Regulations 2022 applies 28 days after the gazetting date. The Order would then be made in accordance with the rule that a regulation must not come into force, until at least 28 days after the public have been notified in the New Zealand Gazette. Compliance 12 The Order complies with: 12.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 12.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993; 12.3 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 2020; 12.4 relevant international standards and obligations; and 12.5 the Legislation Guidelines, which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. 13 Section 17L of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) provides the ability to make regulations that authorise the Commissioner to collect bulk information in the form of datasets, if the collection of the information is considered necessary or relevant for a purpose relating to the administration or enforcement of a matter. 2qddsziq5 2022-11-18 15:34:04 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 14 I consider that the proposed Order in Council meets the requirements of section 17L of the TAA because the efficient and effective collection and use of information helps to support voluntary compliance with tax obligations. The regulations also ensure that compliance and administration costs are minimised. The proposal will also minimise the opportunities for avoidance and evasion. 15 The quantity of information that will be collected under this Order is no more than necessary for the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. The information that will be collected will not impinge on the privacy of individuals as no individual transaction data will be collected, only aggregated data of all merchant sales within a monthly timeframe. 16 Consultation has taken place in accordance with the Tax Administration Act 1994 including consultation with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner. Regulations Review Committee 17 There are no anticipated grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Order to the attention of the House. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 18 The Parliamentary Counsel Office has certified that the Order in Council is in order for submission to Cabinet. Impact Analysis 19 The Quality Assurance panel at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Regular dataset collection from payment service providers Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) prepared by Inland Revenue and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Regulatory Impact Assessment meets the quality assurance criteria. Communications 20 I will make an announcement on the enactment of the Order in Council advising that information can now be collected from payment service providers. 21 Inland Revenue will update their website to outline the details of the Order in Council and its application. The update will outline how a PSP can apply for an exemption from the reporting requirements that are outlined in the Order. 22 Inland Revenue will also publish an article about these changes in its Tax Information Bulletin following enactment and will be engaging with affected payment service providers. Proactive Release 23 I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers with appropriate redactions within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. 2qddsziq5 2022-11-18 15:34:04 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Consultation 24 The Treasury, the Parliamentary Counsel Office, and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet have been informed of the contents of this paper.

This report seeks your agreement to raise the prescribed interest rate used to calculate fringe benefit tax (FBT) on low-interest loans provided by employers to employees from 4.78% to 6.71%. This change is required to align the rate with current market interest rates. The new rate should apply from the beginning of January 2023. 2. An Order in Council is required to make this change. Therefore, this report also seeks your approval for the Parliamentary Counsel Office (PCO) to draft an Order in Council to raise the rate. As changes to the FBT prescribed interest rate have become a routine matter, we consider that your approval is sufficient for PCO to draft the Order. PCO can provide the Order in Council directly to Cabinet Office. Background 3. The FBT rules tax non-cash benefits provided to employees. Included in the definition of ‘fringe benefit’ is any employment-related loan on which the employer is charging a rate of interest that is below the market rate. The interest differential is taxable. A prescribed rate set by regulations is used as a proxy for the market rate of interest, to save employers the compliance costs associated with determining the market rate relevant to loans that they have provided to their employees. 4. The Income Tax Act 2007 permits the making of regulations by Order in Council to set a prescribed rate of interest for the purpose of calculating FBT on low-interest loans. Once a rate is set, it remains the prescribed rate until changed by a subsequent Order in Council. 5. The prescribed interest rate was last changed from 4.50% to 4.78%, effective from the quarter beginning 1 July 2022. Determination of appropriate prescribed rate 6. The Reserve Bank conducts a survey of first mortgage housing interest rates on the last day of each month, producing a ‘floating first mortgage new customer housing rate’. The rate is calculated as the weighted average interest rate for the surveyed institutions, the weightings being based on each institution’s share of total lending for housing purposes. This Reserve Bank series is a suitable indication of general market interest rates and is therefore used as the benchmark for setting the FBT prescribed rate. 7. The floating first mortgage new customer housing rate of 6.71% for August 2022 indicates that the current FBT prescribed rate of 4.78% is lower than the prevailing market rate. 8. Longstanding administrative policy has been to adjust the FBT prescribed interest rate when there has been a change in the floating first mortgage new customer housing rate of 20 basis points or more. We recommend that the rate be adjusted to ensure that there is no long-term misalignment. In Confidence IR2022/454: Increase in FBT prescribed rate of interest Page 2 of 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Process issues 9. When regulations are made declaring the rate of interest applying to employment- related loans, they apply to quarters starting from a date at least 1 month following the date the regulations were made. 10. The Order in Council should be referred to the Cabinet Office by 3 November 2022, so that it can be considered by the Cabinet Legislation Committee on 10 November 2022. PCO has arranged for the Order in Council to be provided directly to the Cabinet Office. 11. A Cabinet paper recommending that Cabinet approve the Order in Council and authorise its submission to the Executive Council is attached. We recommend that you lodge the Cabinet paper with the Cabinet Office by 10am on Thursday 3 November 2022. Revenue implications 12. Raising the FBT prescribed interest rate to 6.71% will increase the amount of FBT that will be collected over 2022/23 by approximately $1.83 million. This amount is estimated to increase to $3.66 million per year over the current forecast period (2023/24 to 2025/26). $millions increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 & out years FBT revenue 2.54 5.08 5.08 5.08 5.08 Company tax (0.71) (1.42) (1.42) (1.42) (1.42) Net Revenue 1.83 3.66 3.66 3.66 3.66 Impact on Operating balance 1.83 3.66 3.66 3.66 3.66 13.

1 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee INCOME TAX (FRINGE BENEFIT TAX, INTEREST ON LOANS) AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2022 (NO 2) Proposal 1 This paper seeks the Cabinet Legislation Committee’s agreement to submit an Order in Council amending the Income Tax (Fringe Benefit Tax, Interest on Loans) Amendment Regulations 2022 (No 2) to the Executive Council. The proposal is to increase the FBT prescribed interest rate for low-interest, employment-related loans from 4.78% to 6.71%, in line with an increase in market interest rates. 2 Changes to the prescribed interest rate are a routine matter and do not involve a change of policy. The methodology used for setting the rate has been applied consistently since the early 1990s. Policy 3 The fringe benefit tax (FBT) rules tax non-cash benefits provided to employees. Included in the definition of ‘fringe benefit’ is any employment-related loan on which the employer is charging a rate of interest that is below the market rate. The interest differential is taxable. A prescribed rate set by regulations is used as a proxy for the market rate of interest to save employers the compliance costs associated with determining the market rate relevant to loans that they have provided to their employees. 4 The Income Tax Act 2007 (‘the Act’) allows regulations to be made to set the prescribed rate. Once a rate is set, it remains the prescribed rate of interest until changed by a subsequent Order in Council. The current FBT prescribed rate, which has applied since 1 July 2022, is 4.78%. 5 The prescribed rate of interest is based on a Reserve Bank survey of first mortgage housing interest rates on the last day of each month (‘floating first mortgage new customer housing rate’). This is calculated as the weighted average interest rate for the surveyed institutions, the weightings being based on each institution’s share of total lending for housing purposes. This Reserve Bank series is selected as the benchmark for setting the FBT prescribed rate because it is seen as a good indication of market interest rates. 2qddsziq5 2022-11-24 10:11:35 Doc 2 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Timing 6 The Act provides that when regulations to change the prescribed rate of interest are made, they apply to quarters starting at least one month following the date the regulations were made by the Governor General by Order in Council. Regulations that reduce the rate may apply for the current quarter if made at least one month before the end of the quarter. 7 In accordance with the Act, I recommend that the regulations to raise the rate have effect from 1 January 2023 – the beginning of the next quarter. No waiver of the 28-day rule is required. Compliance 8 The regulations comply with each of the following, where applicable: 8.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi Not applicable 8.2 the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 Not applicable 8.3 the Human Rights Act 1993 Not applicable 8.4 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993 Not applicable 8.5 relevant international standards and obligations Not applicable 8.6 the Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition) which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee Complies Regulations Review Committee 9 Officials consider that there are no grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Order in Council to the attention of the House under Standing Order 319. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 10 The regulations have been certified by Parliamentary Counsel as being in order for submission to Cabinet. Impact Analysis 11 The proposal is of a minor and mechanical nature and does not substantially alter existing arrangements. Therefore, a regulatory impact assessment is not required. 12 The proposal will not increase compliance costs as it is simply a change in the prescribed interest rate. 2qddsziq5 2022-11-24 10:11:35 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Publicity 13 Inland Revenue will publish an article about these changes in its Tax Information Bulletin. Proactive Release 14 I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers in whole within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions.

This report seeks your agreement to raise the prescribed interest rate used to calculate fringe benefit tax (FBT) on low-interest loans provided by employers to employees from 4.78% to 6.71%. This change is required to align the rate with current market interest rates. The new rate should apply from the beginning of January 2023. 2. An Order in Council is required to make this change. Therefore, this report also seeks your approval for the Parliamentary Counsel Office (PCO) to draft an Order in Council to raise the rate. As changes to the FBT prescribed interest rate have become a routine matter, we consider that your approval is sufficient for PCO to draft the Order. PCO can provide the Order in Council directly to Cabinet Office. Background 3. The FBT rules tax non-cash benefits provided to employees. Included in the definition of ‘fringe benefit’ is any employment-related loan on which the employer is charging a rate of interest that is below the market rate. The interest differential is taxable. A prescribed rate set by regulations is used as a proxy for the market rate of interest, to save employers the compliance costs associated with determining the market rate relevant to loans that they have provided to their employees. 4. The Income Tax Act 2007 permits the making of regulations by Order in Council to set a prescribed rate of interest for the purpose of calculating FBT on low-interest loans. Once a rate is set, it remains the prescribed rate until changed by a subsequent Order in Council. 5. The prescribed interest rate was last changed from 4.50% to 4.78%, effective from the quarter beginning 1 July 2022. Determination of appropriate prescribed rate 6. The Reserve Bank conducts a survey of first mortgage housing interest rates on the last day of each month, producing a ‘floating first mortgage new customer housing rate’. The rate is calculated as the weighted average interest rate for the surveyed institutions, the weightings being based on each institution’s share of total lending for housing purposes. This Reserve Bank series is a suitable indication of general market interest rates and is therefore used as the benchmark for setting the FBT prescribed rate. 7. The floating first mortgage new customer housing rate of 6.71% for August 2022 indicates that the current FBT prescribed rate of 4.78% is lower than the prevailing market rate. 8. Longstanding administrative policy has been to adjust the FBT prescribed interest rate when there has been a change in the floating first mortgage new customer housing rate of 20 basis points or more. We recommend that the rate be adjusted to ensure that there is no long-term misalignment. In Confidence IR2022/454: Increase in FBT prescribed rate of interest Page 2 of 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Process issues 9. When regulations are made declaring the rate of interest applying to employment- related loans, they apply to quarters starting from a date at least 1 month following the date the regulations were made. 10. The Order in Council should be referred to the Cabinet Office by 3 November 2022, so that it can be considered by the Cabinet Legislation Committee on 10 November 2022. PCO has arranged for the Order in Council to be provided directly to the Cabinet Office. 11. A Cabinet paper recommending that Cabinet approve the Order in Council and authorise its submission to the Executive Council is attached. We recommend that you lodge the Cabinet paper with the Cabinet Office by 10am on Thursday 3 November 2022. Revenue implications 12. Raising the FBT prescribed interest rate to 6.71% will increase the amount of FBT that will be collected over 2022/23 by approximately $1.83 million. This amount is estimated to increase to $3.66 million per year over the current forecast period (2023/24 to 2025/26). $millions increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 & out years FBT revenue 2.54 5.08 5.08 5.08 5.08 Company tax (0.71) (1.42) (1.42) (1.42) (1.42) Net Revenue 1.83 3.66 3.66 3.66 3.66 Impact on Operating balance 1.83 3.66 3.66 3.66 3.66 13.

Agreed/Not agreed Paul Fulton Principal Policy Advisor Policy and Strategy Hon David Parker Minister of Revenue / /2022 1 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee INCOME TAX (FRINGE BENEFIT TAX, INTEREST ON LOANS) AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2022 (NO 2) Proposal 1 This paper seeks the Cabinet Legislation Committee’s agreement to submit an Order in Council amending the Income Tax (Fringe Benefit Tax, Interest on Loans) Amendment Regulations 2022 (No 2) to the Executive Council. The proposal is to increase the FBT prescribed interest rate for low-interest, employment-related loans from 4.78% to 6.71%, in line with an increase in market interest rates. 2 Changes to the prescribed interest rate are a routine matter and do not involve a change of policy. The methodology used for setting the rate has been applied consistently since the early 1990s. Policy 3 The fringe benefit tax (FBT) rules tax non-cash benefits provided to employees. Included in the definition of ‘fringe benefit’ is any employment-related loan on which the employer is charging a rate of interest that is below the market rate. The interest differential is taxable. A prescribed rate set by regulations is used as a proxy for the market rate of interest to save employers the compliance costs associated with determining the market rate relevant to loans that they have provided to their employees. 4 The Income Tax Act 2007 (‘the Act’) allows regulations to be made to set the prescribed rate. Once a rate is set, it remains the prescribed rate of interest until changed by a subsequent Order in Council. The current FBT prescribed rate, which has applied since 1 July 2022, is 4.78%. 5 The prescribed rate of interest is based on a Reserve Bank survey of first mortgage housing interest rates on the last day of each month (‘floating first mortgage new customer housing rate’). This is calculated as the weighted average interest rate for the surveyed institutions, the weightings being based on each institution’s share of total lending for housing purposes. This Reserve Bank series is selected as the benchmark for setting the FBT prescribed rate because it is seen as a good indication of market interest rates. 2qddsziq5 2022-11-24 10:11:35 Doc 2 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Timing 6 The Act provides that when regulations to change the prescribed rate of interest are made, they apply to quarters starting at least one month following the date the regulations were made by the Governor General by Order in Council. Regulations that reduce the rate may apply for the current quarter if made at least one month before the end of the quarter. 7 In accordance with the Act, I recommend that the regulations to raise the rate have effect from 1 January 2023 – the beginning of the next quarter. No waiver of the 28-day rule is required. Compliance 8 The regulations comply with each of the following, where applicable: 8.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi Not applicable 8.2 the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 Not applicable 8.3 the Human Rights Act 1993 Not applicable 8.4 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993 Not applicable 8.5 relevant international standards and obligations Not applicable 8.6 the Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition) which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee Complies Regulations Review Committee 9 Officials consider that there are no grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Order in Council to the attention of the House under Standing Order 319. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 10 The regulations have been certified by Parliamentary Counsel as being in order for submission to Cabinet. Impact Analysis 11 The proposal is of a minor and mechanical nature and does not substantially alter existing arrangements. Therefore, a regulatory impact assessment is not required. 12 The proposal will not increase compliance costs as it is simply a change in the prescribed interest rate. 2qddsziq5 2022-11-24 10:11:35 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Publicity 13 Inland Revenue will publish an article about these changes in its Tax Information Bulletin. Proactive Release 14 I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers in whole within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Consultation 15 The Treasury has been consulted in the preparation of this paper. Revenue implications 16 Raising the prescribed interest rate to 6.71% will increase the amount of FBT that will be collected by approximately $1.83 million over the 2022/23 year and $3.66 million per year over the remaining forecast period. Recommendations 17 I recommend that the Cabinet Legislation Committee: a. note that the regulations set the prescribed rate of interest for calculating the taxable benefit of low-int erest, employment-related loans; b. agree that, consistent with the results of the Reserve Bank’s survey for August 2022, the FBT prescribed rate of interest should be raised from 4.78% to 6.71% from the quarter commencing on 1 January 2023; c. note the following changes as a result of the decision in recommendation 2, with a corresponding impact on the operating balance: $millions increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 & out years FBT revenue 2.54 5.08 5.08 5.08 5.08 Company tax (0.71) (1.42) (1.42) (1.42) (1.42) Net Revenue 1.83 3.66 3.66 3.66 3.66 Impact on Operating balance 1.83 3.66 3.66 3.66 3.66 2qddsziq5 2022-11-24 10:11:35 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] d. note that the changes are forecast changes and do not have appropriation implications; e. authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Income Tax (Fringe Benefit Tax, Interest on Loans) Amendment Regulations 2022 (No 2).
