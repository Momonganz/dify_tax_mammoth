### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This determination relates to an arrangement (the Project) involving the finance, design, construction and on-going provision of operation and maintenance services in respect of the Facility by a limited partnership (the Partnership) under a public-private partnership agreement (the Project Agreement) with the Crown.  The Holding Partnership will be the sole limited partner in the Partnership, holding 100% of the Partnership.  The limited partners in the Holding Partnership are Limited Partner A, Limited Partner B and Limited Partner C.  This determination does not apply to Limited Partner C.
2.  The Project Agreement comprises three basic components:
    *   A design and construction phase (the D&C Phase) under which the Partnership agrees to design and construct the Facility for the Crown in consideration for a fixed lump-sum payment (the D&C Payment), payable on completion of the D&C Phase;
    *   A Facility Lease in which the Partnership and the Crown enter and under which the Partnership pays an amount representing the rental under the Facility Lease to the Crown (the Rental Prepayment); and
    *   An operations and maintenance phase (the O&M Phase) under which the Partnership will provide operation and maintenance services to the Crown over a 25 year term in consideration for monthly payments (the Unitary Charge).
3.  The Partnership will enter into:
    *   A Construction Agreement with a contractor (the Contractor), under which the Contractor will design and construct the Facility in consideration for monthly and milestone payments; and
    *   An Operation and Maintenance Contract (the O&M Contract) with a service provider (the Service Provider), under which the Service Provider will provide the on-going operation and maintenance (and other) services in consideration for monthly payments.
4.  The Partnership will raise external debt from a range of third party financiers (the Bank Debt).  Limited Partner C will provide a term debt facility (the Term Debt Facility) to the Partnership to supplement the Bank Debt.
5.  The Holding Partnership will receive funding from Limited Partner C during the D&C Phase in the form of a convertible debt instrument (the Convertible Note). 
6.  The Partnership will enter into Interest Rate Swaps in respect of the Bank Debt.
7.  The Facility Lease, O&M Phase of the Project Agreement, Construction Agreement and O&M Contract are all excepted financial arrangements.  The D&C Phase of the Project Agreement, Bank Debt, Term Debt Facility and Interest Rate Swaps are financial arrangements to which the Partnership is a party.  The Project, including all of these agreements, is a wider financial arrangement. 
8.  _Special Determination S27: Convertible Note in respect of a limited partnership interest_ applies to the Convertible Notes.  _Special Determination S28: Application of the financial arrangement rules to the D&C Phase in a public-private partnership_ applies to the D&C Payment under the D&C Phase.
9.  This determination prescribes:
    *   The amount of consideration that is solely attributable to the Facility Lease; 
    *   How the financial arrangements rules apply to the O&M Phase of the Project Agreement, the Construction Agreement and the O&M Contract;
    *   The method for spreading the payments made under the Bank Debt, Term Debt Facility and Interest Rate Swaps.

### 2\. Reference

1.  This determination is made under ss 90AC(1)(bb) and 90AC(1)(h) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This determination applies to the Partnership in respect of the Project (which is set out in detail in Private Rulings BR Prv 14/31 and BR Prv 14/32 issued on 25 July 2014), including the following arrangements:
    *   The D&C Phase of the Project Agreement, under which the Partnership agrees to design and construct the Facility for the Crown and will receive a fixed lump-sum payment (the D&C Payment) once the Facility is ready for operation (which is the subject of _Special Determination S28: Application of the financial arrangement rules to the D&C Phase of a public-private partnership_);
    *   The O&M Phase of the Project Agreement, under which the Partnership will provide on-going operation and maintenance services for 25 years to the Crown in consideration for monthly payments;
    *   The Facility Lease, under which the Partnership will lease the Facility from the Crown for 25 years and make the Rental Prepayment to the Crown. The Rental Prepayment will be equal to and will offset the D&C Payment;
    *   A Construction Agreement with the Contractor, under which the Contractor will design and construct the Facility in consideration for payments under the Construction Agreement;
    *   An O&M Contract with the Service Provider, under which the Service Provider will provide the on-going operation and maintenance (and other) services in consideration for payments under the O&M Contract;
    *   Bank Debt, under which the Partnership will borrow an agreed sum from external lenders for a term of 7 years from financial close of the Project (Financial Close). The Bank Debt will be a capitalising, interest only senior debt facility that converts to an amortising senior tranche on the Conversion Date. It is expected that the Bank Debt will be refinanced within 7 years of Financial Close, and every 7 years thereafter over the term of the Project. Under IFRS (as the standards apply at the date of this Determination), the Bank Debt (and any subsequent re-financings) will initially be recognised at fair value plus integral fees, and subsequently measured using the amortised cost using the effective interest method (regardless of whether or not hedge accounting is applied), and will not be treated as a hedge of another financial arrangement;
    *   Interest Rate Swaps, under which the Partnership will pay a fixed rate of interest to the swap counterparties, and receive a floating rate in return;
    *   Term Debt Facility under which the Partnership will borrow an agreed sum from Limited Partner C during the D&C Phase for a market rate of interest that converts to an amortising senior tranche on the Conversion Date.  The Term Debt Facility will be recognised under IFRS as a financial liability and initially recorded at fair value plus integral fees. Subsequent measurement will be at amortised cost using the effective interest method;
    *   Convertible Note issued by Holding Partnership to Limited Partner C for the duration of the D&C Phase.  On a single or several nominated dates during the D&C Phase, the Convertible Note will convert (by way of mandatory set off) into a partnership interest in Holding Partnership for Limited Partner C (which is the subject of _Special Determination S27: Convertible Note in respect of a limited partnership interest_).
2.  This determination is made subject to the following conditions:
    *   Limited Partner A and Limited Partner B use IFRS to prepare financial statements.
    *   Limited Partner A and Limited Partner B will recognise income derived from the Crown during the D&C Phase of the Project Agreement and the O&M Phase of the Project Agreement, and will deduct expenditure incurred in relation to the Facility Lease, Construction Agreement and O&M Contract, in each case, under the relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007 (outside of the financial arrangement rules).
    *   Limited Partner A and Limited Partner B do not use the fair value method for the Bank Debt or Term Debt Facility if the Bank Debt or Term Debt Facility is treated as a hedge of another financial arrangement under IFRS and uses for the other financial arrangement a method that is neither the IFRS financial reporting method nor the method required under _Determination G29: Agreements for Sale and Purchase of Property Denominated in Foreign Currency: Exchange Rate to Determine the Acquisition Price and method for spreading income and expenditure_.
    *   Limited Partner A and Limited Partner B will recognise income and expenditure in respect of the Convertible Note in the manner prescribed by _Special Determination S27: Convertible Note in respect of a limited partnership interest_.
    *   Limited Partner A and Limited Partner B will recognise income in respect of the D&C Payment in the manner prescribed by _Special Determination S28: Application of the financial arrangement rules to the D&C Phase in a public-private partnership_.
    *   The continued application of Private Rulings BR Prv 14/31 and BR Prv 14/32 issued on 25 July 2014.
    *   The executed documentation not being materially different from the final documentation that was provided to Inland Revenue on 23 July 2014 to the extent that it impacts on the scope of the determination or the application of the financial arrangement rules to the Applicants and the scope of the determination.

### 4\. Principle

1.  The Facility Lease is an excepted financial arrangement under s EW 5(9). Any amount that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement described in ss EW 5(2) to (16) is not an amount that is taken into account under the financial arrangement rules (s EW 6(2)). This determination specifies the amounts that are solely attributable to the Facility Lease that are not taken into account under the financial arrangement rules.
2.  The O&M Phase, Construction Agreement and O&M Contract are "short-term agreements for sale and purchase" as defined in s YA 1, and are excepted financial arrangements under s EW 5(22). Any amount that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement described in ss EW 5(17) to (25) that is part of a financial arrangement, is an amount that is taken into account under the financial arrangements rules (s EW 6(3)). This determination specifies that no amounts payable to or by the Partnership in respect of the O&M Phase, Construction Agreement and O&M Contract are required to be spread under the financial arrangements rules.
3.  The D&C Phase, Bank Debt, Interest Rate Swaps and Term Debt Facility are "financial arrangements" under s EW 3. This determination specifies that the payments made to or by Limited Partner A and Limited Partner B, in proportion to their share in Holding Partnership, under the Bank Debt, Interest Rate Swaps, and Term Debt Facility must be spread under the financial arrangements rules in accordance with this determination.
4.  This determination does not deal with the treatment of the D&C Payment or the Convertible Note which are subject to separate determinations (_Special Determination S27: Convertible Note in respect of a limited partnership interest_ and _Special Determination S28: Application of the financial arrangement rules to the D&C Phase in a public-private partnership_).

### 5\. Interpretation

1.  In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires-
    *   "IFRS" means International Financial Reporting Standards as defined in s YA 1.
    *   All legislative references in this determination are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated.

### 6\. Method

1.  The Rental Prepayment paid in respect of the Facility Lease, and the property interest granted to the Partnership under the Facility Lease, are solely attributable to the Facility Lease and are not taken into account under the financial arrangement rules.
2.  Limited Partner A and Limited Partner B are not required to spread any amounts under the financial arrangements rules in respect of the:
    *             O&M Phase of the Project Agreement;
    *             Construction Agreement;
    *             O&M Contract.
3.  The IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D may be used to allocate income and expenditure (other than "non-integral fees" as defined in s YA 1) over the term of the Bank Debt and none of the restrictions for application of the IFRS financial reporting method contained in s EW 15D(2B) apply_._
4.  The IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D may be used to allocate income and expenditure (other than "non-integral fees" as defined in s YA 1) in respect of any subsequent refinancing of the Bank Debt over the term of the relevant refinancing, provided that the terms of any such refinancing are materially similar to the terms of the Bank Debt. This determination paragraph does not affect Partner A or Partner B's obligation to perform a base price adjustment under s EW 31 at the time of each refinancing.
5.  The IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D may be used to allocate income and expenditure (other than "non-integral fees" as defined in s YA 1) over the term of the Term Debt Facility. None of the restrictions for the application of this reporting method in s EW 15D(2B) apply_._
6.  The expected value method in s EW 15F may be used to allocate income and expenditure (other than "non-contingent fees" as defined in s YA 1) over the term of the Interest Rate Swaps provided that the swaps are not treated as a hedge of other financial arrangements for which the "fair value method" is used.  None of the mandatory spreading methods in s EW 15H or s EW 15I apply to the Interest Rate Swaps.
7.  This determination does not affect Limited Partner A or Limited Partner B's obligation to perform base price adjustments under s EW 31 in respect of the Interest Rate Swaps.

### 7\. Example

This example illustrates the application of the method set out in this determination.

This example is based on the following parameters:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Commencement of D&C Phase | 1 July 2014 |
| Completion of D&C Phase | 30 June 2019 |
| Completion of O&M Phase | 30 June 2044 |
| D&C Payment from the Crown | $1,000 |
| Aggregate payments to the Contractor | ($850) |
| Facility Lease prepayment | ($1,000) |
| Monthly payments from the Crown during the O&M Phase | $30 |
| Monthly payments to the Service Provider | ($15) |
| Annual interest on the Bank Debt | ($85) |
| Annual interest on the Term Debt Facility | ($7) |
| Annual interest (and inflation adjustment) on the Convertible Note | ($15) |
| Annual net payments in respect of the Interest Rate Swaps | ($7) |

The Partnership is not required to spread any amounts under the financial arrangements rules in respect of the Facility Lease, O&M Phase of the Project Agreement, Construction Agreement and O&M Contract.

The amounts that must be spread under the financial arrangement rules are:

*   Interest on the Bank Debt calculated in accordance with the IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D;
*   Interest on the Term Debt Facility calculated in accordance with the IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D;
*   Payments in respect of the Interest Rate Swaps calculated in accordance with the expected value method in s EW 15F;
*   Amounts in respect of the Convertible Note as specified in _Special Determination S27:_ Convertible _Note in respect of a limited partnership interest;_
*   Amounts in respect of the D&C Payment as specified in _Special Determination S28: Application of the_ financial _arrangement rules to the D&C Phase in a public-private partnership._

This Determination is signed by me on the 25th day of July 2014.

This determination replaces Special Determination 29A: Application of the financial arrangements rules a public-private partnership (Inland Revenue, 2015) to take the 2020 Amendments into account. S29B | 17 December 2020 Page 1 of 10 Determination This determination may be cited as Special Determination S29B: Application of the Financial Arrangements Rules to a Public-Private Partnership. 1 Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) 1. This determination varies and replaces Special Determination S29: Application of the financial arrangements rules to a public-private partnership to take the 2020 Amendments into account. 2. This determination relates to an arrangement (the Project) involving the finance, design, construction and on-going provision of operation and maintenance services in respect of the Facility by the Partnership under a public-private partnership agreement (the Project Agreement) with the Crown. The Holding Partnership will be the sole limited partner in the Partnership, holding 100% of the Partnership. The limited partners in the Holding Partnership are Limited Partners A, B and C. This determination does not apply to Limited Partner C. 3. The Project Agreement comprises three basic components: a) a design and construction phase (the D&C Phase) under which the Partnership agrees to design and construct the Facility for the Crown in consideration for a fixed lump-sum payment (the Original D&C Payment), payable on completion of the D&C Phase; b) a Facility Lease in which the Partnership and the Crown enter and under which the Partnership pays an amount representing the rental under the Facility Lease to the Crown (the Rental Prepayment); and c) an operations and maintenance phase (the O&M Phase) under which the Partnership will provide operation and maintenance services to the Crown over a 25-year term in consideration for monthly payments (the Unitary Charge). 4. The Partnership has entered into: a) a Construction Agreement with a contractor (the Contractor), under which the Contractor will design and construct the Facility in consideration for monthly and milestone payments; and S29B | 17 December 2020 Page 2 of 10 b) an Operation and Maintenance Contract (the O&M Contract) with a service provider (the Service Provider), under which the Service Provider will provide the on-going operation and maintenance (and other) services in consideration for monthly payments. 5. Under the original arrangements:  The Partnership raised external debt from a range of third-party financiers (the Bank Debt) and Limited Partner C provided a term debt facility (the Term Debt Facility) to the Partnership to supplement the Bank Debt.  The Holding Partnership received funding from Limited Partner C during the D&C Phase in the form of a convertible debt instrument (the Convertible Note). Limited Partners A and B provided investment support during the D&C Phase in the form of a letter of credit to the external lenders.  The Partnership entered into Interest Rate Swaps in respect of the Bank Debt. 6. The Facility Lease, O&M Phase of the Project Agreement, Construction Agreement and O&M Contract are all excepted financial arrangements. The D&C Phase of the Project Agreement, Bank Debt, Term Debt Facility and Swaps are financial arrangements to which the Partnership is a party. The Project, including all of these agreements, is a wider financial arrangement. 7. In 2020, the Partnership and the Crown entered into the 2020 Amendments that (among other things):  extended the duration of the D&C Phase and provided for additional payments to be made for the design and construction work (the Additional D&C Payments); and  provided for certain Unitary Charge payments to be paid by the Crown to the Partnership before the O&M Phase commences. 8. The 2020 Amendments included various additional amendments to the Project, as described in the Private Rulings. 9. Special Determination S27B: Convertible Notes in Respect of a Limited Partnership applies to the Convertible Notes. Special Determination S28B: Application of the Financial Arrangement Rules to the Design and Construction Phase in a Public-Private Partnership applies to the D&C Phase. S29B | 17 December 2020 Page 3 of 10 10. This determination prescribes: a) the amount of consideration that is solely attributable to the Facility Lease; b) how the financial arrangements rules apply to the O&M Phase of the Project Agreement, the Construction Agreement and the O&M Contract; and c) the method for spreading the payments made under the Bank Debt, Term Debt Facility and Interest Rate Swaps. 2 Reference This determination is made under s 90AC(1)(bb) and (i ) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This determination varies and replaces Special Determination S29A: Application of the financial arrangements rules a public-private partnership. 3 Scope of determination 1. This determination applies to the Partnership in respect of the Project (which is set out in detail in the Private Rulings), including the following arrangements:  The D&C Phase of the Project Agreement, under which the Partnership agrees to design and construct the Facility for the Crown and will receive a fixed lump-sum payment (the Original D&C Payment) once the Facility is ready for operation and Additional D&C Payments periodically from the Effective Date of the 2020 Amendments. The D&C Phase is the subject of Special Determination S28B.  The O&M Phase of the Project Agreement, under which the Partnership will provide on-going operation and maintenance services for 25 years to the Crown in consideration for monthly payments.  The Facility Lease, under which the Partnership will lease the Facility from the Crown for 25 years and make the Rental Prepayment to the Crown. The Rental Prepayment will be equal to and will offset the Original D&C Payment.  A Construction Agreement with the Contractor, under which the Contractor will design and construct the Facility in consideration for payments under the Construction Agreement.  An O&M Contract with the Service Provider, under which the Service Provider will provide the on-going operation and maintenance (and other) services in consideration for payments under the O&M Contract. S29B | 17 December 2020 Page 4 of 10  Bank Debt, under which the Partnership borrowed an agreed sum from external lenders for a term of seven years from financial close of the Project (Financial Close). The Bank Debt was structured as a capitalising, interest only senior debt facility that converts to an amortising senior tranche on the Conversion Date that was expected to be refinanced within seven years of Financial Close, and every seven years thereafter over the term of the Project. Under IFRS (as the standards apply at the date of this Determination), the Bank Debt (and any subsequent re- financings) was initially recognised at fair value plus integral fees, and subsequently measured using the amortised cost using the effective interest method (regardless of whether hedge accounting is applied), and has not be treated as a hedge of another financial arrangement. Principal payments have commenced under the Bank Debt. With effect from the date the 2020 Amendments becomes effective, the Bank Debt will be extended for two years.  Interest Rate Swaps, under which the Partnership pays a fixed rate of interest to the swap counterparties, and receives a floating rate in return.  Term Debt Facility under which the Partnership borrowed an agreed sum from Limited Partner C during the D&C Phase for a market rate of interest that converts to an amortising senior tranche on the Conversion Date. The Term Debt Facility is recognised under IFRS as a financial liability and was initially recorded at fair value plus integral fees. Subsequent measurement will be at amortised cost using the effective interest method.  Convertible Notes issued by the Holding Partnership to Limited Partner C for the duration of the D&C Phase. On a single date or several nominated dates during the D&C Phase, the Convertible Notes will convert (by way of mandatory set off) into a partnership interest in Holding Partnership for Limited Partner C (which is the subject of Special Determination S27B. 2. In 2020, the Partnership and the Crown entered into the 2020 Amendments that (among other things):  extended the duration of the D&C Phase and provided for additional periodic payments to be made for the design and construction work (the Additional D&C Payments).  provided for certain Unitary Charge payments to be paid by the Crown to the Partnership before the O&M Phase commences. 3. The 2020 Amendments included various additional amendments to the Project, as described in the Private Rulings. S29B | 17 December 2020 Page 5 of 10 4. This determination is made subject to the following conditions:  Limited Partners A and B use IFRS to prepare financial statements.  Limited Partners A and B recognise income derived from the Crown during the D&C Phase of the Project Agreement and the O&M Phase of the Project Agreement, and will deduct expenditure incurred in relation to the Facility Lease, Construction Agreement and O&M Contract, in each case, under the relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007 (outside the financial arrangement rules).  Limited Partners A and B do not use the fair value method for the Bank Debt or Term Debt Facility if the Bank Debt or Term Debt Facility is treated as a hedge of another financial arrangement under IFRS and use for the other financial arrangement a method that is neither the IFRS financial reporting method nor the method required under Determination G29: Agreements for Sale and Purchase of Property Denominated in Foreign Currency: Exchange Rate to Determine the Acquisition Price and method for spreading income and expenditure (Inland Revenue, 1996).  Limited Partners A and B recognise income and expenditure in respect of the Convertible Notes in the manner prescribed by Special Determination S27B.  Limited Partners A and B recognise income in respect of the Original D&C Payment in the manner prescribed by Special Determination S28B.  The Private Rulings continue to apply. 4 Principle 1. The Facility Lease is an excepted financial arrangement under s EW 5(9). Any amount that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement described in s EW 5(2) to (16) is not an amount that is taken into account under the financial arrangement rules (s EW 6(2)). This determination specifies the amounts that are solely attributable to the Facility Lease that are not taken into account under the financial arrangement rules. 2. The O&M Phase, Construction Agreement and O&M Contract are “short-term agreements for sale and purchase” as defined in s YA 1, and are excepted financial arrangements under s EW 5(22). Any amount that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement described in s EW 5(17) to (25) that is part of a financial arrangement, is an amount that is taken into account under the financial arrangements rules (s EW 6(3)). This determination specifies that no amounts payable to or by the Partnership in respect of the O&M Phase, Construction Agreement and O&M Contract S29B | 17 December 2020 Page 6 of 10 are required to be spread under the financial arrangements rules in accordance with this Determination. 3. The D&C Phase, Bank Debt, Interest Rate Swaps and Term Debt Facility are ”financial arrangements” under s EW 3. This determination specifies that the payments made to or by Limited Partners A and B, in proportion to their share in the Holding Partnership, under the Bank Debt, Interest Rate Swaps and Term Debt Facility must be spread under the financial arrangements rules in accordance with this determination. 4. This determination does not deal with the treatment of the D&C Payment or the Convertible Notes, which are subject to separate determinations (Special Determination S27B and Special Determination S28B). 5. The 2020 Amendments do not impact on the application of the financial arrangements rules to any of the matters considered in this Determination. 5 Interpretation In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires:  All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated.  Capitalised terms have the same meaning as set out in the Project Agreement.  IFRS means International Financial Reporting Standards as defined in s YA 1.  Private Rulings means BR Prv 20/64 and BR Prv 20/65, issued on 17 December 2020, and includes any private rulings issued to replace those Rulings, provided that the change to the relevant Ruling does not affect the application of this Determination. 6 Method 1. The Rental Prepayment paid in respect of the Facility Lease, and the property interest granted to the Partnership under the Facility Lease, are solely attributable to the Facility Lease and are not taken into account under the financial arrangement rules. 2. Limited Partners A and B are not required to spread any amounts under the financial arrangements rules in accordance with this Determination in respect of the:  O&M Phase of the Project Agreement;  Construction Agreement; and  O&M Contract. S29B | 17 December 2020 Page 7 of 10 3. The IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D may be used to allocate income and expenditure (other than “non-integral fees” as defined in s YA 1) over the term of the Bank Debt, and none of the restrictions for application of the IFRS financial reporting method contained in s EW 15D(2B) apply. 4. The IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D may be used to allocate income and expenditure (other than “non-integral fees” as defined in s YA 1) in respect of any subsequent refinancing of the Bank Debt over the term of the relevant refinancing, provided the terms of any such refinancing are materially similar to the terms of the Bank Debt. This determination paragraph does not affect Limited Partner A’s or Limited Partner B’s obligation to perform a base price adjustment under s EW 31 at the time of each refinancing. 5. The IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D may be used to allocate income and expenditure (other than “non-integral fees” as defined in s YA 1) over the term of the Term Debt Facility. None of the restrictions for the application of this reporting method in s EW 15D(2B) apply. 6. The expected value method in s EW 15F may be used to allocate income and expenditure (other than “non-contingent fees” as defined in s YA 1) over the term of the Interest Rate Swaps, provided the swaps are not treated as a hedge of other financial arrangements for which the “fair value method” is used.

Spreading method to be used by a company and growers for a share incentive scheme and valuation of shares issued under the scheme
=================================================================================================================================

Determination S30 (Nov 2014) relates to a share scheme in which produce growers supply produce in return for an entitlement to receive shares in the company.

This determination may be cited as Special Determination S30: "Spreading method to be used by a company and growers for a share incentive scheme and valuation of shares issued under the scheme".

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This determination relates to a share incentive scheme (the Scheme) established by a company (Company A).
2.  Under the Scheme, eligible growers commit to exclusively supplying all of their produce through a company (Company B) for a three-year period and to appointing Company B as their agent for that period under the terms and conditions of a yearly agency/supply agreement between Company B and growers. Under the agency/supply agreement, the grower authorises Company B to act as the grower's agent in negotiating service arrangements (eg, packaging and cool storage) with Company A (via an annual Services Agreement (SA)) and to supply the grower's produce to marketers. Under the SA, Company A agrees to supply post-harvest services to the grower for which it is paid fees.
3.  In exchange for exclusively committing to supply produce through the Scheme, at the end of each growing season the grower will become entitled to the issue of shares in Company A for no cash consideration. The number of shares issued is based on the number of produce trays supplied by the grower during the supply season.
4.  The Arrangement is the subject of private ruling BR Prv 14/75 issued on 26 November 2014, and is fully described in that ruling.
5.  The Scheme is a financial arrangement under s EW 3 and an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services as defined in s YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The SA/supply agreement is a short-term agreement for sale and purchase as defined in s YA 1. The Scheme and the SA/supply agreement are, together, a wider financial arrangement.
6.  Company A has adopted International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) for the purpose of preparing its accounts.

### 2\. Reference

1.  This determination is made under s 90AC(1)(bb) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This determination applies to a share incentive scheme (the Scheme) for growers, established by a company (Company A).
2.  Under the Scheme, eligible growers commit to exclusively supplying all of their produce for a three year period and to appointing Company B as their agent for that period under the terms and conditions of a yearly agency/supply agreement between Company B and growers. Under the agency/supply agreement, the grower authorises Company B to act as the grower's agent in negotiating service arrangements (eg, packaging and cool storage) with Company A (via an annual Services Agreement (SA)) and to supply the grower's produce to marketers. Under the SA, Company A agrees to supply post-harvest services to the grower for which it is paid fees.
3.  In exchange for exclusively committing to supply produce through the Scheme, at the end of each growing season the grower will become entitled to the issue of shares in Company A for no cash consideration. The number of shares issued is based on the number of produce trays supplied by the grower during the supply season. Growers are allocated the greater of 10 cents worth of new shares for each tray supplied or a minimum holding. The issue price for the shares is based on the volume weighted average sale price of shares on the NZX Main Board over the 20 Business Days prior to 31 August of the applicable year.
4.  This determination applies to determine the spreading method to be used by Company A in respect of the Arrangement.
5.  This determination also applies when:
    *   Post-harvest services are provided by Company A to growers to determine the value of the services provided by Company A for the purposes of the financial arrangements rules;
    *   Shares are issued by Company A to growers to determine the value of the shares issued by Company A for the purposes of the financial arrangements rules.
6.  This determination is made subject to the following conditions:
    1.  Company A will continue to recognise income derived from the SA/supply agreement and deduct expenditure incurred in relation to the SA/supply agreement under the Income Tax Act (primarily Parts C and D) (other than amounts dealt with under this determination).

### 4\. Principle

1.  The Scheme is a financial arrangement under s EW 3 and an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services as defined in s YA 1. The Scheme and the SA/supply agreement are, together, a financial arrangement as defined in s EW 3.
2.  The SA/supply agreement is an excepted financial arrangement (a short-term agreement for sale and purchase) under s EW 5(22). Under s EW 6(3), all amounts solely attributable to that excepted financial arrangement are taken into account under the financial arrangements rules.
3.  Under s EW 15I, because the financial arrangement includes in part an excepted financial arrangement, s EW 15C(1) does not apply and one of the methods in s EW 15I(2) must be used to allocate an amount of income or expenditure to an income year.
4.  One of the methods available under s EW 15I(2)(c) is a determination made by the Commissioner.
5.  For the purposes of determining the consideration paid or payable under the financial arrangements rules, the value of the post-harvest services provided by Company A and the shares issued by Company A to growers must be established under s EW 32.
6.  Under s EW 32(6), the Commissioner is required to determine the value of the services and shares. Both Company A and growers are required to use this amount.
7.  The only amounts payable under the Arrangement that are required to be spread under the financial arrangements rules are the amounts allocated to the issue of the Company A shares to growers in each year of the Scheme.

### 5\. Interpretation

In this determination (and the Explanation), unless the context otherwise requires-

Words and expressions used (which have not been defined elsewhere within the determination ) have the same meaning as in s YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

"the Scheme" means Company A’s share incentive scheme.

"SA" means the Services Agreement between Company A and Company B.

"SA/supply agreement" means the SA between Company A and Company B and the agency/supply agreement between Company B and growers.

"IFRS financial reporting standard" means a New Zealand Equivalent International Financial Reporting Standard, in effect under the Financial Reporting Act 2013, and as amended from time to time or an equivalent standard issued in its place.

### 6\. Method

1.  The amounts to be spread in relation to the shares issued by Company A must be allocated to an income year by applying NZ IAS 32 (the method used by Company A for IFRS financial reporting purposes). NZ IAS 32 establishes principles for presenting financial instruments as liabilities or equity and for offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities. For IFRS financial reporting purposes, Company A will recognise the shares when they are issued by discounting Revenue in the P&L for 10 cents per tray for all trays packed in the season for eligible growers and increasing Equity on the Balance Sheet. In the event that a grower is allocated a greater number of shares than under the 10 cents per tray method (to reach a minimum shareholding) the accounts will reflect the actual value of the shares issued and the discount to Revenue.
2.  For the purposes of s EW 32(6), the value of the shares issued by Company A is equal to the issue price determined by reference to the volume weighted average sale price of shares on the NZX Main Board over the 20 Business Days prior to 31 August of the applicable supply season (subject to adjustment by the Board).
3.  For the purposes of s EW 32(6), the value of the post-harvest services provided by Company A is equal to the price paid for the services by growers.

### 7\. Example

This example illustrates the application of the method set out in this determination.

Company A provides a share incentive scheme to growers who commit to using its produce post-harvest services for a three year period. Growers are allocated the greater of 10 cents worth of new shares for each tray supplied or a minimum holding. Company A provides services to growers costing $50 in return for service fees of $100 in a year. At the end of the year, Company A issues shares to growers worth $10, based on the volume weighted average sale price of shares on the NZX Main Board over the 20 Business Days prior to 31 August of the applicable year.

Company A will use NZ IAS 32: Financial instruments to allocate income and expenditure relating to the issue of the shares. This means that, when the shares are issued, Company A will recognise a discount to Revenue in the P&L for 10 cents per tray for all trays packed in the season for eligible growers and an increase to Equity will be recognised in the Balance Sheet.

If a grower is allocated a minimum holding instead of 10 cents worth of new shares per tray, the accounts will reflect the actual value of the shares issued and the corresponding discount to Revenue in the P&L.

The value of the shares for the purposes of s EW 32 is $10.

The value of the services for the purposes of s EW 32 is $100.

Application of financial arrangements rules to investors in the Lifetime Income Fund
====================================================================================

Determination S31 (24 Dec 2014) considers application of the financial arrangements rules to investors in the Lifetime Income fund.

This determination may be cited as Special Determination S31: "Application of financial arrangements rules to Investors in the Lifetime Income Fund".

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  The Lifetime Income Fund (the Fund) is a unit trust in which members of the general public up to the age of 85 can invest their retirement savings (or a proportion of them) built up through savings in a KiwiSaver scheme or otherwise.  The Fund will manage the investment in a similar manner to a KiwiSaver scheme through the Balanced Portfolio which will invest in low cost share and fixed interest index funds.  The Fund will also manage distributions to provide income (the Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit) for the Investor over their retirement lifetime (from age 65 onwards). 
2.  The Lifetime Income Fund will achieve this by purchasing a life insurance policy or policies in the name of the Trustee and for the benefit of Investors (the Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit), along with offering an investment in a managed fund.  The Cash Portfolio will be invested in cash and liquid fixed income investments.  Premiums will be paid by the Fund manager to Lifetime Income Limited (LIL) annually by redeeming units held for an Investor in the Cash Portfolio.  The amount of the premiums will be actuarially calculated based on factors specific to the Investor.

3.  The Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit of the Investor is set at a percentage of their Protected Income Base, being the original capital sum invested in the Fund net of any applicable fees and including any increase in value during the Investor's Deferral Period (the period up to the time the Investor begins receiving payments of the Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit).  The Investor may elect to commence receiving their Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit at any time from age 65 until age 85. The payments will be made:
    *   first, out of the capital invested by an Investor in the Lifetime Income Fund and the Investor's proportion of the Fund's post-tax earnings accumulated as a result of investing the original capital sum and;
    *   second, from a life insurance policy or policies purchased by the Fund for the benefit of each individual Investor. 

4.  The Arrangement is the subject of product ruling BR Prd 14/10 and private ruling BR Prv 14/82 issued on 24 December 2014, and is fully described in those rulings.
5.  The Arrangement is a financial arrangement under s EW 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007.  The units in the Fund are excepted financial arrangements under s EW 5(13) and the annuity provided by LIL is an excepted financial arrangement under s EW 5(2), forming part of the financial arrangement.
6.  Under s EW 6(2), an amount that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement described in any of ss EW 5(2) to (16) is not an amount taken into account under the financial arrangements rules.  This determination specifies the amounts that are solely attributable to the units and the annuity. 

### 2\. Reference

This determination is made under s 90AC(1)(h) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This determination applies to an investment in the Lifetime Income Fund (the Fund) and payments received by Investors from the Fund and Lifetime Income Limited (LIL).  The Fund is a unit trust that will elect to be a portfolio investment entity (PIE) under s HM 71.
2.  The Fund is a product in which members of the general public up to the age of 85 can invest their retirement savings (or a portion of them) built up through savings in a KiwiSaver scheme or otherwise.  The Fund will manage the investment in a similar manner to a KiwiSaver scheme through the Balanced Portfolio, which will invest in low cost share and fixed interest index funds.  The Fund will also manage distributions to provide income (the Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit) for the Investor over their retirement lifetime (from age 65 onwards). 
3.  The Fund will achieve this by purchasing a life insurance policy or policies in the name of the Trustee and for the benefit of Investors (the Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit), along with offering an investment in a managed fund.  The Cash Portfolio will be invested in cash and liquid fixed income investments.  Premiums will be paid by the Fund manager to LIL annually by redeeming units held for an Investor in the Cash Portfolio.  The amount of the premiums will be actuarially calculated based on factors specific to the Investor.    

4.  The Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit of the Investor is set at a percentage of their Protected Income Base, being the original capital sum invested in the Fund net of any applicable fees and including any increase in value during the Investor's Deferral Period (the period up to the time the Investor begins receiving payments of the Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit).  The Investor may elect to commence receiving their Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit at any time from age 65 until age 85. The payments will be made:
    *   first, out of the capital invested by an Investor in the Fund and the Investor's proportion of the Fund's post-tax earnings accumulated as a result of investing the original capital sum and;
    *   second, from a life insurance policy or policies purchased by the Fund for the benefit of each individual Investor. 

5.  This determination is made subject to the condition that private ruling Br Prv 14/82 continues to apply (under s 91EB of the Tax Administration Act 1994).

### 4\. Principle

1.  The Arrangement is a financial arrangement under s EW 3.  The units in the Fund are excepted financial arrangements under s EW 5(13) and the annuity provided by LIL is an excepted financial arrangement under s EW 5(2), forming part of the financial arrangement.
2.  Under s EW 6(2), an amount that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement described in any of ss EW 5(2) to (16) is not an amount taken into account under the financial arrangements rules. 
3.  This determination specifies the amounts received by an Investor that are solely attributable to the units and the annuity. 
4.  Due to the amounts set out in specified in this determination being solely attributable to excepted financial arrangements, no income or expenditure will arise for an Investor in the Fund under the financial arrangements rules. 

### 5\. Interpretation

This determination has no specialised terms that need to be defined further.

### 6\. Method

1.  The amounts that are solely attributable to the units in the Fund are:
    *   any payments received by an Investor from the Fund under the Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit; and
    *   any gains or losses made by an Investor who buys or sells units in the Fund.

2.  The amounts that are solely attributable to the annuity paid by LIL to an Investor are any annuity payments received by the Investor under the Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit.

### 7\. Example

These examples illustrate the application of the method set out in this determination.

#### Example A

An Investor invests $100,000 in the Fund at age 65 and in return acquires units in the Fund. The investment grows in value after five years to $112,900 net of fees and taxes During that period, the Fund pays premiums on behalf of the Investor to LIL under a life insurance policy.

The Investor opts to receive their Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit from the Fund from age 70, which means the Benefit is set at 6% of their Protected Income Base of $112,900.This means they receive $6,774 per annum in fortnightly payments.

At age 97, the Investor's capital in the Fund is exhausted and the Investor continues to receive a minimum income of $6,774 per annum in fortnightly payments under the annuity.

The payments of $6,774 per annum paid by the Fund are solely attributable to the units in the Fund. The payments of $6,774 per annum made by LIL to an Investor under the life insurance policy are solely attributable to the annuity.

#### Example B

This example follows Example A but, at age 75, the Investor withdraws $20,000 as an Unplanned Withdrawal, reducing the Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit payments to 5.20% per annum. This means they receive $5,871 per annum in fortnightly payments.

The payments made by the Fund are solely attributable to the units in the Fund. The payments made by LIL to an Investor under the life insurance policy are solely attributable to the annuity.

This Determination is signed by me on the 24th day of December 2014.

Spreading method to be used by bank in respect of the notes and the value of shares issued by bank on conversion.
=================================================================================================================

Determination S32 (22 Jan 2015) relates to a funding transaction involving the issue of notes by a bank to the NZ branch of its Australian parent company.

This determination may be cited as Special Determination S32: Spreading Method to Be Used by the Bank in Respect of the Notes and the Value of Shares Issued by the Bank On Conversion.

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This determination relates to a funding transaction involving the issue of Notes by the Bank to the New Zealand branch of its Australian parent company. The Notes will contain an exchange mechanism, in order to allow them to be recognised as Additional Tier 1 capital for the purposes of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand framework relating to the capital adequacy of banks.
2.  The Note Terms set out the steps that will occur in the event that a Conversion Event occurs, requiring exchange of the Notes. A "Conversion Event" may be a mandatory conversion event (requiring conversion on a specified date or on the occurrence of certain events, including events concerning the Bank's viability or capital adequacy), or an optional conversion event (allowing conversion at the election of the Bank on a specified date or on the occurrence of certain events, including events concerning the tax or regulatory treatment of the Notes).
3.  If a Conversion Event occurs, the relevant number of Notes must be immediately and irrevocably exchanged for ordinary shares in the Bank. This is achieved by the Bank repaying the full face value of the Notes to the Parent, and the Parent using those funds to subscribe for shares in the Bank.
4.  The Arrangement is the subject of private ruling BR Prv 15/03 issued on 22 January 2015, and is fully described in that ruling.
5.  The share subscription provided for in the Note Terms is a financial arrangement (as defined in s EW 3) and an "agreement for the sale and purchase or property or services" (as defined in s YA 1). The various transactions under the Note Terms are, together, a wider financial arrangement.

### 2\. Reference

This determination is made under ss 90AC(1)(bb) and 90AC(1)(i) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This determination applies to a funding transaction involving the issue of Notes by the Bank to the New Zealand branch of its Australian parent. The Note terms set out the steps that will occur in the event that a Conversion Event occurs, requiring exchange of the Notes.
2.  If a Conversion Event occurs, the relevant number of Notes must be immediately and irrevocably exchanged. In summary, the steps for the exchange of the Notes will be as follows:
    1.  The Parent's rights in relation to each Note to be converted will be immediately and irrevocably terminated and repaid by the Bank for an amount equal to the face value of the Notes and the Bank will apply that amount by way of payment for subscription for its shares to be issued under step (b) below.
    2.  The Bank will allot and issue the specified "Conversion Number" of its ordinary shares to the Parent in consideration for payment by the Parent of the subscription amount referred to in paragraph (a) above.
    3.  The "Conversion Number" of ordinary shares for each Note will be calculated in accordance with the following formula:  
        *   Conversion Number for each Note \= Face Value ÷ Ordinary Share Value
            
            Where:
            
            **Face Value** means $100 per Note.
            
            **Ordinary Share Value** (expressed in dollars and cents) means, as at the conversion, the value of each ordinary share of the Bank on issue immediately prior to conversion occurring, as determined by the Bank by reference to its net assets in its most recently published disclosure statement under section 81 of the RBNZ Act and to such other information as the Bank (acting reasonably) considers appropriate and that will not delay or impede the conversion.
            
    4.  If, for whatever reason (including if the Ordinary Share Value is zero), any of the Notes are not able to be converted on a Trigger Event in accordance with the process described above within five business days after the Trigger Event Conversion Date, the Parent's rights (including as to interest payments) in relation to such Notes will be immediately and irrevocably terminated and written off with no payment to the Parent in respect of such Notes. If, for whatever reason (including if the Ordinary Share Value is zero), any of the Notes are not able to be converted in any other circumstances, conversion will be postponed until the first interest payment date on which conversion is possible.

3.  This determination applies in the situation that shares are issued by the Bank to the Parent following a Conversion Event, to determine the value of the shares for the purposes of the financial arrangements rules.

4.  This determination also applies to determine the spreading method to be used by the Bank and the Parent in respect of the Notes. It is made subject to the conditions that:
    *   None of the restrictions for application of the IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D(2B) apply to the Notes; and
    *   The Bank and the Parent both adopt the following accounting approach under IFRS:
        *   The Notes are classified entirely as debt instruments; and
        *   Interest payments under the Notes are recognised as an interest expense in the income statement of the Bank and as interest income in the income statement of the Parent.

### 4\. Principle

1.  Each note is a financial arrangement (as defined in s EW 3). The subscription for shares in the Bank by the Parent under the Note Terms is an "agreement for the sale and purchase of property and services" (as defined in s YA 1), as it is a conditional agreement to acquire property.
2.  The share subscription is not a "short-term agreement for sale and purchase" (as defined in s YA 1), as settlement will not occur within 93 days of the Notes being entered into. As such, it will not be an excepted financial arrangement under s EW 5.
3.  For the purposes of determining the consideration paid or payable under the financial arrangements rules, the value of the shares issued by the Bank must be established under s EW 32. None of subs (3) to (5) apply to the share subscriptions.
4.  Under s EW 32(6), the Commissioner is required to determine the value of the property. Both parties are required to use this amount.
5.  A person who uses IFRS to prepare financial statements and to report for financial arrangements can use the IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D.
6.  Under s EW 15I, because the financial arrangement includes in part an excepted financial arrangement, s EW 15C(1) does not apply and the Bank must use one of the methods in s EW 15I(2) to allocate an amount of income or expenditure to an income year.
7.  One of the methods available under s EW 15I(2) is a determination made by the Commissioner.

### 5\. Interpretation

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires –

*   "the Bank" means the bank issuing the Notes.
*   "the Parent" means the parent company of the Bank, acting through its New Zealand branch.
*   "Conversion Event" means an event or date on or following which the exchange of Notes must occur, or in respect of which the Bank elects for an exchange of Notes to occur, as described in private ruling BR Prv 15/03, issued on 22 January 2015.
*   "Notes" means the fully paid, convertible, subordinated securities issued by the Bank to the Parent shortly after the date certain notes are issued by the Parent to the public.
*   "Note Terms" means the terms on which the Notes are issued.
*   "IFRS" means a New Zealand Equivalent International Financial Reporting Standard, approved or issued under the Financial Reporting Act 1993, and as amended from time to time or an equivalent standard issued in its place.
*   "Trigger Event" and "Trigger Event Conversion Date" have the meanings given to them in the Note Terms.
*   All legislative references in this determination are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated.

### 6\. Method

1.  The Arrangement does not involve the advancement or deferral of income or expenditure.
2.  The IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D (as modified by s EW 15D(2)) must be used by the Bank and the Parent to allocate income and expenditure over the term of the Notes.
3.  For the purposes of s EW 32(6), the value of the shares issued by the Bank on conversion of a Note is equal to the aggregate face value of that Note.

### 7\. Example

This example illustrates the application of the method set out in this determination.

The Bank issues Notes having a face value of $100 to the Parent. Prior to a Conversion, the Bank will use the IFRS financial reporting method to allocate income and expenditure over the term of the Notes.

Following a Conversion Event, the Bank repays the face value of the Notes, by applying the amount on the Parent's behalf to subscribe for ordinary shares in the Bank. The Bank issues the number of shares to the Parent calculated in accordance with the formula in paragraph 2(c) of the Scope of the Determination above. The value of the shares, for the purposes of s EW 32, is equal to the aggregate face value of the Notes repaid by the Bank on the Conversion Event.

This Determination is signed by me on the 22nd day of January 2015.

Special Determination S33 : Application of the financial arrangements rules to the long term incentive plan established for senior executives of New Zealand Company Limited
============================================================================================================================================================================

Determination S33 (Feb 2015) prescribes amounts under a company incentive plan that are solely attributable to excepted financial arrangements.

This determination may be cited as Special Determination S33: "Application of the financial arrangements rules to the long term incentive plan established for senior executives of New Zealand Company Limited"

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This determination relates to an arrangement (the Plan) establishing a long term incentive plan for senior executives of New Zealand Company Limited (Company).  The following persons are parties to the Plan:
    *   Company;
    *   Parent Limited (Parent);
    *   certain employees of Company (Participants); and
    *   Trustee Limited (Trustee).

2.  The Plan comprises four components:
    *   A loan from Company to each Participant, paid to Trustee as agent for each Participant (Loan).
    *   Acquisition of shares in Parent (Shares) by the Trustee on behalf of each Participant, using the relevant Participant's loaned funds.  The Trustee will do this by either acquiring shares on-market, subscribing for shares in Parent, or transferring shares from its unallocated shareholding for the benefit of each Participant.
    *   Trustee will then hold the Shares on trust for each Participant for a restrictive period.  The shares will vest in each Participant upon certain vesting criteria being met.
    *   The grant of a put option (Put Option) by Trustee to each Participant in respect of each Participant's beneficial interest in the Shares.  This is in consideration for the grant of a call option (Call Option) by each Participant to Trustee in respect of each Participant's beneficial interest in the Shares.  The options may be exercised where vesting criteria are not met.
    *   Payment of a bonus (Bonus) by Company to the Participant, in accordance with the employment contract entered into between Company and the relevant Participant (Employment Contract), where vesting criteria are met.

3.  This determination prescribes:
    *   the amount of consideration that is solely attributable to the Shares;
    *   the amount of consideration that is solely attributable to the Put Options or Call Options (as relevant); and
    *   the amount of consideration that is solely attributable to the Employment Contracts.

### 2\. Reference

This determination is made under s 90AC(1)(h) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This determination applies to Company, Trustee and each Participant in respect of the Plan (more fully described in private ruling BR Prv 15/05 issued on 4 February 2015), including the following agreements:
    *   letter of invitation from Parent to employees of Company, under which Parent will invite employees to participate in the Plan;
    *   Parent long term incentive plan rules (Rules), which set out the terms of the Plan;
    *   Parent long term incentive plan trust deed (Trust Deed), under which the Trustee will hold the Shares for the Participants; and
    *   Parent long term incentive plan loan agreement (Loan Agreement), under which Company will loan the Participants funds on an interest free basis to enter into the Plan.

2.  This determination is made subject to the following condition:
    *   The continued application of private ruling BR Prv 15/05 (under s 91EB of the Tax Administration Act 1994).

### 4\. Principle

1.  The following components of the Plan are excepted financial arrangements:
    *   the Shares under s EW 5(13);
    *   the Put Options under s EW 5(13);
    *   the Call Options under s EW 5(13); and
    *   the Employment Contracts under s EW 5(4).

2.  Any amount that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement described in s EW 5(2) to (16) is not an amount that is taken into account under the financial arrangements rules (s EW 6(2)).  This determination specifies the amounts that are solely attributable to the Shares, Put Options, Call Options and Employment Contracts, and are therefore not taken into account under the financial arrangements rules.

### 5\. Interpretation

This determination has no specialised terms that need to be defined further.  All legislative references in this determination are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated.

### 6\. Method

1.  The following consideration amounts (where relevant) paid in respect of the Shares are solely attributable to the Shares and are not taken into account under the financial arrangements rules:
    *   amounts subscribed by the Trustee (as agent for the Participant) for the Shares;
    *   amounts paid by the Trustee (as agent for the Participant) to transfer unallocated Shares for the benefit of the Participant;
    *   Shares received by the Trustee (as agent for the Participant); and
    *   dividends on the Shares received by the Trustee.

2.  The following consideration amounts (where relevant) will be solely attributable to either the Put Options or Call Options and are not taken into account under the financial arrangements rules:
    *   the issue of a Call Option by any Participant as consideration for the issue of any Put Option by the Trustee (and vice versa);
    *   the transfer of any Participant's beneficial interest in Shares to the Trustee; and
    *   the purchase price paid by the Trustee for the transfer of any Participant's beneficial interest in Shares.

3.  The Bonus received by any Participant is solely attributable to the relevant Employment Contract and is not taken into account under the financial arrangements rules.

### 7\. Example

This example illustrates the application of the method set out in this determination for the Participant.

This example is based on the following parameters:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Loan | $100 |
| Share subscription | ($100) |
| Acquisition of Shares (agreed value) | $100 |
| Dividends over restrictive period | $36 |
| Dividends applied to partially repay Loan | ($36) |
| Put Option exercised |     |
| *   Transfer of beneficial interest in Shares (agreed value) | ($64) |
| *   Purchase price for beneficial interest in Shares | $64 |
| Loan repayment | ($64) |

The amounts that are solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement described in s EW 5(2) to (16) and not taken into account under the financial arrangements rules in accordance with s EW 6(2) are:

*   the Share subscription;
*   the acquisition of Shares;
*   the dividends over the restrictive period;
*   the transfer of beneficial interest in Shares; and
*   the purchase price for beneficial interest in Shares.

The amounts that the Participant must take into account under the financial arrangements rules are:

*   the Loan;
*   the dividends applied to partially repay the Loan; and
*   the Loan repayment.

This Determination is signed by me on the 4th day of February 2015.

Spreading Method to Be Used by Bank in Respect of the Notes and Valuation of Shares Issued by Bank and NZHoldCo On Conversion
=============================================================================================================================

Determination S34 (19 Feb 2015) relates to a funding transaction involving the issue of notes by a bank to the public under a notes deed poll.

This determination may be cited as Special Determination S34: Spreading Method to Be Used by Bank in Respect of the Notes and Valuation of Shares Issued by Bank and NZHoldCo On Conversion.

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This determination relates to a funding transaction involving the issue of Notes by the Bank to the public pursuant to a Notes Deed Poll.  The Notes will contain an exchange mechanism, so they can be recognised as Additional Tier 1 capital for the purposes of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and Australian Prudential Regulation Authority frameworks relating to the capital adequacy of banks.
2.  At the same time the Notes are entered into, Bank, NZHoldCo, AusHoldCo and Parent will enter into a Coordination Agreement, which will set out the steps that will occur if a Conversion occurs, requiring exchange of the Notes.  "Conversion" may be a mandatory conversion, an optional conversion (at the election of Bank) or a trigger event conversion (upon a Non-Viability Trigger Event or a Common Equity Trigger Event).
3.  If a Conversion occurs, the relevant number of Notes must be immediately and irrevocably exchanged for ordinary shares in Parent.  The Coordination Agreement provides for a series of share subscriptions and payments from Bank to NZHoldCo, from NZHoldCo to AusHoldCo and from AusHoldCo to Parent.
4.  The Arrangement is the subject of private ruling BR Prv 15/06 issued on 19 February 2015, and is fully described in that ruling.
5.  The share subscriptions provided for in the Coordination Agreement are each a financial arrangement (as defined in s EW 3) and an "agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services" (as defined in s YA 1).  The Notes and the Coordination Agreement are, together, a wider financial arrangement.

### 2\. Reference

This determination is made under ss 90AC(1)(bb) and 90AC(1)(i) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This determination applies to a funding transaction involving the issue of Notes by the Bank to the public pursuant to a Notes Deed Poll.  At the same time that the Notes are entered into, Bank, NZHoldCo, AusHoldCo and Parent will enter into a Coordination Agreement, which will set out the steps that will occur if a Conversion occurs, requiring exchange of the Notes.
2.  If a Conversion occurs, the relevant number of Notes must be immediately and irrevocably exchanged.  In summary, the steps for the exchange of the Notes will be as follows:
    1.  Each Note (subject to the exchange requirement) will be immediately transferred by the Holder to NZHoldCo.
    2.  In consideration for the Holders transferring their Notes to NZHoldCo, Parent will allot and issue a specified "exchange number" of Parent ordinary shares to such Holders for each Note transferred. 
    3.  Immediately following the transfer referred to in (a), the Notes will become immediately due and payable and Bank will be required to repay the Face Value of the Notes to NZHoldCo as transferee.  Under the terms of the Coordination Agreement, the Face Value owed to NZHoldCo will be repaid by being applied on NZHoldCo's behalf to subscribe for ordinary shares in Bank.  The number of ordinary shares in Bank to be subscribed for is based on the equity value of Bank, in accordance with a formula in the Coordination Agreement.
    4.  Under the Coordination Agreement, NZHoldCo will be required to pay a sum to AusHoldCo equal to the Face Value of each Note transferred to NZHoldCo.  This amount will be automatically applied on AusHoldCo's behalf to subscribe for ordinary shares in NZHoldCo.  The number of ordinary shares in NZHoldCo to be subscribed for is based on the equity value of NZHoldCo, in accordance with a formula in the Coordination Agreement.
    5.  Under the Coordination Agreement, AusHoldCo will be required to pay a sum to Parent equal to the Face Value of each Note transferred to NZHoldCo.  This amount will be automatically applied on Parent's behalf to subscribe for ordinary shares in AusHoldCo.  The number of ordinary shares in AusHoldCo to be subscribed for is based on the equity value of AusHoldCo, in accordance with a formula in the Coordination Agreement.
    6.  However, steps (c) to (e) may be deferred if Conversion occurs for a reason other than a trigger event and any of those steps cannot be completed.  If completion of the Intragroup Transactions is deferred any such deferral will be reasonable and no longer than is strictly necessary.
3.  This determination applies to determine the spreading method to be used by Bank in respect of the Notes. It is made subject to the condition that the restriction for application of the IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D(2B) does not apply to the Notes.
4.  This determination also applies when shares are issued by Bank to NZHoldCo and by NZHoldCo to AusHoldCo on Conversion, to determine the value of the shares for the purposes of the financial arrangements rules.

### 4\. Principle

1.  The Notes and the Coordination Agreement are, together, a financial arrangement (as defined in s EW 3).  The subscription for shares in Bank by NZHoldCo and the subscription for shares in NZHoldCo by AusHoldCo in the Coordination Agreement are both an "agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services" (as defined in s YA 1), because they are conditional agreements to acquire property.
2.  The share subscriptions are not a "short-term agreement for sale and purchase" (as defined in s YA 1), because settlement will not occur within 93 days of the Coordination Agreement being entered into.  Therefore, they are not excepted financial arrangements under s EW 5.
3.  The Bank ordinary shares issued to NZHoldCo and the NZHoldCo ordinary shares issued to AusHoldCo on a mandatory conversion, a trigger event conversion or an optional conversion are part of the wider financial arrangement, and are excepted financial arrangements under s EW 5(13).
4.  A person who uses IFRS to prepare financial statements and to report for financial arrangements can use the IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D.
5.  Under s EW 15I, because the financial arrangement includes in part an excepted financial arrangement, s EW 15C(1) does not apply and the Bank must use one of the methods in s EW 15I(2) to allocate an amount of income or expenditure to an income year.
6.  One of the methods available under s EW 15I(2) is a determination made by the Commissioner.
7.  For the purposes of determining the consideration paid or payable under the financial arrangements rules, the value of the shares issued by Bank and NZHoldCo must be established under s EW 32.  None of subs (3) to (5) of s EW 32 applies to the share subscriptions.
8.  Under s EW 32(6), the Commissioner is required to determine the value of the property.  Both parties are required to use this amount.

### 5\. Interpretation

1.  In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires –
    *   "Bank" means the bank issuing the Notes;
    *   "NZHoldCo" means the New Zealand incorporated company holding 100% of the shares in Bank;
    *   "Conversion" has the same meaning as described in private ruling BR Prv 15/06, issued on 19 February 2015;
    *   "Notes" means Notes issued to the public pursuant to a Notes Deed Poll;
    *   "AusHoldCo" means the Australian incorporated company holding 100% of the voting shares in NZHoldCo;
    *   "Parent" means the Australian incorporated parent company of Bank, NZHoldCo and AusHoldCo;
    *   "IFRS" means a New Zealand Equivalent International Financial Reporting Standard, in effect under the Financial Reporting Act 2013, and as amended from time to time or an equivalent standard issued in its place.
    *   All legislative references in this determination are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated.

### 6\. Method

1.  The Arrangement does not involve the advancement or deferral of income or expenditure. 
2.  The IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D must be used to allocate income and expenditure over the term of the Notes.
3.  For the purposes of s EW 32(6) the value of the shares issued by Bank is equal to the amount NZHoldCo paid for those shares and the value of the shares issued by NZHoldCo is equal to the amount AusHoldCo paid for those shares.

### 7\. Example

This example illustrates the application of the method set out in this determination.  

Bank issues Notes having a Face Value of $100 to Holders.  Prior to a Conversion, Bank will use the IFRS financial reporting method to allocate income and expenditure over the term of the Notes.

On Conversion, Notes having a Face Value of $100 are transferred to NZHoldCo by the Holders of the Notes.  

Bank immediately repays the Face Value of the Notes, by applying the amount on NZHoldCo's behalf to subscribe for ordinary shares in Bank.  Bank issues the number of shares to NZHoldCo calculated in accordance with the formula in the Coordination Agreement.  The value of the shares, for the purposes of s EW 32, is $100.

NZHoldCo then pays an amount equal to the Face Value of the Notes to AusHoldCo.  This amount is automatically applied on AusHoldCo's behalf to subscribe for ordinary shares in NZHoldCo.  NZHoldCo issues the number of shares to AusHoldCo calculated in accordance with the formula in the Coordination Agreement.  The value of the shares, for the purposes of s EW 32, is $100.

This Determination is signed by me on the 19th day of February 2015.

Application of the financial arrangements rules to a public-private partnership agreement
=========================================================================================

Determination S36 (28 Apr 2015) relates to operation and maintenance services of a facility by a limited partnership under a PPP. Replaced by S36A (26 Jan 2018).

This Determination may be cited as Special Determination S36: "Application of the financial arrangements rules to a public-private partnership agreement".

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This determination relates to an arrangement (the Project) involving the finance, design, construction and on-going provision of operation and maintenance services in respect of the Facilities by a limited partnership (the Partnership) under a public-private partnership agreement (the Project Agreement) with the Crown. The Holding Partnership will be the sole limited partner in the Partnership, holding 100% of the Partnership.
2.  The limited partners in the Holding Partnership are Limited Partner A and Limited Partner B. Limited Partner A is a limited partnership. Limited Partner B is a limited liability company. Limited Partner B and each taxable limited partner of Limited Partner A are together referred to as the Taxable Limited Partners.
3.  The Project Agreement comprises three basic components for each Facility:
    *   A design and construction phase (the D&C Phase) under which the Partnership agrees to design and construct the Facility for the Crown in consideration for a fixed lump-sum payment (the D&C Payment), payable on completion of the D&C Phase;
    *   A Facility Lease entered into by the Partnership and the Crown, under which the Partnership pays an amount representing the rental under the Facility Lease to the Crown (the Rental Prepayment); and
    *   An operations and maintenance phase (the O&M Phase) under which, in consideration for quarterly payments (the Unitary Charge), the Partnership will provide operation and maintenance services to the Crown over a term beginning once the Facility is ready for operation and ending 25 years after completion of the last-completed Facility.
4.  The Partnership will enter into:
    *   A Construction Agreement with a contractor (the Contractor), under which the Contractor will design and construct each Facility in consideration for monthly and milestone payments; and
    *   An Operation and Maintenance Contract (the O&M Contract) with a service provider (the Service Provider), under which the Service Provider will provide the on-going operation and maintenance (and other) services in consideration for monthly payments.
5.  The Partnership will raise external debt from a range of third party financiers (the Senior Debt).
6.  The Partnership may raise subordinated debt from the Holding Partnership, which may in turn raise subordinated debt from Limited Partner A and Limited Partner B (Subordinated Debt).
7.  The Partnership will enter into Interest Rate Swaps in respect of the Senior Debt.
8.  The Facility Lease, O&M Phase of the Project Agreement, Construction Agreement and O&M Contract are all excepted financial arrangements. The D&C Phase of the Project Agreement, Senior Debt, Subordinated Debt and Interest Rate Swaps are financial arrangements to which the Partnership is a party. The Project, including all of these agreements, is a wider financial arrangement.
9.  _Special Determination S37: Application of the financial arrangements rules to the D&C Phase in a public-private partnership_ applies to the D&C Payment under the D&C Phase.
10.  This determination prescribes:
    *   the amount of consideration that is solely attributable to each Facility Lease;
    *   how the financial arrangements rules apply to the O&M Phase of the Project Agreement, the Construction Agreement and the O&M Contract for each Facility; and
    *   the method for spreading the payments made under the Senior Debt, Subordinated Debt and Interest Rate Swaps.

### 2\. Reference

1.  This determination is made under ss 90AC(1)(bb)and 91AC(1)(h) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This determination applies to the Partnership in respect of the Project (which is set out in detail in Private Ruling BR Prv 15/11 issued on 28 April 2015), including the following arrangements:
    *   The D&C Phase of the Project Agreement, under which the Partnership agrees to design and construct each Facility for the Crown and will receive a fixed lump-sum payment (the D&C Payment) for each Facility once the Facility is ready for operation (which is the subject of _Special Determination S37: Application of the financial arrangements rules to the D&C Phase of a public-private partnership_).
    *   The O&M Phase of the Project Agreement, under which the Partnership will provide on-going operation and maintenance services to the Crown for 25 years following completion of the last-completed Facility to the Crown in consideration for quarterly payments.
    *   The Facility Lease for each Facility, under which the Partnership will lease the Facility from the Crown for a period ending 25 years following completion of the last-completed Facility and will make the Rental Prepayment to the Crown. The Rental Prepayment will be equal to and will offset the D&C Payment.
    *   A Construction Agreement with the Contractor, under which the Contractor will design and construct the Facility in consideration for payments under the Construction Agreement.
    *   An O&M Contract with the Service Provider following completion of the last-completed Facility, under which the Service Provider will provide the on-going operation and maintenance (and other) services in consideration for payments under the O&M Contract.
    *   Senior Debt, under which the Partnership will borrow an agreed sum from external lenders for a term of 5 years from financial close of the Project (Financial Close). The Senior Debt will be a capitalising, interest only senior debt facility that converts to an amortising senior tranche on the Conversion Date. It is expected that the Senior Debt will be refinanced within 5 years of Financial Close and every 5 years thereafter over the term of the Project. Under IFRS (as the standards apply at the date of this Determination), the Senior Debt (and any subsequent re-financings) will initially be recognised at fair value plus integral fees, and subsequently measured using the amortised cost using the effective interest method (regardless of whether hedge accounting is applied). The Senior Debt will not be treated as a hedge of another financial arrangement.
    *   Subordinated Debt, under which Limited Partner A and Limited Partner B may lend to the Holding Partnership and the Holding Partnership may lend to the Partnership.
    *   Interest Rate Swaps, under which the Partnership will pay a fixed rate of interest to the swap counterparties, and receive a floating rate in return.
2.  This determination is made subject to the following conditions:
    *   The Taxable Limited Partners each use IFRSs to prepare financial statements.
    *   The Taxable Limited Partners will each recognise income derived from the Crown during the D&C Phase and the O&M Phase of the Project Agreement, and will deduct expenditure incurred in relation to the Facility Lease, Construction Agreement and O&M Contract, in each case, under the relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007 (outside of the financial arrangements rules).
    *   The Taxable Limited Partners each do not use the fair value method for the Senior Debt if the Senior Debt is treated as a hedge of another financial arrangement under IFRS and uses for the other financial arrangement a method that is neither the IFRS financial reporting method nor the method required under Determination G29: Agreements for Sale and Purchase of Property Denominated in Foreign Currency: Exchange Rate to Determine the Acquisition Price and method for spreading income and expenditure.
    *   The Taxable Limited Partners will each recognise income in respect of the D&C Payment in the manner prescribed by _Special Determination S37: Application of the financial arrangements rules to the D&C Phase in a public-private partnership_.
    *   The continued application of Private Ruling BR Prv 15/11 issued on 28 April 2015.
    *   The final executed documentation is not materially different from the draft documentation that Inland Revenue received on 24 October 2014, 16 January 2015, 12 April 2015 and 23 April 2015.

### 4\. Principle

1.  Each Facility Lease is an excepted financial arrangement under s EW 5(9). Any amount that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement described in ss EW 5(2) to (16) is not an amount that is taken into account under the financial arrangements rules (s EW 6(2)). This determination specifies the amounts that are solely attributable to a Facility Lease that are not taken into account under the financial arrangements rules.
2.  The O&M Phase, Construction Agreements and O&M Contracts are "short-term agreements for sale and purchase" as defined in s YA 1, and are excepted financial arrangements under s EW 5(22), provided that payment under the Construction Agreements and O&M Contracts is required within 93 days of an invoice being rendered. Any amount that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement described in ss EW 5(17) to (25) that is part of a financial arrangement is an amount that is taken into account under the financial arrangements rules (s EW 6(3)). This determination specifies that no amounts payable to or by the Partnership in respect of the O&M Phase, Construction Agreements and O&M Contracts are required to be spread under the financial arrangements rules.
3.  The D&C Phase, Senior Debt, Subordinated Debt and Interest Rate Swaps are "financial arrangements" under s EW 3. This determination specifies that the payments made to or by Limited Partner A and Limited Partner B, in proportion to their share in Holding Partnership, under the Senior Debt, Subordinated Debt and Interest Rate Swaps must be spread under the financial arrangements rules in accordance with this determination.
4.  This determination does not deal with the treatment of the D&C Payment which is subject to a separate determination (_Special Determination S37: Application of the financial arrangements rules to the D&C Phase in a public-private partnership_).

### 5\. Interpretation

1.  In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires:
    *   All legislative references in this determination are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated.
    *   Capitalised terms have the same meaning as set out in the Project Agreement.
    *   "IFRS" means International Financial Reporting Standards as defined in sYA1.

### 6\. Method

1.  The Rental Prepayment paid in respect of a Facility Lease, and the property interest granted to the Partnership under a Facility Lease, are solely attributable to the Facility Lease and are not taken into account under the financial arrangements rules.
2.  The Taxable Limited Partners are not required to spread any amounts under the financial arrangements rules in respect of the:
    *   O&M Phase of the Project Agreement;
    *   Construction Agreement;
    *   O&M Contract.
3.  The IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D may be used to allocate income and expenditure (other than "non-integral fees" as defined in s YA 1) over the term of the Senior Debt and none of the restrictions for application of the IFRS financial reporting method contained in s EW 15D(2B) apply.
4.  The IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D may be used to allocate income and expenditure (other than "non-integral fees" as defined in s YA 1) in respect of any subsequent refinancing of the Senior Debt over the term of the relevant refinancing, provided that the terms of any such refinancing are materially similar to the terms of the Senior Debt. This determination paragraph does not affect each Taxable Limited Partner's obligation to perform a base price adjustment under s EW 31 at the time of each refinancing.
5.  The IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D may be used to allocate income and expenditure (other than "non-integral fees" as defined in s YA 1) over the term of the Subordinated Debt provided that none of the restrictions for the application of this reporting method in s EW 15D(2B) apply and Taxable Limited Partner uses the same IFRS method to allocate both income and expenditure under the Subordinated Debt for financial reporting purposes.
6.  None of the mandatory spreading methods in ss EW 15H or EW 15I apply to the Interest Rate Swaps. Over the term of the Interest Rate Swaps, income or expenditure may be allocated using either:
    
    *   the expected value method in s EW 15F (other than for "non-contingent fees" as defined in s YA 1) provided that the swaps are not treated as a hedge of other financial arrangements for which the "fair value method" is used; or
    *   the IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D (other than for "non-integral fees" as defined in s YA 1) provided that the swaps are not treated as a hedge of other financial arrangements for which a method other than the IFRS financial reporting method is used;
    
      
    provided that each Taxable Limited Partner uses the same method for the entire term of the Interest Rate Swaps.
7.  This determination does not affect each Taxable Limited Partner's obligation to perform base price adjustments under sEW 31 in respect of the Interest Rate Swaps.

### 7\. Example

This example illustrates the application of the method set out in this determination.

This example is based on the following parameters:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Commencement of D&C Phase | 1 May 2015 |
| Completion of D&C Phase | 16 September 2017 |
| Completion of O&M Phase | 21 December 2041 |
| D&C Payment from the Crown | $1,000 |
| Aggregate payments to the Contractor | ($850) |
| Facility Lease prepayment | ($1,000) |
| Quarterly payments from the Crown during the O&M Phase | $30 |
| Quarterly payments to the Service Provider | ($15) |
| Annual interest on the Senior Debt | ($85) |
| Annual net payments in respect of the Interest Rate Swaps | ($7) |

The Taxable Limited Partners are not required to spread any amounts under the financial arrangements rules in respect of the Facility Lease, O&M Phase of the Project Agreement, Construction Agreement and O&M Contract.

The amounts that must be spread under the financial arrangement rules are:

*   Interest on the Senior Debt calculated in accordance with the IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D;
*   Interest on the Subordinated Debt calculated in accordance with the IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D;
*   Payments in respect of the Interest Rate Swaps calculated in accordance with the expected value method in s EW 15F or the IFRS financial reporting method in sEW 15D; and
*   Amounts in respect of the D&C Payment as specified in _Special Determination S37: Application of the financial arrangements rules to the D&C Phase in a public-private partnership_.

This Determination is signed by Howard Davis on the 28th day of April 2015.

Application of the financial arrangements rules to a public-private partnership agreement
=========================================================================================

Determination S36A (26 Jan 2018) varies and replaces S36: Application of the financial arrangements rules to a PPP agreement following a change of partners.

This Determination may be cited as _Special Determination S36A: Application of the financial arrangements rules to a public-private partnership agreement_.

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This determination varies and replaces _Special Determination S36: Application of the financial arrangements rules to a public-private partnership agreement_ following a change of partners.
2.  This determination relates to an arrangement (the Project) involving the finance, design, construction and on-going provision of operation and maintenance services in respect of the Facilities by a limited partnership (the Partnership) under a public-private partnership agreement (the Project Agreement) with the Crown. The Holding Partnership will be the sole limited partner in the Partnership, holding 100% of the Partnership.
3.  At the time that the Project Agreement was entered into, the limited partners in the Holding Partnership were Limited Partner A and Limited Partner B. On 30 March 2017, Limited Partner B sold their interest to Limited Partner C. Limited Partner A and Limited Partner C are both limited partnerships with multiple limited partners, some of whom are exempt from income tax. Each limited partner of Limited Partner A and Limited Partner C that is not exempt from income tax are together referred to as the Taxable Limited Partners. This determination only applies to the Taxable Limited Partners and does not apply to those limited partners that are exempt from income tax.
4.  The Project Agreement comprises three basic components for each Facility:
    *   A design and construction phase (the D&C Phase) under which the Partnership agrees to design and construct the Facility for the Crown in consideration for a fixed lump-sum payment (the D&C Payment), payable on completion of the D&C Phase;
    *   A Facility Lease entered into by the Partnership and the Crown, under which the Partnership pays an amount representing the rental under the Facility Lease to the Crown (the Rental Prepayment); and
    *   An operations and maintenance phase (the O&M Phase) under which, in consideration for quarterly payments (the Unitary Charge), the Partnership will provide operation and maintenance services to the Crown over a term beginning once the Facility is ready for operation and ending 25 years after completion of the last-completed Facility.
5.  The Partnership will enter into:
    *   A Construction Agreement with a contractor (the Contractor), under which the Contractor will design and construct each Facility in consideration for monthly and milestone payments; and
    *   An Operation and Maintenance Contract (the O&M Contract) with a service provider (the Service Provider), under which the Service Provider will provide the on-going operation and maintenance (and other) services in consideration for monthly payments.
6.  The Partnership will raise external debt from a range of third party financiers (the Senior Debt).
7.  The Partnership may raise subordinated debt from the Holding Partnership, which may in turn raise subordinated debt from Limited Partner A and Limited Partner C (Subordinated Debt).
8.  The Partnership will enter into Interest Rate Swaps in respect of the Senior Debt.
9.  The Facility Lease, O&M Phase of the Project Agreement, Construction Agreement and O&M Contract are all excepted financial arrangements.  The D&C Phase of the Project Agreement, Senior Debt, Subordinated Debt and Interest Rate Swaps are financial arrangements to which the Partnership is a party. The Project, including all of these agreements, is a wider financial arrangement.
10.  _Special Determination S37A: Application of the financial arrangements rules to the D&C Phase of a public-private partnership agreement_ applies to the D&C Payment under the D&C Phase.
11.  This determination applies from 30 March 2017 and prescribes:
    *   the amount of consideration that is solely attributable to each Facility Lease;
    *   how the financial arrangements rules apply to the O&M Phase of the Project Agreement, the Construction Agreement and the O&M Contract for each Facility; and
    *   the method for spreading the payments made under the Senior Debt, Subordinated Debt and Interest Rate Swaps.

### 2\. Reference

1.  This determination varies and replaces Special Determination S36: Application of the financial arrangements rules to a public-private partnership agreement.
2.  This determination is made under ss 90AC(1)(bb), 90AC(1)(d) and 90AC(1)(h) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This determination applies to the Partnership in respect of the Project (which is set out in detail in the Private Ruling), including the following arrangements:
    *   The D&C Phase of the Project Agreement, under which the Partnership agrees to design and construct each Facility for the Crown and will receive a fixed lump-sum payment (the D&C Payment) for each Facility once the Facility is ready for operation (which is the subject of Special Determination S37A: Application of the financial arrangements rules to the D&C Phase of a public-private partnership agreement).
    *   The O&M Phase of the Project Agreement, under which the Partnership will provide on-going operation and maintenance services to the Crown for 25 years following completion of the last-completed Facility to the Crown in consideration for quarterly payments.
    *   The Facility Lease for each Facility, under which the Partnership will lease the Facility from the Crown for a period ending 25 years following completion of the last-completed Facility and will make the Rental Prepayment to the Crown. The Rental Prepayment will be equal to and will offset the D&C Payment.
    *   A Construction Agreement with the Contractor, under which the Contractor will design and construct the Facility in consideration for payments under the Construction Agreement.
    *   An O&M Contract with the Service Provider following completion of the last-completed Facility, under which the Service Provider will provide the on-going operation and maintenance (and other) services in consideration for payments under the O&M Contract.
    *   Senior Debt, under which the Partnership will borrow an agreed sum from external lenders for a term of 5 years from financial close of the Project (Financial Close). The Senior Debt will be a capitalising, interest only senior debt facility that converts to an amortising senior tranche on the Conversion Date. It is expected that the Senior Debt will be refinanced within 5 years of Financial Close and every 5 years thereafter over the term of the Project. Under IFRS (as the standards apply at the date of this Determination), the Senior Debt (and any subsequent re-financings) will initially be recognised at fair value plus integral fees, and subsequently measured using the amortised cost using the effective interest method (regardless of whether hedge accounting is applied). The Senior Debt will not be treated as a hedge of another financial arrangement.
    *   Subordinated Debt, under which Limited Partner A and Limited Partner C may lend to the Holding Partnership and the Holding Partnership may lend to the Partnership.
    *   Interest Rate Swaps, under which the Partnership will pay a fixed rate of interest to the swap counterparties, and receive a floating rate in return.
2.  This determination is made subject to the following conditions:
    
    *   Limited Partner A and Limited Partner C use IFRS to prepare financial statements and to report for financial arrangements. Any Taxable Limited Partner that does not use IFRSs to prepare financial statements and to report for financial arrangements will use the same spreading method as Limited Partner A or Limited Partner C as appropriate.
    *   The Taxable Limited Partners will each recognise income derived from the Crown during the D&C Phase and the O&M Phase of the Project Agreement, and will deduct expenditure incurred in relation to the Facility Lease, Construction Agreement and O&M Contract, in each case, under the relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007 (outside of the financial arrangements rules).
    *   The Taxable Limited Partners each do not use the fair value method for the Senior Debt if the Senior Debt is treated as a hedge of another financial arrangement under IFRS and uses for the other financial arrangement a method that is neither the IFRS financial reporting method nor the method required under _Determination G29: Agreements for Sale and Purchase of Property Denominated in Foreign Currency: Exchange Rate to Determine the Acquisition Price and method for spreading income and expenditure_.
    *   The Taxable Limited Partners will each recognise income in respect of the D&C Payment in the manner prescribed by _Special Determination S37A: Application of the financial arrangements rules to the D&C Phase of a public-private partnership agreement._
    *   The continued application of the Private Ruling.
    *   The final executed documentation is not materially different from the draft documentation that Inland Revenue received on 24 October 2014, 16 January 2015, 12 April 2015 and 23 April 2015.
    
    ### 4\. Principle
    
    1.  Each Facility Lease is an excepted financial arrangement under s EW 5(9). Any amount that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement described in ss EW 5(2) to (16) is not an amount that is taken into account under the financial arrangements rules (s EW 6(2)). This determination specifies the amounts that are solely attributable to a Facility Lease that are not taken into account under the financial arrangements rules.
    2.  The O&M Phase, Construction Agreements and O&M Contracts are “short-term agreements for sale and purchase” as defined in s YA 1, and are excepted financial arrangements under s EW 5(22), provided that payment under the Construction Agreements and O&M Contracts is required within 93 days of an invoice being rendered. Any amount that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement described in ss EW 5(17) to (25) that is part of a financial arrangement is an amount that is taken into account under the financial arrangements rules (s EW 6(3)). This determination specifies that no amounts payable to or by the Partnership in respect of the O&M Phase, Construction Agreements and O&M Contracts are required to be spread under the financial arrangements rules.
    3.  The D&C Phase, Senior Debt, Subordinated Debt and Interest Rate Swaps are “financial arrangements” under s EW 3. This determination specifies that the payments made to or by Limited Partner A and Limited Partner C, in proportion to their share in Holding Partnership, under the Senior Debt, Subordinated Debt and Interest Rate Swaps must be spread under the financial arrangements rules in accordance with this determination.
    4.  This determination does not deal with the treatment of the D&C Payment which is subject to a separate determination (_Special Determination S37A: Application of the financial arrangements rules to the D&C Phase of a public-private partnership agreement_).

### 5\. Interpretation

1.  In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires:
    *   All legislative references in this determination are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated.
    *   Capitalised terms have the same meaning as set out in the Project Agreement.
    *   "IFRS" means International Financial Reporting Standards as defined in sYA1.
    *   "Private Ruling" means Private Ruling BR Prv 18/01 issued on 26 January 2018, and includes any Ruling issued to replace that Ruling, provided that the change to the Ruling does not affect the application of this determination.

### 6\. Method

1.  The Rental Prepayment paid in respect of a Facility Lease, and the property interest granted to the Partnership under a Facility Lease, are solely attributable to the Facility Lease and are not taken into account under the financial arrangements rules.
2.  The Taxable Limited Partners are not required to spread any amounts under the financial arrangements rules in respect of the:
    *   O&M Phase of the Project Agreement;
    *   Construction Agreement;
    *   O&M Contract.
3.  The IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D may be used to allocate income and expenditure (other than “non-integral fees” as defined in s YA 1) over the term of the Senior Debt and none of the restrictions for application of the IFRS financial reporting method contained in s EW 15D(2B) apply.
4.  The IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D may be used to allocate income and expenditure (other than “non-integral fees” as defined in s YA 1) in respect of any subsequent refinancing of the Senior Debt over the term of the relevant refinancing, provided that the terms of any such refinancing are materially similar to the terms of the Senior Debt. This determination paragraph does not affect each Taxable Limited Partner’s obligation to perform a base price adjustment under s EW 31 at the time of each refinancing.
5.  The IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D may be used to allocate income and expenditure (other than “non-integral fees” as defined in s YA 1) over the term of the Subordinated Debt provided that none of the restrictions for the application of this reporting method in s EW 15D(2B) apply and provided that each Taxable Limited Partner uses the same IFRS method to allocate both income and expenditure under the Subordinated Debt for financial reporting purposes.
6.  None of the mandatory spreading methods in ss EW 15H or EW 15I apply to the Interest Rate Swaps. Over the term of the Interest Rate Swaps, income or expenditure may be allocated using either:
    *   the expected value method in s EW 15F (other than for “non-contingent fees” as defined in s YA 1) provided that the swaps are not treated as a hedge of other financial arrangements for which the “fair value method” is used; or
    *   the IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D (other than for “non-integral fees” as defined in s YA 1) provided that the swaps are not treated as a hedge of other financial arrangements for which a method other than the IFRS financial reporting method is used;provided that each Taxable Limited Partner uses the same method for the entire term of the Interest Rate Swaps.
7.  This determination does not affect each Taxable Limited Partner’s obligation to perform base price adjustments under s EW 31 in respect of the Interest Rate Swaps.

### 7\. Example

This example illustrates the application of the method set out in this determination. This example is based on the following parameters:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Commencement of D&C Phase | 1 May 2015 |
| Completion of D&C Phase | 16 September 2017 |
| Completion of O&M Phase | 21 December 2041 |
| D&C Payment from the Crown | $1,000 |
| Aggregate payments to the Contractor | ($850) |
| Facility Lease prepayment | ($1,000) |
| Quarterly payments from the Crown during the O&M Phase | $30 |
| Quarterly payments to the Service Provider | ($15) |
| Annual interest on the Senior Debt | ($85) |
| Annual net payments in respect of the Interest Rate Swaps | ($7) |

The Taxable Limited Partners are not required to spread any amounts under the financial arrangements rules in respect of the Facility Lease, O&M Phase of the Project Agreement, Construction Agreement and O&M Contract.

The amounts that must be spread under the financial arrangement rules are:

*   Interest on the Senior Debt calculated in accordance with the IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D;
*   Interest on the Subordinated Debt calculated in accordance with the IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D;
*   Payments in respect of the Interest Rate Swaps calculated in accordance with the expected value method in s EW 15F or the IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D; and
*   Amounts in respect of the D&C Payment as specified in _Special Determination S37A: Application of the financial arrangements rules to the D&C Phase of a public-private partnership agreement_.

This Determination is signed by me on the 26th day of January 2018.

Application of the financial arrangements rules to the D&C Phase of a public-private partnership agreement
==========================================================================================================

Determination S37 (28 Apr 2015) relates to payments received by a limited partnership for the design and construction of facilities under a PPP agreement.

This Determination may be cited as Special Determination S37: "Application of the financial arrangements rules to the D&C Phase of a public-private partnership agreement".

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This determination relates to an arrangement (the Project) involving the finance, design, construction and on-going provision of operation and maintenance services in respect of the Facilities by a limited partnership (the Partnership) under a public-private partnership agreement (the Project Agreement) with the Crown. The Holding Partnership will be the sole limited partner in the Partnership, holding 100% of the Partnership.
2.  The limited partners in the Holding Partnership are Limited Partner A and Limited Partner B.  Limited Partner A is a limited partnership.  Limited Partner B is a limited liability company.  Limited Partner B and each taxable limited partner of Limited Partner A are together referred to as the Taxable Limited Partners.
3.  The Project Agreement comprises three basic components for each Facility:
    *   A design and construction phase (the D&C Phase) under which the Partnership agrees to design and construct the Facility for the Crown in consideration for a fixed lump-sum payment (the D&C Payment), payable on completion of the D&C Phase;
    *   A Facility Lease entered into by the Partnership and the Crown, under which the Partnership pays an amount representing the rental under the Facility Lease to the Crown (the Rental Prepayment); and
    *   An operations and maintenance phase (the O&M Phase) under which, in consideration for quarterly payments (the Unitary Charge), the Partnership will provide operation and maintenance services to the Crown over a term beginning once the Facility is ready for operation and ending 25 years after completion of the last-completed Facility.
4.  The Partnership will enter into:
    *   A Construction Agreement with a contractor (the Contractor), under which the Contractor will design and construct each Facility in consideration for monthly and milestone payments; and
    *   An Operation and Maintenance Contract (the O&M Contract) with a service provider (the Service Provider) in respect of each Facility, under which the Service Provider will provide the on-going operation and maintenance (and other) services in consideration for monthly payments.
5.  The Partnership will raise external debt from a range of third party financiers (the Senior Debt).
6.  The Partnership may raise subordinated debt from the Holding Partnership, which may in turn raise subordinated debt from Limited Partner A and Limited Partner B (Subordinated Debt).
7.  The Partnership will enter into Interest Rate Swaps in respect of the Senior Debt.
8.  The Facility Lease, O&M Phase of the Project Agreement, Construction Agreement and O&M Contract are all excepted financial arrangements. The D&C Phase of the Project Agreement, Senior Debt, Subordinated Debt and Interest Rate Swaps are financial arrangements to which the Partnership is a party. The Project, including all of these agreements, is a wider financial arrangement.
9.  _Special Determination S36: Application of the financial arrangements rules to a public-private partnership_ applies to arrangements in the wider financial arrangement, excluding the D&C Payments.
10.  This determination prescribes the portion of each D&C Payment treated as income under the financial arrangement rules (the Interest Component) and the method for spreading that income.

### 2\. Reference

1.  This determination is made under ss 90AC(1)(bb)and 91AC(1)(i) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This determination applies to the Partnership in respect of the Project (which is set out in detail in Private Ruling BR Prv 15/11 issued on 28 April 2015), including the D&C Phase of the Project Agreement for each Facility, under which the Partnership agrees to design and construct the Facility for the Crown and will receive a fixed lump-sum payment (the D&C Payment) once the Facility is ready for operation.
2.  This determination is made subject to the following conditions:
    *   The design and construction costs of each Facility are agreed between the Partnership and the Crown on an arm's length basis and set out in the Base Case for the relevant Facility under the Project Agreement as referenced in the definition of "Design and Construction Payment" in clause 1.1 of the Project Agreement.
    *   The Taxable Limited Partners each use IFRSs to prepare financial statements and to report for financial arrangements.
    *   The continued application of private ruling BR Prv 15/11 issued on 28 April 2015.
    *   The final executed documentation is not materially different from the draft documentation that Inland Revenue received on 24 October 2014, 16 January 2015, 12 April 2015 and 23 April 2015.

### 4\. Principle

1.  During the D&C Phase of the Project Agreement, the Partnership will receive consideration from the Crown (in the form of the D&C Payment) for each Facility and will in turn provide consideration to the Crown (in the form of the completion of each Facility that is part of the Project and the transfer of its rights, set out in clause 12.2(c) of the Project Agreement, in each Facility). The D&C Phase of the Project Agreement for each facility is a "financial arrangement" under s EW 3 and an "agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services" under s YA 1.
2.  The Partnership and the Crown have agreed that each D&C Payment includes capitalised interest (clause 13.6(c) of the Project Agreement). The Interest Component of each D&C Payment will be income under the financial arrangements rules under subpart EW.
3.  During the D&C Phase for each Facility the Partnership has variable expenditure commitments that will accrue. The capitalised interest component of each D&C Payment is intended to offset the expected funding costs incurred on these commitments.
4.  The Interest Component is calculated with reference to expected funding costs.  No adjustment is made for variances between actual and expected costs as the D&C Payment for each Facility, including capitalised interest, is agreed in advance.
5.  The Interest Component of each D&C Payment needs to be spread over the term of the D&C Phase for the Facility to which it relates.

### 5\. Interpretation

1.  In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires:
    *   All legislative references in this determination are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated.
    *   Capitalised terms have the same meaning as set out in the Project Agreement.
    *   "IFRS" means International Financial Reporting Standards as defined in s YA 1.

### 6\. Method

#### Calculation of Interest Component

1.  The value of the completion of a Facility and transfer of the Partnership's rights to the Crown, set out in clause 12.2(c) of the Project Agreement, is the agreed design and construction costs of the relevant Facility (excluding Fitout) set out in the Base Case for the relevant Facility under the Project Agreement.
2.  The D&C Payment less the agreed design and construction costs of the Facility (excluding Fitout) set out in the Base Case for the relevant Facility under the Project Agreement is the Interest Component that is income under the financial arrangements rules.
3.  BR Prv 15/11 rules on the portion of the D&C Payment that is not income under the financial arrangements rules, and that portion is not considered in this determination.

#### Spreading of Interest Component

4.  The method for determining the amount of income that is to be allocated to each income year is as follows:
    
    1.  The expected design and construction costs of the Facility (excluding Fitout) as set out in the Base Case for the relevant Facility are treated as having been incurred at the beginning of each of the income years that make up the D&C Phase for each Facility (the Annual Expenditure). No adjustment will be made to the Annual Expenditure in any income year to reflect actual expenditure in that year.
    2.  The interest allocated to each income year is then calculated in accordance with the following formula:  
        Interest = OB x R
    
      
    Where:  
      
    **OB** is the sum of the Annual Expenditure for that income year, plus the Annual Expenditure and interest attributable to any previous income year.  
      
    **R** is the internal rate of return (based on annual rests) calculated using the notional cash flows in paragraph (a) above at the beginning of each income year as outflows, and the D&C Payment at the end of the D&C Phase as the only inflow.

### 7\. Example

This example illustrates the application of the method set out in this determination.

The Partnership and the Crown agree to the D&C Payment under the Base Case sheet that the D&C Payment equals $60,000.

The Base Case sets out that the agreed design and construction costs of the Facility (excluding Fitout) are to be $55,500.

The value of the "completion of the relevant Facility and the transfer of the rights set out in clause 12.2(c)" of the Project Agreement, as set out in clause 13.4(a) of the Project Agreement, is equal to $55,500.

The Interest Component of the D&C Payment is $4,500 by implication of the valuation under this determination.

The Taxable Limited Partners will each spread the Interest Component over the term of the D&C Phase of the Project Agreement, as follows.

The Annual Expenditure incurred and treated as having been incurred at the beginning of the relevant income year is as follows:

| Year | Actual D&C Costs |
| --- | --- |
| 1   | ($2,500) |
| 2   | ($35,000) |
| 3   | ($18,000) |
| D&C Payment | $60,000 |
|     | ($55,500) |

Based on receipt of the $60,000 D&C Payment in Year 3, the Project has an internal rate of return of 4.62%.

The Interest Component is therefore spread as follows:

| Year | Actual D&C costs | Cumulative | Interest income |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | ($2,500) | ($2,500) | $115 |
| **2** | ($35,000) | ($37,615) | $1,737 |
| **3** | ($18,000) | ($57,352) | $2,648 |
|     |     | $60,000 |     |
|     | ($55,500) |     | $4,500 |

Application of the financial arrangements rules to the D&C Phase of a public-private partnership agreement
==========================================================================================================

This determination varies and replaces Special Determination S37: Application of the financial arrangements rules to the D&C Phase of a public-private partnership agreement following a change of partners in the limited partnership.

This Determination may be cited as _Special Determination S37A: Application of the financial arrangements rules to the D&C Phase of a public-private partnership agreement._

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This determination varies and replaces Special Determination S37: Application of the financial arrangements rules to the D&C Phase of a public-private partnership agreement following a change of partners.
2.  This determination relates to an arrangement (the Project) involving the finance, design, construction and on-going provision of operation and maintenance services in respect of the Facilities by a limited partnership (the Partnership) under a public-private partnership agreement (the Project Agreement) with the Crown. The Holding Partnership will be the sole limited partner in the Partnership, holding 100% of the Partnership.
3.  At the time that the Project Agreement was entered into, the limited partners in the Holding Partnership were Limited Partner A and Limited Partner B. On 30 March 2017, Limited Partner B sold their interest to Limited Partner C. Limited Partner A and Limited Partner C are both limited partnerships with multiple limited partners, some of whom are exempt from income tax. Each limited partner of Limited Partner A and Limited Partner C that is not exempt from income tax are together referred to as the Taxable Limited Partners. This determination only applies to the Taxable Limited Partners and does not apply to those limited partners that are exempt from income tax.
4.  The Project Agreement comprises three basic components for each Facility:
    *   A design and construction phase (the D&C Phase) under which the Partnership agrees to design and construct the Facility for the Crown in consideration for a fixed lump-sum payment (the D&C Payment), payable on completion of the D&C Phase;
    *   A Facility Lease entered into by the Partnership and the Crown, under which the Partnership pays an amount representing the rental under the Facility Lease to the Crown (the Rental Prepayment); and
    *   An operations and maintenance phase (the O&M Phase) under which, in consideration for quarterly payments (the Unitary Charge), the Partnership will provide operation and maintenance services to the Crown over a term beginning once the Facility is ready for operation and ending 25 years after completion of the last-completed Facility.
5.  The Partnership will enter into:
    *   A Construction Agreement with a contractor (the Contractor), under which the Contractor will design and construct each Facility in consideration for monthly and milestone payments; and
    *   An Operation and Maintenance Contract (the O&M Contract) with a service provider (the Service Provider) in respect of each Facility, under which the Service Provider will provide the on-going operation and maintenance (and other) services in consideration for monthly payments.
6.  The Partnership will raise external debt from a range of third party financiers (the Senior Debt).
7.  The Partnership may raise subordinated debt from the Holding Partnership, which may in turn raise subordinated debt from Limited Partner A and Limited Partner B (Subordinated Debt).
8.  The Partnership will enter into Interest Rate Swaps in respect of the Senior Debt.
9.  The Facility Lease, O&M Phase of the Project Agreement, Construction Agreement and O&M Contract are all excepted financial arrangements. The D&C Phase of the Project Agreement, Senior Debt, Subordinated Debt and Interest Rate Swaps are financial arrangements to which the Partnership is a party. The Project, including all of these agreements, is a wider financial arrangement.
10.  _Special Determination S36A: Application of the financial arrangements rules to a public-private partnership_ applies to arrangements in the wider financial arrangement, excluding the D&C Payments.
11.  This determination applies from 30 March 2017 and prescribes the portion of each D&C Payment treated as income under the financial arrangement rules (the Interest Component) and the method for spreading that income.

### 2\. Reference

1.  This determination varies and replaces _Special Determination S37: Application of the financial arrangements rules to the D&C Phase of a public-private partnership agreement._
2.  This determination is made under ss 90AC(1)(bb), 90AC(1)(d) and 90AC(1)(i) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This determination applies to the Partnership in respect of the Project (which is set out in detail in the Private Ruling), including the D&C Phase of the Project Agreement for each Facility, under which the Partnership agrees to design and construct the Facility for the Crown and will receive a fixed lump-sum payment (the D&C Payment) once the Facility is ready for operation.
2.  This determination is made subject to the following conditions:
    *   The design and construction costs of each Facility are agreed between the Partnership and the Crown on an arm's length basis and set out in the Base Case for the relevant Facility under the Project Agreement as referenced in the definition of "Design and Construction Payment" in clause 1.1 of the Project Agreement.
    *   Limited Partner A and Limited Partner C use IFRS to prepare financial statements and to report for financial arrangements. Any Taxable Limited Partner that does not use IFRSs to prepare financial statements and to report for financial arrangements will use the same spreading method as Limited Partner A or Limited Partner C as appropriate.
    *   The continued application of the Private Ruling.
    *   The final executed documentation is not materially different from the draft documentation that Inland Revenue received on 24 October 2014, 16 January 2015, 12 April 2015 and 23 April 2015.

### 4\. Principle

1.  During the D&C Phase of the Project Agreement, the Partnership will receive consideration from the Crown (in the form of the D&C Payment) for each Facility and will in turn provide consideration to the Crown (in the form of the completion of each Facility that is part of the Project and the transfer of its rights, set out in clause 12.2(c) of the Project Agreement, in each Facility). The D&C Phase of the Project Agreement for each facility is a "financial arrangement" under s EW 3 and an "agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services" under s YA 1.
2.  The Partnership and the Crown have agreed that each D&C Payment includes capitalised interest (clause 13.6(c) of the Project Agreement). The Interest Component of each D&C Payment will be income under the financial arrangements rules under subpart EW.
3.  During the D&C Phase for each Facility the Partnership has variable expenditure commitments that will accrue. The capitalised interest component of each D&C Payment is intended to offset the expected funding costs incurred on these commitments.
4.  The Interest Component is calculated with reference to expected funding costs.  No adjustment is made for variances between actual and expected costs as the D&C Payment for each Facility, including capitalised interest, is agreed in advance.
5.  The Interest Component of each D&C Payment needs to be spread over the term of the D&C Phase for the Facility to which it relates.

### 5\. Interpretation

1.  In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires:
    *   All legislative references in this determination are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated.
    *   Capitalised terms have the same meaning as set out in the Project Agreement.
    *   "IFRS" means International Financial Reporting Standards as defined in s YA 1.
    *   "Private Ruling" means Private Ruling BR Prv 18/01 issued on 26 January 2018, and includes any Ruling issued to replace that Ruling, provided that the change to the Ruling does not affect the application of this determination.

### 6\. Method

#### Calculation of Interest Component

1.  The value of the completion of a Facility and transfer of the Partnership's rights to the Crown, set out in clause 12.2(c) of the Project Agreement, is the agreed design and construction costs of the relevant Facility (excluding Fitout) set out in the Base Case for the relevant Facility under the Project Agreement.
2.  The D&C Payment less the agreed design and construction costs of the Facility (excluding Fitout) set out in the Base Case for the relevant Facility under the Project Agreement is the Interest Component that is income under the financial arrangements rules.
3.  The Private Ruling rules on the portion of the D&C Payment that is not income under the financial arrangements rules, and that portion is not considered in this determination.

#### Spreading of Interest Component

4.  The method for determining the amount of income that is to be allocated to each income year is as follows:
    
    1.  The expected design and construction costs of the Facility (excluding Fitout) as set out in the Base Case for the relevant Facility are treated as having been incurred at the beginning of each of the income years that make up the D&C Phase for each Facility (the Annual Expenditure). No adjustment will be made to the Annual Expenditure in any income year to reflect actual expenditure in that year.
    2.  The interest allocated to each income year is then calculated in accordance with the following formula:  
        Interest = OB x R
    
    *   Where:
    *   **OB** is the sum of the Annual Expenditure for that income year, plus the Annual Expenditure and interest attributable to any previous income year.
    *   **R** is the internal rate of return (based on annual rests) calculated using the notional cash flows in paragraph (a) above at the beginning of each income year as outflows, and the D&C Payment at the end of the D&C Phase as the only inflow.

### 7\. Example

This example illustrates the application of the method set out in this determination.

The Partnership and the Crown agree to the D&C Payment under the Base Case sheet that the D&C Payment equals $60,000.

The Base Case sets out that the agreed design and construction costs of the Facility (excluding Fitout) are to be $55,500.

The value of the "completion of the relevant Facility and the transfer of the rights set out in clause 12.2(c)" of the Project Agreement, as set out in clause 13.4(a) of the Project Agreement, is equal to $55,500.

The Interest Component of the D&C Payment is $4,500 by implication of the valuation under this determination.

The Taxable Limited Partners will each spread the Interest Component over the term of the D&C Phase of the Project Agreement, as follows.

The Annual Expenditure incurred and treated as having been incurred at the beginning of the relevant income year is as follows:

| Year | Actual D&C Costs |
| --- | --- |
| 1   | ($2,500) |
| 2   | ($35,000) |
| 3   | ($18,000) |
| D&C Payment | $60,000 |
|     | ($55,500) |

Based on receipt of the $60,000 D&C Payment in Year 3, the Project has an internal rate of return of 4.62%.

The Interest Component is therefore spread as follows:

| Year | Actual D&C costs | Cumulative | Interest income |

Application of financial arrangements rules to loans by NZ Dairy Farming Trusts to New Zealand resident farmers
===============================================================================================================

Determination S38 (15 May 2015) relates to the financial arrangements rules as applied to loans from NZ dairy farming trusts to NZ resident famers.

This determination may be cited as Special Determination S38: "Application of financial arrangements rules to loans by NZ Dairy Farming Trusts to New Zealand resident farmers."

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This determination relates to Loans between an NZ Dairy Farming Trust (the Fund) and New Zealand resident Farmers.
2.  The Fund will lend money to Farmers under the Loan Agreement.
3.  Loans from the Fund to Farmers will rank as junior debt of the Farmers.  In general, a trading bank will provide senior debt, working capital, transactional banking facilities (and other banking facilities) to Farmers.  For each Loan, the Fund, the trading bank and the Farmer will enter into an inter-creditor security agreement.  
4.  Under the Loan Agreement, a Farmer will pay:
    *   an Establishment Fee;
    *   Milk-Priced Interest;
    *   Land-Priced Interest; and
    *   Early Repayment Interest (if the loan is repaid before the agreed maturity date).
5.  Milk-Priced Interest will be payable monthly and will be charged at a single rate of interest for each 12-month milk season ending 31 May.   The Milk-Priced Interest rate for each milk season will be linked to Fonterra's prevailing Farmgate Milk Price for milk supplied for that season.  Fonterra forecasts the Farmgate Milk Price at the start of a milk season for the season and provides quarterly updates to the forecast.  If the forecast increases, Milk-Priced Interest payments for the season to date will increase and Farmers will make a catch-up payment as part of the next monthly Milk-Priced Interest payment.  When Fonterra finalises the Farmgate Milk Price for the season ended 31 May (generally in September), the Fund will calculate a final interest reconciliation and Farmers will make an adjustment payment.
6.  Land-Priced Interest is payable on maturity of the Loans, with the rate linked to the increase in a land price index (for the area in which the Farmer's Farm is located). 
7.  This determination applies to calculate and allocate the Fund's income and Farmers' expenditure under the Loans for each income year over the term of the Loan Agreement (other than the income year in which the base price adjustment is calculated). 

### 2\. Reference

This Determination is made under ss 90AC(1)(bb) and 90AC(1)(d) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope

1.  This determination applies to the tax treatment of the Loan Agreement by the Fund and Farmers.
2.  Farmers applying this determination pursuant to s EW 15E of the Act must meet the requirements of s EW 15E(1)(c). 
3.  In accordance with s EW 20 of the Act, this determination cannot be applied by Farmers who are able, and choose, to use the straight-line method to calculate and allocate income and expenditure under financial arrangements.
4.  The Funds will use IFRS to prepare financial statements and to report for financial arrangements.

### 4\. Principle

1.  The Loan Agreement is a financial arrangement under s EW3(3) of the Act that is not part of a wider financial arrangement.
2.  This determination specifies that the Milk-Priced Interest payable or accrued by a Farmer in an income year together with a portion of the Establishment Fee and a portion of the estimated Land-Priced Interest calculated by reference to the movement between:
    
    1.  the average level of the Index at the end of each quarter in the income year; and
    2.  the average level of the Index at the end of each quarter in the preceding income year;
    
      
    is income for the Fund in the income year and is expenditure for the Farmer in the income year.
3.  In the income year the Loan Agreement matures (or when the rights and obligations of the Fund or Farmers cease as specified in s EW 29 of the Act), the Fund and Farmers must calculate income and expenditure under the base price adjustment in s EW 31 of the Act.

### 5\. Interpretation

In this determination, the following expressions have the following meanings:

**the Act** means the Income Tax Act 2007.

**Establishment Fee** means the fee payable by the Farmer to the Fund when the funds under the Loan Agreement are drawn down.

**Farm** means a Farmer's farm land.

**Farmer** means the borrower under a Loan Agreement.

**Fund** means the trustee(s) of an NZ Dairy Farming Trust that enters into a Loan Agreement with a Farmer.

**IFRS** means International Financial Reporting Standards as defined in s YA 1.

**Index** means:

1.  the REINZ Dairy Land Price Index, or
2.  the PropertylQ Index, or
3.  a similar land price Index,

applying to the area in which a Farmer's Farm is located.

**Loan** means the funds advanced by the Fund to a Farmer under a Loan Agreement. 

**Loan Agreement** means a debt instrument issued by the Fund to a Farmer:

1.  for use in purchasing or developing the Farmer's Farm;
2.  for a fixed term;
3.  on an interest only basis;
4.  under which interest is payable by the Farmer to the Fund on loan principal, comprising:  
      
    monthly payments made during the term of the Loan Agreement pegged to Fonterra's forecasted Farmgate Milk Price, as adjusted for Fonterra's final Farmgate Milk Price for the year (Milk-Priced Interest); and  
      
    a balloon payment at the time the Loan is repaid at a rate equal to the percentage difference between:  
      
    the average level of the Index at the end of each of the last four quarters before the Loan is repaid; and  
      
    the average level of the Index at the end of the last four quarters before the loan was drawn down (Land-Priced Interest); and  
      
    any interest due as a result of early repayment of the Loan principal (Early Repayment Interest);
5.  under which the Loan principal is payable to the Fund at the maturity of the Loan Agreement.

**NZ Dairy Farming Trust** means a trust that is a New Zealand tax resident and is managed by AgInvest Holdings Limited or an associate, which lends money to Farmers under the Loan Agreement.

### 6\. Method

1.  The Fund's income for a Loan Agreement for an income year equals:
    1.  the Establishment Fee divided by the term of the Loan Agreement (in years);
    2.  the Milk-Priced Interest payable by the Farmer to the Fund for that income year;
    3.  a portion of the estimated Land-Priced Interest payment due on maturity of the Loan equal to:
        
        1.  in the income year the Loan is drawn down:
            *   Average level of the Index at the end of each quarter  
                in the income year – average level of the Index at the  
                end of the last four quarters before Loan drawn down  x Loan principal  
                Average level of the Index at the end of the last four  
                quarters before Loan drawn down
        2.  in following income years (except for the year in which the base price adjustment must be calculated):
            *   Average level of the Index at the end of each quarter  
                in the income year – average level of the index at the  
                end of each quarter in the preceding income year     x Loan principal  
                Average level of the Index at the end of the last four  
                quarters before Loan drawn down
        
          
        provided that no account will be taken of any movement in the average level of the Index below the average level of the Index at the end of the last four quarters before the Loan was drawn down.
2.  The Farmer's expenditure for a Loan Agreement for an income year equals:
    1.  the Establishment Fee divided by the term of the Loan Agreement (in years);
    2.  the Milk-Priced Interest payable by the Farmer to the Fund for that income year.  If the Farmer files its tax return before the Milk-Priced Interest is finally calculated for a period that falls within the income year, the Farmer should use the Milk-Priced Interest most recently calculated before the Farmer files its return;
    3.  a portion of the estimated Land-Priced Interest payment due on maturity of the Loan equal to:
        
        1.  in the income year the Loan is drawn down:
            *   Average level of the Index at the end of each quarter  
                in the income year – average level of the Index at the  
                end of the last four quarters before Loan drawn down         x Loan principal  
                Average level of the Index at the end of the last four  
                quarters before Loan drawn down
        2.  in following income years (except for the year in which the base price adjustment must be calculated):
            *   Average level of the Index at the end of each quarter  
                in the income year – average level of the index at the  
                end of each quarter in the preceding income year     x Loan principal  
                Average level of the Index at the end of the last four  
                quarters before Loan drawn down;
        
          
        provided that no account will be taken of any movement in the average level of the Index below the average level of the Index at the end of the last four quarters before the Loan was drawn down.

### 7\. Example

1.  This example illustrates the application of the method (set out in this determination) for determining the income and expenditure under the Loan Agreement for an income year.
2.  The example is based on a Loan Agreement as follows:
    
    |     |     |     |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Start date | 1 August 2014 |     |
    | End date | 31 July 2024 |     |
    | Loan principal | $1,000,000 |     |
    | Establishment Fee | $5,000 |     |
    | Milk-Priced Interest | Farmgate Milk Price | Interest rate |
    | Milk Price<$5.26 | 2.5% |
    | 5.25<Milk Price<$7.01 | 6% minus .02% for each cent below $7.00 |
    | 7.00<Milk Price<$9.01 | 6% plus .02% for each cent above $7.00 |
    | $9.00<Milk Price | 10% |
    | Land-Priced Interest | Principal Amount x the percentage difference between:<br><br>*   the average level of the Index at the end of each of the last four quarters before the Loan is repaid; and<br>*   the average level of the Index at the end of the last four quarters before the Loan was drawn down |     |
    
      
    _2015 income year_
3.  This example assumes that in the 2015 income year:
    *   The Farmgate Milk Price for the 2015 season is $7.50, so that the Milk-Priced Interest rate for the period to 31 March is 7.00% (6.00%+(.02% x50)).
    *   The average level of the Index at the end of each of the last four quarters before the Loan was drawn down was 103, and the average level of the Index at the end of each quarter in the 2015 income year is 106.
4.  Income to the Fund under this determination for the Loan for the 2015 income year will be:
    
    |     |     |
    | --- | --- |
    | Total Milk-Priced Interest payable to Fund for 2015 income year | $1M x 7.00% x 8/12 = $46,666.67 |
    | Portion of estimated Land-Priced Interest allocated to income year | $1M x((106-103)/103) = $29,126 |
    | Portion of Establishment Fee allocated to income year | $500 |
    | Total income under Loan Agreement for income year | $76,292.67 |
    
      
    _2016 income year_
5.  This example assumes that in the 2016 income year:
    *   The Farmgate Milk Price for the 2016 season is $5.10, so that the Milk-Priced Interest rate for the period 1 June 2015 to 31 May 2016 is 2.5%.
    *   The average value of the Index at the end of each quarter in the 2016 income year is 95, and the Farmer has a March balance date.
6.  Expenditure for the Farmer under this determination for the Loan for the 2016 income year will be:
    
    |     |     |
    | --- | --- |
    | Total Milk-Priced Interest payable to Fund for income year | $1M x 7.00% x 2/12 = $11,666.67  <br>$1M x 2.50% x 10/12 = $20,833.33 |
    | Portion of estimated Land-Priced Interest allocated to income year | $1M x ((103-106)/103) =-$29,126 |
    | Portion of Establishment Fee allocated to income year | $500 |
    | Total expenditure under Loan Agreement for income year | 3,874 |

Valuation of shares issued by bank following a non-viability trigger event
==========================================================================

Determination S39 (2015) relates to the valuation of shares issued by a bank following a non-viability trigger event.

This determination may be cited as Special Determination S39: Valuation of shares issued by Bank following a Non-Viability Trigger Event.

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This determination relates to a funding transaction involving the issue of Notes by Bank to Parent. The Notes will contain a conversion mechanism, in order to allow them to be recognised as Tier 2 capital for the purposes of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand framework relating to the capital adequacy of banks.
2.  Bank will enter into a Deed Poll, which will set out the steps that will occur in the event that a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs, requiring conversion of the Notes.
3.  If a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs, the relevant number of Notes must be immediately and irrevocably converted into ordinary shares in Bank.
4.  The Arrangement is the subject of private ruling BR Prv 15/25 issued on 27 July 2015, and is fully described in that ruling.
5.  The share subscriptions provided for in the Deed Poll are each a financial arrangement (as defined in s EW 3) and an “agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services” (as defined in s YA 1). The Notes and the share subscriptions are, together, a wider financial arrangement.

### 2\. Reference

This determination is made under s 90AC(1)(i) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This determination applies to a funding transaction involving the issue of Notes by Bank to Parent. Bank will enter into a Deed Poll, which will set out the steps that will occur in the event that a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs, requiring conversion of the Notes into shares in Bank.
2.  If a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs, the relevant number of Notes must be immediately and irrevocably converted into shares in the Bank. In summary, the steps for the conversion of the Notes will be as follows:
    1.  Each Note (subject to conversion) will become immediately due and payable and Bank will be required to repay the NZ$ equivalent of the A$ face value of the Note. All accrued but unpaid interest on the Notes will be cancelled.
    2.  Under the terms of the Deed Poll, Parent will be required to pay a sum to Bank equal to the NZ$ equivalent of the A$ face value of each Note converted, to subscribe for ordinary shares in Bank.
    3.  The number of ordinary shares in Bank to be subscribed for will be calculated in accordance with a formula set out in the Deed Poll.
3.  This determination applies in the situation that shares are issued by Bank to Parent following a Non-Viability Trigger Event, to determine the value of the shares for the purposes of the financial arrangement rules.

### 4\. Principle

1.  The share subscriptions and the Notes are, together, a financial arrangement (as defined in s EW 3). The subscription for shares in Bank by Parent contained in the Deed Poll is an “agreement for the sale and purchase of property and services” (as defined in s YA 1), as it is a conditional agreement to acquire property.
2.  The share subscriptions are not a “short-term agreement for sale and purchase” (as defined in s YA 1), as settlement is not required to occur within 93 days of the Deed Poll being entered into. As such, they are not excepted financial arrangements under s EW 5.
3.  For the purposes of determining the consideration paid or payable under the financial arrangements rules, the value of the shares issued by Bank must be established under s EW 32. None of subs (2B) to (5) of s EW 32 apply to the share subscriptions.
4.  Under s EW 32(6), the Commissioner is required to determine the value of the property. Bank is required to use this amount.

### 5\. Interpretation

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires:

*   **"Bank"** means the bank issuing the Notes.
*   **"Parent"** means the ultimate parent company of Bank.
*   **"Non-Viability Trigger Event”** has the meaning set out in the Deed Poll, as described in private ruling BR Prv 15/25, issued on 27 July 2015.
*   **"Notes"** means the notes issued to Parent as described in private ruling BR Prv 15/25, issued on 27 July 2015.

All legislative references in this determination are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated.

### 6\. Method

1.  The Arrangement does not involve the advancement or deferral of consideration.
2.  For the purposes of s EW 32(6), the value of the shares issued by Bank is equal to the amount paid for those shares by Parent.

### 7\. Example

This example illustrates the application of the method set out in this determination.

Following a Non-Viability Trigger Event, Notes with a face value of A$1,000 are to be converted to ordinary shares in Bank. Bank immediately repays the NZ$ equivalent of the A$ face value of the Notes to Parent.

Parent pays an amount equal to the NZ$ equivalent of the A$ face value of the Notes to Bank to subscribe for ordinary shares in Bank. Bank issues the number of shares to Parent calculated in accordance with the formula set out in the Deed Poll. The value of the shares, for the purposes of s EW 32, is the NZ$ equivalent of A$1,000.

This determination is signed by Fiona Heiford on the 27th day of July 2015.

Spreading method to be used by Infrastructure Provider in respect of the Provision of Services Agreement and valuation of shares issued under that Agreement
============================================================================================================================================================

Determination S40 (10 Aug 2015) relates to a company share incentive scheme where a customer commits to increase the volume of throughput processed by the company.

This determination may be cited as Special Determination S40: "Spreading method to be used by Infrastructure Provider Ltd in respect of the Provision of Services Agreement and valuation of shares issued under that Agreement".

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This determination relates to the Provision of Services Agreement (the Agreement) established between Infrastructure Provider Limited (IPL) and Provider Logistics (Provider).
2.  Under the Agreement, Provider commits to delivering a specified volume of freight to IPL each year for the duration of the Agreement, and to increasing the volume of freight over the duration of the Agreement (the Commitment).
3.  In consideration for the Commitment:
    *   IPL will issue shares to Provider, and
    *   Provider will grant IPL a call option.

4.  If Provider does not meet the Commitment over the term of the Agreement, IPL can exercise the call option to require Provider to sell shares back to IPL for nil consideration.  The combination of the share issue and the call option leave Provider in the net position that the number of shares it will retain in IPL is determined by the extent to which Provider meets the Commitment.
5.  For any of Provider's freight that is sent via IPL, IPL will provide freight services to Provider's freight handlers and will receive payment in return (the Freight Services Agreement).
6.  The Arrangement is the subject of private ruling BR Prv 15/29 issued on 10 August 2015, and is fully described in that ruling.
7.  The Agreement is a financial arrangement under s EW 3 and an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services as defined in s YA 1.  The Freight Services Agreements are short-term agreements for sale and purchase as defined in s YA 1.  Together, the Agreement and the Freight Services Agreement are a wider financial arrangement. 

### 2\. Reference

This determination is made under s 90AC(1)(bb) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This determination applies to the Agreement between IPL and Provider.
2.  Under the Agreement, Provider commits to sending freight to IPL's facilities as set out in the Commitment.  In consideration, IPL will issue shares to Provider and Provider will grant a call option over those shares to IPL.
3.  This determination applies to determine the spreading method to be used by IPL for the Arrangement. 
4.  This determination also applies when:
    *   Freight Services are provided by IPL to Provider's freight handlers, to determine the value of the services provided by IPL for the financial arrangements rules;
    *   Shares are issued by IPL to Provider, to determine the value of the shares issued by IPL for the financial arrangements rules.

5.  This determination is made subject to the following condition:
    1.  IPL will continue to recognise income derived from the Freight Services Agreement and deduct expenditure incurred in relation to the Freight Services Agreement under the Income Tax Act 2007 (primarily Parts C and D) (other than amounts dealt with under this determination).

### 4\. Principle

1.  The Agreement is a financial arrangement under s EW 3 and an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services as defined in s YA 1.  Together, the Agreement and the Freight Services Agreement are a financial arrangement as defined in s EW 3.
2.  The Freight Services Agreements are excepted financial arrangements (a short-term agreement for sale and purchase) under s EW 5(22).  Under s EW 6(3), all amounts solely attributable to that excepted financial arrangement are taken into account under the financial arrangements rules. 
3.  Under s EW 15I, because the financial arrangement includes in part an excepted financial arrangement, s EW 15C(1) does not apply and one of the methods in s EW 15I(2) must be used to allocate an amount of income or expenditure to an income year.
4.  One of the methods available under s EW 15I(2)(c) is a determination made by the Commissioner.
5.  To determine the consideration paid or payable under the financial arrangements rules, the value of the freight services provided by IPL and the IPL shares issued by IPL to Provider must be established under s EW 32.
6.  Under s EW 32(6), the Commissioner must determine the value of the services and shares. Both IPL and Provider must use this amount. 
7.  The only amounts payable under the Arrangement that must be spread under the financial arrangements rules are the amounts allocated to the issue of the IPL shares to Provider. 

### 5\. Interpretation

In this determination (and the Explanation), unless the context otherwise requires-

Words and expressions used (which have not been defined elsewhere within the determination) have the same meaning as in s YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

"Agreement" means the Provision of Services Agreement between IPL and Provider.

"IPL" means Infrastructure Provider Limited.

"Provider" means Infrastructure Provider Limited.

"Provider's freight handlers" means the freight handlers that are engaged by Provider to provide freight services for Provider's customers.

"Freight Services Agreement" means the agreements between IPL and Provider's freight handlers under which IPL agrees to provide freight services to Provider's freight handlers for consideration.

### 6\. Method

1.  The amount to be spread will not exceed the market value of the shares issued on the commencement date.  The market price will be determined by reference to the volume weighted average sale price of the shares on the NZX Main Board over the 20 business days prior to the date the shares were issued (subject to adjustment by the Board of IPL).
2.  The amounts to be spread in relation to the shares issued by IPL must be allocated to an income year by applying a method that treats the market value of the shares issued to Provider as, in substance, a volume rebate.  The amount of the rebate will be reported as a reduction in revenue to be recognised in each year that the rebate is earned (ie at the time it becomes reasonably clear that Provider's Commitment will be met).
3.  The amounts spread each year will be spread on a pro-rata basis based on the number of shares in each tranche that have been estimated each year will be eventually released from the call option.
4.  For s EW 32(6), the value of the shares issued by IPL is equal to the market price of the shares as at the issue date.  The market price will be determined by reference to the volume weighted average sale price of the shares on the NZX Main Board over the 20 business days prior to the date the shares were issued (subject to adjustment by the Board.  The same value will be used for any shares that are acquired pursuant to the exercise of the call option.
5.  For s EW 32(6), the value of the freight services provided by IPL under the Freight Services Agreement is equal to the price paid for the services by Provider's freight handlers.
6.  On termination of the Arrangement, a base price adjustment (BPA) will be calculated under s EW 31.  The BPA will take into account all consideration received by IPL (being the fees received by IPL for facilities services provided to Provider freight handlers and any amount paid by Provider on exercise of the call option calculated by reference to dividends received on those shares plus interest), and all consideration provided by IPL (being the facilities  services and the shares issued to Provider at the commencement of the Arrangement net of any shares (if any) that were acquired pursuant to the exercise of the call option).

### 7\. Example

This example illustrates the application of the method set out in this determination.

Under the Agreement, IPL has issued 1m in Tranche 1 shares (value approximately $100m ) and a further 1m in Tranche 2 shares (value approximately $100m to Provider).    

Provider's commitment to IPL under the Agreement consists of an initial volume commitment of freight and an increase in the volume of freight for each year the Agreement is in force.  Provided the Provider has satisfied the applicable freight commitment for each vesting period, the Agreement provides for a percentage of the Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 shares to be released from the call option every 3 years, and at year 10.  The percentage of shares available for release under the Agreement in each vesting period is set out below:

| Vesting Period | Years 1-3 | Years 4-6 | Years 7-9 | Year 10 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| % of Tranche 1 shares available for release | 30.00 | 30.00 | 30.00 | 10.00 |
| % of Tranche 2 shares available for release | 20.00 | 30.00 | 40.00 | 10.00 |

Further, assume that in year 1 IPL provides Provider's freight handlers with facilities services costing $ 30 m in return for fees of $100m.

At the end of every year, IPL will assess whether Provider has satisfied the Commitment for that year.  Where it appears likely that the Commitment will be satisfied, IPL will recognise a reduction to Revenue in the Income Statement for an amount equal to the value of the shares that are likely to vest in Provider as a result of satisfying its Commitment, and an increase to Equity will be recognised in the Balance Sheet. 

For example, in year 1, if Provider was considered likely to satisfy its Commitment, IPL would recognise a reduction in revenue in its P&L of $10m for the Tranche 1 shares and $6.66m for the Tranche 2 shares. 

The reduction in revenue recognised by Provider in each subsequent year (assuming that its Commitment is satisfied) is set out below:

| Deduction available to Provider if Commitment is  <br>satisfied: | Years 1-3 | Years 4-6 | Years 7-9 | Year 10 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| In relation to Tranche 1 shares/ year ($m) | 10  | 10  | 10  | 10  |
| In relation to Tranche 2 shares/ year ($m) | 6.66 | 10  | 13.33 | 10  |
| **Total deduction available/ year ($m)** | **16.66** | **20** | **23.33** | **20** |

The value of the shares for s EW 32 is $200m. 

The value of the services for s EW 32 is $100m. 

This Determination is signed by Dinesh Gupta on the 10th day of August 2015.

Application of the financial arrangements rules to a public-private partnership agreement
=========================================================================================

Determination S41 (4 Sep 2015) relates to the finance, design, build and ongoing services to a prison by a limited partnership under a PPP.

This Determination may be cited as Special Determination S41: "Application of the financial arrangements rules to a public-private partnership agreement".

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This determination relates to an arrangement (the Project) involving the finance, design, construction and on-going provision of asset management and facilities maintenance services in respect of a prison (the Facility) by a limited partnership (the Partnership) under a public-private partnership agreement (the Project Agreement) with the Crown. The Holding Partnership will be the sole limited partner in the Partnership, holding 100% of the Partnership.
2.  The sole limited partner in the Holding Partnership will be Investor Limited Partner, a limited partnership with multiple limited partners, some of whom are exempt from income tax. The limited partners of Investor Limited Partner that are not exempt from income tax are together referred to as the Taxable Limited Partners. This determination only applies to the Taxable Limited Partners and does not apply to those limited partners that are exempt from income tax.

3.  The Project Agreement comprises three basic components:
    *   A design and construction phase (the D&C Phase), under which the Partnership agrees to design and construct the Facility for the Crown in consideration for a fixed lump-sum payment (the D&C Payment) payable on completion of the D&C Phase;
    *   Leases of part of the Existing Facility and the New Facility by the Crown to the Partnership (together, the Facility Leases), under which the Partnership pays amounts representing the rental under the Facility Leases to the Crown (the Rental Prepayments); and
    *   An asset management and facilities maintenance phase (the AM/FM Phase), under which the Partnership will provide asset management and facilities maintenance services to the Crown in consideration for monthly payments (the Unitary Charge). Asset management and facilities maintenance service will be provided from the Applicable Service Commencement Date until the Actual Termination Date (a date specified in the event that the Project Agreement is terminated) or the Expiry Date, being 25 years from the Full Service Commencement Date.

4.  The Partnership has entered into an Early Works Construction Subcontract with a contractor (the Contractor), under which the Contractor will provide earthworks and any associated works that are required to form the building platform for the Facility.

5.  The Partnership will enter into:
    *   a D&C Subcontract with the Contractor, under which the Contractor will design and construct the Facility in consideration for monthly and milestone payments; and
    *   an Asset Management and Facilities Maintenance Contract (the AM/FM Subcontract) with a service provider (the Service Provider), under which the Service Provider will provide the on-going asset management and facilities maintenance (and other) services in consideration for monthly payments.

6.  The Partnership will raise external debt from third party financiers (the Senior Debt). The Partnership will enter into Interest Rate Swaps in respect of the Senior Debt.
7.  The Investor Limited Partner will provide investment support during the D&C Phase in the form of a standby letter of credit (the Letters of Credit) to the external lenders.
8.  The Facility Leases, AM/FM Phase of the Project Agreement, Early Works Construction Subcontract, D&C Subcontract and AM/FM Subcontract are all excepted financial arrangements.
9.  The D&C Phase of the Project Agreement, Senior Debt, Interest Rate Swaps and Letters of Credit are financial arrangements to which the Partnership is a party.
10.  The Project, including all of these agreements, is a wider financial arrangement.

11.  This determination prescribes:
    *   the amount of consideration that is solely attributable to the Facility Lease;
    *   how the financial arrangements rules apply to the AM/FM Phase of the Project Agreement, the Early Works Construction Subcontract, the D&C Subcontract and the AM/FM Subcontract;
    *     the method for spreading the payments made under the Senior Debt, Interest Rate Swaps and Letters of Credit.

### 2\. Reference

1.  This determination is made under ss 90AC(1)(bb) and 90AC(1)(h) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This determination applies to the Partnership in respect of the Project (which is set out in detail in Private Ruling BR Prv 15/35 issued on 4 September 2015), including the following arrangements:
    *   The D&C Phase of the Project Agreement, under which the Partnership agrees to design and construct the Facility for the Crown and will receive a fixed lump-sum payment (the D&C Payment) once the Facility is ready for operation (which is the subject of _Special Determination S42: Application of the financial arrangements rules to the D&C Phase of a public-private partnership_).
    *   The AM/FM Phase of the Project Agreement, under which the Partnership will provide on-going asset management and facilities maintenance services to the Crown in consideration for monthly payments. Asset management and facilities maintenance service will be provided from the Applicable Service Commencement Date until the Actual Termination Date (a date specified in the event that the Project Agreement is terminated) or the Expiry Date, being 25 years from the Full Service Commencement Date.
    *   The Facility Leases, under which the Partnership will lease the complete Facility (the New Facility Lease) and part of the existing Facility (the Existing Facility Lease) from the Crown and make the Rental Prepayments to the Crown. The leases commence from the Applicable Service Commencement Date until the Actual Termination Date (a date specified in the event that the Project Agreement is terminated) or the Expiry Date, being 25 years from the Full Service Commencement Date. The Rental Prepayment for the New Facility Lease will be equal to and will offset the D&C Payment.
    *   An Early Works Construction Subcontract and a D&C Subcontract with the Contractor, under which the Contractor will design and construct the Facility in consideration for payments under the D&C Subcontract.
    *   An AM/FM Subcontract with the Service Provider, under which the Service Provider will provide the on-going asset management and facilities maintenance (and other) services in consideration for payments under the AM/FM Subcontract.
    *   Senior Debt, under which the Partnership will borrow an agreed sum from external lenders for a term of 7 years from financial close of the Project (Financial Close). The Senior Debt will include a capitalising, interest only senior debt facility that converts to an amortising senior tranche on the Conversion Date and a debt servicing facility. It is expected that the Senior Debt will be refinanced within 7 years of Financial Close, and every 7 years thereafter over the term of the Project. Under IFRS (as the standards apply at the date of this determination), the Senior Debt (and any subsequent re-financings) will initially be recognised at fair value plus integral fees, and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method (regardless of whether hedge accounting is applied). The Senior Debt will not be treated as a hedge of another financial arrangement.
    *   Letters of Credit, under which Investor Limited Partner will provide equity support in favour of the Holding Partnership and the Senior Lenders. The Holding Partnership will pay Investor Limited Partner an annual Investment Support Fee for the provision of the Letters of Credit. The Investment Support Fee will be an arm's length fee.
    *   Interest Rate Swaps, under which the Partnership will pay a fixed rate of interest to the swap counterparties and receive a floating rate in return.

2.  This determination is made subject to the following conditions:
    *   The Taxable Limited Partners use IFRS to prepare financial statements.
    *   The Taxable Limited Partners will recognise income derived from the Crown during the D&C Phase of the Project Agreement and the AM/FM Phase of the Project Agreement, and will deduct expenditure incurred in relation to the Facility Leases, Early Works Construction Subcontract, D&C Subcontract and AM/FM Subcontract, in each case, under the relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007 (outside of the financial arrangements rules).
    *   The Taxable Limited Partners each do not use the Fair Value method for the Senior Debt if the Senior Debt is treated as a hedge of another financial arrangement under IFRS and uses for the other financial arrangement a method that is neither the IFRS financial reporting method nor the method required under Determination G29: Agreements for Sale and Purchase of Property Denominated in Foreign Currency: Exchange Rate to Determine the Acquisition Price and method for spreading income and expenditure.
    *   The Letters of Credit are not treated as a hedge of another financial arrangement.
    *   The Taxable Limited Partners will recognise income in respect of the D&C Payment in the manner prescribed by _Special Determination S42: Application of the financial arrangements rules to the D&C Phase in a public-private partnership_.
    *   The continued application of Private Ruling BR Prv 15/35 issued on 4 September 2015.
    *   The executed documentation not being materially different from the final documentation provided to Inland Revenue on 25 February 2015, 21 August 2015 and 28 August 2015 to the extent that it impacts on the scope of the determination or the application of the financial arrangements rules to the Applicants and the scope of the determination.

### 4\. Principle

1.  The Facility Leases are excepted financial arrangements under s EW 5(9). Any amount that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement described in ss EW 5(2) to (16) is not an amount that is taken into account under the financial arrangements rules (s EW 6(2)). This determination specifies the amounts that are solely attributable to the Facility Leases that are not taken into account under the financial arrangements rules.
2.  The AM/FM Phase, Early Works Construction Subcontract, D&C Subcontract and AM/FM Subcontract are "short-term agreements for sale and purchase" as defined in s YA 1, and are excepted financial arrangements under s EW 5(22). Any amount that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement described in ss EW 5(17) to (25) that is part of a financial arrangement is an amount that is taken into account under the financial arrangements rules (s EW 6(3)). This determination specifies that no amounts payable to or by the Partnership in respect of the AM/FM Phase, D&C Subcontract and AM/FM Subcontract are required to be spread under the financial arrangements rules.
3.  The D&C Phase, Senior Debt, Interest Rate Swaps and Letters of Credit are "financial arrangements" under s EW 3. This determination specifies that the payments made to or by the Taxable Limited Partners, in proportion to their share in Investor Limited Partner, under the Senior Debt, Interest Rate Swaps, and Letters of Credit must be spread under the financial arrangements rules in accordance with this determination.
4.  This determination does not deal with the treatment of the D&C Payment, which is subject to a separate determination (_Special Determination S42: Application of the financial arrangements rules to the D&C Phase in a public-private partnership_).

### 5\. Interpretation

1.  In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires:
    *   All legislative references in this determination are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated.
    *   Capitalised terms have the same meaning as set out in the Project Agreement.
    *   "Applicable Service Commencement Date" for the Existing Facility is the Existing Facility Service Commencement Date and for the New Facility is the Full Service Commencement Date.
    *   "Existing Facility Lease" means the lease of part of the Existing Facility.
    *   "Facility Leases" means the Existing Facility Lease and the New Facility Lease.
    *   "IFRS" means International Financial Reporting Standards as defined in s YA 1.
    *   "New Facility Lease" means the lease of the New Facility.
    *   "Project Agreement" is a public-private partnership agreement between the Partnership and Her Majesty, the Queen in right of New Zealand acting by and through the Chief Executive of the Department of Corrections (the Crown).
    *   "Rental Prepayments" mean the rent payable under the New Facility Lease and the Existing Facility Lease that is to be prepaid.
    *   "Senior Debt" means the external debt financing arrangements including the Construction Facility, the Term Facility and the Debt Service Reserve Facility.

### 6\. Method

1.  The Rental Prepayments paid in respect of the Facility Leases, and the property interest granted to the Partnership under the Facility Leases, are solely attributable to the Facility Leases and are not taken into account under the financial arrangements rules.

2.  The Taxable Limited Partners are not required to spread any amounts under the financial arrangements rules in respect of the:
    *   AM/FM Phase of the Project Agreement;
    *   Early Works Construction Subcontract;
    *   D&C Subcontract; and
    *   AM/FM Subcontract.

3.  The IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D may be used to allocate income and expenditure (other than "non-integral fees" as defined in s YA 1) over the term of the Senior Debt and none of the restrictions for application of the IFRS financial reporting method contained in s EW 15D(2B) apply.
4.  The IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D may be used to allocate income and expenditure (other than "non-integral fees" as defined in s YA 1) in respect of any subsequent refinancing of the Senior Debt over the term of the relevant refinancing, provided that the terms of any such refinancing are materially similar to the terms of the Senior Debt. This determination paragraph does not affect the Taxable Limited Partners' obligation to perform a base price adjustment under s EW 31 at the time of each refinancing.

5.  None of the mandatory spreading methods in ss EW 15H or EW 15I apply to the Interest Rate Swaps.  Over the term of the Interest Rate Swaps, income or expenditure may be allocated using either:
    *   the expected value method in s EW 15F (other than "non-contingent fees" as defined in s YA 1) provided that the swaps are not treated as a hedge of other financial arrangements for which the "fair value method" is used, or
    *   the IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D (other than "non- integral fees" as defined in s YA 1) provided that the swaps are not treated as a hedge of other financial arrangements for which a method other than the IFRS financial reporting method is used,
6.  provided that each Taxable Limited Partner uses the same method for the entire term of the Interest Rate Swaps.

6.  This determination does not affect the Taxable Limited Partners' obligation to perform base price adjustments under s EW 31 in respect of the Interest Rate Swaps.
7.  The IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D may be used to allocate income and expenditure (other than "non-integral fees" as defined in s YA 1) over the term of the Letters of Credit. None of the restrictions for the application of this reporting method in s EW 15D(2B) apply.

### 7\. Example

This example illustrates the application of the method set out in this determination.

This example is based on the following parameters:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Commencement of D&C Phase | 1 July 2015 |
| Completion of D&C Phase | 30 June 2020 |
| Completion of O&M Phase | 30 June 2045 |
| D&C Payment from the Crown | $1,000 |
| Aggregate payments to the Contractor | ($850) |
| Facility Lease prepayment | ($1,000) |
| Monthly payments from the Crown during the O&M Phase | $30 |
| Monthly payments to the Service Provider | ($15) |
| Annual interest on the Senior Debt | ($85) |
| Annual net payments in respect of the Interest Rate Swaps | ($7) |
| Annual Investment Commitment Fee for the Letters of Credit | ($7) |

The Taxable Limited Partners are not required to spread any amounts under the financial arrangements rules in respect of the Facility Leases, AM/FM Phase of the Project Agreement, Early Works Construction Subcontract, D&C Subcontract and AM/FM Subcontract.

The amounts that must be spread under the financial arrangements rules are:

*   Interest on the Senior Debt calculated in accordance with the IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D;
*   Payments in respect of the Interest Rate Swaps calculated in accordance with the expected value method in s EW 15F or the IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D;
*   Payments in respect of the Letters of Credit calculated in accordance with the IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D; and
*   Amounts in respect of the D&C Payment as specified in _Special Determination S42: Application of the financial arrangements rules to the D&C Phase in a public-private partnership_.

Application of the financial arrangements rules to the D&C Phase of a public-private partnership agreement.
===========================================================================================================

Determination S42 (4 Sep 2015) relates to payments received by a limited partnership for the design and construction of a prison under a PPP.

This Determination may be cited as Special Determination S42: "Application of the financial arrangements rules to the D&C Phase of a public-private partnership agreement".

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This determination relates to an arrangement (the Project) involving the finance, design, construction and on-going provision of asset management and facilities maintenance services in respect of a prison (the Facility) by a limited partnership (the Partnership) under a public-private partnership agreement (the Project Agreement) with the Crown. The Holding Partnership will be the sole limited partner in the Partnership, holding 100% of the Partnership.
2.  The sole limited partner in the Holding Partnership will be Investor Limited Partner, a limited partnership with multiple limited partners, some of whom are exempt from income tax. The limited partners of Investor Limited Partner that are not exempt from income tax are together referred to as the Taxable Limited Partners. This determination only applies to the Taxable Limited Partners and does not apply to those limited partners that are exempt from income tax.

3.  The Project Agreement comprises three basic components:
    *   A design and construction phase (the D&C Phase), under which the Partnership agrees to design and construct the Facility for the Crown in consideration for a fixed lump-sum payment (the D&C Payment) payable on completion of the D&C Phase;
    *   Leases of part of the Existing Facility and the New Facility by the Crown to the Partnership (together, the Facility Leases), under which the Partnership pays amounts representing the rental under the Facility Leases to the Crown (the Rental Prepayments); and
    *   An asset management and facilities maintenance phase (the AM/FM Phase), under which the Partnership will provide asset management and facilities maintenance services to the Crown in consideration for monthly payments (the Unitary Charge). Asset management and facilities maintenance service will be provided from the Applicable Service Commencement Date (i.e. for the Existing Facility from the Existing Facility Service Commencement Date and for the New Facility from the Full Service Commencement Date) until the Actual Termination Date (a date specified in the event that the Project Agreement is terminated) or the Expiry Date, being 25 years from the Full Service Commencement Date.

4.  The Partnership has entered into an Early Works Construction Subcontract with a contractor (the Contractor), under which the Contractor will provide earthworks and any associated works that are required to form the building platform for the Facility.

5.  The Partnership will enter into:
    *   a D&C Subcontract with the Contractor, under which the Contractor will design and construct the Facility in consideration for monthly and milestone payments; and
    *   an Asset Management and Facilities Maintenance Contract (the AM/FM Subcontract) with a service provider (the Service Provider), under which the Service Provider will provide the on-going asset management and facilities maintenance (and other) services in consideration for monthly payments.

6.  The Partnership will raise external debt from third party financiers (the Senior Debt). The Partnership will enter into Interest Rate Swaps in respect of the Senior Debt. The Investor Limited Partner will provide investment support during the D&C Phase in the form of a standby letter of credit (the Letters of Credit) to the external lenders.
7.  The Facility Leases, AM/FM Phase of the Project Agreement, Early Works Construction Subcontract, D&C Subcontract and AM/FM Contract are all excepted financial arrangements.  The D&C Phase of the Project Agreement, Senior Debt, Interest Rate Swaps and Letters of Credit are financial arrangements to which the Partnership is a party. The Project, including all of these agreements, is a wider financial arrangement. _Special Determination S41: Application of the financial arrangements rules to a public-private partnership_ applies to arrangements in the wider financial arrangement, excluding the D&C Payment.
8.  This determination prescribes the portion of the D&C Payment treated as income under the financial arrangements rules (the Interest Component) and the method for spreading that income.

### 2\. Reference

1.  This determination is made under ss 90AC(1)(bb) and 90AC(1)(i) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This determination applies to the Partnership in respect of the D&C Phase of the Project Agreement, under which the Partnership agrees to design and construct the Facility for the Crown and will receive a fixed lump-sum payment (the D&C Payment) once the Facility is ready for operation.

2.  This determination is made subject to the following conditions:
    *   The design and construction costs of the Facility are agreed between the Partnership and the Crown on an arm's length basis and set out in the Base Case under the Project Agreement as referenced to in the definition of "Design and Construction Payment" in Clause 1.1 of the Project Agreement.
    *   The Taxable Limited Partners use IFRS to prepare financial statements and to report for financial arrangements.
    *   The Taxable Limited Partners will recognise income derived from the Crown during the D&C Phase of the Project Agreement and deduct expenditure incurred in relation to the Early Works Construction Subcontract and D&C Subcontract under the relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007 (outside of the financial arrangements rules).
    *   The continued application of private ruling BR Prv 15/35 issued on 4 September 2015.
    *   The executed documentation not being materially different from the final documentation provided to Inland Revenue on 25 February 2015, 21 August 2015 and 28 August 2015 to the extent that it impacts on the scope of the determination or the application of the financial arrangements rules to the Applicants and the scope of the determination..

### 4\. Principle

1.  During the D&C Phase of the Project Agreement, the Partnership will receive consideration from the Crown (in the form of the D&C Payment) and will in turn provide consideration to the Crown (in the form of the completion of the Facility and the transfer of its rights, set out in Clause 11.2(c) of the Project Agreement, in the Facility). The D&C Phase of the Project Agreement is a "financial arrangement" under s EW 3 and an "agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services" under s YA 1..
2.  The Partnership and the Crown have agreed that the D&C Payment includes capitalised interest (Clause 12.8(c) of the Project Agreement). The Interest Component of the D&C Payment will be income under the financial arrangements rules under subpart EW.
3.  The Interest Component is calculated with reference to expected funding costs. No adjustment is made for variances between actual and expected costs as the D&C Payment, including capitalised interest, is agreed in advance.
4.  The Interest Component is calculated with reference to expected funding costs. No adjustment is made for variances between actual and expected costs as the D&C Payment, including capitalised interest, is agreed in advance.
5.  The Interest Component needs to be spread over the term of the D&C Phase.

### 5\. Interpretation

1.  In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires:
    *   All legislative references in this determination are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated.
    *   Capitalised terms have the same meaning as set out in the Project Agreement.
    *   “IFRS” means International Financial Reporting Standards as defined in s YA 1.
    *   "Project Agreement" is a public-private partnership agreement between the Partnership and Her Majesty, the Queen in right of New Zealand acting by and through the Chief Executive of the Department of Corrections (the Crown).

### 6\. Method

#### _Calculation of Interest Component of D&C Payment_

1.  The value of the completed Facility and transfer of the Partnership's rights to the Crown, set out in Clause 11.2(c) of the Project Agreement, is the agreed design and construction costs of the Facility (excluding Fitout) set out in the Base Case under the Project Agreement.
2.  The D&C Payment, less the agreed design and construction costs of the Facility (excluding Fitout) set out in the Base Case under the Project Agreement, is the Interest Component that is income under the financial arrangements rules.
3.  BR Prv 15/35 rules on the portion of the D&C Payment that is not income under the financial arrangements rules and is not considered in this determination.

#### _Spreading of Interest Component of D&C Payment_

4.  The method for determining the amount of income that is to be allocated to each income year is as follows:
    1.  The expected design and construction costs of the Facility (excluding Fitout) as set out in the Base Case are treated as having been incurred at the beginning of each of the income years that make up the D&C Phase (the Annual Expenditure). No adjustment will be made to the Annual Expenditure in any income year to reflect actual expenditure in that year.
    2.  The interest allocated to each income year is then calculated in accordance with the following formula:  
        
        *   Interest = OB x R
        
        Where:  
        **OB** is the sum of the Annual Expenditure for that income year, plus the Annual Expenditure and interest attributable to any previous income year.  
        **R** is the internal rate of return (based on annual resets) calculated using the notional cash flows in para (a) above at the beginning of each income year as outflows, and the D&C Payment at the end of the D&C Phase as the only inflow.

### 7\. Example

This example illustrates the application of the method set out in this determination.

The Partnership and the Crown agree under the Base Case sheet that the D&C Payment equals $250,000.

The Base Case sets out that the agreed design and construction costs of the Facility (excluding Fitout) are to be $240,000.

The value of the "completed Facility and the transfer of the rights set out in Clause 11.2(c)" of the Project Agreement, as set out in Clause 12.6 of the Project Agreement, is equal to $250,000.

The Interest Component of the D&C Payment is $10,000 by implication of the valuation under this determination.

The Limited Partners will spread the Interest Component over the term of the D&C Phase of the Project Agreement, as follows.

The Annual Expenditure incurred and treated as having been incurred at the beginning of the relevant income year is as follows:

| Years | Actual D&C costs |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | ($31,000) |
| **2** | ($77,000) |
| **3** | ($130,000) |
| **4** | ($2,000) |
| **D&C Payment** | $250,000 |
|     | ($240,000) |

Based on receipt of the $250,000 D&C Payment in Year 4 the Project has an internal rate of return of 1.5980%.

The Interest Component is therefore spread as follows:

| Years | Actual D&C costs | Cumulative | Interest income |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | ($31,000) | ($31,000) | $495 |
| **2** | ($77,000) | ($108,495) | $1,734 |
| **3** | ($130,000) | ($240,229) | $3,839 |
| **4** | ($2,000) | ($246,068) | $3,932 |
| **D&C Payment** |     | $250,000 |     |
|     | ($240,000) |     | $10,000 |

Spreading of income and expenditure under varied participants' debt arrangements
================================================================================

Determination S44 (21 Dec 2015) relates to the spreading of income and expenditure under varied participants' debt arrangements.

This Determination may be cited as "Special Determination S44: Spreading of income and expenditure under varied participants' debt arrangements".

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This Determination relates to financial arrangements between New Zealand Company Limited, the other Debtors and Participant Creditors, whose terms have been amended under a Restructured Debt Deed (RDD) in accordance with a Deed of Company Arrangement (DOCA). 
2.  The Debtors owe a significant amount of money to various parties.  The Debtors have been in financial distress and, immediately prior to the implementation of the DOCA and the RDD, were unable to repay all of their financial obligations.
3.  The Debtors entered into a voluntary administration, aimed at providing balance sheet relief and enabling a controlled sale of the Debtors' assets.  This involved the Debtors entering into, amongst other things, the DOCA and the RDD.   These documents have restructured the Debtors' liabilities and have affected the claims of many of the Debtors' creditors, including the Participant Creditors. 
4.  This Determination applies in respect of the Participants' Debts, which are owed to parties outside of the New Zealand Company Limited group of companies.
5.  Each Participant Creditor had amounts owing to it by the Debtors under the terms of existing agreements, being the Participant Creditor Claims.  The amounts include any interest, fees or other amount accrued, but unpaid, under the existing agreements up to, and excluding, the Restructuring Effective Date.
6.  From the Restructuring Effective Date, the Participant Creditor Claims have been compromised, amended and are now owed on common terms in accordance with the RDD and the DOCA. 
7.  Prior to the Restructuring Effective Date, the Debtors will use the IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D to allocate their income and expenditure from the Participants' Debts to income years.  This requires the Debtors to allocate their income and expenditure from the Participants' Debts in accordance with their IFRS accounting treatment.
8.  As a consequence of the RDD and DOCA, the Debtors' IFRS accounting method may change from the effective interest rate method to the fair value method.
9.  This Determination sets out a method the Debtors may use as an alternative to the IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D to allocate their income and expenditure from the Participants' Debts in and from the income year in which their IFRS accounting method changes, if their IFRS accounting method changes.

### 2\. Reference

This Determination is made under s 90AC(1)(bb) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This Determination applies to the Debtors in respect of the Participants' Debts.  The Participants' Debts have the following key terms.
2.  The Participants' Debts have been apportioned on the basis of one third into Tranche A and two thirds into Tranche B.  The two tranches are not legally separate debts.
3.  The Debtors' liability in respect of any amounts due to the Participant Creditors under the Participants' Debts is limited to the aggregate amount available for distribution by the Debtors (or any receiver, liquidator, voluntary administrator or statutory manager or similar insolvency practitioner) under and in accordance with the relevant Payment Waterfall contained in the RDD.
4.  The rate of interest applicable to Tranche A of a Participants' Debts in any Interest Period shall be the rate per annum (as determined by the Calculation Agent) equal to the sum of the relevant Margin and the Base Rate for the period applicable to the Tranche A amount outstanding from the Restructuring Effective Date.  Each Interest Period is three months.
5.  The rate of interest applicable to Tranche B of a Participants' Debts in any Interest Period shall be 0% per annum for the period applicable to the Tranche B amount outstanding from the Restructuring Effective Date.
6.  Interest shall be calculated on a daily basis at the applicable interest rate and accrued interest shall (subject to the Payment Waterfall and Limited Recourse provisions) be payable monthly on the Tranche A Debt on each Payment Date, on and from a specified date.
7.  The Debtors shall (subject to the Payment Waterfall and Limited Recourse provisions) repay the Participants' Debts, together with all unpaid interest accrued on the Tranche A amount of the Participants' Debts and any other sum due under the RDD, on the first to occur of the Final Distribution Date and the Final Maturity Date.  The Participants' Debts are all denominated in New Zealand dollars.
8.  The Debtors will be released and discharged from all Claims against them by the Participant Creditors on and from the Final Distribution Date.
9.  This Determination may be used by a Debtor for the Participants' Debts on the condition that the Debtor's accounting treatment for the Participants' Debts under IFRS changes from the effective interest rate method to the fair value method.
10.  This Determination does not apply to any of the Participants' Debts that are:
    *   a mandatory convertible note;
    *   an optional convertible note;
    *   an agreement for the sale and purchase of property denominated in foreign currency;
    *   treated as an equity instrument under IFRS;
    *   treated under IFRS by the relevant Debtor as a hedge; or
    *   not a financial arrangement (as defined in s EW 3).
11.  This Determination is made on the condition that:
    *   The amendment to the terms of the Participant Creditor Claims under the DOCA and the RDD did not result in the cancellation of those Participant Creditor Claims.

### 4\. Principle

1.  The Debtors may account for income and expenditure on a Participants' Debts using the same method as Method A or Method B (as appropriate) provided for in Determination G26: Variable Rate Financial Arrangements (Determination G26).
2.  For the purposes of applying these methods, the maturity date of the Participants' Debts is deemed to be the Final Maturity Date.  If the actual maturity date changes so that it falls in a different income year to the deemed maturity date, then the maturity date will be treated as extended (or reduced) to the actual maturity date.  An adjustment under Determination G25: Variations in the Terms of a Financial Arrangement (Determination G25) will be required on the actual maturity date, on the basis that the extension or variation is a change in the terms of the Participants' Debts.
3.  Under these methods, the income deemed to be derived or expenditure deemed to be incurred by the Debtors in a Period or an income year is calculated by adding together:
    1.  The amount of the Total Finance Charges Excluding Interest allocated to that Period (or income year); and
    2.  The amount of Interest payable or receivable in that Period (or income year).
4.  Method A and Method B find and then allocate the Total Finance Charges Excluding Interest to each Period or income year of the financial arrangement.  Once this amount has been allocated, the amount of Interest payable or receivable in that Period or income year is added to it.  This gives the income or expenditure for each Period or income year of the financial arrangement. 
    1.  Method A may only be applied to Small Discount or Premium Financial Arrangements.  It results in an allocation to each Period proportionate to the amount of principal outstanding in that Period, and the length of that Period.
    2.  Method B may be applied to other financial arrangements.  It assumes that the rate, price or index known to apply in the first Period applies to all subsequent Periods.  The Act and Determinations are used to spread the Total Finance Charges over the term of the financial arrangement.  The assumed Interest content of the Total Finance Charges in each Period (or in each income year) is then subtracted.

The yield to maturity method or other permissible method would be used for calculation purposes.

### 5\. Interpretation

In this Determination, unless the context otherwise requires:

*   Legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated.
*   Capitalised terms not otherwise defined in this Determination have the meanings set out in Determination G26, the RDD and the DOCA (as appropriate).  In addition:
    *   "Debtors" means the various debtor companies within the New Zealand Company Limited group.     
    *   "DOCA" means the Deed of Company Arrangement entered into between the Debtors, the Deed Administrators and the Directors of the Debtors, following approval by the requisite majority of the Debtors' creditors at a Watershed Meeting.
    *   "Final Distribution Date" means the date on which the final payment is made to the Participant Creditors in accordance with cl 12.3 of the DOCA.
    *   "Final Maturity Date" means the date that is a specified period from the Deed Commencement Date.
    *   "IFRS" means the New Zealand equivalents to the International Financial Reporting Standards in effect under the Financial Reporting Act 2013.
    *   "Participants' Debts" means the Participant Creditor Claims with the key terms (from the Restructuring Effective Date) specified in the Scope of this Determination.
    *   "Participant Creditor" means a creditor under a Participant Creditor Claim.
    *   "Participant Creditor Claims" means the various specified creditor claims.
    *   "RDD" means the Restructured Debt Deed entered into between the Debtors, the Deed Administrators and the Security Trustee in favour of the Participant Creditors.
    *   "Restructuring Effective Date"means the date on which the conditions precedent to the DOCA were satisfied, and is accordingly the date on which the Participant Creditor Claims became compromised, amended and owed on the terms set out in the RDD and the DOCA.

### 6\. Method

1.  The Debtors may use a method that is the same as Method A or Method B, as appropriate, contained in Determination G26 for the Participants' Debts in and from the income year in which their IFRS accounting method changes, if their IFRS accounting method changes.
2.  Method A may only be applied to Small Discount or Premium Financial Arrangements.  Method B may be applied to other financial arrangements.
3.  For the purposes of using these methods, the maturity date of the Participants' Debts is deemed to be two years and six months from the Restructuring Effective Date.
4.  If the actual maturity date occurs in a different income year to the deemed maturity date, the maturity date will be treated as having been extended or varied.  An adjustment under Determination G25 will then be required, on the basis that there will have been an extension or variation in the terms of the financial arrangement. 

### 7\. Example

This example illustrates the application of the methods set out in this Determination from the date the method applies (for an income year other than an income year in which a base price adjustment is performed).  The example is based on a Participant's Debt, as follows:

*   Tranche A portion:  1/3 of $100  
    Tranche B portion:  2/3 of $100  
    Interest on Tranche A portion:  6% per year  
    Accrued interest per year:  $2 (1/3 of $100 at 6%)  
    Total Finance Charges Excluding Interest: nil

Because there are no Total Finance Charges Excluding Interest, the Debtor may use Method A.  The Debtor will have expenditure of $2 for the accrued interest that is payable in that income year under Method A.  Because there are no Total Finance Charges Excluding Interest, the Debtor will not be required to spread anything further.  Therefore, the Debtor will not have any other income or expenditure for that income year in respect of either the Tranche A portion or the Tranche B portion.

For further examples, including examples of Method B where there are Total Finance Charges Excluding Interest, see the examples provided in Determination G26.

This Determination is signed by me on the 21st day of December 2015.

Spreading of income and expenditure under varied intra-group debt arrangements
==============================================================================

Determination S45 (21 Dec 2015) relates to spreading of income and expenditure under varied intra-group debt arrangements.

This Determination may be cited as "Special Determination S45: Spreading of income and expenditure under varied intra-group debt arrangements".

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This Determination relates to financial arrangements the terms of which have been amended under a Restructured Debt Deed (RDD) entered into by New Zealand Company Limited (NZCo) and the Administration Subsidiaries in favour of Participant Creditors, in accordance with a Deed of Company Arrangement (DOCA).
2.  NZCo and the Administration Subsidiaries owe a significant amount of money to various parties. NZCo and the Administration Subsidiaries have been in financial distress and, immediately prior to the implementation of the restructure, were unable to repay all of their financial obligations.
3.  NZCo and the Administration Subsidiaries entered into a voluntary administration, aimed at providing balance sheet relief and enabling a controlled sale of their assets. This involved NZCo and the Administration Subsidiaries entering into, amongst other things, the DOCA and the RDD. These documents have restructured the liabilities of NZCo and the Administration Subsidiaries and have affected the claims of many of their creditors.
4.  This Determination relates to the Intercompany Obligations, which are owed within the NZCo group of companies.
5.  Prior to the Restructuring Effective Date, certain Intercompany Obligations were owed between Administration Subsidiaries and NZCo. As from the Restructuring Effective Date, the Intercompany Obligations owing immediately prior to that date have become compromised and amended by each applicable Administration Subsidiary to NZCo, or by NZCo to the applicable Administration Subsidiary, in accordance with the RDD and the DOCA.
6.  Prior to the Restructuring Effective Date, NZCo and the Administration Subsidiaries will use the IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D to allocate their income and expenditure from their financial arrangements to income years. This requires NZCo and the Administration Subsidiaries to allocate their income and expenditure from their financial arrangements in accordance with their IFRS accounting treatment.
7.  As a consequence of the RDD and DOCA, the IFRS accounting method of NZCo and the Administration Subsidiaries may change from the effective interest rate method to the fair value method.
8.  This Determination sets out a method NZCo and the Administration Subsidiaries may use, as an alternative to the IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D, to allocate their income and expenditure from the Intercompany Obligations in and from the income year in which their IFRS accounting method changes, if their IFRS accounting method changes.

### 2\. Reference

This Determination is made under s 90AC(1)(bb) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This Determination applies to NZCo and the Administration Subsidiaries in respect of the Intercompany Obligations with the key terms set out below.
2.  Other than the Subsidiary Loan, the Intercompany Obligations are not interest bearing and will continue to be not interest bearing following the Restructuring Effective Date.
3.  The Subsidiary Loan is interest bearing and will remain interest bearing following the Restructuring Effective Date. Interest is payable on the Subsidiary Loan at the rate notified by Subsidiary, being the amount Subsidiary considers, in its reasonable opinion, is required to fund the outstanding balance of the loan. The interest rate is currently set at 5%. Interest is due and payable monthly, but any unpaid interest will be capitalised and form part of the principal.
4.  The liability of NZCo and each Administration Subsidiary in respect of any amounts due to each member of the NZCo Administration Group in respect of its Intercompany Obligations at any time is limited to the aggregate amount available for distribution by NZCo or any Administration Subsidiary, the Security Trustee, or any receiver, liquidator, voluntary administrator or statutory manager (or similar insolvency practitioner) of NZCo and/or an Administration Subsidiary at that time.
5.  The Intercompany Obligations are expressed to be repayable on demand under their original terms. Under the RDD, repayment may only be made to the extent it is necessary to facilitate a payment to third party creditors. The Intercompany Obligations are all denominated in New Zealand dollars.
6.  The Intercompany Obligations will be released and discharged, on and from the Final Distribution Date.
7.  This Determination is made on the conditions that:
    *   The Intercompany Obligations do not have any discount, premium, establishment fee or other finance charge.
    *   The accounting treatment under IFRS for the Intercompany Obligation of any party applying this Determination changes to the fair value method.
    *   Both parties to an Intercompany Obligation use the method in this Determination if the method is available for use by the respective parties.
    *   The amendment to the terms of the Intercompany Obligations under the DOCA and the RDD did not result in the cancellation of the Intercompany Obligations.

### 4\. Principle

1.  The Intercompany Obligations (other than the Subsidiary Loan) do not have any interest or discount, premium, establishment fee or other finance charge. Consequently, there is no income or expenditure arising for the parties to these Intercompany Obligations prior to the year in which a base price adjustment is required. Consequently, there is no amount of income or expenditure to allocate to any income year prior to the year in which a base price adjustment is required.
2.  The Subsidiary Loan has a variable interest rate, but no discount, premium, establishment fee or other finance charge. Accordingly, the income or expenditure allocated to an income year (other than an income year in which a base price adjustment is required) in respect of the Subsidiary Loan equals the interest receivable or payable for that income year, provided that the amount of expenditure allocated to an income year of the borrower under this Determination shall not exceed the amount of income allocated to the same income year of the lender (whether under this Determination or otherwise).

### 5\. Interpretation

In this Determination, unless the context otherwise requires:

*   Legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007.
*   Capitalised terms not otherwise defined in this Determination have the meanings set out in the RDD and the DOCA. In addition:
    *   "Administration Subsidiaries" means the various subsidiaries under administration.     
    *   "DOCA" means the Deed of Company Arrangement entered into between NZCo and the Administration Subsidiaries, the Deed Administrators and the Directors of NZCo and the Administration Subsidiaries, following approval by the requisite majority of their creditors at a Watershed Meeting.
    *   "Final Distribution Date" means the date on which the final payment is made to the Participant Creditors in accordance with cl 12.3 of the DOCA.
    *   "Final Maturity Date" means the date that is a specified period from the Deed Commencement Date.
    *   "IFRS" means the New Zealand equivalents to the International Financial Reporting Standards in effect under the Financial Reporting Act 2013.
    *   "Intercompany Obligations" means any claim that NZCo or the Administration Subsidiaries has against another member of NZCo or the Administration Subsidiaries.
    *   "NZCo" mean New Zealand Company Limited (subject to deed of company arrangement).
    *   "RDD" means the Restructured Debt Deed entered into between NZCo and the Administration Subsidiaries, the Deed Administrators and the Security Trustee in favour of the Participant Creditors.
    *   "Restructuring Effective Date" means the date on which the conditions precedent to the DOCA were satisfied, and is accordingly the date on which the Intercompany Obligations became compromised and amended under the RDD and the DOCA.
    *   "Subsidiary" means a specified subsidiary.
    *   "Subsidiary Loan" means the Intercompany Obligation owed by NZCo to Subsidiary.

### 6\. Method

1.  No income or expenditure will arise for the parties to the Intercompany Obligations, other than the Subsidiary Loan, prior to the income year in which a base price adjustment is required.
2.  For the Subsidiary Loan, the income or expenditure allocated to an income year by a party (other than an income year in which a base price adjustment is required) equals the interest receivable or payable for that income year, provided that the amount of expenditure allocated to an income year of the borrower under this Determination shall not exceed the amount of income allocated to the same income year of the lender (whether under this Determination or otherwise).

### 7\. Example

These examples illustrate the application of the methods set out in this Determination. The examples relate to an income year in which a base price adjustment is not required for the relevant Intercompany Obligation.

#### Example A

This example applies to an Intercompany Obligation, other than the Subsidiary Loan. The terms of the example Intercompany Obligation are as follows:

*   Principal: $100  
    Interest: 0%  
    Non Interest Finance costs: nil

There is no amount of income or expenditure to spread under this Determination.

#### Example B

This example applies to the Subsidiary Loan. The terms of the example Subsidiary Loan are as follows:

*   Principal: $100  
    Interest: 5% per year  
    Accrued interest per year: $5  
    Non Interest Finance costs: nil

NZCo has expenditure of $5 in the income year from the Subsidiary Loan under this Determination. Subsidiary has income of $5 from the Subsidiary Loan in the income year under this Determination.

This Determination is signed by me on the 21st day of December 2015.

Valuation of shares issued by bank on conversion of notes
=========================================================

Determination S46 (30 May 2016) relates to a funding transaction and value of shares when notes issued by a Bank to the NZ branch of its Australian parent company.

This Determination may be cited as Special Determination S46: Valuation of Shares Issued by Bank on Conversion of Notes.

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This determination relates to a funding transaction involving the issue of Notes by the Bank to the New Zealand branch of its Australian parent company. The Notes will contain a conversion mechanism, in order to allow them to be recognised as Additional Tier 1 capital for the purposes of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand framework relating to the capital adequacy of banks.
2.  The Arrangement is the subject of private ruling BR Prv 16/24 issued on 30 May 2016, and is fully described in that ruling.
3.  Each Note is a "financial arrangement" (as defined in s EW 3) consisting of a debt instrument and a contingent share subscription.

### 2\. Reference

This determination is made under s 90AC(1)(i) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This determination applies to a funding transaction involving the issue of Notes by Bank to the New Zealand branch of its Australian parent pursuant to a Deed Poll. The Deed Poll will set out the steps that will occur upon Conversion.
2.  If a Conversion occurs, the relevant number of Notes must be immediately and irrevocably converted on the relevant Conversion Date. In summary, the steps for the Conversion of the Notes will be as follows:
    1.  The rights of the New Zealand branch of the Australian parent in relation to each Note to be converted will be immediately and irrevocably terminated and repaid by Bank for an amount equal to the face value of the Notes.
    2.  The New Zealand branch of the Australian parent is taken to have irrevocably directed that any amount payable to it in accordance with paragraph (a) above will be applied by Bank by way of subscription for ordinary shares.
    3.  Bank will allot and issue the specified Conversion Number of ordinary shares to the New Zealand branch of the Australian parent in consideration for the payment by the New Zealand branch of the Australian parent of the subscription amount referred to in paragraph (b) above.
3.  This determination applies when shares are issued by Bank to the New Zealand branch of the Australian parent on Conversion to determine the value of the shares for the purposes of the financial arrangements rules.

### 4\. Principle

1.  The Notes are each a financial arrangement (as defined in s EW 3) consisting of a debt instrument and a contingent share subscription. The contingent share subscription is an "agreement for the sale and purchase of property and services" (as defined in s YA 1), as it is a conditional agreement to acquire property.
2.  The contingent share subscription is not a "short-term agreement for sale and purchase" (as defined in s YA 1), as settlement is not required to occur within 93 days of being entered into. As such, it is not an excepted financial arrangement under s EW 5.
3.  For the purposes of determining the consideration paid or payable under the financial arrangements rules, the value of the shares issued by Bank must be established under s EW 32. None of subs (2B) to (5) of s EW 32 apply to the share subscriptions.
4.  Under s EW 32(6), the Commissioner is required to determine the value of the property. Both parties are required to use this amount.

### 5\. Interpretation

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires:

*   All legislative references in this determination are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated
*   **Bank** means the bank issuing the Notes.
*   **The New Zealand branch of the Australian parent** means the parent company of the bank, acting through its New Zealand branch.
*   **Conversion** and **Conversion Number** have the same meaning as described in private ruling BR Prv 16/24, issued on 30 May 2016.
*   **Conversion Date** means a Trigger Event Conversion Date, Exchange Date or Change in Control Conversion Date as each of those terms are defined in private ruling BR Prv 16/24, issued on 30 May 2016, as relevant.
*   **Notes** means the fully paid, convertible, subordinated, perpetual securities issued by Bank to the New Zealand branch of the Australian parent.

### 6\. Method

1.  The Arrangement does not involve the advancement or deferral of income or expenditure.
2.  For the purposes of s EW 32(6) the value of the shares issued by Bank is equal to the amount the New Zealand branch of the Australian parent paid for those shares.

### 7\. Example

This example illustrates the application of the method set out in this determination.

Bank issues Notes having a face value of $100 to Holders. Following a Conversion Event, Notes having a face value of $100 are converted into ordinary shares in Bank. Bank immediately repays the face value of the Notes and applies the relevant amount on the New Zealand branch of the Australian parent’s behalf to subscribe for ordinary shares in Bank. Bank issues the number of shares to the New Zealand branch of the Australian parent calculated in accordance with the "Conversion Number" formula. The value of the aggregate shares issued, for the purposes of s EW 32, is $100.

This Determination is signed by me on the 30th day of May 2016.

Valuation of shares issued by Bank and HoldCo following a non-viability trigger event
=====================================================================================

Determination S47 (Oct 2016) relates to a funding transaction involving the issue of notes by a bank to the public pursuant to a deed poll.

This Determination may be cited as Special Determination S47: Valuation of Shares Issued by Bank and HoldCo Following a Non-Viability Trigger Event.

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This determination relates to a funding transaction involving the issue of Notes by the Bank to the public pursuant to a Deed Poll. The Notes will contain an exchange mechanism, in order to allow them to be recognised as Tier 2 capital for the purposes of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and Australian Prudential Regulation Authority frameworks relating to the capital adequacy of banks.
2.  At the same time that the Notes are entered into, Bank, HoldCo and Parent will enter into a Co-Ordination Agreement, which will set out the steps that will occur if a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs, requiring exchange of the Notes.
3.  If a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs, the relevant number of Notes must be immediately and irrevocably exchanged for ordinary shares in Parent. The Co-Ordination Agreement provides for a series of share subscriptions and payments from Bank to HoldCo and from HoldCo to Parent.
4.  The Arrangement is the subject of private ruling BR Prv 16/47 issued on 7 October 2016, and is fully described in that ruling.
5.  Each Note is a financial arrangement (as defined in s EW 3). The share subscriptions provided for in the Co-Ordination Agreement are each a financial arrangement (as defined in s EW 3) and an “agreement for the sale and purchase or property or services” (as defined in s YA 1). The Notes and the Co-Ordination Agreement are, together, a wider financial arrangement.

### 2\. Reference

This determination is made under s 90AC(1)(i) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This determination applies to a funding transaction involving the issue of Notes by the Bank to the public pursuant to a Deed Poll. At the same time that the Notes are entered into, Bank, HoldCo and Parent will enter into a Co-Ordination Agreement, which will set out the steps that will occur if a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs, requiring exchange of the Notes.
2.  If a Non-Viability Trigger Event occurs, the relevant number of Notes must be immediately and irrevocably exchanged. In summary, the steps for the exchange of the Notes will be as follows:
    1.  Each Note (subject to the exchange requirement) will be immediately transferred by the holder to HoldCo.
    2.  In consideration for the holders transferring their Notes to HoldCo, Parent will allot and issue a specified “exchange number” of Parent ordinary shares to such holders for each Note assigned.
    3.  Immediately following the transfer referred to in (a), the Notes will become immediately due and payable and Bank will be required to repay the Face Value of the Notes to HoldCo as assignee. Under the terms of the Co Ordination Agreement, the Face Value owed to HoldCo will be repaid by being applied on HoldCo’s behalf to subscribe for ordinary shares in Bank. The number of ordinary shares in Bank to be subscribed for will be calculated in accordance with a formula in the Co-Ordination Agreement.
    4.  Under the Co-Ordination Agreement, HoldCo will be required to pay a sum to Parent equal to the Face Value of each Note assigned to it. This amount will be automatically applied on Parent’s behalf to subscribe for ordinary shares in HoldCo. The number of ordinary shares in HoldCo to be subscribed for will be calculated in accordance with a formula in the Co Ordination Agreement.
3.  This determination applies in the situation that shares are issued by Bank and HoldCo following a Non-Viability Trigger Event, to determine the value of the shares for the purposes of the financial arrangements rules.

### 4\. Principle

1.  The Co-Ordination Agreement and Notes are, together, a financial arrangement (as defined in s EW 3). The subscription for shares in Bank by HoldCo and the subscription for shares in HoldCo by Parent contained in the Co-Ordination Agreement are both an “agreement for the sale and purchase of property and services” (as defined in s YA 1), as they are conditional agreements to acquire property.
2.  The share subscriptions are not a “short-term agreement for sale and purchase” (as defined in s YA 1), as settlement will not occur within 93 days of the Co Ordination Agreement being entered into. As such, they are not excepted financial arrangements under s EW 5.
3.  The the purposes of determining the consideration paid or payable under the financial arrangements rules, the value of the shares issued by Bank and HoldCo must be established under s EW 32. None of subs (2B) to (5) of s EW 32 apply to the share subscriptions.
4.  Under s EW 32(6), the Commissioner is required to determine the value of the property. Both parties are required to use this amount.

### 5\. Interpretation

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires:

*   All legislative references in this determination are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated.
*   **Bank** means the bank issuing the Notes.
*   **HoldCo** means the parent company of Bank.
*   **Notes** means the Notes issued to the public pursuant to a Deed Poll.
*   **Parent** means the parent company of HoldCo.

### 6\. Method

1.  The Arrangement does not involve the advancement or deferral of income or expenditure.
2.  For the purposes of s EW 32(6), the value of the shares issued by Bank is equal to the amount HoldCo paid for those shares, and the value of the shares issued by HoldCo is equal to the amount Parent paid for those shares.

### 7\. Example

This example illustrates the application of the method set out in this determination.

Bank issues Notes with a face value of $100 to the public. Following a Non-Viability Trigger Event, Notes having a face value of $100 are transferred to HoldCo by the holders of the Notes.

Bank immediately repays the face value of the Notes to HoldCo. This amount is automatically applied on HoldCo’s behalf to subscribe for ordinary shares in Bank. Bank issues the number of shares to HoldCo calculated in accordance with the formula in the Co-Ordination Agreement. The value of the shares, for the purposes of s EW 32, is $100.

HoldCo then pays an amount equal to the face value of the Notes to Parent. This amount is automatically applied on Parent’s behalf to subscribe for ordinary shares in HoldCo. HoldCo issues the number of shares to Parent calculated in accordance with the formula in the Co-Ordination Agreement. The value of the shares, for the purposes of s EW 32, is $100.

This Determination is signed by me on the 7th day of October 2016.

Spreading Method to be applied by Bank, valuation of shares issued by Bank on Conversion and solely attributable
================================================================================================================

Determination S48 (18 Oct 2016) relates to a funding transaction covering the issue of notes by a bank to its parent company pursuant to a deed poll.

This Determination may be cited as Special Determination S48: Spreading Method to be applied by Bank, valuation of shares issued by Bank on Conversion and solely attributable.

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This determination relates to a funding transaction involving the issue of Notes by Bank to Parent pursuant to a Deed Poll. The Notes will contain a conversion mechanism to allow them to be recognised as Additional Tier 1 capital for the purposes of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand framework relating to the capital adequacy of banks.
2.  The funding transaction is the subject of private ruling BR Prv 16/53, issued on 18 October 2016 and is fully described in that ruling.
3.  The agreement to subscribe for shares provided for in the Deed Poll is a financial arrangement (as defined in s EW 3) and an “agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services” (as defined in s YA 1). The Notes, the Deed Poll and the ordinary shares in Bank issued on Conversion are, together, part of a wider financial arrangement. That wider financial arrangement includes excepted financial arrangements being the ordinary shares in Bank.

### 2\. Reference

This determination is made under ss 90AC(1)(bb), 90AC(1)(h) and 90AC(1)(i) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This determination applies to a funding transaction involving the issue of Notes by Bank to Parent pursuant to a Deed Poll.
2.  If a Conversion occurs, the relevant number of Notes must be immediately and irrevocably converted. In summary, the steps for the conversion of the Notes will be as follows:
    1.  Bank will issue a specified number of ordinary shares in Bank to Parent for each Note to be converted.
    2.  Parent's rights in relation to each Note to be converted will be immediately and irrevocably terminated for an amount equal to the Issue Price of the Note to be converted. Bank will apply this amount by way of payment for the subscription of the ordinary shares referred to in paragraph (a).
    3.  Immediately following the transfer referred to in (a), the Notes will become immediately due and payable and Bank will be required to repay the Face Value of the Notes to HoldCo as assignee. Under the terms of the Co Ordination Agreement, the Face Value owed to HoldCo will be repaid by being applied on HoldCo’s behalf to subscribe for ordinary shares in Bank. The number of ordinary shares in Bank to be subscribed for will be calculated in accordance with a formula in the Co-Ordination Agreement.
3.  This determination applies:
    1.  if shares are issued by Bank on a Conversion of the Notes, to determine the value of the shares for the purposes of the financial arrangements rules;
    2.  to determine the spreading method to be used in respect of the Notes; and
    3.  to determine whether any amounts are solely attributable to the ordinary shares in Bank.

### 4\. Principle

1.  The Notes and the subscription for shares are, together, part of a financial arrangement (as defined in s EW 3). The agreement to subscribe for shares in Bank by Parent is an “agreement for the sale and purchase of property and services” (as defined in s YA 1), because it is a conditional agreement to acquire property. The shares in Bank are excepted financial arrangements (as defined in s EW 5(13)).
2.  The agreement to subscribe for shares is not a “short-term agreement for sale and purchase” (as defined in s YA 1), because settlement is not required to occur within 93 days. Therefore, the agreement to subscribe for shares is not an excepted financial arrangement under s EW 5.
3.  For the purposes of determining the consideration paid or payable under the financial arrangements rules, the value of the shares issued by Bank must be established under s EW 32. None of subs (2B) to (5) of s EW 32 apply to the share subscription.
4.  Under s EW 32(6), the Commissioner is required to determine the value of the property. Bank is required to use this amount.
5.  A person who uses IFRS to prepare financial statements and to report for financial arrangements can use the IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D. Bank uses IFRS to prepare financial statements and to report for financial arrangements.
6.  Under s EW 15I, because the financial arrangement includes in part an excepted financial arrangement, s EW 15C(1) does not apply and Bank must use one of the methods in s EW 15I(2) to allocate an amount of income or expenditure to an income year. One of the methods available under s EW 15I(2) is a determination made by the Commissioner.
7.  Under s EW 6(2), an amount that is "solely attributable" to an excepted financial arrangement described in any of ss EW 5(2) to EW 5(16) is not an amount that is taken into account under the financial arrangements rules.

### 5\. Interpretation

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires:

*   All legislative references in this determination are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated.
*   **Bank** means the bank issuing the Notes.
*   **Conversion** has the meaning set out in the terms of the Notes, as described in private ruling BR Prv 16/53, issued on 18 October 2016.
*   **Deed Poll** has the same meaning as described in private ruling BR Prv 16/53, issued on 18 October 2016.
*   **IFRS** means a New Zealand Equivalent International Financial Reporting Standard in effect under the Financial Reporting Act 2013, and as amended from time to time or an equivalent standard issued in its place.
*   **Notes** means the Notes issued to Parent pursuant to a Deed Poll.
*   **Parent** means the parent company of Bank.

### 6\. Method

1.  The funding transaction does not involve the advancement or deferral of income or expenditure.
2.  The IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D (as modified by s EW 15D(2)) must be used to allocate income and expenditure over the term of the Notes, provided none of the restrictions for application of the IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D(2B) apply to the Notes.
3.  For the purposes of s EW 32(6), the value of the shares issued by Bank is equal to the amount Parent paid for those shares.
4.  No amount of consideration paid or payable under the Notes or the share subscription is "solely attributable" to an excepted financial arrangement.

### 7\. Example

This example illustrates the application of the method set out in this determination.

Bank issues Notes having a face value of $100. Prior to the Notes being redeemed or converted, Bank will use the IFRS financial reporting method to allocate income and expenditure over the term of the Notes.

On a Conversion, Notes having an Issue Price of $100 are to be converted into ordinary shares in Bank.

Bank immediately pays an amount equal to the Issue Price of the Notes to Parent for termination of Parent's rights under the Notes. This amount is automatically applied on Parent’s behalf to subscribe for ordinary shares in Bank. Bank issues the number of shares to Parent calculated in accordance with the formula in the terms of the Notes. The value of the shares, for the purposes of s EW 32, is $100.

None of these amounts are solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement.

This Determination is signed by me on the 18th day of October 2016.

Application of the financial arrangements rules to a Public–Private Partnership
===============================================================================

Determination S49 (Oct 2016) relates to an arrangement involving the construction and provision of services for a facility by a limited partnership under a PPP.

This determination may be cited as _Special Determination S49: Application of the Financial Arrangements Rules to a Public–Private Partnership_.

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This determination relates to an arrangement (the Project) involving the finance, design, construction and provision of ongoing asset management and maintenance services in respect of the Facility by a limited partnership (the Partnership) under a public–private partnership agreement (the Project Agreement) with the Crown.
2.  Another limited partnership (Holdings) will hold a 100% interest in the Partnership. Holdings has four limited partners. Limited Partner A is exempt from income tax. Limited Partner B is a limited partnership with multiple limited partners, some of whom are exempt from income tax. Limited Partner C and Limited Partner D are both limited liability companies. Limited Partner C, Limited Partner D, and each limited partner of Limited Partner B that is not exempt from income tax are together referred to as the Taxable Limited Partners. This determination only applies to the Taxable Limited Partners and does not apply to those limited partners that are exempt from income tax.
3.  The Project Agreement comprises three basic components:
    *   a design and construction phase (the D&C Phase) under which the Partnership agrees to design and construct the Facility for the Crown in consideration for a fixed lump-sum payment (the D&C Payment), payable on completion of the D&C Phase;
    *   a Facility Lease to be entered into by the Partnership and the Crown under which the Partnership prepays an amount representing the rental the Partnership will pay to the Crown (the Rental Prepayment); and
    *   an asset management and maintenance phase (the AM&M Phase) under which the Partnership will provide asset management and maintenance services to the Crown over a 25-year term in consideration for monthly payments (the Unitary Payment).
4.  Partnership will enter into:
    *   a Construction Agreement with a contractor (the Contractor), under which the Contractor will design and construct the Facility in consideration for payments; and
    *   an Asset Management and Maintenance Contract with a service provider (the Service Provider), under which the Service Provider will provide the asset management and maintenance (and other) services in consideration for payments.
5.  The Partnership will raise debt (the Senior Debt) from Limited Partner A and various third-party financiers. The Partnership will enter into interest rate swaps in respect of the Senior Debt (the Swaps).
6.  Holdings will also receive funding during the D&C Phase from:
    *   Limited Partner A and Limited Partner B in the form of convertible debt instruments (the Convertible Notes); and
    *   Limited Partner C and Limited Partner D in the form of deferred equity contributions backed by letters of credit (the Letters of Credit).
7.  The Facility Lease, AM&M Phase, Construction Agreement, and Asset Management and Maintenance Contract are all excepted financial arrangements as defined in s EW 5. The D&C Phase, Senior Debt, Swaps, and Letters of Credit are financial arrangements as defined in s EW 3.
8.  The Project is the subject of two private rulings (BR Prv 16/64 and BR Prv 16/65, issued on 31 October 2016) and is described more fully in those rulings. The D&C Phase is the subject of _Special Determination S50: Application of the Financial Arrangements Rules to the D&C Phase of a Public–Private Partnership_, and the Convertible Notes are the subject of _Special Determination S51: Subordinated Convertible Note in Respect of a Limited Partnership Interest in a Public–Private Partnership_.
9.  This determination prescribes:
    *   the amount of consideration that is solely attributable to the Facility Lease;
    *   how the financial arrangements rules apply to the AM&M Phase, Construction Agreement, and Asset Management and Maintenance Contract; and
    *   the method for spreading the payments made in respect of the Senior Debt, Swaps, and Letters of Credit.

### 2\. Reference

This determination is made under ss 90AC(1)(bb), 90AC(1)(d) and 90AC(1)(h) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This determination applies to the Partnership in respect of the Project, including the following arrangements:
    1.  The D&C Phase of the Project Agreement, under which the Partnership agrees to design and construct the Facility for the Crown and will receive a fixed lump-sum payment (the D&C Payment) once the Facility is ready for operation. The D&C Phase is the subject of _Special Determination S50: Application of the Financial Arrangements Rules to the D&C Phase of a Public–Private Partnership_, so is not covered by this determination.
    2.  The AM&M Phase of the Project Agreement, under which the Partnership will provide ongoing asset management and maintenance services for 25 years to the Crown in consideration for monthly payments.
    3.  The Facility Lease, under which the Partnership will lease the Facility from the Crown for 25 years and prepay the rental to the Crown (the Rental Prepayment). This payment will be equal to and will offset the payment receivable in relation to the D&C Phase.
    4.  Construction Agreement with the Contractor, under which the Contractor will design and construct the Facility in consideration for payments. The Construction Agreement will:
        1.  provide for periodic invoices to be rendered by the subcontractor; and
        2.  require that payment be made within 93 days of an invoice being rendered.
    5.  An Asset Management and Maintenance Contract with the Service Provider, under which the Service Provider will provide the ongoing asset management and maintenance (and other) services in consideration for payments. The Asset Management and Maintenance Contract will:
        1.  provide for periodic invoices to be rendered by the subcontractor; and
        2.  require that payment be made within 93 days of an invoice being rendered.
    6.  Senior Debt, under which the Partnership will borrow an agreed sum from external lenders and Limited Partner A for a term of approximately seven years from financial close of the Project (Financial Close). The Senior Debt will be:
        
        1.  a capitalising, interest-only senior debt facility that converts to an amortising senior tranche on the Conversion Date and a Debt Service Reserve Facility; and
        2.  refinanced within approximately seven years of Financial Close and every five years thereafter over the term of the Project.
        
        In this determination, references to the Senior Debt include any refinancing of that debt on materially the same terms.  
          
        Under IFRS (as the standards apply at the date of this determination), the Senior Debt initially will be recognised at fair value plus integral fees, and will be subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method (regardless of whether or not hedge accounting is applied), and will not be treated as a hedge of another financial arrangement.
    7.  Swaps, under which the Partnership will manage the floating interest rate risk on the Senior Debt tranche during the first seven years of the Project.
    8.  Convertible Notes, under which Limited Partner A and Limited Partner B provide funding during the D&C Phase. The Convertible Notes are the subject of _Special Determination S51: Subordinated Convertible Note in Respect of a Limited Partnership Interest in a Public–Private Partnership_, so are not covered by this determination.
    9.  Letters of Credit, under which Limited Partner C and Limited Partner D provide and maintain investment support.
2.  Limited Partner B, Limited Partner C and Limited Partner D use IFRSs to prepare financial statements and to report for financial arrangements. Any Taxable Limited Partner that does not use IFRSs to prepare financial statements and to report for financial arrangements will use the same spreading method as Limited Partner B.
3.  The Taxable Limited Partners will recognise income derived from the Crown and will deduct expenditure incurred, under the relevant provisions of the Act to the extent that the financial arrangement rules do not apply to those amounts.
4.  This determination is made subject to the following conditions:
    1.  This determination shall only apply to a Taxable Limited Partner if such Taxable Limited Partner recognises income and expenditure in respect of the Convertible Note in the manner prescribed by _Special Determination S51: Subordinated Convertible Note in Respect of a Limited Partnership Interest in a Public–Private Partnership_.
    2.  This determination shall only apply to a Taxable Limited Partner if such Taxable Limited Partner recognises income in respect of the D&C Payment in the manner prescribed by _Special Determination S50: Application of the Financial Arrangements Rules to the D&C Phase of a Public–Private Partnership_.
    3.  Private rulings BR Prv 16/64 and BR Prv 16/65 issued on 31 October 2016 continue to apply (under s 91EB of the Tax Administration Act 1994).

### 4\. Principle

1.  The Facility Lease is an excepted financial arrangement under s EW 5(9).
2.  The AM&M Phase, Construction Agreement, and Asset Management and Maintenance Contract are “short-term agreements for sale and purchase” (as defined in s YA 1). Therefore, they are excepted financial arrangements under s EW 5(22).
3.  The Senior Debt, Swaps and Letters of Credit are “financial arrangements” under s EW 3.
4.  Together, all of these financial arrangements and excepted financial arrangements (as well as the D&C Phase and Convertible Notes) are a wider “financial arrangement” under s EW 3.
5.  Any amount that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement described in s EW 5(2) to (16) is not an amount that is taken into account under the financial arrangements rules (s EW 6(2)). Any amount that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement described in s EW 5(17) to (25) is an amount that is taken into account under the financial arrangements rules (s EW 6(3)).
6.  This determination specifies:
    1.  the amounts that are solely attributable to the Facility Lease and not taken into account under the financial arrangements rules;
    2.  whether any amounts payable in respect of the AM&M Phase, Construction Agreement, and Asset Management and Maintenance Contract are required to be spread under the financial arrangements rules; and
    3.  how payments made under the Senior Debt, Swaps and Letters of Credit must be spread under the financial arrangements rules.

### 5\. Interpretation

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires:

*   All legislative references in this determination are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated.
*   **IFRS** means a New Zealand Equivalent International Financial Reporting Standard in effect under the Financial Reporting Act 2013, and as amended from time to time or an equivalent standard issued in its place.

### 6\. Method

1.  The amounts that are solely attributable to the Facility Lease and not taken into account under the financial arrangements rules are the:
    *   Rental Prepayment; and
    *   property interest granted to the Partnership.
2.  The Taxable Limited Partners do not have any amounts to spread under the financial arrangements rules in respect of the:
    *   AM&M Phase;
    *   Construction Agreement; and
    *   Asset Management and Maintenance Contract.
3.  The IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D may be used by the Taxable Limited Partners to allocate income and expenditure (other than “non-integral fees” as defined in s YA 1) over the term of the Senior Debt (including any refinancing). None of the restrictions for the application of this reporting method in s EW 15D(2B) apply.
4.  None of the mandatory spreading methods in s EW 15H or s EWI 15I apply to the Swaps. Over the term of the Swaps, income or expenditure may be allocated using either:
    *   the expected value method in s EW 15F (other than “non-contingent fees” as defined in s YA 1) provided that the Swaps are not treated as a hedge of other financial arrangements for which the “fair value method” is used and provided that the relevant Taxable Limited Partner has notified the Commissioner of its decision to use this method; or
    *   the IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D (other than “non-integral fees” as defined in s YA 1) provided that the Swaps are not treated as a hedge of other financial arrangements for which a method other than the IFRS financial reporting method is used,provided that this paragraph 6.4 shall only apply to a Taxable Limited Partner is such Taxable Limited Partner uses the same method for the entire term of the relevant swap and that the method is consistent with s EW 24.
5.  This determination does not affect the Taxable Limited Partners’ obligation to perform base price adjustments under s EW 31 in respect of the Swaps and the Senior Debt at the time of any refinancing.
6.  The IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D may be used to allocated income and expenditure (other than “non-integral fees” as defined in s YA 1) over the term of the Letters of Credit, provided the Letters of Credit are not treated as a hedge of another financial arrangement. None of the restrictions for the application of this reporting method in s EW 15D(2B) apply.

### 7\. Example

This example illustrates the application of the method set out in this determination.

This example is based on the following parameters:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Commencement of D&C Phase | 1 December 2016 |
| Completion of D&C Phase | 1 December 2021 |
| Completion of AM&M Phase | 1 December 2046 |
| D&C Payment from the Crown | $1,000 |
| Aggregrate payments to the Contractor | ($850) |
| Facility Lease prepayment | ($1,000) |
| Monthly payments from the Crown during the AM&M Phase | $30 |
| Monthly payments to the Service Provider | ($15) |
| Annual interest on the Senior Debt | ($85) |
| Annual interest on the Convertible Note | ($15) |
| Annual net payments in respect of the Swaps | ($7) |
| Annual Investment Commitment Fee for the Letter of Credit | ($7) |

The Taxable Limited Partners are not required to spread any amounts under the financial arrangements rules in respect of the:

*   Facility Lease;
*   AM&M Phase;
*   Construction Agreement; or
*   Asset Management and Maintenance Contract.

The amounts that must be spread by the Taxable Limited Partners under the financial arrangements rules in accordance with this determination are:

*   interest on the Senior Debt calculated in accordance with the IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D;
*   payments in respect of the Swaps calculated in accordance with the expected value method in s EW 15F or the IFRS reporting method in s EW 15D; and
*   payments in respect of the Letters of Credit calculated in accordance with the IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D.

The Taxable Limited Partners must also apply:

*   _Special Determination S50: Application of the Financial Arrangements Rules to the D&C Phase of a Public–Private Partnership_; and
*   _Special Determination S51: Subordinated Convertible Note in Respect of a Limited Partnership Interest in a Public–Private Partnership_.

This Determination is signed by me on the 31st day of October 2016.

Application of the financial arrangements rules to the D&C Phase of a Public-Private Partnership
================================================================================================

Determination S50 (31 Oct 2016) relates to the application of the financial arrangement rules to the design and construction phase of a PPP.

This Determination may be cited as _Special Determination S50: Application of the Financial Arrangements Rules to the D&C Phase of a Public-Private Partnership_.

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This determination relates to an arrangement (the Project) involving the finance, design, construction and provision of ongoing asset management and maintenance services in respect of the Facility by a limited partnership (the Partnership) under a public–private partnership agreement (the Project Agreement) with the Crown.
2.  Another limited partnership (Holdings) will hold a 100% interest in the Partnership. Holdings has four limited partners. Limited Partner A is exempt from income tax. Limited Partner B is a limited partnership with multiple limited partners, some of whom are exempt from income tax. Limited Partner C and Limited Partner D are both limited liability companies. Limited Partner C, Limited Partner D, and each limited partner of Limited Partner B that is not exempt from income tax are together referred to as the Taxable Limited Partners. This determination only applies to the Taxable Limited Partners and does not apply to those limited partners that are exempt from income tax.
3.  This Project Agreement comprises three basic components:
    *   a design and construction phase (the D&C Phase) under which the Partnership agrees to design and construct the Facility for the Crown in consideration for a fixed lump-sum payment (the D&C Payment), payable on completion of the D&C Phase;
    *   a Facility Lease to be entered into by the Partnership and the Crown under which the Partnership prepays an amount representing the rental the Partnership will pay to the Crown (the Rental Prepayment); and
    *   an asset management and maintenance phase (the AM&M Phase) under which the Partnership will provide asset management and maintenance services to the Crown over a 25-year term in consideration for monthly payments (the Unitary Payment).
4.  The Partnership will enter into:
    *   a Construction Agreement with a contractor (the Contractor), under which the Contractor will design and construct the Facility in consideration for payments; and
    *   an Asset Management and Maintenance Contract with a service provider (the Service Provider), under which the Service Provider will provide the asset management and maintenance (and other) services in consideration for payments.
5.  The Partnership will raise debt (the Senior Debt) from Limited Partner A and various third-party financiers. The Partnership will enter into interest rate swaps in respect of the Senior Debt (the Swaps).
6.  Holdings will also receive funding during the D&C Phase from:
    *   Limited Partner A and Limited Partner B in the form of convertible debt instruments (the Convertible Notes); and
    *   Limited Partner C and Limited Partner D in the form of deferred equity contributions backed by letters of credit (the Letters of Credit).
7.  Facility Lease, AM&M Phase, Construction Agreement, and Asset Management and Maintenance Contract are all excepted financial arrangements as defined in s EW 5. The D&C Phase, Senior Debt, Swaps, and Letters of Credit are financial arrangements as defined in s EW 3. The Project, including all of these agreements, is a wider financial arrangement. _Special Determination S49: Application of the Financial Arrangements Rules to a Public¬ Private PartnershipSpecial Determination S51: Subordinated Convertible Note in Respect of a Limited Partnership Interest in a Public–Private Partnership_ applies to the Convertible Notes.
8.  This determination prescribes:
    *   the portion of the D&C Payment treated as income under the financial arrangements rules (the Interest Component); and
    *   the method for spreading that income over the term of the D&C Phase.

### 2\. Reference

This determination is made under ss 90AC(1)(bb), 90AC(1)(d) and 90AC(1)(i) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This determination applies to the Partnership in respect of the D&C Phase of the Project Agreement, under which the Partnership agrees to design and construct the Facility for the Crown and will receive a fixed lump-sum payment (the D&C Payment) once the Facility is ready for operation.
2.  Limited Partner B, Limited Partner C and Limited Partner D use IFRSs to prepare financial statements and to report for financial arrangements.
3.  The Taxable Limited Partners will recognise income derived from the Crown during the D&C Phase of the Project Agreement and deduct expenditure incurred in relation to the Construction Agreement under the relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007 (outside of the financial arrangements rules).
4.  This determination is made subject to the following conditions:
    *   The design and construction costs of the Facility are agreed between the Partnership and the Crown on an arm's length basis and set out in the Base Case under the Project Agreement as referenced to in the definition of "Design and Construction Payment" in Clause 1.1 of the Project Agreement.
    *   Private rulings BR Prv 16/64 and BR Prv 16/65 issued on 31 October 2016 continue to apply (under s 91EB of the Tax Administration Act 1994).

### 4\. Principle

1.  During the D&C Phase, the Partnership will receive consideration from the Crown (in the form of the D&C Payment) and will in turn provide consideration to the Crown (in the form of the completion of the Facility, including the transfer of the rights set out in clause 11.2 of the Project Agreement). The D&C Phase is a “financial arrangement” under s EW 3 and an “agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services” under s YA 1.
2.  The Partnership and the Crown have agreed that the D&C Payment includes capitalised interest (clause 12.5(c) of the Project Agreement). The Interest Component of the D&C Payment will be income under the financial arrangements rules in subpart EW.
3.  During the D&C Phase the Partnership will accrue variable expenditure commitments. The capitalised interest component of the D&C Payment is intended to offset the expected funding costs incurred in relation to these commitments.
4.  The Interest Component is calculated with reference to expected funding costs. No adjustment is made for variances between actual and expected costs as the D&C Payment, including capitalised interest, is agreed in advance.
5.  The Interest Component needs to be spread over the term of the D&C Phase.

### 5\. Interpretation

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires:

*   All legislative references in this determination are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated.
*   **IFRS** means a New Zealand Equivalent International Financial Reporting Standard in effect under the Financial Reporting Act 2013, and as amended from time to time or an equivalent standard issued in its place.

### 6\. Method

#### Calculation of the interest component of the D&C Payment

1.  The value of the completed Facility (including the transfer of the rights under clause 11.2(c) of the Project Agreement) is the agreed design and construction costs of the Facility (excluding Fitout) set out in the Base Case under the Project Agreement.
2.  The D&C Payment, less the agreed design and construction costs of the Facility (excluding Fitout) set out in the Base Case under the Project Agreement, is the Interest Component that is income under the financial arrangements rules.
3.  Private Ruling BR Prv 16/65 rules on the portion of the D&C Payment that is not income under the financial arrangements rules and is not considered in this determination.

#### Spreading of the interest component of the D&C Payment

4.  The method for determining the amount of income that is to be allocated to each income year is as follows:
    1.  The expected design and construction costs of the Facility (excluding Fitout) as set out in the Base Case are treated as having been incurred at the beginning of each of the income years that make up the D&C Phase (the Annual Expenditure). No adjustment will be made to the Annual Expenditure in any income year to reflect actual expenditure in that year.
    2.  The interest allocated to each income year is then calculated in accordance with the following formula:
        
        > Interest = OB x R
        
        Where:  
          
        **OB** is the sum of the Annual Expenditure for that income year, plus the Annual Expenditure and interest attributable to any previous income year.  
          
        **R**

### 7\. Example

This example illustrates the application of the method set out in this determination.

The Partnership and the Crown agree under the Base Case that the D&C Payment equals $250,000.

The Base Case sets out that the agreed design and construction costs of the Facility (excluding Fitout) are to be $240,000. This is value of the completed facility (including the transfer of the Partnership’s rights as set out in clause 11.2 of the Project Agreement).

The Interest Component of the D&C Payment is $10,000 by implication of the valuation under this determination.

The Taxable Limited Partners will spread the Interest Component over the term of the D&C Phase of the Project Agreement, as follows:

The Annual Expenditure incurred and treated as having been incurred at the beginning of the relevant income year is as follows:

| Years | Actual D&C costs |
| --- | --- |
| **1** | ($31,000) |
| **2** | ($77,000) |
| **3** | ($130,000) |
| **4** | ($2,000) |
| **D&C Payment** | $250,000 |
|     | ($240,000) |

Based on receipt of the $250,000 D&C Payment in Year 4, the Project has an internal rate of return of 1.5980%.

The Interest Component is therefore spread as follows:

| Years | Actual D&C costs | Cumulative | Interest income |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | ($31,000) | ($31,000) | $495 |
| 2   | ($77,000) | ($108,495) | $1,734 |
| 3   | ($130,00) | ($240,229) | $3,839 |
| 4   | ($2,000) | ($246,068) | $3,932 |
| D&C payment |     | $250,000 |     |
|     | ($240,000) |     | $10,000 |

This Determination is signed by me on the 31st day of October 2016.

Subordinated Convertible Note in respect of a Limited Partnership Interest in a Public–Private Partnership
==========================================================================================================

Determination S51 (31 Oct 2016) relates to the issue of subordinated convertible notes by a limited partnership to two of its limited partners.

This determination may be cited as _Special Determination S51: Subordinated Convertible Note in Respect of a Limited Partnership Interest in a Public–Private Partnership_.

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This determination relates to the issue of subordinated convertible notes (Convertible Notes) by a limited partnership (the Partnership) to two of its limited partners (Limited Partner A and Limited Partner B – the Subscribers). The Convertible Notes will convert to a 40% partnership interest (for each of the Subscribers) at a single, or several, nominated date(s) in the future to match the partnership contributions by the other two limited partners in the Partnership (Limited Partner C and Limited Partner D).
2.  Limited Partner A is exempt from income tax. Limited Partner B is a limited partnership with multiple limited partners, some of whom are exempt from income tax. Limited Partner C and Limited Partner D are both limited liability companies. Limited Partner C, Limited Partner D, and each limited partner of Limited Partner B that is not exempt from income tax are together referred to as the Taxable Limited Partners. This determination only applies to the Taxable Limited Partners and does not apply to those limited partners that are exempt from income tax.
3.  The Convertible Notes will earn a fixed rate of interest that is payable monthly (Coupon Interest Payments) until the Convertible Notes are converted or repaid. The Coupon Interest Payments will be capitalised on each interest payment date. However, the additional Convertible Notes issued in satisfaction of the interest payments will not convert to a partnership interest, but will be repaid to the Subscribers over multiple distribution dates.
4.  The interest rate on the Convertible Notes will be a market rate determined under an agreed rate-set process. No fees are payable by the Partnership or the Subscribers in relation to the Convertible Notes.
5.  In accordance with s EW 6(2) an amount that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement is not taken into account under the financial arrangements rules. An interest in a partnership is an excepted financial arrangement under s EW 5(11). Therefore, the Convertible Notes are a financial arrangement that includes an excepted financial arrangement.
6.  This Determination prescribes the method for determining the amounts that are solely attributable to the excepted financial arrangement, as well as the method for spreading the income and expenditure under the financial arrangements rules.

### 2\. Reference

This determination is made under ss 90AC(1)(bb), 90AC(1)(d) and 90AC(1)(h) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This determination applies to the Convertible Notes issued by the Partnership to the Subscribers as part of a wider transaction entered into by the parties, which is the subject of Private Rulings BR Prv 16/64 and BR Prv 16/65, issued on 31 October 2016.
2.  The terms of the Convertibles Note are as follows:
    1.  The Convertible Notes will be drawn in full at Financial Close and will have a face value equal to 40% (for each of the Subscribers) of the total equity requirement.
    2.  The Convertible Notes will earn a fixed rate of interest that is capitalised monthly until conversion or repayment (the Coupon Interest Payments).
    3.  The Coupon Interest Payments that are capitalised on each interest payment date will not convert to a partnership interest, but will be paid out to the limited partners over multiple partnership distribution dates.
    4.  The interest rates payable to Limited Partner A and Limited Partner B under the convertible notes do not exceed the arm’s length rates that would have been agreed between wholly unrelated parties having regard to the terms of the convertible notes and applying orthodox pricing methodologies.
    5.  No fees are payable by the Partnership or the Subscribers in relation to the Convertible Notes.

### 4\. Principle

1.  The Convertible Notes are a financial arrangement (as defined in s EW 3). An interest in a partnership is an excepted financial arrangement (s EW 5(11)). Therefore, the Convertible Notes are a financial arrangement that includes an excepted financial arrangement.
2.  Under s EW 6(2), an amount that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement is not taken into account under the financial arrangements rules.
3.  Any amount that is not solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement is required to be taken into account under the financial arrangements rules and spread in accordance with those rules.
4.  Under s EW 14(3), an amount calculated for and allocated to an income year under a spreading method will either be expenditure incurred or income derived by the person.
5.  _Determination G1A: Apportionment of Income and Expenditure on a Daily Basis_ sets out a method for calculating and allocating income and expenditure on the basis of daily apportionment.

### 5\. Interpretation

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires:

*   All legislative references in this determination are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated.
*   **Convertible Notes** means the unsecured subordinated notes, in a denomination of $1.00 issued by the Partnership to the Subscribers.
*   means the monthly interest payable on the Convertible Notes in accordance with their terms.
*   **IFRS** means a New Zealand Equivalent International Financial Reporting Standard in effect under the Financial Reporting Act 2013 and as amended from time to time or an equivalent standard issued in its place.

### 6\. Method

1.  Any change in the market value of the interest in the Partnership between the issue date of the Convertible Notes and conversion into the partnership interest will be solely attributable to the excepted financial arrangement.
2.  The Coupon Interest Payments are not solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement, and therefore must be spread under the financial arrangements rules. There will be no other amounts of income or expenditure under the financial arrangements rules in relation to the Convertible Notes.
3.  Under s EW 14(3), the Coupon Interest Payments will be expenditure incurred by the Taxable Limited Partners and income derived by the limited partners of Limited Partner B that are not exempt from income tax.
4.  Income and expenditure in respect of the Convertible Notes will be calculated by daily apportionment of the Coupon Interest Payment to income years in accordance with _Determination G1A: Apportionment of Income and Expenditure on a Daily Basis_.

### 7\. Example

This example illustrates the application of the method set out in this determination.

On 1 April 2017, Convertible Notes are issued to the Subscribers for $1,000. The Convertible Notes will mandatorily convert to a 40% interest in the Partnership for each Subscriber on 31 March 2022.

The Coupon Interest Payments will be set at the market interest rate of 8.5% and will be capitalised on each monthly interest payment date.

The annual sum of Coupon Interest Payments as at 31 March from 2018 to 2022 is:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 31 March 2018 | $88.39 |
| 31 March 2019 | $96.20 |
| 31 March 2020 | $104.71 |
| 31 March 2021 | $113.96 |
| 31 March 2022 | $124.04 |
|     | **$527.30** |

On the date of issue, the market value of a 40% partnership interest in the Partnership is $1,000. Any change in the market value between the date of issue and 31 March 2022 will be solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement.

The amounts that must be spread under the financial arrangements rules are the Coupon Interest Payments, which shall be apportioned using the method outlined in _Determination G1A: Apportionment of Income and Expenditure on a Daily Basis_.

This Determination is signed by me on the 31st day of October 2016.

Valuation of Shares Issued by Bank following a Non-Viability Trigger Event
==========================================================================

Determination S52 (20 Mar 2017) relates to the valuation of shares issued by a bank following a non-viability trigger event.

This determination may be cited as _Special Determination S52: Valuation of Shares Issued by Bank following a Non-Viability Trigger Event_.

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This determination relates to a funding transaction involving the issue of Notes by the Bank to wholesale investors pursuant to a Deed Poll. The Notes will contain a conversion mechanism, whereby the Bank will immediately and irrevocably convert Notes into ordinary shares in Bank upon the occurrence of a Non-Viability Trigger Event, in order to allow them to be recognised as Tier 2 capital for the purposes of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand framework relating to the capital adequacy of banks.
2.  The Arrangement is the subject of private ruling BR Prv 17/17 issued on 20 March 2017, and is fully described in that ruling.
3.  Each Note is a "financial arrangement" (as defined in s EW 3) consisting of a debt instrument and a contingent share subscription.

### 2\. Reference

This determination is made under s 90AC(1)(i) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This determination applies to a funding transaction involving the issue of Notes by Bank to wholesale investors pursuant to a Deed Poll. The Deed Poll will set out the steps that will occur upon Conversion following a Non-Viability Trigger Event.
2.  If a Conversion occurs, the relevant number of Notes must be immediately and irrevocably converted. In summary, the steps for the Conversion of the Notes will be as follows:
    1.  On the Conversion Date, Bank will issue a specified “conversion number” of Bank ordinary shares to each Holder in respect of each Note to be Converted.
    2.  Each Note will be immediately redeemed by Bank for an amount equal to the NZ$ equivalent of the A$ Face Value of the Note. Under the terms of the Deed Poll, the NZ$ equivalent of the A$ Face Value owed to each Holder will be repaid by being applied on each Holder’s behalf to subscribe for the relevant "conversion number" of ordinary shares in Bank.
3.  This determination applies when shares are issued by Bank to each Holder on Conversion to determine the value of the shares issued by Bank for the purposes of the financial arrangements rules.

### 4\. Principle

1.  The Notes are each a financial arrangement (as defined in s EW 3) consisting of a debt instrument and a contingent share subscription. The contingent share subscription is an "agreement for the sale and purchase of property and services" (as defined in s YA 1), as it is a conditional agreement to acquire property.
2.  The contingent share subscription is not a "short-term agreement for sale and purchase" (as defined in s YA 1), as settlement is not required to occur within 93 days of the Deed Poll being entered into. As such, it is not an excepted financial arrangement under s EW 5.
3.  For the purposes of determining the consideration paid or payable under the financial arrangements rules, the value of the shares issued by Bank must be established under s EW 32. None of subs (2B) to (5) of s EW 32 apply to the share subscriptions.
4.  Under s EW 32(6), the Commissioner is required to determine the value of the property. Both parties are required to use this amount.

### 5\. Interpretation

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires:

*   All legislative references in this determination are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated.
*   **Bank** means the bank issuing the Notes.
*   **Conversion, Non-Viability Trigger Event** and **Face value** have the same meaning as described in private ruling BR Prv 17/17, issued on 20 March 2017.
*   **Notes** means the Subordinated Notes issued to wholesale investors pursuant to a Deed Poll.

### 6\. Method

1.  The Arrangement does not involve the advancement or deferral of income or expenditure.
2.  For the purposes of s EW 32(6) the value of the shares issued by Bank is equal to the amount the Holders paid for those shares.

### 7\. Example

This example illustrates the application of the method set out in this determination.

Bank issues Notes having a Face Value of A$100 to Holders. Following a Non-Viability Trigger Event, Notes having a Face Value of A$100 are converted into ordinary shares in Bank. Bank immediately repays the NZ$ equivalent of the A$ Face Value of the Notes and applies the relevant amount on each Holder’s behalf to subscribe for ordinary shares in Bank. Bank issues the number of shares to each Holder calculated in accordance with the "conversion number" formula in the Deed Poll. The value of the aggregate shares issued, for the purposes of s EW 32, is the NZ$ equivalent of A$100.

This Determination is signed by me on the 20th day of March 2017.

Application of the financial arrangements rules to a public-private partnership agreement
=========================================================================================

Determination S53 (Apr 2017) relates to an arrangement involving the finance, design, construction and on-going provision of operational services under a PPP.

This determination may be cited as _Special Determination S53: Application of the financial arrangments rules to a public-private partnership agreement_.

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This determination relates to an arrangement (the Project) involving the finance, design, construction and on-going provision of operational services in respect of the Facilities by a limited partnership (Contractor LP) under a public-private partnership agreement (the Project Agreement) with the Crown. The sole limited partner in Contractor LP will be Hold LP, holding 100% of Contractor LP.
2.  The limited partners in Hold LP are:
    *   a limited partnership (Investment LP) with two limited partners, one of which (Limited Partner A) is a limited liability company and the other of which (Limited Partner B) is itself a limited partnership having multiple limited partners, some of whom are exempt from income tax;
    *   a limited liability company (Limited Partner C).
3.  Limited Partner A, Limited Partner C and each limited partner of Limited Partner B that is not exempt from income tax are together referred to as the Taxable Limited Partners. This determination only applies to the Taxable Limited Partners and does not apply to those limited partners that are exempt from income tax.
4.  The Project Agreement comprises three basic components for each Facility:
    *   A design and construction phase (the D&C Phase) under which Contractor LP agrees to design and construct the Facility for the Crown in consideration for a fixed lump-sum payment (the D&C Payment), payable on completion of the D&C Phase;
    *   A Facility Lease entered into by Contractor LP and the Crown, under which Contractor LP pays an amount representing the rental under the Facility Lease to the Crown (the Rental Prepayment); and
    *   An Operating Term (the O&M Phase) under which, in consideration for quarterly payments (the Unitary Charge), Contractor LP will provide operational services to the Crown over a term beginning once the Facility is ready for operation and ending on the Expiry Date (9 December 2043).
5.  The Partnership will enter into:
    *   A Construction Agreement with a contractor (the Contractor), under which the Contractor will design and construct each Facility in consideration for monthly and milestone payments; and
    *   An Operational Services Sub-Contract (the Operational Services Contract) with a service provider (the Service Provider), under which the Service Provider will provide the on-going operational (and other) services in consideration for quarterly payments.
6.  The Partnership will raise external debt from a range of third party financiers (the Senior Debt).
7.  Investment LP and Limited Partner C will each provide investment support (Sponsor Support) during the D&C Phase in the form of a letter of credit (Letter of Credit) or cash collateral. In addition, regardless of the form of the Sponsor Support, sponsor support fees will be payable by both Contractor LP and Hold LP (the Sponsor Support Fees). Investment LP may procure that its Sponsor Support is provided by its limited partners (Limited Partner A and Limited Partner B), in which case a Sponsor Support Fee will also be payable by Investment LP to Limited Partner A and Limited Partner B.
8.  The Partnership will enter into Interest Rate Swaps in respect of the Senior Debt.
9.  The Facility Lease, O&M Phase of the Project Agreement, Construction Agreement and Operational Services Contract are all excepted financial arrangements. The D&C Phase of the Project Agreement, Senior Debt, Letters of Credit, agreements to pay the Sponsor Support Fees and Interest Rate Swaps are financial arrangements to which Contractor LP is a party. The Project, including all of these agreements, is a wider financial arrangement.
10.  This determination prescribes:
    *   the amount of consideration that is solely attributable to each Facility Lease;
    *   how the financial arrangements rules apply to the O&M Phase of the Project Agreement, the Construction Agreement and the Operational Services Contract for each Facility; and
    *   the method for spreading the payments made under the Senior Debt, Interest Rate Swaps, Letters of Credit and Sponsor Support Fees.

### 2\. Reference

This determination is made under ss 90AC(1)(bb), 90AC(1)(d) and 91AC(1)(h) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This determination applies to Contractor LP in respect of the Project (which is set out in detail in Private Ruling BR Prv 17/19, issued on 5 April 2017), including the following arrangements:
    *   The D&C Phase of the Project Agreement, under which Contractor LP agrees to design and construct each Facility for the Crown and will receive a fixed lump-sum payment (the D&C Payment) for each Facility once the Facility is ready for operation.
    *   The O&M Phase of the Project Agreement, under which Contractor LP will provide on-going operational services to the Crown in consideration for quarterly payments for the period following completion of each Facility until 9 December 2043.
    *   The Facility Lease for each Facility, under which Contractor LP will lease the Facility from the Crown for a period following completion of the relevant Facility until 9 December 2043 and will make the Rental Prepayment to the Crown. The Rental Prepayment will be equal to and will offset the D&C Payment.
    *   A Construction Agreement with the Contractor, under which the Contractor will design and construct each Facility in consideration for payments under the Construction Agreement.
    *   An Operational Services Contract with the Service Provider following completion of each Facility, under which the Service Provider will provide the on-going operational (and other) services in consideration for payments under the Operational Services Contract.
    *   Senior Debt, under which Contractor LP will borrow an agreed sum from external lenders for a term of 5 years from financial close of the Project (Financial Close). The Senior Debt will include a capitalising, interest only senior debt facility that converts to an amortising senior tranche on the Conversion Date. It is expected that the Senior Debt will be refinanced within 5 years of Financial Close and every 5 years thereafter over the term of the Project. Under IFRS (as the standards apply at the date of this Determination), the Senior Debt (and any subsequent re-financings) will initially be recognised at fair value plus integral fees, and subsequently measured using the amortised cost using the effective interest method (regardless of whether hedge accounting is applied). The amount of the Senior Debt may be increased by way of an Accordion Facility in order to fund any Additional Schools. The Senior Debt (including the Accordion Facility and any subsequent re-financings) will not be treated as a hedge of another financial arrangement.
    *   Interest Rate Swaps, under which Contractor LP will pay a fixed rate of interest to the swap counterparties, and receive a floating rate in return.
    *   If Investment LP (or its limited partners) or Limited Partner C provide their sponsor support by way of a Letter of Credit a fee (the LC Fee) will be payable by Investment LP (or its limited partners) or Limited Partner C (respectively) to the provider of the Letter of Credit in consideration for the provider issuing the Letter of Credit in favour of the Hold LP and the Senior Lenders.
    *   Regardless of the form of the Sponsor Support, Sponsor Support Fees will be payable by Hold LP to each of Investment LP and Limited Partner C in consideration for the provision of such Sponsor Support (Hold LP Sponsor Support Fees). Contractor LP will in turn be required to pay an amount equal to any Hold LP Sponsor Support Fees to Hold LP (Contractor LP Sponsor Support Fees). If Investment LP procures that Limited Partner A and Limited Partner B provide its Sponsor Support, Investment LP will pay an amount equal to the Hold LP Sponsor Support Fee received by it to each of Limited Partner A and Limited Partner B on a pro rata basis (Investment LP Sponsor Support Fees). (Together, the Hold LP Sponsor Support Fees, Contractor LP Sponsor Support Fees and Investment LP Sponsor Support Fees are the Sponsor Support Fees.
2.  This determination is made subject to the following conditions:
    *   Limited Partner A, Limited Partner B and Limited Partner C use IFRSs to prepare financial statements and to report for financial arrangements. Any Taxable Limited Partner that does not use IFRSs to prepare financial statements and to report for financial arrangements will use the same spreading method as Limited Partner B.
    *   The Taxable Limited Partners will recognise income derived from the Crown and will deduct expenditure incurred, under the relevant provisions of the Act to the extent that the financial arrangement rules do not apply to these amounts.
    *   The continued application of Private Ruling BR Prv 17/19 issued on 5 April 2017 (including any Ruling issued to replace that Ruling, provided that the change to the Ruling does not affect the application of this determination).

### 4\. Principle

1.  Each Facility Lease is an excepted financial arrangement under s EW 5(9). Any amount that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement described in ss EW 5(2) to (16) is not an amount that is taken into account under the financial arrangements rules (s EW 6(2)). This determination specifies the amounts that are solely attributable to a Facility Lease that are not taken into account under the financial arrangements rules.
2.  For each Facility, the O&M Phase, Construction Agreements and Operational Service Contracts are “short-term agreements for sale and purchase” as defined in s YA 1, and are excepted financial arrangements under s EW 5(22), provided that payment under the Construction Agreements and Operational Services Contracts is required within 93 days of an invoice being rendered. Any amount that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement described in ss EW 5(17) to (25) that is part of a financial arrangement is an amount that is taken into account under the financial arrangements rules (s EW 6(3)). This determination specifies that no amounts payable to or by Contractor LP in respect of the O&M Phase, Construction Agreements and Operational Services Contracts are required to be spread under the financial arrangements rules.
3.  The D&C Phase for each Facility, Senior Debt, Interest Rate Swaps, Letters of Credit, and agreements by Contractor LP, Hold LP and (if applicable) Investment LP to pay Sponsor Support Fees in consideration for sponsor support are “financial arrangements” under s EW 3. This determination specifies that the payments made to or by the Taxable Limited Partners, in proportion to their share in Hold LP, under the Senior Debt, Letters of Credit, agreement to pay Sponsor Support Fees, and Interest Rate Swaps must be spread under the financial arrangements rules in accordance with this determination.

### 5\. Interpretation

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires:

*   All legislative references in this determination are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated.
*   Capitalised terms have the same meaning as set out in the Project Agreement.
*   **IFRS** means International Financial Reporting Standards as defined in s YA 1.

### 6\. Method

1.  The Rental Prepayment paid in respect of a Facility Lease, and the property interest granted to Contractor LP under a Facility Lease, are solely attributable to the Facility Lease and are not taken into account under the financial arrangements rules.
2.  For each Facility, the Taxable Limited Partners are not required to spread any amounts under the financial arrangements rules in respect of the:
    *   O&M Phase of the Project Agreement;
    *   Construction Agreement;
    *   Operational Services Contract.
3.  The IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D may be used to allocate income and expenditure (other than “non-integral fees” as defined in s YA 1) over the term of the Senior Debt and none of the restrictions for application of the IFRS financial reporting method contained in s EW 15D(2B) apply.
4.  The IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D may be used to allocate income and expenditure (other than “non-integral fees” as defined in s YA 1) in respect of any subsequent refinancing of the Senior Debt over the term of the relevant refinancing, provided that the terms of any such refinancing are materially similar to the terms of the Senior Debt. This determination paragraph does not affect each Taxable Limited Partner’s obligation to perform a base price adjustment under s EW 31 at the time of each refinancing.
5.  The IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D may be used to allocate income and expenditure (other than “non-integral fees” as defined in s YA 1) in respect of additional Senior Debt provided by way of an Accordion Facility over the term of the relevant Accordion Facility, provided that the Accordion Facility is entered into on terms materially similar to the terms of the existing Senior Debt.
6.  None of the mandatory spreading methods in ss EW 15H or EW 15I apply to the Interest Rate Swaps. Over the term of the Interest Rate Swaps, income or expenditure may be allocated using either:
    *   the expected value method in s EW 15F (other than for “non-contingent fees” as defined in s YA 1) provided that the swaps are not treated as a hedge of other financial arrangements for which the “fair value method” is used; or
    *   the IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D (other than for “non-integral fees” as defined in s YA 1) provided that the swaps are not treated as a hedge of other financial arrangements for which a method other than the IFRS financial reporting method is used;provided that each Taxable Limited Partner uses the same method for the entire term of the Interest Rate Swaps.
7.  The IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D may be used to allocate income and expenditure (other than "non-integral fees" as defined in s YA 1) over the term of the Letters of Credit and the agreements by Contractor LP, Hold LP and (if applicable) Investment LP to pay Sponsor Support Fees in consideration for sponsor support, provided that they are not treated as a hedge of another financial arrangement. None of the restrictions for the application of this reporting method in s EW 15D(2B) apply.
8.  This determination does not affect each Taxable Limited Partner’s obligation to perform base price adjustments under s EW 31 in respect of the Interest Rate Swaps.

### 7\. Example

This example illustrates the application of the method set out in this determination.

This example is based on the following parameters:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Commencement of D&C Phase | 7 April 2017 |
| Completion of D&C Phase | 1 February 2019 |
| Completion of AM&M Phase | 9 December 2043 |
| D&C Payment from the Crown | $1,000 |
| Aggregrate payments to the Contractor | ($850) |
| Facility Lease prepayment | ($1,000) |
| Quarterly payments from the Crown during the O&M Phase | $30 |
| Quarterly payments to the Service Provider | ($15) |
| Annual interest on the Senior Debt | ($85) |
| Annual Hold LP Sponsor Support Fee | ($15) |
| Annual Contractor LP Sponsor Support Fee | ($15) |
| Annual LC Fee | ($15) |
| Annual net payments in respect of the Interest Rate Swaps | ($7) |

The Taxable Limited Partners are not required to spread any amounts under the financial arrangements rules in respect of the Facility Lease, O&M Phase of the Project Agreement, Construction Agreement and O&M Contract.

The amounts that must be spread under the financial arrangement rules are:

*   Interest on the Senior Debt (including the Accordion Facility and any subsequent re-financings) calculated in accordance with the IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D;
*   Payments in respect of the Interest Rate Swaps calculated in accordance with the expected value method in s EW 15F or the IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D; and
*   Payments made and amounts received in respect of the Letters of Credit and Sponsor Support Fees calculated in accordance with the IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D.

This Determination is signed by me on the 5th day of April 2017.

Application of financial arrangements rules to Investors in the Lifetime Income Fund
====================================================================================

Determination S54 (18 Aug 2017) considers the application of financial arrangements rules to investors in the Lifetime Income Fund.

This Determination may be cited as Special Determination S54: Application of financial arrangements rules to Investors in the Lifetime Income Fund.

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This determination relates to the Lifetime Income Fund (the Fund), which is a managed investment scheme in which investors (Investors) can invest their retirement savings in return for a stream of regular payments (the Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit) for the rest of their life.
2.  Investors can elect to commence receiving their Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit at any time from age 60 until age 90. The Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit is calculated as a percentage of the Investor’s Protected Income Base.  An Investor’s Protected Income Base is the Investor’s original capital sum invested in the Fund net of any applicable fees and Unplanned Withdrawals, and includes any increase in value during the Deferral Period (the period up to the time the Investor begins receiving payments of the Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit).  Each Investor’s Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit is paid in two phases:
    1.  Protected Income Phase: This period commences on the date the Investor elects for the commencement of Lifetime Withdrawal Benefits (the Initial Regular Payment Date), and ends when all Units held by the Investor in the Fund have been redeemed.  During this period the Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit is paid out of the capital invested by an Investor in the Fund and the Investor’s proportion of the Fund’s post-tax earnings accumulated as a result of investing the Investor’s original capital sum.
    2.  Insured Income Phase: This period commences from the end of the Protected Income Phase and ends on the date of death of the Investor.  During this period the Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit is funded from the proceeds of a group life insurance policy (the Policy) that the Manager of the Fund is required to take out in the name of the Supervisor of the Fund for the benefit of Investors.  During this phase the life insurer pays the Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit in the form of an annuity to Investors under the Policy.  However, under the Fund’s trust deed, payments from the life insurer are made directly to the manager of the Fund.  Those payments are then treated as a subscription on behalf of that Investor in the Fund’s Cash Portfolio.  Provided payments are received under the Policy in respect of an Investor, all payments of Lifetime Withdrawal Benefits to the Investor during their Insured Income Phase are then funded by redeeming the relevant Units in the Cash Portfolio until the date of death of the Investor.
3.  The arrangement referred to above (the Arrangement) is the subject of product ruling BR Prd 17/04 issued on 18 August 2017 and private ruling BR Prv 17/35 issued on 18 August 2017, and is fully described in those rulings.
4.  This determination prescribes:
    1.  the amount of consideration that is solely attributable to an Investor’s Units in the Fund; and
    2.  the amount of consideration that is solely attributable to the annuity that an Investor receives from the life insurer under the Policy.

### 2\. Reference

This determination is made under s 90AC(1)(h) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3.Scope of determination

1.  This determination relates to the Arrangement under which Investors can invest their retirement savings in the Fund in return for regular fortnightly or monthly payments of a Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit for the rest of their life.  The Fund is a managed investment scheme as defined in the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013.  The terms and conditions applicable to the Fund are set out in a trust deed dated 17 July 2017 (the Trust Deed).
2.  Under the Trust Deed, the Manager of the Fund is required to effect with Lifetime Income Limited, in the name of the Supervisor and for the benefit of Investors, the Policy to provide regular payment benefits in respect of Investors during their Insured Income Phase.
3.  Investors can elect to commence receiving their Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit at any time from age 60 until age 90.  The Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit is calculated as a percentage of the Investor’s Protected Income Base.  An Investor’s Protected Income Base is the Investor’s original capital sum invested in the Fund net of any applicable fees and Unplanned Withdrawals, and includes any increase in value up to the time the Investor begins receiving payments of the Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit.
4.  Each Investor’s Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit is paid in two phases:
    1.  Protected Income Phase: This period commences on the date the Investor elects for the commencement of Lifetime Withdrawal Benefits (the Initial Regular Payment Date) and ends when all Units held by the Investor in the Fund have been redeemed.  During this period, the Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit is paid out of the capital invested by an Investor in the Fund and the Investor’s proportion of the Fund’s post-tax earnings accumulated as a result of investing the Investor’s original capital sum.
    2.  Insured Income Phase: This period commences from the end of the Protected Income Phase and ends on the date of death of the Investor.  During this period, the Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit is funded from the proceeds of the Policy.  During this phase, the life insurer pays the Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit in the form of an annuity to Investors under the Policy.  However, under the Fund’s trust deed, payments from the life insurer are made directly to the Manager of the Fund, and it is then treated as a subscription on behalf of that Investor in the Fund’s Cash Portfolio.  Provided that payments are received under the Policy in respect of an Investor, all payments of Lifetime Withdrawal Benefits to the Investor during their Insured Income Phase are then funded by redeeming the relevant Units in the Cash Portfolio until the date of death of the Investor.
5.  This determination applies to Investors in the Fund in relation to all of the following aspects of the Arrangement:
    1.  redemption of Investors’ Units in the Fund to fund the payment of Lifetime Withdrawal Benefits during the Investors’ Protected Income Phase;
    2.  redemption of Investors’ Units in the Fund if they make Unplanned Withdrawals from the Fund;
    3.  annuities paid by the life insurer to Investors under the Policy during the Investors’ Insured Income Phase; and
    4.  redemption of Investors’ Units in the Fund to fund the payment of Lifetime Withdrawal Benefits during the Investors’ Insured Income Phase.
6.  This determination is made subject to the following condition:
    1.  The continued application of private ruling BR Prv 17/35 (the Ruling) issued on 18 August 2017 (including any ruling issued to replace the Ruling, provided that the change to the Ruling does not affect the application of this determination).

### 4\. Principle

1.  The following components of the Arrangement are excepted financial arrangements:
    1.  Investors’ Units in the Fund (the Units); and
    2.  annuities paid by Lifetime Income Limited to Investors during their Insured Income Phase (the Annuities).
2.  Any amount that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement described in s EW 5(2) to (16) is not an amount that is taken into account under the financial arrangements rules (s EW 6(2)).  This determination specifies the amounts that are solely attributable to the Units and the Annuities, and are therefore not taken into account under the financial arrangements rules.

### 5\. Interpretation

1.  All legislative references in this determination are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated.
2.  Capitalised terms and phrases in this determination should be taken to have the meaning attributed to that term or phrase in clause 1 of the Trust Deed or in the description of the Arrangement in product ruling BR Prd 17/04 issued on 18 August 2017.  This determination has no specialised terms that need to be defined further.

### 6\. Method

1.  The amounts that are solely attributable to the Units are the:
    1.  Lifetime Withdrawal Benefits received by Investors from the Fund during the Investors’ Protected Income Phase;
    2.  proceeds received by an Investor on redemption of their Units in the Fund when the Investor makes an Unplanned Withdrawal; and
    3.  Lifetime Withdrawal Benefits received by Investors from the Fund during the Investors' Insured Income phase.
2.  The amounts that are solely attributable to the Annuities are the payments made by Lifetime Income Limited to Investors under the Policy during their Insured Income Phase. (These amounts are then treated as a subscription on behalf of that Investor in the Fund’s Cash Portfolio to fund the ongoing payment of Lifetime Withdrawal Benefits during this phase.)

### 7\. Examples

1.  The following examples illustrate the application of the method set out in this determination.

### Example A

2.  An Investor invests $100,000 in the Fund at age 65 and in return acquires Units in the Fund.  The investment grows in value after five years to $112,900 net of fees and taxes.  During that period, the Fund pays premiums on behalf of the Investor to LIL under the Policy.
3.  The Investor opts to receive their Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit from the Fund from age 70, which means the Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit is set at 5.5% per annum of their Protected Income Base of $112,900.  This means the Investor receives $6,209.50 per annum in fortnightly instalments from the Fund.
4.  At age 97, the Investor’s capital in the Fund is exhausted, and the Investor continues to receive a minimum income of $6,209.50 per annum in fortnightly instalments under the annuity.
5.  The payments of $6,209.50 per annum paid by the Fund are solely attributable to the Units in the Fund.  The payments of $6,209.50 per annum made by LIL to an Investor under the Policy are solely attributable to the Annuity.

### Example B

6.  An Investor invests $150,000 in the Fund at age 67 and elects to start receiving a Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit immediately.  The Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit is set at 5% per annum of the Investor’s Protected Income Base.  This means the Investor receives $7,500 per annum in fortnightly instalments from the Fund.  At age 72 the Investor withdraws $20,000 as an Unplanned Withdrawal.  This reduces the Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit payments to $6,500 per annum in fortnightly payments.
7.  The payments of the Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit by the Fund to the Investor during their Protected Income Phase are solely attributable to the Units in the Fund.

This Determination is signed by me on the 18th day of August 2017.

Valuation of Shares Issued by Bank on Conversion
================================================

Determination S55 (8 Sep 2017) relates to a funding transaction involving the issue of notes by a bank to a parent company, and their valuation on conversion.

This determination may be cited as Special Determination S55: Valuation of Shares Issued by Bank on Conversion.

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This determination relates to a funding transaction involving the issue of Notes by Bank to Parent. The Notes will contain a conversion mechanism, in order to allow them to be recognised as Additional Tier 1 capital for the purposes of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand framework relating to the capital adequacy of banks.
2.  Bank will enter into an agreement, which will set out the steps that will occur if a Conversion of the Notes occurs. A Conversion may be an optional conversion (at the election of Bank following certain specified events) or an automatic conversion (upon a Capital Trigger Event, a Non-Viability Trigger Event or on certain other events relating to a change in control of Bank).
3.  If Conversion occurs, the relevant number of Notes must be immediately and irrevocably converted into ordinary shares in Bank.
4.  The Arrangement is the subject of, and fully described in, the Ruling.

### 2\. Reference

This determination is made under s 90AC(1)(i) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This determination applies to a funding transaction involving the issue of Notes by Bank to Parent.  Bank will enter into an agreement, which will set out the steps that will occur on Conversion of the Notes.
2.  If a Conversion occurs, the relevant number of Notes must be immediately and irrevocably converted into shares in the Bank. In summary, the steps for the conversion of the Notes will be as follows:
    1.  Each Note (subject to Conversion) will become immediately due and payable and Bank will be required to repay the face value of the Note.
    2.  Under the terms of the Notes, Parent will be required to pay a sum to Bank equal to the face value of each Note converted, to subscribe for ordinary shares in Bank.
    3.  The number of ordinary shares in Bank to be subscribed for will be calculated in accordance with a formula set out in the terms of the Notes.
3.  This determination applies where shares are issued by Bank to Parent on a Conversion of the Notes, to determine the value of the shares for the purposes of the financial arrangements rules.

### 4\. Principle

1.  The share subscriptions and the Notes are, together, a financial arrangement (as defined in s EW 3). That financial arrangement does not include an excepted financial arrangement (as defined in s EW 5).
2.  The subscription for shares in Bank by Parent contained in the terms for the Notes is an "agreement for the sale and purchase of property and services" (as defined in s YA 1), as it is a conditional agreement to acquire property.  The share subscriptions are not a "short-term agreement for sale and purchase" (as defined in s YA 1), as settlement is not required to occur within 93 days of the terms for the Notes being entered into.  As such, they are not excepted financial arrangements under s EW 5.
3.  For the purposes of determining the consideration paid or payable under the financial arrangements rules, the value of the shares issued by Bank must be established under s EW 32.  None of subs (2B) to (5) of s EW 32 apply to the share subscriptions.
4.  Under s EW 32(6), the Commissioner is required to determine the value of the property.  Bank and Parent are both required to use this amount.

### 5\. Interpretation

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires:

*   All legislative references in this determination are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated.
*   **Bank** means the bank issuing the Notes.
*   **Parent** means the parent company of Bank.
*   **Conversion** has the meaning set out in the terms of the Notes, as described in the Ruling.
*   **IFRS** means a New Zealand Equivalent International Financial Reporting Standard, in effect under the Financial Reporting Act 2013, and as amended from time to time or an equivalent standard issued in its place.
*   **Notes** means the Notes issued to Parent as described in the Ruling.
*   **Ruling** means private ruling BR Prv 17/39, issued on 8 September 2017.

### 6\. Method

For the purposes of s EW 32(6), the value of the shares issued by Bank is equal to the amount paid for those shares by Parent.

### 7\. Example

This example illustrates the application of the method set out in this determination.

Bank issues Notes having a face value of NZ$1,000. On Conversion, Notes with a face value of NZ$1,000 are to be converted to ordinary shares in Bank. Bank immediately repays the face value of the Notes to Parent.

Parent pays an amount equal to the face value of the Notes to Bank to subscribe for ordinary shares in Bank. Bank issues the number of shares to Parent calculated in accordance with the formula set out in the terms for the Notes. The value of the shares, for the purposes of s EW 32, is the NZ$1,000.

This Determination is signed by me on the 8th day of September 2017.

Treatment of prepayments for services using IFRS
================================================

Determination S56 (9 Oct 2017) considers the treatment of prepayments for services received and made by a limited partnership under the financial arrangements rules.

This Determination may be cited as Special Determination S56: Treatment of prepayments for services using IFRS.

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This Determination applies in respect of prepayments received by LP from customers under customer contracts, and of prepayments made by LP to Subsidiaries under supporting contracts on back-to-back terms.
2.  Specifically, this Determination relates to the value of the consideration for one of the customer contracts and its supporting contract, and the spreading of any interest income or expenditure for two of the customer contracts and their supporting contracts under the financial arrangements rules.
3.  This Determination must be applied in conjunction with BR Prv 17/48.

### 2\. Reference

This Determination is made under ss 90AC(1)(d), 90AC(1)(i) and 90AC(1)(bb) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, in accordance with ss EW 20, EW 32(5) and EW 15I(2)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (respectively).

### 3\. Scope of Determination

1.  This Determination applies to LP and its limited partners in respect of payments made and received under Agreements for the Sale and Purchase of services.
2.  LP has entered into Customer Contracts and will enter into back-to-back Supporting Contracts with Subsidiaries on materially the same terms.
3.  Under each of the Customer Contracts, LP receives upfront pre-payments from the Customers in return for the provision of services over the term of the contracts. Under the back-to-back Supporting Contracts, LP makes upfront payments to Subsidiaries and receives the services (in order to provide those services on to the customers).
4.  This Determination is made subject to the following conditions:
    *   LP and its limited partners will derive income from the prepayments under the Customer Contracts and will deduct expenditure incurred under the Supporting Contracts under the relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007 (outside of the financial arrangements rules) in accordance with BR Prv 17/48.
    *   This Determination applies to:
        *   LP, its limited partner, and the ultimate limited partners who are New Zealand tax residents or have a fixed establishment in New Zealand, who use IFRS to prepare financial statements and to report for financial arrangements and who will apply IFRS in respect of the Customer Contracts and Supporting Contracts; and
        *   Where relevant, the ultimate limited partners who are New Zealand tax residents or have a fixed establishment in New Zealand, and who do not use IFRS.
    *   The application of this Determination is subject to the continued application of private ruling BR Prv 17/48 (the Ruling) issued on 9 October 2017 (including any ruling issued to replace the Ruling, provided that the change to the Ruling does not affect the application of this determination).
    *   The Supporting Contracts are entered into on the same material terms as the corresponding Customer Contracts. The Customer Contracts will not be materially different from the documentation provided to Inland Revenue, to the extent that it impacts on the scope of the Determination, or the application of the financial arrangements rules to LP and its limited partners.

### 4\. Principle

1.  On and before the Service Date, LP will receive consideration from the Customers (in the form of the prepayments) in return for LP providing consideration to the Customers in the form of the provision of services from the Service Date and over the term of the Customer Contracts.
2.  The Customer Contracts are each a “financial arrangement” under s EW 3 and are each an "agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services" under s YA 1.
3.  The Customer Contracts are also each a wider or composite "financial arrangement".
4.  LP will also make payments to the Subsidiaries under the Supporting Contracts in return for the Subsidiaries providing consideration to LP in the form of the provision of the services from the Service Date and over the term of the Supporting Contracts.
5.  The Supporting Contracts are each a "financial arrangement" under s EW 3 and an "agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services" under s YA 1.
6.  Valuing the services provided under the Customer Contracts and the Supporting Contracts may result in interest expenditure and interest income to LP and its limited partners.
7.  The interest component (if any) will be spread over the term of the contracts.
8.  All of the Customer Contracts and the Supporting Contracts will have the same principles under IFRS accounting applied to them in the financial statements of LP and the IFRS limited partners. The non-IFRS ultimate limited partners will be allocated income and expenditure in proportion to their partnership interests and will apply consistent accounting treatment.

### 5\. Interpretation

In this Determination, unless the context otherwise requires:

*   All legislative references in this determination are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated.
*   Capitalised terms have the meaning as set out in BR Prv 17/48.
*   **IFRS** means International Financial Reporting Standards as defined in s YA 1.
*   **IFRS limited partners** means LP’s limited partners (including ultimate limited partners) who use IFRS to prepare financial statements and to report for financial arrangements.

### 6\. Method

_Category 1 Contract_

1.  The consideration that is services provided by LP under the Category 1 Contract (and services received by LP under the relevant Supporting Contract) is valued under IFRS using the principles of s EW 32(2B).
2.  The amount of LP’s and the IFRS limited partners’ interest expenditure that is to be allocated to each income year under the Category 1 Contract (if any) is determined by using the method in  
    s EW 15D IFRS financial reporting method.
3.  The amount of LP’s and the IFRS limited partners’ interest income that is to be allocated to each income year under the relevant Supporting Contract (if any) is determined by using the method in s EW 15D IFRS financial reporting method.
4.  The non-IFRS limited partners will recognise interest income and expenditure under the Category 1 Contract and the relevant Supporting Contract (if any) as allocated to them from LP, in accordance with the method in s EW 15D.

_Category 2 Contract_

5.  The amount of LP’s and the IFRS limited partners’ interest expenditure that is to be allocated to each income year under the Category 2 Contract (if any) is determined by using the method in  
    s EW 15D IFRS financial reporting method.
6.  The amount of LP’s and the IFRS limited partners’ interest income that is to be allocated to each income year under the relevant Supporting Contract (if any) is determined by using the method in s EW 15D IFRS financial reporting method.
7.  The non-IFRS limited partners will recognise interest income and expenditure under the Category 2 Contract and the relevant Supporting Contract (if any) as allocated to them from LP, in accordance with the method in s EW 15D.

_Category 3 Contract_

8.  The non-IFRS limited partners will recognise interest income and expenditure under the Category 3 Contract and the relevant Supporting Contract (if any) as allocated to them from LP, in accordance with the method in s EW 15D.

### 7\. Example

This example is very stylised and is for illustrative purposes only. The example is based on the anticipated IFRS treatment. However, it is possible that the IFRS treatment may differ from the example, in which case, the IFRS treatment will prevail.

_Category 1 Contract_

1.  The consideration that is services is valued by LP in its financial statements using IFRS, in accordance with the principles of s EW 32(2B) to be $Z.
2.  The amount paid by Customer 1 to LP is $X.
3.  The amount of LP’s and its limited partners’ interest expenditure (if any) for the Category 1 Contract is $Y (which is $Z-$X).
4.  $Y will be deductible to LP’s limited partners over the period of the Category 1 Contract. The proportion of $Y that is to be allocated to each income year under the Category 1 Contract will be calculated in accordance with the IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D.
5.  For the avoidance of doubt, the method for determining the proportion of $Z which is income that is to be allocated to each income year under Category 1 Contract is set out in BR PRV 17/48.

This Determination is signed by me on the 9th day of October 2017.

Valuation of shares issued by Bank on Conversion of Notes
=========================================================

This determination relates to a funding transaction involving the issue of Notes by Bank to Group Member pursuant to a Deed Poll. The Notes will contain a conversion mechanism to allow them to be recognised as Tier 2 capital for the purposes of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand framework relating to the capital adequacy of banks.

This Determination may be cited as _Special Determination S57: Valuation of shares issued by Bank on conversion of Notes._

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This determination relates to a funding transaction involving the issue of Notes by Bank to Group Member pursuant to a Deed Poll. The Notes will contain a conversion mechanism to allow them to be recognised as Tier 2 capital for the purposes of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand framework relating to the capital adequacy of banks.
2.  The funding transaction is the subject of private ruling BR Prv 18/09, issued on 26 March 2018 and is fully described in that ruling.
3.  The agreement to subscribe for shares provided for in the Deed Poll is a financial arrangement (as defined in s EW 3) and an “agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services” (as defined in s YA 1). The Notes and the agreement to subscribe for shares are, together, part of a wider financial arrangement.

### 2\. Reference

This determination is made under s 90AC(1)(i) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This determination applies to a funding transaction involving the issue of Notes by Bank to Group Member pursuant to a Deed Poll.
2.  If an event requiring conversion of the Notes occurs, the relevant number of Notes must be immediately and irrevocably converted. In summary, the steps for the conversion of the Notes will be as follows:
    1.  Bank will issue a specified number of ordinary shares in Bank to Group Member for each Note to be converted.
    2.  Group Member’s rights in relation to each Note to be converted will be immediately and irrevocably terminated for an amount equal to the Issue Price of the Note to be converted. Bank will apply this amount by way of payment for the subscription of the ordinary shares referred to in paragraph (a).
3.  This determination applies if shares are issued by Bank on a conversion of the Notes to determine the value of the shares for the purposes of the financial arrangements rules.

### 4\. Principle

1.  The Notes and the subscription for shares are, together, part of a financial arrangement (as defined in s EW 3). The agreement to subscribe for shares in Bank by Group Member is an “agreement for the sale and purchase of property and services” (as defined in s YA 1), because it is a conditional agreement to acquire property.
2.  The agreement to subscribe for shares is not a “short-term agreement for sale and purchase” (as defined in s YA 1), because settlement is not required to occur within 93 days. Therefore, the agreement to subscribe for shares is not an excepted financial arrangement under s EW 5.
3.  For the purposes of determining the consideration paid or payable under the financial arrangements rules, the value of the shares issued by Bank must be established under s EW 32. None of subs (2B) to (5) of s EW 32 applies to the share subscription.
4.  Under s EW 32(6), the Commissioner is required to determine the value of the property. Bank is required to use this amount.

### 5\. Interpretation

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires:

*   All legislative references in this determination are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated.
*   **Bank** means the bank issuing the Notes.
*   **Group Member** means a member of the same “wholly-owned group of companies” (as defined in s YA 1) as Bank.
*   **Notes** means the Notes issued to Group Member pursuant to the Deed Poll described in private ruling BR Prv 18/09.

### 6\. Method

1.  The funding transaction does not involve the advancement or deferral of income or expenditure.
2.  For the purposes of s EW 32(6), the value of the shares issued by Bank is equal to the amount Group Member paid for those shares.

### 7\. Example

This example illustrates the application of the method set out in this determination.

Following an event requiring conversion, Notes having an Issue Price of $100 are to be converted into ordinary shares in Bank. Bank immediately pays an amount equal to the Issue Price of the Notes to Group Member for termination of Group Member’s rights under the Notes. This amount is automatically applied on Group Member’s behalf to subscribe for ordinary shares in Bank. Bank issues the number of shares to Group Member calculated in accordance with the formula in the terms of the Notes. The value of the shares, for the purposes of s EW 32, is $100.

This Determination is signed by me on the 26th day of March 2018.

Application of the financial arrangement rules to a public-private partnership
==============================================================================

This determination relates to an arrangement involving the finance, design, construction and on-going provision of asset management and facilities maintenance services in respect of a Facility by a limited partnership under a public-private partnership agreement with the Crown.

This Determination may be cited as _Special Determination S58: Application of the financial arrangement rules to a public-private partnership._

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This determination relates to an arrangement (the Project) involving the finance, design, construction and on-going provision of asset management and facilities maintenance services in respect of a Facility by a limited partnership (the Partnership) under a public-private partnership agreement (the Project Agreement) with the Crown. The sole limited partner in the Partnership will be Holdings LP.
2.  The limited partners in Holdings LP are:
    *   a limited partnership (Limited Partner A), with two limited partners, one of which is a limited liability company (Limited Partner A1) and the other of which is itself a limited partnership (Limited Partner A2) with multiple limited partners, some of whom are exempt from income tax;
    *   a limited partnership (Limited Partner B), with multiple limited partners, some of whom are exempt from income tax; and
    *   a limited liability company (Limited Partner C).
3.  Limited Partner C, Limited Partner A1, and each limited partner of Limited Partner A2 and Limited Partner B that is not exempt from income tax, are together referred to as the Taxable Limited Partners. This determination only applies to the Taxable Limited Partners and does not apply to those limited partners that are exempt from income tax.
4.  The Project Agreement comprises three basic components:
    *   A design and construction phase (the D&C Phase) under which the Partnership agrees to design and construct the Facility for the Crown in consideration for a fixed lump-sum payment (the D&C Payment), payable on completion of the D&C Phase;
    *   A Facility Lease which the Partnership and the Crown enter and under which the Partnership pays an amount representing the rental under the Facility Lease to the Crown (the Rental Prepayment); and
    *   An asset management and facilities maintenance phase (the AM/FM Phase) under which the Partnership will provide asset management and facilities maintenance services to the Crown over a 25 year term in consideration for monthly payments (the Unitary Charge).
5.  The Partnership will enter into:
    *   A Design and Construction Contract with the D&C Contractor, under which the D&C Contractor will design and construct the Facility (the D&C Subcontract); and
    *   An Asset Management and Facilities Maintenance Contract with the AM/FM Contractor, under which the AM/FM Contractor will provide the on-going asset management and facilities maintenance services (the AM/FM Subcontract).
6.  The Partnership will raise external debt from a range of third party financiers (the Senior Debt).
7.  Limited Partner C will provide investment support (Sponsor Support) during the D&C Phase in the form of a letter of credit (Letter of Credit).
8.  Holdings LP will receive funding from Limited Partner A and Limited Partner B during the D&C Phase in the form of Equity Subordinated Notes (ESNs). The application of the financial arrangements rules to the ESNs is set out in _Determination S59: Equity Subordinated Notes in respect of a Limited Partnership in a Public-Private Partnership._
9.  The Partnership will enter into Interest Rate Swaps in respect of the Senior Debt.
10.  The Facility Lease, AM/FM Phase of the Project Agreement, D&C Subcontract and AM/FM Subcontract are all excepted financial arrangements. The D&C Phase of the Project Agreement, Senior Debt, Letter of Credit, and Interest Rate Swaps are financial arrangements to which the Partnership is a party. The Project, including all of these agreements and the ESNs, is a wider financial arrangement.
11.  The Project is subject to, and described more fully in, the Private Rulings.
12.  This determination prescribes:
    *   the amount of consideration that is solely attributable to the Facility Lease;
    *   how the financial arrangements rules apply to the AM/FM Phase of the Project Agreement, the D&C Subcontract and the AM/FM Subcontract; and
    *   the method for spreading the payments made under the Senior Debt, Interest Rate Swaps and the Letter of Credit.

### 2\. Reference

This determination is made under ss 90AC(1)(bb), 90AC(1)(d) and 90AC(1)(h) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This determination applies to the Partnership in respect of the Project, including the following arrangements:
    *   The D&C Phase of the Project Agreement, under which the Partnership agrees to design and construct the Facility for the Crown and will receive a fixed lump-sum payment (the D&C Payment) for the Facility once the Facility is ready for operation.
    *   The AM/FM Phase of the Project Agreement, under which the Partnership will provide on-going asset management and facilities maintenance services to the Crown in consideration for quarterly payments for the period following completion of the Facility for 25 years until 2044.
    *   The Facility Lease, under which the Partnership will lease the Facility from the Crown for a period following completion of the Facility until 2044 and will make the Rental Prepayment to the Crown. The Rental Prepayment will be equal to and will offset the D&C Payment.
    *   A D&C Subcontract, under which the D&C Subcontractor will design and construct the Facility in consideration for payments.
    *   An AM/FM Contract with the AM/FM Subcontractor following completion of the Facility, under which the AM/FM Subcontractor will provide the on-going asset management and facilities maintenance services in consideration for payments under the AM/FM Contract.
    *   Senior Debt, under which the Partnership will borrow an agreed sum from external lenders for a term of approximately five years from financial close of the Project (Financial Close). The Senior Debt will include a capitalising, interest only senior debt facility that converts to an amortising senior tranche on the Conversion Date. It is expected that the Senior Debt will be refinanced within 5 years of Financial Close and every 5 years thereafter over the term of the Project. Under IFRS (as the standards apply at the date of this Determination), the Senior Debt (and any subsequent re-financings) will initially be recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs, and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method (regardless of whether hedge accounting is applied). Broadly, from a practical perspective, this means the principal, integral fees and interest payments will be spread over the term of the Facility in line with accounting. The Senior Debt (and any subsequent re-financings) will not be treated as a hedge of another financial arrangement.
    *   Interest Rate Swaps, under which the Partnership will pay a fixed rate of interest to the swap counterparties, and receive a floating rate in return.
    *   ESNs under which Limited Partner A and Limited Partner B provide funding to Holdings LP. The application of the financial arrangements rules to the ESNs is set out in _Determination S59: Equity Subordinated Notes in respect of a Limited Partnership in a Public-Private Partnership_ issued on 3 April 2018.
    *   A Letter of Credit under which Limited Partner C will provide investment support in consideration of a Sponsor Support Fee of 2.5% per annum of the current amount of Sponsor Support. The Sponsor Support Fee will be calculated daily and payable monthly in arrears.
2.  Limited Partner A, Limited Partner A2, Limited Partner B and Limited Partner C use IFRSs to prepare financial statements and to report for financial arrangements. Any Taxable Limited Partner that does not use IFRSs to prepare financial statements and to report for financial arrangements will use the same spreading method as Limited Partner A or Limited Partner B, as relevant.
3.  The Taxable Limited Partners will recognise income derived from the Crown and will deduct expenditure incurred, under the relevant provisions of the Act to the extent that the financial arrangement rules do not apply to those amounts.
4.  This determination is made subject to the continued application of the Private Rulings.

### 4\. Principle

1.  The Facility Lease is an excepted financial arrangement under s EW 5(9). Any amount that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement described in ss EW 5(2) to (16) is not an amount that is taken into account under the financial arrangements rules (s EW 6(2)). This determination specifies the amounts that are solely attributable to the Facility Lease that are not taken into account under the financial arrangements rules.
2.  The AM/FM Phase, the D&C Subcontract and the AM/FM Subcontract are “short-term agreements for sale and purchase” as defined in section YA 1, and are excepted financial arrangements under s EW 5(22). Any amount that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement described in ss EW 5(17) to (25) that is part of a financial arrangement is an amount that is taken into account under the financial arrangements rules (s EW 6(3)). This determination specifies that no amounts payable to or by the Partnership in respect of these excepted financial arrangements are required to be spread under the financial arrangements rules.
3.  The D&C Phase, Senior Debt, Interest Rate Swaps and the Letter of Credit are “financial arrangements” under s EW 3. This determination specifies that the payments made to or by the Taxable Limited Partners, in proportion to their share in Holdings LP, under the Senior Debt, Letter of Credit, and Interest Rate Swaps must be spread under the financial arrangements rules in accordance with this determination.

### 5\. Interpretation

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires:

*   All legislative references in this determination are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated.
*   Capitalised terms have the same meaning as set out in the Project Agreement.
*   **ESNs**means the unsecured equity subordinated notes, in a denomination of $1.00 issued by the Holdings LP to the Subscriber.
*   **IFRS** means International Financial Reporting Standards as defined in s YA 1.
*   **Private Rulings** means Private Rulings BR Prv 18/45 and BR Prv 18/46, issued on 3 April 2018, and includes any Rulings issued to replace those Rulings, provided that the change to the relevant Ruling does not affect the application of this determination.
*   **Project Agreement** is a public-private partnership agreement between the Partnership and the Crown.
*   **Taxable Limited Partners** has the same meaning as in the Private Rulings.

### 6\. Method

1.  The amounts that are solely attributable to the Facilities Lease and not taken into account under the financial arrangement rules are:
    *   The Rental Prepayment; and
    *   The property interest granted to the Partnership under the Facility Lease.
2.  The Taxable Limited Partners do not have any amounts to spread under the financial arrangements rules in respect of the:
    *   AM/FM Phase of the Project Agreement;
    *   D&C Subcontract;
    *   AM/FM Subcontract.
3.  The IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D may be used to allocate income and expenditure (other than “non-integral fees” as defined in s YA 1) over the term of the Senior Debt (including any refinancing) and none of the restrictions for application of the IFRS financial reporting method contained in s EW 15D(2B) apply.
4.  None of the mandatory spreading methods in ss EW 15H or EW 15I apply to the Interest Rate Swaps. Over the term of the Interest Rate Swaps, income or expenditure may be allocated using either:
    *   the expected value method in s EW 15F (other than for “non-contingent fees” as defined in s YA 1) provided that the swaps are not treated as a hedge of other financial arrangements for which the “fair value method” is used; or
    *   the IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D (other than for “non-integral fees” as defined in s YA 1) provided that the swaps are not treated as a hedge of other financial arrangements for which a method other than the IFRS financial reporting method is used;provided that each Taxable Limited Partner uses the same method for the entire term of the Interest Rate Swaps.
5.  The IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D may be used to allocate income and expenditure (other than "non-integral fees" as defined in s YA 1) over the term of the Letter of Credit, provided the Letter of Credit is not treated as a hedge of another financial arrangement. None of the restrictions for the application of this reporting method in s EW 15D(2B) apply.
6.  This determination does not affect each Taxable Limited Partner’s obligation to perform base price adjustments under s EW 31 in respect of the Interest Rate Swaps and Senior Debt.

### 7\. Example

This example illustrates the application of the method set out in this determination.

This example is based on the following parameters:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Commencement of D&C Phase | 7 April 2018 |
| Completion of D&C Phase | 1 February 2020 |
| Completion of AM/FM Phase | 9 December 2044 |
| D&C Payment from the Crown | $1,000 |
| Aggregate payments to the D&C Subcontractor | ($850) |
| Facility Lease prepayment | ($1,000) |
| Monthly payments from the Crown during the AM/FM Phase | $30 |
| Monthly payments to the AM/FM Subcontractor | ($15) |
| Annual interest on the Senior Debt | ($85) |
| Annual Sponsor Support Fee during the D&C Phase | ($15) |
| Annual net payments in respect of the Interest Rate Swaps | ($7) |

The Taxable Limited Partners are not required to spread any amounts under the financial arrangements rules in respect of the Facility Lease, AM/FM Phase of the Project Agreement, D&C Subcontract and AM/FM Subcontract.

The amounts that must be spread under the financial arrangement rules are:

*   Interest on the Senior Debt (including any subsequent re-financings) calculated in accordance with the IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D;
*   Payments in respect of the Interest Rate Swaps calculated in accordance with the expected value method in s EW 15F or the IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D (as relevant); and
*   Payments made and amounts received in respect of the Letter of Credit (including the Sponsor Support Fee) calculated in accordance with the IFRS financial reporting method in s EW 15D.

This Determination is signed by me on the 3rd day of April 2018.

Equity Subordinated Notes in respect of a Limited Partnership Interest in a Public–Private Partnership
======================================================================================================

This determination relates to the issue of equity subordinated notes (ESNs) by a limited partnership to two of its limited partners (the Subscribers). The ESNs will be deemed to be repaid at a single, or several, nominated date(s) in the future, with the proceeds used to satisfy the Subscribers’ obligation to contribute a total of 60% of the required capital of Holdings LP.

This Determination may be cited as _Special Determination S59: Equity Subordinated Notes in respect of a Limited Partnership Interest in a Public–Private Partnership._

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This determination relates to the issue of equity subordinated notes (ESNs) by a limited partnership (Holdings LP) to two of its limited partners (the Subscribers). The ESNs will be deemed to be repaid at a single, or several, nominated date(s) in the future, with the proceeds used to satisfy the Subscribers’ obligation to contribute a total of 60% of the required capital of Holdings LP. The timing of the partnership contributions will match those made by the other limited partner in Holdings LP (Limited Partner C, a limited liability company).
2.  The Subscribers are both limited partnerships. The first (Limited Partner A) has two limited partners, one of which is a limited liability company (Limited Partner A1) and the other of which is itself a limited partnership (Limited Partner A2) with multiple limited partners, some of whom are exempt from income tax. The second (Limited Partner B) is a limited partnership with multiple limited partners, some of whom are exempt from income tax.
3.  Limited Partner C, Limited Partner A1, and each limited partner of Limited Partner A2 and Limited Partner B that is not exempt from income tax, are together referred to as the Taxable Limited Partners. This determination only applies to the Taxable Limited Partners and does not apply to those limited partners that are exempt from income tax.
4.  The ESNs will earn a fixed rate of interest that is payable monthly (Coupon Interest Payments) until the ESNs are repaid or deemed to have been repaid. The Coupon Interest Payments will be capitalised on each interest payment date, with additional ESNs issued in satisfaction of the interest payments.
5.  The interest rate on the ESNs will be approximately 6.22% per annum. No fees are payable by Holdings LP or the Subscribers in relation to the ESNs.
6.  This Determination prescribes the method for determining the amounts that are solely attributable to the excepted financial arrangement, as well as the method for spreading the income and expenditure under the financial arrangements rules.

### 2\. Reference

This determination is made under ss 90AC(1)(bb), 90AC(1)(d) and 90AC(1)(h) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This determination applies to the ESNs issued by Holdings LP to the Subscribers as part of a wider transaction entered into by the parties. That wider transaction is the subject of the Private Rulings.
2.  The terms of the ESNs are as follows:
    1.  The ESNs will be drawn in full at Financial Close and will have a face value equal to 60% of the total capital requirement of Holdings LP.
    2.  The ESNs will earn a fixed rate of interest that is capitalised monthly until the ESNs are repaid or deemed to be repaid (the Coupon Interest Payments).
    3.  Additional ESNs will be issued in satisfaction of the Coupon Interest Payments.
    4.  The interest rate payable under the ESNs will not exceed the arm’s length rates that would have been agreed between wholly unrelated parties having regard to the terms of the convertible notes and applying orthodox pricing methodologies.
    5.  No fees are payable by Holdings LP or the Subscribers in relation to the ESNs.
    6.  On issue of a Call Notice from Holdings LP for the contribution of partnership capital, the requisite number of ESNs will be deemed to be repaid to meet the Subscribers’ funding obligation under the Call Notice. The amount payable on repayment of the ESNs will be offset against the obligation to contribute capital to Holdings LP.

### 4\. Principle

1.  The ESNs are a financial arrangement (as defined in section EW 3). An interest in a partnership is an excepted financial arrangement (section EW 5(11)). Therefore, the ESNs are a financial arrangement that includes an excepted financial arrangement.
2.  Under section EW 6(2), an amount that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement is not taken into account under the financial arrangements rules.
3.  Any amount that is not solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement is required to be taken into account under the financial arrangements rules and spread in accordance with those rules.
4.  Under section EW 14(3), an amount calculated for, and allocated to, an income year under a spreading method will either be expenditure incurred or income derived by the person.
5.  _Determination G1A: Apportionment of Income and Expenditure on a Daily Basis_ sets out a method for calculating and allocating income and expenditure on the basis of daily apportionment.

### 5\. Interpretation

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires:

*   All legislative references in this determination are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated.
*   **ESNs** means the unsecured equity subordinated notes, in a denomination of $1.00 issued by the Holdings LP to the Subscriber.
*   **Private Rulings** means Private Rulings BR Prv 18/45 and BR Prv 18/46, issued on 3 April 2018, and includes any Rulings issued to replace those Rulings, provided that the change to the relevant Ruling does not affect the application of this determination.
*   **Taxable Limited Partners** has the same meaning as in the Private Rulings.

### 6\. Method

1.  Any change in the market value of the interest in Holdings LP (between the issue date of the ESNs and any deemed repayment of those ESNs and associated capital contribution to Holdings LP) will be solely attributable to the excepted financial arrangement.
2.  The Coupon Interest Payments are not solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement, and therefore must be spread under the financial arrangements rules. There will be no other amounts of income or expenditure under the financial arrangements rules in relation to the ESNs.
3.  Under section EW 14(3), the Coupon Interest Payments will be:
    1.  expenditure incurred by the Taxable Limited Partners; and
    2.  income derived by Limited Partner A1 and the limited partners of Limited Partner A2 and Limited Partner B that are not exempt from income tax.
4.  Income and expenditure in respect of the ESNs will be calculated by daily apportionment of the Coupon Interest Payment to income years in accordance with _Determination G1A: Apportionment of Income and Expenditure on a Daily Basis._

### 7\. Example

This example illustrates the application of the method set out in this determination.

On 1 April 2018, ESNs are issued to the Subscribers for $1,000. The ESNs will be deemed to have been repaid when a call is made by Holdings LP for partnership capital (on 31 March 2023).

The Coupon Interest Payments will be set at a market interest rate of approximately 6.22% and will be capitalised on each monthly interest payment date, with additional ESNs issued.

The annual sum of Coupon Interest Payments as at 31 March, from 2019 to 2023, is:

| Date | Amount |
| --- | --- |
| 31 March 2019 | $64.00 |
| 31 March 2020 | $68.10 |
| 31 March 2021 | $72.46 |
| 31 March 2022 | $77.10 |
| 31 March 2023 | $82.03 |
|     | **$363.69** |

On the date of issue, the market value of a 60% partnership interest in the Partnership is $1,000. Any change in the market value between the date of issue and 31 March 2023 will be solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement.

The amounts that must be spread under the financial arrangements rules are the Coupon Interest Payments, which shall be apportioned using the method outlined in _Determination G1A: Apportionment of Income and Expenditure on a Daily Basis._

This Determination is signed by me on the 3rd day of April 2018.

Spreading of income and expenditure under deferred payment arrangement
======================================================================

This determination applies to the applicants in relation to a deferred payment arrangement. Under the arrangement, a company assigned its rights to future cashflows to the applicants, in partial satisfaction of existing debts owed by the company to the applicants.

This Determination may be cited as _Special Determination S60: Spreading of income and expenditure under Deferred Payment Arrangement._

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  In 2017, a company (the Company) and related entities entered into an agreement (the Agreement) to sell certain of its operations to a third party purchaser (the Purchaser). The Agreement provided for part of the consideration to be paid on a contingent and deferred basis (the Deferred Payments).
2.  For the Company to be liquidated in a solvent liquidation, the Company assigned its entitlement to receive the Deferred Payments to a Creditors’ Trust, as bare trustee for all of the creditors of the Company, including the Applicants. The assignment was made in partial satisfaction of existing debts owed by the Company to its creditors.
3.  The contingent future Deferred Payments was valued at the time of the sale at $18.76 million (the Valuation). The Valuation used an expected value methodology that had been agreed with the Commissioner.
4.  The right of the Applicants to receive the Deferred Payments is a “financial arrangement” as defined in s EW 3 (the Deferred Payment Arrangement). This Determination prescribes the method to be used by the Applicants to spread any income under that financial arrangement.

### 2\. Reference

This Determination is made under s 90AC(1)(bb) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This Determination applies to the Applicants in relation to the Deferred Payment Arrangement. Under the Deferred Payment Arrangement, the Company assigned its rights to future cashflows to the Applicants, in partial satisfaction of existing debts owed by the Company to the Applicants.
2.  The Deferred Payment Arrangement is part of a wider arrangement between the parties, which is the subject of Private Ruling BR Prv 18/65 (issued on 17 August 2018). This Determination is made subject to the continued application of that Private Ruling.
3.  For the purposes of this Determination, it is assumed that the Valuation is the market value of the Deferred Payments on the date of assignment.

### 4\. Principle

1.  The Deferred Payment Arrangement is a “financial arrangement” as defined in s EW 3, and is not an “excepted financial arrangement” under s EW 5.
2.  Under s EW 12, the Applicants are required to use a spreading method to calculate an amount of income or expenditure for each income year over the term of the Deferred Payment Arrangement, other than the income year in which a base price adjustment (BPA) is required (s EW 13(1)). The Applicants must use the method set out in this Determination to spread any income in relation to the Deferred Payment Arrangement.
3.  Under s EW 29, a BPA will be required in the income year when the final payment is due under the Deferred Payment Arrangement (currently expected to be 2021). The Applicants will not have any expenditure under the Deferred Payment Arrangement in any income year prior to the income year in which a BPA is required.

### 5\. Interpretation

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires:

*   All legislative references in this determination are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated.
*   **Applicants** means the creditors that applied for Private Ruling BR Prv 18/65 and this Determination.
*   **Proportionate Share** means the percentage proportionate share for each Applicant as set out in the final beneficiary schedule provided by the Company’s liquidators.

### 6\. Method

1.  In each income year prior to the year in which a BPA is required, each Applicant is only required to recognise income under the Deferred Payment Arrangement to the extent that:
    *   the Applicant receives a payment from the Purchaser in that income year; and
    *   the cumulative amounts of all of the Deferred Payments received by the Applicant in that income year and all preceding income years exceeds the Applicant’s Proportionate Share of the Valuation.
2.  In the income year in which the final payment is due under the Deferred Payment Arrangement, each Applicant will be required to undertake a BPA calculation. Private Ruling BR Prv 18/65 confirms the treatment of the outcome of the BPA calculation.

### 7\. Example

These examples illustrate the application of the method set out in this Determination and are based on an Applicant having a 25% Proportionate Share of the $18.76 million Valuation (that is, $4.69 million).

**Example A**

This example is based on the Applicant receiving:

*   $4 million in year 1 of the Deferred Payment Arrangement;
*   $1 million in year 2 of the Deferred Payment Arrangement;
*   $0 in year 3 of the Deferred Payment Arrangement (which is also the year in which a BPA is required).

The Applicant will recognise income from the Deferred Payment Arrangement as follows:

|     | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cumulative cash received | $4 million | $5 million | $5 million |
| Income recognised in income year | $0  | $0.31 million | $0 (under the BPA calculation) |

**Example B**

This example is based on the Applicant receiving:

*   $2 million in year 1 of the Deferred Payment Arrangement;
*   $1 million in year 2 of the Deferred Payment Arrangement;
*   $0 in year 3 of the Deferred Payment Arrangement (which is also the year in which a BPA is required).

The Applicant will recognise income from the Deferred Payment Arrangement as follows:

|     | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cumulative cash received | $2 million | $3 million | $3 million |
| Income recognised in income year | $0  | $0  | \-$1.69 million (expenditure under the BPA calculation) |

This Determination is signed by me on the 17th day of August 2018.

Optional Convertible Notes with Discretionary Interest Payments
===============================================================

This determination relates to the issue of optional convertible notes issued by the Issuer to Holders who are owned and controlled by the same persons as the Issuer’s shareholders. The Issuer (at their sole discretion) can elect to pay interest quarterly (and if no interest is paid it does not accumulate). The exercise of the option to convert into shares is held by the Holders, and if exercised would result in no change in the ownership/voting interests in the Issuer. The determination specifies whether any amount is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement.

This determination may be cited as _Special Determination S61: Optional Convertible Notes with Discretionary Interest Payments_.

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This determination relates to optional convertible notes (Convertible Notes) issued by the Issuer to the Holders. The Holders are different legal entities to the shareholders of the Issuer. However, they are ultimately owned and controlled by the same persons. This determination only applies to the Issuer as the Note Holders are not New Zealand residents and do not have a fixed establishment in New Zealand for the purposes of ss EW 9 and EW 10.
2.  Under the Convertible Notes, the Holders have loaned funds to the Issuer. The Issuer, at their sole discretion, can elect to pay interest to the Holders on a quarterly basis. If no interest is paid, it does not accumulate. The interest rate is set at 250bp over the bank bill rate. No fees are payable by either the Issuer or the Holders in relation to the Convertible Notes. The Holders have the option to convert the Notes to an equivalent value of shares in the Issuer at any point during the term of the facility, but cannot demand repayment in cash until the facility maturity date. The exercise of the option to convert the debt to equity would result in no change in the ownership/voting interests in the Issuer.
3.  A share or an option to acquire a share is an excepted financial arrangement under s EW 5(13). The Convertible Notes are a financial arrangement that include an excepted financial arrangement. In accordance with s EW 6(2), an amount that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement under ss EW 5(2) to EW 5(16) is not taken into account under the financial arrangements rules.
4.  Determination G22A: Optional Convertible Notes Denominated in New Zealand Dollars (Determination G22A) prescribes the method under the financial arrangement rules for calculating income, expenditure and the base price adjustment in relation to optional convertible notes that are denominated in New Zealand Dollars. Determination G22A does not apply to the Convertible Notes as the date and amount of all payments is not known by the first balance date. This determination applies the method and the principle from Determination G22A to the Convertible Notes.
5.  If the Holders exercised the option and the result would be no change in the ownership of the issuer (either beneficially, voting or market value interests), no value is attributed to the Convertible Note’s equity component. Therefore, all consideration paid or received under the Convertible Notes is attributed to the debt component.
6.  As interest is discretionary, no amounts are taken into account under the financial arrangements rules, as the amount and timing of payment is not known at the first balance date. However, in the income year in which such payments are made, the amounts will be accounted for by applying Determination G25: Variations in the Terms of a Financial Arrangement.

### 2\. Reference

This determination is made under ss 90AC(1)(bb) and 90AC(1)(h) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This determination applies to the Convertible Notes issued by the Issuer to Holders on 26 February 2019.
2.  The terms of the Convertible Notes are as follows:
    *   The Convertible Notes will have a face value of NZ$1.00.
    *   The payment of any interest is discretionary and non-cumulative. The interest rate will be 250bp over the bank bill rate. The Issuer’s decision on whether to pay interest is made on a quarterly basis. Any interest will not be capitalised.
    *   The Principal is required to be repaid by the Final Repayment Date, which is 9 years and 360 days from the date of issue.
    *   At any point prior to the Final Repayment Date, any of the Holders may elect to convert their Convertible Notes into ordinary shares in the Issuer (subject to a 90% agreement of the Holders). No Holder can act independently, a unanimous conversion will occur so that there is no change in the ownership of the Issuer.
    *   The number of shares to be issued upon a conversion event will be based on the market value of the Issuer at the time of conversion.
    *   The right of conversion is solely held by the Holders i.e. the Issuer has no power to convert.
    *   The Issuer has the right to early repay a portion or all of the Convertible Notes by giving 5 days notice.
    *   No fees are payable by the Issuer or the Holders in relation to the Convertible Notes.

### 4\. Principle

1.  The Convertible Notes are a financial arrangement (as defined in s EW 3).
2.  A share or an option to acquire a share is an excepted financial arrangement (s EW 5(13)). The Convertible Notes are therefore a financial arrangement that includes an excepted financial arrangement.
3.  Under s EW 6(2), an amount that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement under ss EW 5(2) to EW 5(16) is not taken into account under the financial arrangements rules. Any amount that is not solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement is required to be taken into account under the financial arrangements rules and spread in accordance with those rules.
4.  Under s EW 14(3) an amount that is allocated to an income year under a spreading method will either be expenditure incurred or income derived by the person. Any discretionary interest payments made will be expenditure incurred by the Issuer.
5.  Determination G22A sets out a method for calculating and allocating income and expenditure for the purposes of the financial arrangement rules. In accordance with the principle in Determination G22A, none of the consideration provided or received under the Convertible Notes is attributed to the equity component of the Notes, and all consideration paid or received is attributed to the debt component. This is because:
    1.  The parties to the Convertible Note at the date of issue are beneficially owned and ultimately controlled by the same person; and
    2.  There would be no change to either the voting interests or the market value interests in the Issuer if the option to convert was exercised by the Holders.
6.  The Issuer’s discretion to elect to pay interest on a quarterly basis results in the dates and amounts of interest payments not being known by the first balance date following issue of the Convertible Notes.
7.  Using the principle and method in Determination G22A, there will be no amounts to spread under the financial arrangement (as the subscription price for the Convertible Notes is equal to the repayment price and there are no known interest payments). In an income year in which any interest is paid, Determination G25: Variations in the Terms of a Financial Arrangement should be applied to account for those payments.

### 5\. Interpretation

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires:

*   All legislative references in this determination are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated.
*   **Convertible Notes** means the unsecured subordinated notes, in a denomination of $1.00 issued by the Issuer to the Holders.

### 6\. Method

1.  The Convertible Notes have both a debt and equity component. The equity component (being the conversion option) is an excepted financial arrangement.
2.  The amount of consideration received by the Issuer that is solely attributable to the equity component of the Convertible Note is nil.
3.  Any early redemption of a Convertible Note for its $1 face value will be attributed to the debt component of the note.
4.  As the issue price and redemption price of the Convertible Notes are the same, there will be no amounts of expenditure or interest to be spread in accordance with the financial arrangements rules.
5.  Any interest payments made will not be solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement. Under s EW 14(3) any discretionary interest payments will be expenditure incurred by the Issuer.
6.  In the event that interest is paid, the amount of consideration paid by the Issuer must be varied using Determination G25: Variations in the terms of a financial arrangement.

### 7\. Example

This example illustrates the application of the method set out in this determination.

On 1 April 2019, 1,000 $1 Optional Convertible Notes are issued to the Holders for a 9 year and 360 days term. The notes can be converted to shares at any time.

No interest will accrue as the interest payments are at the discretion of the Issuer. On the date of issue, as a conversion event will not trigger a change in the beneficial or ultimate owner of the Issuer, no value will be allocated to the equity component of the convertible note.

However in the 2023 income year, the Issuer exercises its discretion to pay interest for two quarters. The market interest rate is set as per the facility agreement (but for the purposes of this example we will use 5%).

The annual sum of the expenditure incurred under the financial arrangement applying the principles in Determination G25 for the period 31 March 2020 to 2024 is:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 31 March 2020 | Nil |
| 31 March 2021 | Nil |
| 31 March 2022 | Nil |
| 31 March 2023 | $25 (being the year in which cash interest is paid) |
| 31 March 2024 | Nil |
| **Total Deductions** | **$25** |

This Determination is signed by me on the 6th day of March 2019.

Spreading method to be applied by Landowners making Infrastructure Payments to fund bulk infrastructure under a Final Encumbrance
=================================================================================================================================

This Determination relates to an arrangement involving an encumbrance under which a landowner is required to make payments to Milldale Infrastructure LP over a fixed period. This determination prescribes the method for determining the amount of expenditure a landowner has under the financial arrangement in each income year.

This determination may be cited as _Special Determination S62: Spreading method to be applied by Landowners making Infrastructure Payments to fund bulk infrastructure under a Final Encumbrance_.

### 1\. Explanation (which does not form part of the determination)

1.  This Determination relates to an arrangement involving an encumbrance (the Final Encumbrance) under which a landowner (the Landowner) is required to make payments to Milldale Infrastructure LP (the LP) over a fixed period. The arrangement is described in more detail in the Product Ruling.
2.  The LP is a vehicle that was set up to provide funding to developers to assist the build of storm water, water supply, wastewater and roading infrastructure (collectively the Bulk Infrastructure) for housing development projects. As repayment of the funding received, the developers will issue a Final Encumbrance on certain subdivided sections in the relevant subdivision, requiring Landowners to make payments to the LP (the Infrastructure Payments) attributable to that section. Each time a subdivided section is sold the Final Encumbrance will be transferred for no consideration.
3.  The Final Encumbrance:

*   Creates an obligation of the Landowner at the relevant time to pay the Infrastructure Payments attributable to that section from the relevant Infrastructure Payments commencement date and over the Infrastructure Payments term;
*   Sets out the payment dates on which Infrastructure Payments are to be made by the Landowner;
*   Enables the Landowner to prepay the Infrastructure Payments (in full but not in part);
*   Grants the LP security over the section;
*   Requires the Landowner to transfer the Final Encumbrance for no consideration when the Landowner sells a section with a Final Encumbrance; and
*   Enables the Final Encumbrance to be released on the date on which all Infrastructure Payments have been paid in full.

4.  Where a section is sold, the sale and purchase agreement may apportion an accrued or prepaid portion of the Infrastructure payment for the period in which settlement falls.
5.  Where an Infrastructure Payment has accrued for a period but is not yet due on the date that a section is sold, the Vendor may pay an amount as 'outgoings' to the purchaser on settlement for their share of the Infrastructure Payment. Similarly, if the Vendor has prepaid an amount of Infrastructure Payment for a period, the purchaser may pay an amount of 'outgoings' to the Vendor for their share of the Infrastructure Payment for the period.
6.  This determination prescribes the method for determining the amount of expenditure a Landowner has under the financial arrangement in each income year.
7.  A cash basis person or an IFRS taxpayer may elect to apply the method in this determination. Subject to 3.3 below, any other taxpayer is required to apply this determination.

### 2\. Reference

This determination is made under ss 90AC(1)(bb) and 90AC(1)(d) of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### 3\. Scope of determination

1.  This determination is conditional upon the continued application of the Product Ruling.
2.  This determination applies to the Landowner in respect of Infrastructure Payments made under the Final Encumbrance and transfers of the Final Encumbrance.
3.  This determination does not apply to:

*   The Developer;
*   A Landowner who holds the property for private purposes and to whom the private limitation in s DA 2(2) applies;
*   A Landowner who holds the property for the purposes of deriving exempt income, and to whom the exempt income limitation in s DA 2(3) applies;
*   A non-resident, unless the Landowner carries on business through a “fixed establishment” (as defined in s YA 1) in New Zealand and the property is used as part of carrying on that business;
*   A Landowner that is a cash basis person, unless they elect to apply it;
*   A Landowner that is an IFRS taxpayer, unless they elect to apply it; or
*   A Landowner that treats the Final Encumbrance as a hedge under IFRS.

### 4\. Principle

1.  The Final Encumbrance is a “financial arrangement” under s EW 3 and is not an “excepted financial arrangement” under s EW 5.
2.  For the purposes of s EW 15 and EW 31(7), the only amounts of “consideration” under the Final Encumbrance are:
    *   the Infrastructure Payments made by the Landowner; and
    *   any adjustment made to the purchase price for the accrued or prepaid portion of the Infrastructure Payment when the section is purchased or sold.
3.  Under s EW 12, the Landowners are required to use one of the spreading methods in s EW 14(2). Under s EW 15E(2)(d) and s EW 20, the Commissioner can determine the method to be applied. The amount allocated to an income year will be “expenditure incurred” by the Landowner, and will be deductible to them.
4.  Under s EW 29, the Landowner is required to perform a base price adjustment (BPA) in the income year that the final Infrastructure Payment is made (including any lump sum prepayment of the amount owing) or the property is sold.
5.  This determination specifies the method that must be applied by Landowners to allocate an amount of expenditure to an income year.

### 5\. Interpretation

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires:

*   All legislative references in this determination are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated.
*   Capitalised terms have the same meaning as set out in the Final Encumbrance.
*   **Cash basis person** has the same meaning as in s EW 54.
*   **IFRS** has the same meaning as in s YA 1.
*   **IFRS taxpayer** means a person who uses IFRS to prepare financial statements and to report for financial arrangements.
*   **Product Ruling** means product ruling BR Prd 19/01, issued on 7 March 2019 and includes any Ruling issued to replace that Ruling provided that any change to the Ruling does not affect the application of this determination.

### 6\. Method

1.  The method for determining the amount of expenditure that is to be allocated to each income year is on a paid basis. That is, the amount of the Infrastructure Payment made by a Landowner in an income year is allocated to that income year as expenditure
2.  If a Landowner does not pay an Infrastructure Payment in an income year, no amount is allocated as expenditure in that income year.
3.  If the property is purchased by a person in an income year:
    1.  Where the Infrastructure Payment for the period is prepaid beyond the date of settlement of the transaction, the payment by the purchaser for their apportioned share of the prepaid Infrastructure Payments (covering the period from the time of settlement) will be allocated to the income year in which settlement occurred.
    2.  Where the Infrastructure Payment for the period is accrued but unpaid on the settlement date, the amount owing and adjusted for on settlement by the vendor for their apportioned share of the accrued but unpaid Infrastructure Payments (covering the period up to settlement) will be allocated by the purchaser to the year that the purchaser makes a payment of its first Infrastructure Payment (i.e. the Infrastructure Payment income from settlement is netted against the next Infrastructure Payment paid by the purchaser).

### 7\. Example

The examples below illustrate the application of the method set out in this determination.

**Example 1**

A Landowner purchases a subdivided section on 1 July 2019 with a Final Encumbrance attached. The Final Encumbrance requires annual Infrastructure Payments of $1,200 per year. The term of the Final Encumbrance is 30 years.

The Infrastructure Payments fall due for payment in four equal quarterly instalments on the same payment dates that apply for quarterly payments of Auckland Council general rates, being:

*   31 August, for the period 1 July - 30 September
*   30 November, for the period 1 October - 31 December
*   28 February, for the period 1 January - 31 March
*   31 May, for the period 1 April - 30 June

If the Landowner pays the Infrastructure Payments on the due dates the Landowner will have the following amounts allocated as expenditure in the income year ended 31 March 2020:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 31 August 2019 | $300.00 |
| 30 November 2019 | $300.00 |
| 28 February 2020 | $300.00 |
| **Total Interest Component** | **$900.00** |

**Example 2**

Assume the same facts as Example 1, however the Landowner elects to prepay all Infrastructure Payments on 1 July 2019.

As the financial arrangement has matured, a BPA is required and no spreading method will be applied. The full prepaid amount will be expenditure under the BPA in the income year ended 31 March 2020.

**Example 3**

Assume the same facts as Example 1, however the Landowner sells the section on 31 July 2029. The Final Encumbrance is transferred to the New Landowner.

On settlement, there will be an apportionment of the accrued but unpaid Infrastructure Payment on settlement date, calculated on a number of days basis:

31 days / 92 days in the quarter \* $300 = $101.10

If the Landowner pays the Infrastructure Payments on the due dates the Landowner will have the following amounts allocated as expenditure to the year of disposal (the income year ended 31 March 2030):

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 31 May 2029 | $300.00 |
| Transfer of Final Encumbrance | $101.10 |
| **Total Interest Component** | **$401.10** |

**Example 4**

Assume the same facts as Example 3, but from the purchaser's (New Landowner's) perspective.

On settlement, there will be an apportionment of the accrued but unpaid Infrastructure Payment on settlement date, calculated on a number of days basis:

31 days / 92 days in the quarter \* $300 = $101.10

This apportionment of outgoings will be consideration paid to the New Landowner. If the New Landowner pays the Infrastructure Payments on the due dates the New Landowner will have the following amount of expenditure allocated to the year following acquisition (the income year ended 31 March 2030):

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Transfer of Final Encumbrance | ($101.10) |
| 31 August 2029 | $300.00 |
| 30 November 2029 | $300.00 |
| 28 February 2030 | $300.00 |
| **Total Interest Component** | **$798.00** |

**Example 5**

Assume the same facts as Example 4, but the New Landowner has a 31 July non-standard balance date.

The apportionment of outgoings will be allocated to the year that the New Landowner makes a payment of its first Infrastructure Payment (i.e. the income from settlement is netted against the next Infrastructure Payment paid by the New Landowner).

For the year ended 31 July 2029, the New Landowner will have no income or expenditure under the financial arrangements rules in relation to the Final Encumbrance.

For the year ended 31 July 2030, the expenditure will be equal to the Infrastructure Payment\[s\] made by the New Landowner less the apportionment of outgoings.

If the New Landowner pays the Infrastructure Payments on the due dates the New Landowner will have the following amount of expenditure allocated to the year following acquisition (the income year ended 31 July 2030):

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Transfer of Final Encumbrance | ($101.10) |
| 31 August 2029 | $300.00 |
| 30 November 2029 | $300.00 |
| 28 February 2029 | $300.00 |
| 31 May 2030 | $300.00 |
| **Total Interest Component** | **$1098.90** |

DETERMINATION > FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS > SPECIAL Spreading of income and expenditure under an agreement for the sale and purchase of assets Issued: 24 April 2020 S63 UNCLASSIFIED Page 1 of 7 S63 | 24 April 2020 Determination This Determination may be cited as Special Determination S63: Spreading of income and expenditure under an agreement for the sale and purchase of assets. 1 Explanation (which does not form part of the determination) 1. The Vendor and the Purchaser entered into an agreement for the sale and purchase of assets and an interest in a joint venture (the Agreement) on 2 December 2019. 2. The Agreement provides for the consideration to be calculated quarterly and by reference to:  a fixed instalment amount; plus  an amount based on volume of outputs produced by the assets; plus  a share of revenue from the sale of products generated from, or use of, the assets; less  certain costs incurred in holding the assets and in deriving revenue. 3. The total consideration payable by the Purchaser and the duration of the Agreement are unknown, due to the uncertain nature of outputs produced by the assets and the unique nature of the Agreement. 4. An adjustment calculated by reference to net working capital and employee entitlements was required to be calculated and paid by the Vendor to the Purchaser or by the Purchaser to the Vendor soon after the completion date (the Adjustment). 5. This determination prescribes the method for spreading the payments made under the Agreement. 2 Reference This determination is made under s 90AC(1)(bb) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 3 Scope of determination 1. This determination applies to the Purchaser and the Vendor in relation to the Agreement. Under the Agreement the Purchaser acquired certain assets and an UNCLASSIFIED Page 2 of 7 S63 | 24 April 2020 interest in a joint venture (the Property) in consideration for a quarterly payment calculated by reference to:  a fixed instalment amount; plus  an amount based on volume of outputs produced by the assets; plus  a share of revenue from the sale of products generated from, or use of, the assets; less  certain costs incurred in holding the assets and in deriving revenue. 2. The total consideration payable by the Purchaser and the duration of the Agreement are unknown, due to the uncertain nature of outputs produced by the assets and the unique nature of the Agreement. The Agreement can result in payments being made by the Vendor to the Purchaser. 3. The Agreement also provided for the acquisition of other specific assets (which are not part of the Property referred to in para 3.1) by the Purchaser in exchange for a one-off Adjustment to be paid soon after the completion date. 4. The Purchaser and the Vendor both use International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) to prepare financial statements and to report for financial arrangements. 5. Both parties must apply the method specified in this determination. 4 Principle 1. The Agreement is a “financial arrangement” under s EW 3 and is an “agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services” under s YA 1. The Agreement is not an “excepted financial arrangement” under s EW 5. 2. The Adjustment is an “excepted financial arrangement” under s EW 5(22). Any amount that is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement described in ss EW 5(17) to (25) that is part of a financial arrangement, is an amount that is taken into account under the financial arrangements rules (s EW 6(3)). This determination specifies that amounts payable in relation to the Adjustment do not need to be spread under the financial arrangements rules. 3. Section EW 15C(1) does not apply to the Agreement, because the financial arrangement is an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services that is not a “foreign ASAP” (as defined in s YA 1). Accordingly, one of the methods in s EW 151(2) must be used to allocate an amount of income or expenditure to an UNCLASSIFIED Page 3 of 7 S63 | 24 April 2020 income year. A method that is available under s EW 151(2)(c) is a determination made by the Commissioner. 4. The parties have agreed a lowest price for the Property. This is the value of the Property for the purposes of s EW 32. The lowest price has been separated into:  a lowest price for the Property (the Property Lowest Price); and  a lowest price for the Adjustment (the Adjustment Lowest Price). 5. Under s EW 29, in the income year in which the final payment is due under the Agreement, each Party will be required to undertake a base price adjustment (BPA) calculation. 5 Interpretation In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires:  All legislative references in this determination are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated. 6 Method 1. The Adjustment amounts do not need to be spread under the financial arrangements rules. 2. In each income year prior to the year in which a BPA is required, each Party is only required to recognise income under the Arrangement to the extent that:  the Party receives a net payment from the other Party in that income year;  the payment received by the Party is not the Adjustment; and  the cumulative net amount of all of the consideration received and paid by the Party in that income year and all preceding income years for the Property (excluding the Adjustment) exceeds the Property Lowest Price. 3. In each income year prior to the year in which a BPA is required, each Party may only recognise expenditure under the Arrangement to the extent that:  the Party makes a net payment to the other Party in that income year;  the payment made to the Party is not the Adjustment; and UNCLASSIFIED Page 4 of 7 S63 | 24 April 2020  the cumulative net amount of all of the consideration paid and received by the Party in that income year and all preceding income years for the Property (excluding the Adjustment) exceeds the Property Lowest Price. 4. In the income year in which the final payment is due under the Agreement, each Party will be required to undertake a BPA calculation. 7 Example The following examples illustrate the application of the method set out in this determination. The figures and values used in these examples are indicative only and cannot be relied on as an indication of the expected cashflows under the Agreement. Example A This example is based on the following:  The Parties have agreed a Property Lowest Price of $20 million;  The Vendor receives $2 million in year 1 for the Adjustment;  The Vendor receives the following payments from the Purchaser for the Property: o $8 million in year 1; o $10 million in year 2; o $10 million in year 3; and o $6 million in year 4.  The Agreement terminates in year 4.  The Vendor does not make any payments to the Purchaser. No part of the Adjustment needs to be spread under the financial arrangements rules. In relation to the Property, the Vendor will recognise income and expenditure from the Agreement as follows (excluding the Adjustment): Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Cumulative cash received / (paid) $8 million $18 million $28 million $34 million UNCLASSIFIED Page 5 of 7 S63 | 24 April 2020 Income / (expenditure) recognised in income year $0 $0 $8 million $6 million (Determined under the BPA) In relation to the Property, the Purchaser will recognise income and expenditure from the Agreement as follows: Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Cumulative cash received / (paid) ($8 million) ($18 million) ($28 million) ($34 million) Income / (expenditure) recognised in income year $0 $0 ($8 million) ($6 million) (Determined under the BPA) Example B This example is based on the following:  The Parties have agreed a Property Lowest Price of $20 million;  The Vendor receives $2 million in year 1 for the Adjustment;  The Vendor has received the following payments from Purchaser for the Property: o $15 million in year 1; o $0 million in year 2; o $8 million in year 3 o $4 million in year 4; and o $6 million in year 5.  The Purchaser receives a payment of $5 million for the Property from the Vendor in year 2.  The Agreement terminates in year 5. No part of the Adjustment needs to be spread under the financial arrangements rules. UNCLASSIFIED Page 6 of 7 S63 | 24 April 2020 In relation to the Property, the Vendor will recognise income and expenditure from the Agreement as follows (excluding the Adjustment): Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Cumulative cash received / (paid) $15 million $10 million $18 million $22 million $28 million Income / (expenditure) recognised in income year $0 $0 $0 $2 million $6 million (Determined under the BPA) In relation to the Property, the Purchaser will recognise income and expenditure from the Agreement as follows: Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Cumulative cash received / (paid) ($15 million) ($10 million) ($18 million) ($22 million) ($28 million) Income / (expenditure) recognised in income year $0 $0 $0 ($2 million) ($6 million) (Determined under the BPA) This determination is signed by me on the 24 th day of April 2020.

Fifteen percent of active SMEs owe one third of the total IR tax debt and a third of the debt owed is made up of penalties and interest. This report provides policy makers and administrators with advice about the interventions that are most likely to be effective in addressing the SME tax debt burden. It stresses the importance of early intervention actions in conjunction with education, the increased discretionary use of waiving penalties as an incentive, along with the threat of non-monetary sanctions, such as credit reporting. On their own they are unlikely to produce effective outcomes, however they increase our knowledge of factors underlying SME tax debt. Key points include: Penalties influence payment in many cases, and discourage it in some cases  It is the mere existence of penalties that influences payment for SMEs that have never been in debt (rather than the specific details). Most SMEs are aware of financial penalties for late payment of business tax  There is a complex relationship between awareness of sanctions (penalties and interest) and compliance.  Awareness and imposition of penalties and interest can increase compliance in the early stages of the tax debt being incurred. There is a lack of detailed knowledge and understanding of the current late payment penalty  Most SMEs see penalties as influential but many lack specific knowledge of how they are applied. Increased knowledge of the penalty system can increase compliance in the early stages of the tax debt being incurred  Increased knowledge of penalties and interest will help increase payment for some SMEs, in particular SMEs with current debt or SMEs who have a history of debt.  Providing information in the early stages and early dialogue about payment options and the possibility of avoiding penalties is likely to encourage more SMEs to contact IR before payment is due.  However, there is a debt tipping point at which penalties and interest are ineffective, if not obstructive.  Most SMEs that were not aware of payment options and the possibility of avoiding penalties (and who have made a late payment in the last three years) would have contacted IR had they known they could avoid some penalties. Debt experiences can impact on SMEs business practices  The main reasons for incurring late payment penalties are administrative error, short-term and long- term cashflow problems.  Debt experiences can prompt SMEs to change their business processes or practices but it depends on the cause and simplicity of the tax debt. For example, the more simple the cause of the debt, the more likelihood of changes (and vice versa).  Most SMEs with tax debt assume that their debts will only be written off through bankruptcy. Sanction Thresholds Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public SMEs are evenly divided about the fairness of IR financial penalties for late payment  This varies by debt status. For example, SMEs in debt consider the financial penalties as more unfair than SMEs that have never been in debt.  SMEs that are not in debt perceive bankruptcy as an ‘easy option’. They consider that IR should recover some tax debt rather than none, and support the waiver of penalties but not interest so that SMEs can make inroads into the tax amount. There are penalty thresholds and debt tipping points Threshold  Penalties and interest build up at 8 days is 5.2%. At this point most SMEs would be encouraged to pay by the due date.  For many SMEs penalties and interest amounting to 3.3% would encourage them to pay by the due date.  There is an inverse relationship between penalty threshold and annual turnover. Debt tipping point  The median debt tipping point where debt becomes unmanageable across all SMEs is $10,000. This does not vary by debt status.  In addition to the above dollar amount, other factors in the debt tipping point are when income is not sufficient to service the debt, penalties and interest are approaching 50% of the original tax amount, or when payment arrangements are only paying penalties and interest without making inroads into the original amount. Non-monetary sanctions and incentives could be somewhat effective  Improved notification in itself would only be partly effective. The full leverage comes from early dialogue and IRs ability to waive penalties in return for a payment arrangement.  Credit reporting in combination with dialogue and payment arrangements could encourage compliance.  Smaller sized businesses are more sensitive to sanctions than larger SMEs so a combination of financial and non-financial sanctions would be effective for this group. IR can play an instrumental role in preventing future tax debt  SMEs accept that it is their responsibility to financially manage their business and comply with their tax obligations.  But a more proactive role by IR in the management of tax debt would be effective, targeting those in early debt and those that have a history of debt. Sanction Thresholds 3 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Introduction Inland Revenue (IR) plays a central role in securing and delivering most of the financial resources required by the Government to provide services and facilities that improve New Zealanders’ quality of life. Delays in collection affect the level and timeliness of financial resources available to the Government. Delay helps secure an unfair competitive advantage for those who withhold tax payments to improve their cashflow. At a macro-economic level, delaying tax payments also adds to the level of government borrowing and public debt interest. The small and medium enterprise (SME) sector makes a significant contribution to New Zealand’s economy, but a large proportion of the $5.15 billion of total tax debt is owed by SMEs. SMEs make up about a third of tax debtors within New Zealand, with this debt primarily incurred through financial penalties that result from income tax, GST and PAYE. IR wants to understand the drivers behind SME debt in order to develop effective interventions to reduce it. Past experience shows how difficult it is to design an effective penalty system. Other factors also contribute to tax compliance behaviour, such as social norms 1 , prioritisation of debts, and whether the tax system is considered fair and equitable. A better understanding of SME attitudes and behaviour towards tax debt and IRs late payment penalties and interest assists IR to determine use of financial sanctions and other non-monetary sanctions and incentives. Specifically, the report looks at: • views on current sanctions • the effectiveness of current sanctions on compliance behaviour • thresholds and tipping points of sanctions • other types of sanctions This will assist policy and operations to better target current penalties and help IR look at new ways or different approaches to its current and other non-monetary sanctions (see Future considerations). The report explores whether there is a tipping point with financial sanctions, in particular, whether there is a threshold with late payment penalties and interest for some SME tax customers. International research (OECD 2010) argues that sanctions are only partially effective as a compliance mechanism. This report looks at how sanctions and initiatives can more effectively be used by IR to help SMEs better manage their tax obligations, to reduce the time SMEs are in debt, and the level of debt incurred. It also explores hypothetical non-monetary sanctions to supplement the current sanction regime to encourage compliance for some SMEs. We focus specifically on tax debt incurred by SMEs through late payment of income tax, GST and PAYE, and with late payment penalties (penalties) and interest charges. 1 Social norms are the accepted behaviours within a society or group. The term ‘social norm’ is used here as it encompasses wider behaviours than that of ‘compliance norms’, which refers to behaviour motivated by rewards and the avoidance of sanctions. Sanction Thresholds 4 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Background SMEs play a crucial role in New Zealand’s economic wellbeing. Ninety-seven percent of firms employ fewer than 19 employees (Ministry of Economic Development, 2010). Business revenue collection is also significant for IR. Therefore, it is important for IR to understand this sector, especially as small businesses are more susceptible to incurring tax debt than other IR customers. Ten percent of SMEs owe almost half of IR tax debt and 15% of active SMEs owe one third. About one third of the debt owed by SMEs is made up of penalties and interest. The OECD (2010) Understanding and Influencing Taxpayers’ Compliance Behaviour report confirms that, although the success of deterrence strategies can be linked to fear of detection or severity of punishment, it is also linked to norms. Deterrence is more effective where strong social norms exist (see The role of non- financial sanctions and incentives for discussion). It proposes that revenue bodies consider the use of non- monetary penalties. The report also stresses that it is important to understand the compliance behaviour of corporations and the role of tax intermediaries and other third parties in this. The report assists with understanding how penalties and interest (within IRs debt collection practices) impact SME debt behaviour 2 . Previous research on compliance behaviour confirms that for some tax customers, sanctions are effective motivators to compliance. These tend to be the ‘rational economic actors’, who are motivated by a financial advantage to complying and see sanctions as an ‘incentive’ to comply. There are also tax customers who have high tax morale and are motivated to comply because it is the ‘right thing to do’. Despite this, tax debt is growing rapidly and current sanctions appear to be only partially effective as a compliance mechanism. The call by the Government to reduce or slow its growth, and reduce the time customers are in debt is the key driver behind this analysis. 2 Tyler (1990) argues that retributive justice refers to the perceptions of fairness of sanctions when rules are broken. Perceptions of retributive unfairness may occur when sanctions are too harsh or too weak. Retributive fairness/justice also relates to the legitimacy of revenue authorities and is an area identified by OECD (2010) requiring further consideration. Sanction Thresholds 5 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Analysis of IRs Administrative data In April 2010 there were 1.1 million SME customers and over half (586,000) of them were active in business. The following analysis is based on IRs administrative data for 2010, and looks at two SME groups (all SMEs and Active SMEs) and their tax debt activity by different areas. ‘Active SMEs’ refer to businesses that have transactions with IR (i.e. Filing, GST, PAYE, Income Tax), which is a subset of all SMEs as not all of them have an obligation to File returns with IR (see the Appendix for definitions). Overall debt situation  In 2010 10% (110,000) of SMEs accounted for nearly one-third of all IR debtors and owed almost half ($2,430 million) of IR tax debt, with an average debt value of $22,000 per customer. Fifteen percent (86,000) of active SMEs owed one third (32%) of the total IR tax debt, with average debt value of $19,000.  Around one-third of the debt owed by SMEs and active SMEs was made up of penalties and interest. Age of debt  Figure 1 shows that when looking at the oldest unpaid debt element each SME debtor had, 41% was less than 6 months and this was the same percentage for those debt elements aged over one year. Compared with SMEs, the oldest debt element owed by active SMEs was younger; 47% younger than 6 months old and 34% over one year. Figure 1. Oldest debt element owed by SMEs Oldest debt element owed by SMEs- Apr 2010 Less than 6 months 41% 6 months - 1 year 18% 1 - 3 years 29% 3 years or more 12% Oldest debt element owed by active SMEs- Apr 2010 Less than 6 months 47% 6 months - 1 year 19% 1 - 3 years 26% 3 years or more 8% Sanction Thresholds Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Tax type  GST debt (including the penalty and interest applied) makes up almost half of total SME debt, followed by income tax debt. PAYE accounts for a smaller proportion of debt.  72%, 32% and 21% of the SME debtors had debt in GST, income tax and in PAYE respectively. Overall, 96% of the SME debtors had debt in one or more of GST, PAYE and income tax. The components of the active SME debtors were similar to that of SMEs, except that proportionally more active SMEs have debt in PAYE and less in income tax. Figure 2. SME customers owing debt in GST, PAYE or income tax (k=,000) Debt by entity type  Individual (or sole trader) and company groups had the higher proportion of debtors, with 19% and 13% respectively in SMEs and 16% and 18% among active SMEs.  Two-thirds of tax debt was owed by companies. Sole traders (individuals in business) owed 20% and trusts owed less than 10%. See Figure 3 below. Figure 3. SME debt by entity type Debt owed by SMEs - by entity type Other 0% Company 67% Trust 9% Individual 20% Partnership 4% Debt owed by active SMEs - by entity type Partnership 4% Individual 19% Trust 8% Company 69% Other 0% GST only, 52k PAY only, 8k INC only, 18k GST and INC, 13k GST and PAY, 11k GST, PAY and INC, 4k INC and PAY, 1k GST PAY AY INC Sanction Thresholds Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Debt by industry area 3  The Primary Production sector has the best debt profile among the five industry groups 4 . The Services sector was the largest debt contributor (excluding SME customers who did not have an industry classification for their business) accounting for 25% of the total debt. Debt by business size  Customers with a large GST turnover or more employees were more likely to be in debt. However, a very high proportion of the total debt was owed by small businesses with GST turnover below $500,000 annually or with nil GST turnover. See Figure 4 below. Figure 4. SME debt by entity’s turnover  72% and 59% of the debt owed by SMEs and active SMEs respectively were from the entities that did not employ any people. See Figure 5 below. Figure 5. SME debt by entity’s employee number 3 NB. Almost 50% of SMEs and 25% active SMEs did not have an industry code 4 The industrial group is based on ANZSIC06 and grouped into five categories: Primary Production, Industrial, Distribution, Business and Finance, and Services.

But the average debt value and proportion of penalty and interest was significantly lower than older businesses.  Figure 6 below shows that about two-thirds of SMEs owing tax debt were from businesses aged over five years. The penalties and interest for these customers made up about 40% of their debt. Figure 6. SME debt owed by business age Use of tax agents  Many SMEs use a tax agent. SMEs that did not were more likely to owe tax debt. Their average debt amount, as well as the proportion of penalty and interest, was higher than those who use a tax agent. Debt by location  About half of the debt was owed by SMEs from the Auckland region.  Figure 7 below shows that the Auckland region (including Takapuna and Manukau service centre areas) has a higher proportion of debtors. Also the average debt value of those from Auckland region was higher than other regions. Figure 7.

Awareness of late payment penalties Penalties influence payment in the majority of cases, and discourage it in a minority of cases  It is the mere existence of penalties that influences payment for SMEs that have never been in debt rather than the specific details (see the Discussion section).  For the majority of SMEs penalties are influential in making sure they pay their business tax by the due dates to avoid any additional or unnecessary cost to their business.  Few SMEs are aware of the size of the penalties or the interest rate, that the penalties can build up quickly, or that the penalties could impact their business.  The views of tax agents are similar. Most SMEs are aware of financial penalties for late payment of business tax  Most SMEs are aware that interest accrues on any unpaid amount and that penalties and interest are calculated on the total unpaid amount, including any unpaid penalties.  However, there is a complex relationship between awareness of sanctions (penalties and interest) and compliance.  Awareness and imposition of penalties and interest can increase compliance in the early stages of the tax debt being incurred. There is a lack of detailed knowledge and understanding of late payment penalties  Most SMEs are aware there are financial penalties for late payment of business tax and see them as influential but they lack knowledge of how they are applied.  Relatively few SMEs are aware that on the day following the due date a penalty of 1% is applied, that after the seventh day following the due date a penalty of 4% is applied, and that a 1% penalty is applied per month on any unpaid amount. Increased knowledge of the penalty system can increase compliance in the early stages of the tax debt being incurred  Increased knowledge of penalties and interest will help increase payment for some SMEs, in particular SMEs with current debt or SMEs who have a history of debt.  Most SMEs that were not aware of payment options and the possibility of avoiding penalties (and who have made a late payment in the last three years) would have contacted IR had they known they could avoid some penalties.  Providing information in the early stages and early dialogue about payment options and the possibility of avoiding penalties is likely to encourage more SMEs (especially those at risk of being late with their tax payments) to contact IR before payment is due.  However, there is a debt tipping point which penalties and interest are ineffective, if not obstructive. Sanction Thresholds Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Reasons for late payments The main causes of tax debt include administrative or cashflow problems  For SMEs that have never been in debt, the reasons tend to relate to an error on the part of the business, such as not being aware of or forgetting the date, or some other error. SMEs with a debt history tend to attribute their most recent late payment to not being aware of or forgetting the due date, or external circumstances beyond their control.  SMEs currently in debt, on the other hand, tend to attribute their late payment to poor cashflow. These SMEs are also more likely than average to say they used the money for other expenses.  Many SMEs late with a payment have no contact with IR prior to the due date.  Most SMEs are aware they can contact IR in advance to avoid some penalties although SMEs currently in debt are less likely to be aware of this.  Tax agents generally believe SMEs miss the due dates for tax payment primarily due to a lack of cashflow. The majority of SMEs make changes to practices and processes as a result of making a late payment  The cause and simplicity of the tax debt has a direct correlation with changes to business practices. The more simple the cause of the debt, the more likelihood of change (and vice versa). Many SMEs that have missed a recent payment have made a change to their practices or processes as a direct result of having missed a payment.  SMEs currently in debt (for whom short-term cashflow was the primary reason for late payment) are most likely to set funds aside to ensure they make payments or keep a closer eye on their obligations and finances.  SMEs with tax debt caused by long-term cashflow difficulties and more complex financial issues in their business are likely to be more restricted in the immediate, simple, straightforward changes they can make. They will need to make more substantial changes to avoid this situation in the future, e.g., generating more revenue, improving debtors’ management and better management of finances. The potential for changes depends on the economy, overall debt level of the business, the ability to generate income and whether they can realistically trade out of difficulties.  SMEs with a debt history (who are not aware of or have forgotten the due date) are more likely than SMEs currently in debt to have set up a reminder to ensure they do not miss due dates in future.  SMEs with tax debt caused by administrative errors make straightforward changes to business practices and processes to ensure it does not happen again, e.g., reminders of due dates and improved administrative practices. Payment prioritisation of debt  Decision-makers trade-off various competing payment priorities under different penalty regimes. Paying employee wages is the highest priority, regardless of the threat of implications. Payments to IR rate second (with PAYE rating higher than GST).  Differences between small and larger sized SMEs suggest that different compliance strategies are required for different sized businesses. SMEs are evenly divided about the fairness of IR financial penalties  This varies by debt status. For example, SMEs with a debt history and SMEs currently in debt are more likely to consider the financial penalties as being unfair for businesses.  Most commonly this is because they think financial penalties are high, or they can compound and get out of control.  However there is recognition that they are a lever to obligate SMEs to pay on time and are needed to encourage compliance.  Ongoing penalties are considered to be unfairly harsh for those who are making an attempt to pay, and in this situation the penalties undermine the ability to comply. There is, however, support for the continued application of interest rates (higher than the banks’ loan rates) for unpaid amounts. Sanction Thresholds Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Tax agents  Tax agents are divided about whether the system is fair or unfair.  Some consider it is a business’ obligation to pay on time, that the interest rate is fair, and that the penalties are an incentive for businesses to pay on time.  Others consider the financial penalties are unfair because the penalties or interest rate is too high, or because penalties can build up and become out of control. Attitudes and behaviours vary over SME customer groups  Financial (and business) aptitude marks the difference between those SMEs that have never been in tax debt and SMEs that have experience of tax debt.  IRs appropriate and effective management of tax debt needs to be aware of the difference between SMEs that have tax debt caused by administrative error (but ability to pay), tax debt caused by short- term cashflow, and ongoing cashflow difficulties associated with reduced ability to pay. SMEs are not gambling that tax debts will be written off  Most SMEs with tax debt assume that their tax debts will only be written off through bankruptcy and that IR will use bankruptcy as a tool of last resort. They want to avoid bankruptcy believing they may be able to trade their way out of their financial difficulties.  SMEs that are not in debt perceive bankruptcy and tax debt written off as an ‘easy option’ taken by SMEs in debt. They consider that IR should recover some tax debt rather than none. To this extent, they support the waiver of penalties but not interest so that SMEs can make inroads into the tax amount. Penalty thresholds and debt tipping points There are penalty thresholds and debt tipping points  It is important to determine the point at which penalties encourage SMEs to make their payments by the due dates (the penalty threshold). Penalty and interest build up at 8 days is 5.2%.  At this point most SMEs would be encouraged to pay by the due date.  For 75% of SMEs penalties and interest amounting to 3.3% would encourage them to pay by the due date. Penalty threshold and annual turnover  There is an inverse relationship between penalty threshold and annual turnover.  The threshold at which 75% of SMEs would be encouraged to pay at 8 days is outlined in Table 1. Table 1 Percentage of tax bill by SME annual turnover % of SMEs tax bill Annual turnover 6.5% up to $50 thousand 3.8% $50,001-$100 thousand 2.0% $100,001-$500 thousand 1.7% $500,001-$100 million Sanction Thresholds Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Debt tipping point When does the amount of debt become unmanageable?  Across all SMEs the median debt tipping point is $10,000.  For SMEs with $500,001-$100 million turnover this is closer to $30,000.  For SMEs with 6+ employees it is $40,000.  The median tipping points do not vary by debt status. In addition to the dollar amount, other factors influence the debt tipping point:  When penalties and interest compound to the extent that they are 50% or more of the original tax amount owing.  The repayment amount that businesses can afford out of current revenue is so little that it is only addressing penalties and interest and not the tax amount itself.  Other business and personal debt, e.g., employee wage costs, suppliers, bank interest and other costs, contribute to SMEs inability to pay tax debt.  There is a cumulative tax debt across several tax types.  The total amount owing is out of proportion with yearly income. The role of non-financial sanctions and incentives Non-monetary sanctions and incentives could be somewhat effective  Five non-monetary sanctions and incentives have been identified as potentially encouraging SMEs to pay their outstanding tax.  These include improved notification, credit reporting, an annual practising certificate, travel restrictions, and information on statements to show how penalties and interest build up.  Travel restrictions, improved notification, and credit reporting were considered the most effective, although all five sanctions and incentives would be somewhat effective in encouraging on-time payment. The effectiveness of each non-monetary incentive and sanction differs considerably by sub-group  SMEs that have never been in debt and tax agents favour more punitive options, such as travel restrictions and credit reporting.  SMEs with a debt history preferred improved notification, followed by travel restrictions and credit reporting. Improved notification and information on statements  Improved notification in itself would be only partly effective. The full leverage comes from the dialogue and IRs ability to waive penalties in return for a payment arrangement.  Improved notification and showing how penalties and interest build up over time are not effective for people who have long-term/large debt with insufficient revenue to enter into a payment arrangement. In this situation, the notification contributes to the tipping point and inaction. Travel restrictions and certificate of compliance  Travel restrictions are considered difficult to enforce, and a certificate of compliance is an ineffective incentive.  SMEs that are not in debt support travel restrictions for SMEs in debt who ‘just want to holiday’, but they do not support travel restrictions for those who need to travel for their business.  It would be ineffective for SMEs that have debt – they cannot afford to travel and see it as a punitive measure. Sanction Thresholds Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Credit reporting  Credit reporting is perceived to be an effective tool working in much the same way as penalties.  The threat of credit reporting would need to be used early (while the debt can still be managed) to warn SMEs of the consequences of not making arrangements with IR for the repayment of outstanding tax.  However, just like accumulated penalties and interest, credit reporting will contribute to the tipping point and to the business’ inability to trade out of difficulty.  It is likely to be a short step from credit reporting to bankruptcy for some SMEs.  SMEs that are not in debt would welcome the protection offered by the credit reporting of insolvent businesses. Improved notification and information to show how penalties build up would be most effective when combined with the current financial penalties and interest. Smaller sized businesses are more sensitive to sanctions than larger SMEs and a combination of financial and non-financial sanctions would be effective for this group. The role of Inland Revenue Inland Revenue can play an instrumental role in preventing future tax debt  SMEs accept that it is their responsibility to financially manage their business and comply with their tax obligations.  However, they think that IR taking a more proactive role in the management of tax debt would be effective; targeting those in early debt and those that have a history of debt. Currently IR notifies SMEs in debt that penalties and interest are applying, that they can enter into a payment arrangement and that they can phone IR. However, this current communication is not maximising the leverage that IR has for effective intervention to prevent, manage or limit tax debt. SMEs believe that IR currently prevents or limits tax debt almost solely through information and sanctions (with some payment arrangements). While, on the one hand, the debt is serious enough to impose penalties and interest, SMEs are also getting the message that it is not urgent or of sufficiently high priority for IR to actively contact SMEs and instigate standard debt collection practices. Those with a high level of financial management skill (and meet their tax obligations) perceive IRs role as tax collection only. More contact may be generated if more SMEs are made aware earlier of payment arrangements and the waiver of penalties. At this point they are likely to have small or short-term debt and the cashflow reserves to enter into payment arrangements. Those with a poor level of skill and/or extenuating circumstances (e.g., affected by a downturn in the economy) favour a greater role by IR to prevent and/or manage tax debt. These SMEs are likely to need proactive management from IR. They are likely to have large or long-term debt, have already incurred substantial penalties and interest, business financial difficulties and/or a mindset of not dealing with issues. Awareness and use of instalment options  Increased awareness of payment options and the waiver of penalties are likely to increase contact with IR by SMEs at risk.  Most SMEs are aware they can contact IR in advance to avoid some penalties, although SMEs currently in debt are less aware of this.  Most SMEs who have been late with a payment had no contact with IR prior to the due date. Many would have contacted IR had they known they could avoid some penalties.  There is a strong argument from SMEs and tax agents for IR to manage tax debt through a more urgent, standardised business debt collection practice which would consist of early, personalised contact (by telephone from a dedicated debt collection team), dialogue, negotiation of the payment terms in return for avoiding negative consequences and then the consequences introduced if the business makes no attempt to pay (penalties, credit reporting and bankruptcy). Sanction Thresholds 14 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Future considerations The 2011 IR annual report shows $1.15 billion of debt, (overdue tax, penalties and interest) at 30 June 2011, being paid back under instalment arrangement compared to $938 million at the same time the previous year. Much of this is SME debt. The increase of 23 percent is part of a strategy by IR to deal with tax debt, which rose from $3.66 billion at the end of June 2007 to just over $5.5 billion at the end of June 2011. Analysis of IR administrative data has shown that the older tax debt becomes, the more uncollectable it is, which has led to a focus on tackling it early. Uncollectable tax debt has increased from $1.17 billion in 2007 to $1.71 billion. Inland Revenue has identified the following issues for future consideration. Better targeted communications to SME customers (in particular to those currently in early stages of tax debt and those who have a history of tax debt) focusing on late payment penalties Undertake a review of current communication messaging aimed at late payment penalties  There is a lack of specific knowledge of penalties by SMEs.  The review would include the content of outgoing letters that relate to penalties, including the type of language used, and that interest rates can and do change over time. Undertake a targeted campaign aimed at SMEs with a history of late payment tax debt (in particular, SMEs with young tax debt)  This would include directing SMEs to an online calculator that would help them estimate the consequences and impact if they do not enter into a payment arrangement.  Messaging would focus on SMEs that have a first debt case, providing them with additional information about penalties and interest.  Evaluate the impact of the campaign and explore the feasibility of applying it to other types of penalty, such as employer monthly schedules (EMS) penalty. Leverage off intermediaries to disseminate information more effectively  For example, host a ‘tax game’ or a SME tax calculator on IRs website or other industry websites. Improved processes and systems to enable easier repayment Consider the use of standard debt collection practices 5  Trial early contact using the campaign management teams to contact debtors 3 - 4 days after the due date. Review the timing of notifications  Design and trial changes to the frequency and type of notifications. 5 For example, personalised contact (by telephone from a dedicated debt collection team), dialogue, negotiation of the payment terms in return for avoiding negative consequences and then the consequences introduced if the business makes no attempt to pay (penalties, credit reporting and bankruptcy). Sanction Thresholds Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Support better SME self-management  IR can promote the types of changes businesses make to their processes (such as reminders of due dates and better administrative practices), or practices used by SMEs that have never been in debt. For example, keeping a tight rein on all financial aspects and accounting for the business, i.e. invoice debtors on the 20th of the month and pay all creditors on the due date.  For cashflow problems, these include: setting aside funds to ensure payments can be made; generating more revenue; improving debtors’ management and better management of finances to help improve tools currently being used.  Inform new businesses or businesses with ‘young’ debt. Investigate policy options on the use of incentives and non-monetary sanctions Undertake an in-depth evaluation of IRs early intervention processes  Investigate the feasibility of credit reporting and travel restrictions as levers to encourage repayment of tax debt.  Increasing the visibility of non-monetary sanctions would support SMEs and encourage non-viable businesses to cease trading before they are forced into receivership.  This would require closer consultation with the Ministry of Justice, which is already exploring the use of non-monetary sanctions for non-payment of fines. Sanction Thresholds 16 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Discussion There may be opportunities for changes to policy and practices to assist with reducing the growth of SME tax debt and ensure optimal solutions are in place to reduce the level of default and increase revenue for the Government. The issues regarding SME tax debt are complex and it would be naive to imagine that a magic bullet can fully address the growing level of IR debt. Any changes would require a sustained and consistent approach. Although most SMEs pay their tax on time, some SMEs are at particular risk of incurring debt. HM Revenue & Customs (2010) noted that countries which act early to ensure taxpayers pay on time and prevent payments from becoming overdue end up holding less debt and have less debt to recover. This means that older existing debt is harder to clear. This report considers both debtors and non-debtors as we learn what determines compliance behaviour. It also identifies tipping points and thresholds when penalties and interest become so large that the SME debtor is unable to continue to make repayments. These indicate the importance of early intervention. Key conclusions indicate that a ‘wrap around approach’ to early intervention would be more effective than one that is more ‘linear’. For example, notifying and educating SMEs who are late with their payments will not help those SMEs who do not have the capacity to make payments. A coordinated approach is likely to produce more effective outcomes. This approach would need to include early identification, notification, and education, along with a long-term sustainable payment schedule. It would also require close monitoring of that schedule. The use of IRs discretionary power to waive penalty charges also emerges as an effective lever. This, along with the threat of non-financial sanctions, will provide a more effective approach to managing SME tax debt. The overall purpose is to explore current sanctions and their effectiveness on compliance behaviour, identify thresholds and tipping points of sanctions, and identify other types of sanctions. Current sanctions For the majority of SMEs penalties are influential in ensuring they pay their business tax by the due dates. However, in-depth knowledge of the penalty rules does not necessarily equate to compliance. While most SMEs are aware of financial penalties for the late payment of business tax there is a lack of detailed knowledge of how the sanctions are applied. SMEs with debt or who have a history of debt are no more knowledgeable than SMEs that have never been in debt. Increased knowledge of the penalty rules would more likely benefit SMEs currently in debt or with a history of debt in the early stages of the tax debt being incurred. For SMEs who have never been in debt, knowing that penalties exist is enough for this group to comply. The Canada Revenue Agency wrote about similar findings in 2009 (Attitudes towards payment of debt and compliance). The majority of taxpayers assumed there would be some sort of adverse financial consequence, such as interest, but awareness was low about how charges are calculated. The introduction of non-payment penalties appears to have had some success by encouraging customers into instalment arrangements. However, those who enter into instalment arrangements are those more vulnerable to being unable to make tax debt payments. Sanction Thresholds Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Issues of fairness SMEs are evenly divided on the fairness of sanctions. SMEs in debt (especially those in debt for a longer time) or with a history of tax debt consider the regime as more unfair than SMEs who have never been in debt. Financial penalties are considered to be high, and there is a concern that penalties and interest can compound and get out of control. While it is accepted that incurring interest on outstanding tax owed is fair, where SMEs have entered into payment arrangements there should not be ongoing and compounding penalties. This contributes to the tipping points and makes it less likely that the tax debt will be paid. In the UK in 2008, HM Revenue & Customs reported that taxpayers felt that a system of interest and penalties for non-payment of tax is necessary in order to ensure fair treatment. They also perceived that percentage interest payments, in line with those of other financial institutions (such as banks), to be the fairest sanction for non-payment. In New Zealand, IR plays a central role in securing and delivering most of the financial resources required by the Government to provide services and facilities that improve New Zealanders’ quality of life. Delays in collection affect the level and timeliness of financial resources available to the Government. Delay also helps secure an unfair competitive advantage for those who withhold tax payments to improve their cashflow. At a macro-economic level, delaying tax payments also adds to the level of government borrowing and public debt interest. Various factors influence tax debt attitudes and behaviour. One of the factors is a perceived lack of fairness, equity and justice with the tax system. Inadequate knowledge of tax law has been argued by small business taxpayers as a reason for their inability to meet their obligations (McKerchar, 1995; Coleman and Freeman, 1994, 1997; Canada Revenue Agency, 2009). Although some respondents in the Canada Revenue Agency study did understand the role of charges as a penalty (and for some it was a deterrent), they thought that more knowledge about how charges are calculated could have a stronger deterrent impact. IR is increasingly aware that small businesses choose to use tax agents because of the complexity of the tax system and the fear of being penalised should they make mistakes in doing the tax themselves. Early communication with at risk SME groups (SMEs with early debt or a past history of debt) to raise awareness of how penalties are calculated, and a sustainable repayment schedule should help increase the perception of fairness in this group. The role of IR Most SMEs accept that it is their responsibility to meet their tax obligations on time and it is IRs responsibility to collect tax and impose consequences if tax is not paid by the due date. However, IR needs to achieve the appropriate balance of help versus consequences. IR provides information to businesses on its website with a section focusing on the needs of new businesses. In addition, IR provides information to trade associations and other organisations dealing with businesses. ‘Debt prevention education’ for new businesses is regarded as important and for SMEs to be upskilled in good business and money management skills to ensure that tax obligations are met in full and on time. Businesses would like to see IR being more proactive and would also like to see IR offer advisory services to all business and provide account managers. However, IRs role is primarily a tax collection agency and it is not supposed to be an organisation whose aim is to coach business people to gain better business skills. The issue for IR will be how it can clarify its role as government’s principal revenue collector to its SME customers and at the same time provide a tax system that encourages communication and compliance. Sanction Thresholds Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Instalment arrangements Those who enter into instalment arrangements are those more vulnerable to being unable to make tax debt payments. The Canada Revenue Agency (2009) research highlighted a lack of awareness that partial payments can be a viable option for final tax payments. Respondents believed that Canada Revenue Agency will not work with people to develop a payment schedule, but rather insist on receiving the full amount immediately. This belief resulted in participants saying that instead of filing on time and making partial payment at the deadline, they will delay filing and pay the entire amount late. Providing specific information about penalties and payment options is likely to have some influence on SMEs, with a debt history or who are currently in the early stages of debt, to contact IR in advance. The effectiveness of current sanctions on compliance As highlighted earlier, the fact that penalties merely exist (and not how they are applied) is a deterrent for most SMEs and in particular those that have never been in debt. The Irish Revenue (2009) Survey of Small and Medium Sized Business Customers found that knowing there were sanctions was one of the factors respondents gave that encouraged them to pay their taxes on time. Overall, it is clear that in the majority of cases penalties and interest encourages compliance and in a minority of cases they discourage compliance. Current sanctions encourage payment of tax debt in the early stages but are not effective motivators the older the debt becomes. SMEs who have never been in debt consider bankruptcy and tax debt written off as an ‘easy option’ taken by SMEs in debt. They support the waiver of penalties (but not interest) so that SMEs have the ability to make inroads into the tax amount. Feedback suggests IR should act more quickly to intervene, but also impose sanctions if there is no change in behaviour. SMEs not in debt also support credit reporting, as it protects other businesses. Current penalties and interest offer very effective leverage to prevent debt and to manage debt within the first few weeks after a late payment (before the debt escalates). Beyond that window of opportunity, continued application of penalties and interest without proactive (and effective) intervention from IR becomes less effective. Proactive intervention, in combination with not imposing penalties when taxpayers comply with instalment arrangements, is likely to be effective. There would appear to be no need to change the penalty or interest rates, but rather use the existing sanctions more effectively – through operations and communications. Thresholds and tipping points of sanctions Penalty thresholds  Penalties and interest of just 1% at eight days would encourage half of SMEs to pay by the due dates.  Three quarters (75%) of SMEs say that penalties and interest of 3.3% would encourage them to pay by the due dates.  Penalties and interest of 5.2% (build-up at eight days under the existing system) would encourage most to pay by the due dates. Figure 8 shows the proportion of all SMEs that would be encouraged to pay at each penalty and interest value. The horizontal line represents the penalty and interest build-up at eight days under the existing system (5.2% at eight days). At this point most SMEs would be encouraged to pay by the due dates. The results are consistent with knowledge of how penalties and interest are applied, that for many SMEs the mere existence of a penalty encourages them to pay their tax by the due dates. Sanction Thresholds Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Debt tipping points There is a tipping point at which penalties and interest decrease compliance, at around $10,000 (total GST debt, including core debt, penalties and interest) beyond which people feel that they will not be able to pay off the amount. As can be seen in the tables below, across all SMEs the median tipping point is a total debt of $10,000. This tipping point remains relatively constant except for larger SMEs that have an annual turnover between $500,001 and $100 million, or six or more employees. The median tipping points for these SMEs are $28,965 and $40,000, respectively. As can be seen in the tables below, the median tipping point does not vary by debt status. Table 2 Debt tipping point by annual turnover All SMEs Annual turnover Up to $50,000 $50,001 to $100,000 $100,001 to $500,000 $500,001 to $100 million Base (n=) 251 41 57 88 62 10 th percentile $2,000 $1,000 $1,800 $4,000 $6,115 25 th percentile $5,000 $2,000 $5,000 $5,948 $10,000 50 th percentile (median) $10,000 $10,000 $10,000 $12,000 $28,965 75 th percentile $30,000 $20,000 $20,000 $38,680 $180,000 90 th percentile $100,000 $50,000 $34,000 $62,822 $500,000 By annual turnover, findings indicate an interest scale could be an effective approach rather than a one size fits all.

Sanction Thresholds Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Figure 9. Window of opportunity before tipping point Triggers to debt There are two main reasons for late payment of tax – administrative errors and cashflow (short-term and long- term). These causes of tax debt are also found in other tax jurisdictions research (Australian Tax Office, 2008; Canada Revenue Agency, 2009; HM Revenue & Customs, 2008). With regard to decision-making and triggers to debt, the HM Revenue & Customs (2008) found that many debtors described how the misalignment between tax due dates and business invoicing dates caused short- term problems. Changes to income tax timeframes (provisional and terminal) to smooth out payments, and aligning the due dates for each tax type would be useful. Paying tax owed is regarded as important, but when it comes to resource allocation decisions and prioritising outstanding debt, businesses rank meeting employee wage costs above other bills. Small business is assumed to be vital to the New Zealand economy, and that the Government needs small business earning revenue and employing people. SMEs with long-term or high tax debt hope that back penalties (and possibly some interest), as well as future penalties can be wiped, so that the original tax debt repayment is achievable. Otherwise they ‘bury their head in the sand’ when they are unable to pay their tax debt or meet their instalment repayment obligations. A group of motivational postures have been identified by Braithwaite (2002) as important in the context of taxation compliance, one of these is disengagement. This is where individuals and groups have moved past the point of challenging the tax authority. For these people the tax system and the tax office are off the radar. The objective is to be socially distant and blocked from view. Disengagement would be a ‘by-product’ of the tipping point with tax debt. IR would need to be cognisant of early warning signs and act before the SME reaches their threshold, and therefore the point of no return where tax becomes uncollectible. IR can use its dialler technology (which is suited to large volume early contact) and its campaign management teams to contact debtors a few days after the due date. At this point it would enable IR to get more debt matters resolved when any penalties and interest would be minimal. 0% 100% Window of opportunity for IR’s interventions SME COMPLIANCE Penalties StartTipping Point TIME SMEs with permanent cash flow problems/business debt/no arrangement SMEs good business practice Escalated debt SMEs with cash flow SMEs with admin error Sanction Thresholds Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Other types of sanctions and incentives The OECD (2010) Understanding and Influencing Taxpayers’ Compliance Behaviour report confirms that although the success of deterrence strategies can be linked to fear of detection or severity of punishment, it is also linked to norms, and deterrence is more effective where strong social norms exist. It proposes that revenue bodies consider the use of non-monetary penalties. Five non-monetary sanctions and incentives have been identified as potentially encouraging SMEs to pay their tax by the due date. These are improved notification, credit reporting, an annual practising certificate, travel restrictions and information on statements to show how penalties and interest build up. All five sanctions and incentives would be at least somewhat effective in encouraging on-time payment. Improved notification and information on statements to show how penalties build up would be more effective when combined with the current financial penalties and interest charges. More punitive options, such as travel restrictions and credit reporting, appeal to SMEs that have never been in debt and tax agents. For SMEs in debt, improved notification is the most effective incentive. Other non-financial sanctions are less appealing. The optimal system needs to strike a balance between punitive elements (penalties and interest charges for late payment) and assistance from IR to help ensure payments are made by the due dates (such as improved notification and more information on statements). The introduction of credit reporting is likely to work in similar ways to penalties and interest, in that it would give IR effective leverage within the first few weeks of debt. However, credit reporting will also work in the same way that accumulated penalties and interest do – making it less likely for the debt to be repaid once the SME has accumulated penalties and interest and a bad credit rating. Incentives Businesses would like a penalties and interest system to take account of good past history. They want IR to be flexible, with more tolerant treatment in terms of penalties and interest for those with good records. In particular, SMEs with a good track record should have some leniency (e.g., no penalty) if they have a one-off late payment. It provides that IR will notify a taxpayer the first time their payment is late, rather than imposing an immediate late payment penalty, and setting out a further date for payment. If payment is not made penalties are then imposed. The most effective route to debt management and recovery is through IR more effectively managing the existing interventions and adopting standard debt collection practices which consist of proactive, early and personalised intervention from staff who are skilled in negotiating and agreeing outcomes. Sanction Thresholds 23 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Conclusion This report has explored factors underlying SME debt attitudes and behaviour. The aim was to identify potential changes to policy and practices that help to lessen the growth of debt, or the time SMEs spend in debt. Penalties and interest are influential, and improving awareness and knowledge of penalties would be effective in preventing or limiting tax debt in the early stages of tax debt. However, there are thresholds and tipping points and these suggest that, rather than changing the penalty rules, IR needs to use the existing sanctions more effectively. This would include better targeting of SMEs at risk, early dialogue, and ensuring staff are skilled in negotiating and agreeing viable repayment agreements. The introduction of credit reporting is likely to work in similar ways to penalties and interest, and could be used in combination with more proactive actions. In particular, the threat of non-financial sanctions can be part of the early dialogue if SMEs do not adhere to payment arrangements. The SME Capability to Manage Regulation (2011) research 6 argues that capability to manage any type of regulation is closely related to the capability to manage the business in general. The World Bank report, Doing Business (2010), states that New Zealand is one of the easiest countries to start a new business but IR tax data and Statistics NZ data show that SMEs are most vulnerable to fail in the first year. There could be a connection between the ease of set up, and the lack of knowledge of regulation obligations. As raised at the beginning of the discussion, the complexities of the issues are such that it would require a collaborative, sustained and consistent approach by those in operations, policy and communications. No single intervention will in itself lead to a step change in outcomes; making a substantive difference over time will take an integrated and consistent approach involving new approaches and interventions. 6 Battisti, M. Deakins, D. & Perry, M. (2011). SME capability to manage regulation. New Zealand Centre for Small & Medium Enterprise Research, Massey University. Report prepared for Inland Revenue. The report argues that while compliance is a measure of demonstrated action, the concept of capability expresses the broader potential to act. It allows for a more nuanced understanding of how SME owners manage regulation. Sanction Thresholds 24 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public References Ahmed, E. & Braithwaite, V.

Sanction Thresholds 26 Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public Appendix A Key definitions The Target group Small and medium enterprises (SME) All entities with an active relationship for GST or PAYE that do not belong to large enterprises or non-profit organisations, and All non-individual entities without active registration for GST or PAYE not belonging to non-profit organisations. Enterprises with less than $100 million GST turnover annually. Sanctions Penalties and interest (related to new and old debt) This study focuses solely on late payment penalties and interest. Late payment penalties - If taxes and duties are not paid by the due dates, customers may have to pay a late payment penalty. Interest - If customers underpay, they will be charged interest from the day after the original due date for payment. These rules are designed to encourage customers to pay the right amount of tax at the right time and to compensate the Government if the customer pays too little tax by charging interest. Interest rates are set by government and are based on market rates and will vary over time. Interest on underpayments is linked to the market rate for short-term borrowing. Interest is calculated on a daily basis on the amount of overpaid or underpaid tax. Interest does not compound and is not included when calculating penalties. Interest on tax underpayments is charged on the tax owing, which includes accumulated penalties and shortfall penalties. Debt 7 Collectible debt is debt that IR expects to collect and where active collection action is occurring or possible. This includes debt that is being progressively repaid under an instalment arrangement. The debt collection process starts with automated actions, such as reminder notices to customers with overdue debt. Next, on the basis of risk of continued non-compliance, cases are identified for debt staff to proactively contact customers to arrange payments, e.g., by phone. Customers who are unable to pay their debt at that time can arrange to repay by instalment. These have grown significantly, partly because of IRs voluntary compliance policy to encourage customers facing financial difficulty in the economic recession to contact IR and set up instalment arrangements to pay their debts. Non-collectible debt includes deferred debt, insolvency debt, default assessments and debt to be written off. Deferred debt is debt that is suspended pending investigation or litigation action. There is potential for a proportion of deferred debt to become collectible once the legal process has finished. The amount of insolvency debt that will be collected depends on the outcome of the insolvency process. 7 Definition of debt is taken from Inland Revenue (2010) Annual Report. Sanction Thresholds Inland Revenue | Te Tari Taake Classification: Public A default assessment is made where a customer has not filed a return to encourage them to comply with their filing obligations. In some circumstances, default assessments are collectible and paid. A proportion of the non-collectible debt will never be collected, and may be written off under various legislative provisions (e.g., hardship provisions). Tax types Income tax, GST and PAYE (most common tax types that incur SME debt). Tipping points When penalties and interest have a positive influence to compliance behaviour and when they become barriers to tax debt repayment. The enterprises in this report are entities that have active registration with Inland Revenue, including:  all non-individual customers that are not non-profit organisations, and  individuals if they registered for tax types of ‘GST’ and/or ‘PAYE’. SMEs are enterprises with less than $100 million GST turnover annually. Active in business. Not all enterprises have reported business activities; some of them register with IR but do not have obligations for filing returns or paying GST, PAYE or Income tax because they do not provide services or sell goods. To identify and separate these entities, those who are running a business and have obligations in filing return or paying for GST or PAYE, or paying Income tax are identified as ‘active 8 ’ . Turnover or GST turnover 9 of an enterprise or SME is the annual sales and income from goods sold and services provided where GST is charged. It includes GST and zero-rated supplies (zero-rated supplies are taxable supplies that are taxed at the rate of 0%) but excludes exempt supplies 10 . This turnover information is from GST101 returns (for GST), which can be filed monthly, two-monthly or six- monthly. For a new entity that starts a business sometime during a tax year, the annual turnover is proportionally estimated based on the turnover it gives for a period of time in the GST101 returns. However, if an entity which has obligation for filing GST did not file any GST101 returns for a tax year, the annual turnover is unknown. For the entities that do not have the GST filing obligation, the GST turnover is regarded as zero. Expenses of an enterprise or SME include the annual purchases and expenses, for which tax invoicing requirements have been met, including GST but excluding imported goods. Expense data are from GST101 returns. Same as GST turnover, the expenses for the new entities that start business sometime after the start of a tax year are proportionally estimated based on the expenses claimed from their GST101 returns. Also the annual expenses are unknown if the entity has not filed at least one GST101 return for the tax year. Because turnover and expenses come from GST101 returns, enterprises, even though they are running a business in a tax year, have unknown turnover and expenses if they:  are a member of a GST filing group, where a representative of the group files GST returns for all members, or  are totally non-compliant in all their GST filing obligations in the tax year. Some enterprises do not have GST turnover if their business is purely about exempt supplies and does not charge GST. 8 ‘Active’ here means active in business, rather than active status of the enterprise. 9 In this report, ‘turnover’ means GST turnover. 10 For details, see GST Guide – IR375 at http://www.ird.govt.nz/resources/d/a/dab382004bbe58fa80efd0bc87554a30/ir375.pdf

Scope and detailed design
=========================

The Transformation’s scope was delivered using a product-based strategy requiring business functions, processes and technology to be safely transitioned, product by product, to the new application platform (START).

In preparation for the major START releases we were required to complete a product strategy and a roadmap for each of the products being transitioned into START. Product strategies provide a view of the vision and desired outcomes for that product, for example student loans or payday filing, while the product roadmap captures the delivery of new, continuing and emerging requirements including policy and delivering legislation.

The product strategy was viewed alongside:

*   Business profiles, to provide a view of the current state.
*   The business solution blueprints (see high level design), to provide a view of the future state.
*   Cost to benefit analysis, providing a Must do/Should do/Could do view of scope.

Collectively these documents helped us decide our baseline scope.

Definition design

The design phase for each Release was split into 2:

1.  High-level design.
2.  Detailed design.

High-level design is the start point. Through each subsequent part of the process, each design was validated and updated until we had developed a detailed design for that release of work.

[High-level design in Enterprise architecture](/about-us/business-transformation/delivering-our-transformation/getting-going/enterprise-architecture)

Product designs

Product designs (target business profiles) were developed at each release, to provide a point-in-time release specific view of the current state.

The design captured the current issues and business pain points and identified opportunities we could bring into our future design.

Product designs are used to develop the solution designs or Business Function Definitions (BFDs).

Business function definitions

Business Function Definitions are detailed release specific solution requirements mapped to level 3 processes and contain:

*   Business rules
*   Coexistence approach
*   Customer impact
*   Channel impact
*   Key business process considerations
*   Organisation impact
*   Technical integration
*   Detail around how it will operate, for example who will use it, metrics and reports, content and correspondence

Completing the Business Function Definitions at each release was always a big milestone as they inform other important plans and artefacts which support delivery, such as test scenarios and change plans.

Customer and digital design

One of the most important ways we applied what we learned was through a change in approach to Customer and Digital Design (CX, DX)

*   We designed an integrated end-to-end customer and digital experience across all channels to compliment the technical implementation methodology. Inland revenue’s Channel Strategy and Customer Blueprint were key inputs.
*   We considered customers’ preferred channels and contact points. Customer research, journey maps and voice of the customer reports helped us identify preferred inbound and outbound contact points.
*   For specific processes, we tested the design through demonstrations with selected customer groups and with internal teams.

Design review workshops

Bringing the right people into the design process was a significant lesson learnt after Stage 1 of the transformation –for both customers and our front-line staff.

From release 2 to Stage 4, 60 front-line staff from across the organisation came together to help us understand if what we had designed would work for customers and our people in future and were there any gaps or things to consider.

Over a 3-day workshop, attendees participated in deep dives by product or process area, during which they received an overview of the technical designs, a walk-through of the associated business process and were given the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in START, the new platform.

These events were helpful to the programme team and very well received by attendees. It created advocates for the new system who then went back into the business, and we identified potential testers, trainers and change champions to bring into the programme at later stages of the release.

Programme change requests

Change is inevitable during the lifetime of a programme, and it is important that there is a well understood, consistent approach to recording, assessing and approving change.

We had a very robust change control process which was there to confirm that where change was required, it was agreed to by the relevant authority before it was executed.

In all cases, the impact of the change had to be considered against a baseline (what had been previously agreed), covering schedule, scope, business benefit, resource, and financial impact.

Programme change requests (PCRs) were managed by our Project Management Office using issue and project tracking software, (JIRA). The team monitored quality, ensured consistency, reported change status to governance forums, managed physical documents and ran the approvals process using an agreed delegation framework.

A Programme change request which involved a design change, required approval by the Design Authority to ensure it would still deliver the agreed design outcomes.

Proposing change

The accountability for change lay with the person who knew most about it. Throughout the change request process, the change owner was responsible for:

*   drafting the programme change request
*   co-ordinating the impact assessment (including impact on costs, benefits, and risks)
*   coordinating mandatory consultation with all relevant parties, such as Programme Leadership Team members, implementation or delivery partners, and the Finance Manager
*   liaising with the Contract Manager if any impacts on third party Statements of Work were identified
*   presenting the programme change request
*   completing any necessary activities to action the change.

What we learnt

We learnt a lot, particularly after our first release. This helped us make changes to optimise solution delivery and improve outcomes for our people and our customers. These included:

*   involving customers early in the design process
*   ensuring the design of each release set us up to deliver transformational outcomes and benefits as we’d set out in the Business Blueprints and Product Designs
*   getting the right people involved in design decision making at the right time
*   having a mechanism and process in place to capture design decisions and escalate promptly at the right time based on risk.

Second High Court decision confirms structured finance transactions as tax avoidance
====================================================================================

2009 case note - CIR considered the transactions constituted tax avoidance, High Court upheld CIR's assessments - structured finance, financial arrangements.

Case

Westpac Banking Corporation v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994

### Summary

Between 1998 and 2000 Westpac entered into a number of structured finance transactions with foreign counterparties. The Commissioner considered the transactions constituted tax avoidance, and issued amended assessments to Westpac. The High Court upheld the Commissioner's assessments.

### Impact of decision

This judgment represents a helpful example of the practical implementation of the "tandem approach" to considering avoidance which is required by _Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289, where both the specific provisions and the general anti-avoidance provisions are given equal weight.

### Facts

Between 1998 and 2002 Westpac entered into a number of structured finance transactions with foreign counterparties. The Commissioner issued amended assessments in relation to nine of the transactions, on the grounds that (a) the transactions were part of tax avoidance arrangement, and (b) Westpac was not entitled to deductions for guarantee procurement fees paid as part of the arrangement.

By order of the Court, four of the nine transactions were litigated. The remaining five are stayed until further court order.

Westpac had previously received a binding ruling in relation to a similar transaction. The Court of Appeal ruled prior to this hearing that the existence of that binding ruling was irrelevant and that Westpac was not entitled to place any reliance on it.

The Judgment is lengthy, reflecting the amount of evidence adduced. This summary does not attempt to traverse the facts in detail. The Judgment contains a useful summary of one of the transactions from paragraph \[120\].

In summary (and generally):

1.  Westpac and the counterparty's subsidiary entered into a Sale and Repurchase Agreement in respect of redeemable preference shares ("RPS") carrying a fixed dividend. That dividend was exempt income, and was also relived from foreign dividend withholding payment ("FDWP") under the conduit tax relief regime. The dividend was calculated to share the tax benefits arising from the transaction. (One of the transactions used the Foreign Tax Credit ("FTC") regime instead of the conduit regime.)
2.  Westpac agreed to pay a guarantee procurement fee ("GPF") to the subsidiary for the procurement of a guarantee from the counterparty. The guarantee was in respect of the subsidiary's obligations to repurchase the shares at the conclusion of the transaction.
3.  Westpac and the subsidiary entered into a swap, whereby Westpac paid a fixed interest rate and received a floating interest rate.
4.  Westpac funded the transaction by borrowing funds from the market.
5.  Westpac claimed deductions for the funding costs, as well as the GPF. Its costs were greater than the fixed dividend received, but as the dividend was exempt the transactions were profitable on an after-tax basis.

### Decision

The Commissioner won on all counts.

_Deductibility of the GPF_  
This issue is covered in the judgment at paragraphs \[252\] to \[315\]: the Financial Arrangement ("FA") deductibility at \[254\] to \[295\]; Gross income at \[296\] to \[315\].

His Honour agreed with the Commissioner that the GPF was paid for the service of procuring the guarantee, not for the guarantee itself. The parties had deliberately structured the arrangement in that way to avoid the possible application of withholding tax payable if it was a guarantee fee. The Court agreed that it is the legal structures implemented by the parties which are relevant at this "black letter" stage of analysis; it was not open to Westpac to argue on economic substance grounds that the fee was really paid for the guarantee itself. As it was paid for the service of procurement, in this case it did not fall within the definition of an FA.

Westpac argued the RPS were held on revenue account, and that as the guarantee was in respect of the subsidiary's repurchase obligations, the GPF was paid to preserve the value of a revenue asset, and therefore there was a nexus with gross income.

On the facts, His Honour decided that the RPS were on capital account. Further, while Westpac clearly had an intention of reselling the shares, the resale was not the purpose of acquiring them. Purpose was not necessarily synonymous with intention, and in this case the purpose was to derive the dividends. Therefore, because the shares were held on capital account and were not purchased for the purpose of resale, the guarantee was not over a revenue asset. This meant there was no nexus between the GPF and gross income.

_Tax avoidance_  
The avoidance analysis of the transactions at issue is discussed at paragraphs \[316\]-\[620\]. The recent decisions of the Supreme Court in _Ben Nevis_ and _Glenharrow Holdings Ltd V the Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2009\] 2 NZLR 359 are discussed at paragraphs \[170\]-\[201\]. The following is merely a brief summary of the key findings.

In respect of the _Ben Nevis_ and _Glenharrow_ decisions, His Honour:

1.  Agreed with the decision of Wild J in the recent BNZ structured finance decision _(BNZ Investments & Ors v_ _CIR_ HC WN CIV 2004-485-1059 15 July 2009) that the _Ben Nevis_ and _Glenharrow_ decisions render analysis of previous avoidance case law unnecessary (at paragraph \[170\]).
2.  Accepted the Commissioner's submission that the cases are not a restatement of existing law, and represent a rejection of Richardson J's juristic scheme and purpose approach in _Challenge_ (at paragraphs \[174\]-\[183\]).
3.  Disagreed with the Commissioner's submission that the avoidance provisions only bite once the Court is satisfied that the specific provisions have been complied with.
4.  Referred to the factors for consideration listed at paragraphs \[108\]-\[109\] of _Ben Nevis_ and stated at paragraphs \[193\]-\[196\]:
    1.  _Ben Nevis_ represents "a significant shift in identifying the principles to be applied when construing s BG 1, mandating a broader inquiry than was previously required".
    2.  "The previous constraints imposed by a legalistic focus, to the exclusion of economic realism, have gone".
    3.  _Ben Nevis_ prescribes "a combined form and substance test".
    4.  The ratio of _Ben Nevis_ at paragraphs \[107\] and \[108\] is "designed to prescribe the permissible scope of the substance inquiry".
5.  Noted _Glenharrow's_ emphasis that anti-avoidance provisions are concerned with the purpose of the arrangement, not the purpose of the parties. Subjective intention may be relevant to the issue of whether there was (for example) a business purpose for a scheme.

The avoidance analysis of the transactions at issue is extensive, and as much turns on the facts of each arrangement, it is not useful to reproduce that analysis in any detail here. However, a useful summary of the factors His Honour considered is at paragraph \[317\]:

*   Broadly stated, the question is whether by using all of the specific provisions - both the conduit and FTC regimes for income and the interest deductibility provisions for expenditure - Westpac crossed the line and changed the character of the transactions from lawful to unlawful. That inquiry will take into account:
    1.  The nature of the contractual relationship between Westpac and the counterparty and the legal effects of the documents;
    2.  The economic substance of the transaction (investment or loan);
    3.  The structure of the transaction and whether Westpac obtained the benefit of the specific provisions in an artificial or contrived way including but not limited to:
        1.  the existence and amount of the GPF, the circumstances in which it was agreed, and its objective value - that is, whether it was at a market or commercial rate;
        2.  the use of a pricing mechanism to fix the dividend rate and in particular whether it provided for the parties to share all of Westpac's taxation benefits - that is, both cross-border and domestic asymmetries;
        3.  the cost of funds to Westpac and the profitability of the transaction (both pre and post-tax);
        4.  the relationship between a transaction and the relevant level of Westpac's tax shelter or estimated tax ratio;
        5.  the use of currency and interest swaps (both internal and external); and
        6.  the financial consequences of the transaction.

Some key findings by His Honour were:

1.  There was a commercial purpose to the transactions (paragraph \[590\]) but the main purpose was generating deductible expenses and altering the incidence of income tax (eg paragraphs \[598\] and \[605\]).
2.  There was never any prospect of profit, and the tax benefits were significant (eg paragraphs \[586\]-\[587\]).
3.  There was no commercial justification for the GPF; its function was to generate a statutory deduction for an expense which appeared genuine but was in truth a contrivance (eg paragraphs \[593\]-\[600\]).
4.  Aspects of the structure (such as the GPF) were artificial. While taxpayers are free to structure their affairs in the most tax effective way, and to take post-tax consequences into account when deciding whether to proceed with a transaction, that is premised on the assumption that the transaction has an independently justifiable commercial rationale (paragraphs \[603\]-\[604\]). Further, this was not a case of a taxpayer choosing between "two means of carrying out an economically rational transaction, one of which would result in less tax being payable than the other" (paragraph \[617\]).

His Honour discusses the use of the specific provisions (the conduit and foreign tax credit regimes) as part of the arrangement at \[605\]-\[618\].

At \[577\]-\[582\] His Honour identifies (and rejects as irrelevant) what he describes as "tangential factors" which the Commissioner had submitted amounted to indicia of tax avoidance. These included the social cost of the transactions, the novelty of the transactions, and the use of a formula to determine pricing. His Honour accepted that circularity is relevant, but held that there was no circularity in the transactions at issue.

_Reconstruction_  
Reconstruction is discussed at paragraphs \[621\]-\[667\].

The Commissioner did not reconstruct the arrangements in this case; he merely disallowed the deductions claimed in relation to them. The Court observed at \[624\] that the Commissioner may have had grounds for disallowing an exemption \[of income\] at least for that amount of Westpac's income attributable to the GPF equivalent of the dividend rate.

Westpac's arguments, which were all rejected on the facts, were that:

1.  the Commissioner failed to identify the tax advantages accruing to the bank (\[637\]-\[641\]);
2.  incorrectly disallowed deductions for the cost of funds (\[642\]-\[648\]);
3.  failed to limit reconstruction to the extent to which the GPFs exceeded the market value (\[649\]-\[667\]).

[All Income tax dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[Income tax])

If you’re getting taxable income from more than 1 source, you may need to use a secondary tax code. This is because your extra earnings may have pushed you into a higher tax bracket.

Why there are secondary tax codes
---------------------------------

Income sources could include pay, a benefit, pension or other taxable payment such as Student Allowance, an ACC compensation payment or paid parental leave.

Using the right tax codes ensures your payer deducts tax at the right rate for your total annual income. Each 'layer' of your income is taxed at a different rate. The higher layers are taxed at a higher rate than the lower layers.     
  
[Tax rates for individuals](https://www.ird.govt.nz/income-tax/income-tax-for-individuals/tax-codes-and-tax-rates-for-individuals/tax-rates-for-individuals)
   
  
Each payer has no way of knowing the total amount of income you’ll earn in a year. Using secondary tax codes lets your payer know the right amount of tax to deduct from your secondary source of income.   
  
This helps you pay the right amount of tax, so you don’t overpay during the year or end up with a tax bill at the end of the tax year (31 March).

When to use a secondary tax code
--------------------------------

Every time you get a new source of income you must let your payer, such as an employer, know the right tax code to use for you.    
  
If you’re getting an income-tested benefit, NZ Super or Veteran’s pension, you’ll need to give MSD a tax code to use. If you're getting ACC payments, let ACC know.

Kia ora, I’m Ivy.

**Rikki**

And I’m Rikki, from Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake.

**Ivy**

Tax can be complicated, so we’re here to tell you what to do if you earn an additional source of income.

Alex appears in-front of her work desk, with a roll of blueprints in her hand.

#### Audio

**Ivy**

Meet Alex, she earns $70,000 a year as an interior designer.

#### Visual

Alex now appears in an art gallery gesturing towards the art on the walls.

#### Audio

**Rikki**

She also works at a local art gallery, earning her another $5,000 a year.

#### Visual

Ivy and Rikki appear side by side with an A-frame board between them.

The board shows Alex's total income of $75,000, the tax code 'SH'. and the secondary tax rate of 30%.

#### Audio

**Ivy**

That brings her total annual income to $75,000.

**Rikki**

For her additional income, Alex uses the secondary tax code ‘SH’.

**Ivy**

With this code, Alex’s additional income gets taxed at 30%, which is just right for her total income.

**Rikki**

If either of Alex’s incomes change, she may need to switch to a different secondary tax code.

The camera zooms into the A-frame board, displaying the different tax brackets, codes, and rates.

| Annual total income | Secondary tax code | Secondary tax rate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $15,600 or less | SB  | 10.5% |
| Between $15,601 and $53,500 | S   | 17.5% |
| Between $53,501 and $78,100 | SH  | 30% |
| Between $78,101 and $180,000 | ST  | 33% |

**Ivy**

It's key to remember, secondary tax rates are based on your total income to ensure you’re taxed correctly on every dollar.

**Rikki**

And don’t worry, using the right secondary tax code means you're not overpaying tax; it's about paying the right amount.

Section 16 - Commissioner's powers to obtain information
========================================================

2012 case note – CIR's powers to obtain information under section 16 - search and seizure, access warrant, reasonableness, remove and retain documents.

Case

Tauber & Others v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

This was an appeal of a High Court decision which dismissed a judicial review application by the appellants, challenging the issuance and execution of section 16 warrants and seeking orders for the Commissioner to not inspect and return the documents seized. The Court of Appeal upheld the High Court decision and found the Commissioner's application for the access warrants for private dwellings and removal and retention of documents lawful and reasonable.

### Impact of decision

The decision vindicates the procedures followed by the Commissioner's access and removal teams and shows they were methodical, justifiable and not unreasonable.

The decision also confirms the precedent set by the _Avowal_ litigation:

*   the statutory form of warrant is sufficient;
*   the Commissioner need not exhaust alternative investigatory powers before relying on section 16 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA");
*   other persons may accompany the officer executing the warrants so long as their presence is necessary for the effective exercise of the search and inspection powers.

### Facts

This is an appeal of the High Court decision of Venning J in favour of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") dismissing the appellant's judicial review application.

As part of her investigation into Messrs Tauber and Webb as well as associated entities, the Commissioner applied to the District Court for warrants pursuant to sections 16(4) and 16C(2) of the TAA. Warrants were issued to enter four private dwellings alongside eight warrants issued to remove and retain documents accessed from the private dwellings and four businesses under section 16. This included the registered address (as well as the home address) of Ms Bockett, the accountant of the Honk Entities.

On 16 March 2011, the Commissioner executed the warrants. A total of eight sites were accessed: six in Auckland and two in Hamilton.

A total of 111 boxes of hard copy books and documents were removed, along with approximately 9.5 terabytes of electronic media from the Auckland sites. Late on 16 March 2011, a blanket privilege claim was made over all hard copy and electronic information removed.

On 8 April 2011, the applicants filed their judicial review application challenging the lawfulness and reasonableness of the access and removal operations for the six Auckland sites.

Following the hearing in the High Court, the appellants failed to make out any grounds for review. They have appealed aspects of that decision.

### Decision

All challenges to the warrants failed. The appeal was dismissed and the Commissioner was awarded one set of costs from all the appellants.

**_Appropriateness of judicial review_**

The Court found that the facts fell into the recognised exception in the case of _Gill v Attorney-General_ \[2010\] NZCA 468, \[2011\] 1 NZLR 433 and therefore judicial review was appropriate. _Gill_ states that a judicial review of a search warrant is generally not appropriate because the most suitable remedy for any errors in the process is the exclusion of wrongly seized evidence. However, because the nature and the scope of these warrants impacted directly both on the powers of the Commissioner and whether these powers have been lawfully exercised, the review was appropriate.

**_Consideration of the unredacted affidavit_**

In the High Court, the case had proceeded on the basis that access to the unredacted affidavit was not required. Venning J reserved his position on this point and indicated that he would call for an unredacted copy if required. In the Court of Appeal, the Judges questioned whether it would be possible to review the decision of the District Court without seeing all material provided to them. A copy of the unredacted application was given to them.

The Judges reviewed the application to ensure that no material had been unduly redacted. While a few small portions were questionably masked, they did not consider that material relevant to the issues on appeal. They were satisfied that it was proper for them to have access to, and review, the full unredacted application.

**_Was the Commissioner's reliance on section 16 powers reasonable?_**

This issue focused on whether the warrants were required for the Commissioner to exercise her functions. The Court agreed with Baragwanath J in _Avowal Administrative Attorneys Lt v District Court at North Shore_ \[2010\] 2 NZLR 794 and found the following:

1.  A warrant issued under section 16(4) is not a warrant to search the premises for particular information or documents but rather gives access to enter a private dwelling. The Commissioner's power to inspect documents on these premises then comes from part of the broader statutory power, section 16(1).
2.  Section 21 of the Bill of Rights Act 1990 (the freedom from unreasonable search and seizure) requires that section 16(4) is to be read subject to an overall test of reasonableness in all the circumstances.
3.  Whether or not other options have been pursued is one of the factors to be taken into account when determining whether a warrant should be issued. However, there should be no absolute requirement that the Commissioner should exhaust all options before seeking a warrant.
4.  The Commissioner's power under section 16C to seize and retain documents for inspection is more intrusive than taking copies under section 16B. Therefore, the judicial officer considering the warrant application must be satisfied in all the circumstances that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the Commissioner may require removing documents to exercise her functions.

**_Alleged errors and omissions in affidavit_**

The Court agreed with the High Court judge. The errors or failing contained in the affidavit were primarily in relation to emphasis and in the context of a lengthy affidavit, they were not material. Even if restricted to considering the redacted affidavit, none of the challenges would succeed.

**_The form of the warrants_**

The appellant contended that the warrants did not meet the requirements of section 16(5)(b). Section 16(5)(b) requires that the warrant issued specify a class of persons who may have physical access to a private dwelling under a warrant issued under s 16(4). The Court stated that a class of every officer authorised by the Commissioner met this requirement.

Counsel for the appellants argued that the warrants were drawn too widely and did not have as much specificity as the circumstances allowed. The Court upheld _Avowal_; because these warrants were issued under the statutory scheme of a civil tax-recovery scheme they were not analogous to search warrants under the criminal law or other legislation. The Commissioner's powers under section 16 are necessarily broad given the complexity that is often inherent in tax investigations. Therefore, the warrants were not expressed too broadly.

**_Were the warrants reasonably required?_**

The Court gave separate consideration to the applications for the access warrants to the private homes of Messrs Tauber and Webb, as opposed to that of Ms Bockett out of deference to her status as a professional.

The access warrants for the private dwellings of Messrs Tauber and Webb, as well as the related removal and retention warrants, were lawful and reasonable. The affidavit demonstrated that it was reasonable in all circumstances of the case for the Commissioner to seek the access warrants on the basis that the warrants were reasonably required. It was not necessary for the Commissioner to demonstrate that all other options available to her under the TAA had been exhausted.

The Court was satisfied by a narrow margin that the affidavit filed in support of the warrants for the private dwelling of Ms Bockett demonstrated that it was reasonable in all the circumstances of the case for the Commissioner to seek the warrants. Particular emphasis was placed on evidence pointing towards a pattern of action on behalf of Honk Entities and others that obstructed the Commissioner's investigation. This included a failure by Honk Entities, which Ms Bockett was agent of, to comply with section 17 requests.

Had the Court found that the warrants in respect of Ms Bockett's residence were unlawful it would have been necessary to consider the question of remedy. The Judges determined that even if they had determined that the warrants were unlawful, the breach could only have been classified as slight and therefore no relief would have been granted.

Section 17 notice served upon a liquidator
==========================================

2006 case note – CIR may employ section 17 notices during the liquidation of a company even when a creditor of the company – audit.

Case

Re: Next Generation Investments Ltd (in liq) v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (Judicial Review)

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994; Companies Act 1993

### Summary

The Commissioner may employ section 17 notices during the liquidation of a company even though he is a creditor of the company. Section 17 prevails over section 256 Companies Act 1993 ("CA"). A as long as the Commissioner's status as a creditor is merely incidental to the subject matter of the notice.

### Facts

The applicants are the liquidators of Next Generation Investments Limited ("NGI"). The Commissioner filed a proof of debt in the liquidation for $415,866.77 but was of the view that NGI's GST liability required further investigation. NGI was notified of a forthcoming GST audit about a week before the shareholders appointed a liquidator.

As part of the audit, the Commissioner issued a section 17 Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") notice. The liquidators declined to comply stating they were prevented by section 256 CA which requires a creditor to seek court orders before inspecting the records of a company in liquidation. The liquidators believed that they were prohibited from allowing such records to be released by the earlier decision of the High Court in re Tasman Pacific Airlines of NZ Ltd \[2002\] 1 NZLR 688.

### Decision

His Honour Priestley J discussed the broad ambit of section 17 as approved by the Privy Council in The Commissioner of Inland Revenue v New Zealand Stock Exchange; The Commissioner of Inland Revenue v The National Bank of New Zealand Ltd \[1990\] 3 NZLR 333, 337 where it rejected a submission designed to limit section 17 to situations where the Commissioner had a serious question in mind as to a specified taxpayer's tax liability.

The recent decisions of the High Court in Vinelight Nominees Ltd v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (2005) 22 NZTC 19,298 and Chesterfield Preschools Ltd and Others v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (2005) 22 NZTC 19, 500 were also discussed as relevant to the present matter. In the former, the applicants sought to limit the operation of section 17 where court proceedings were commenced on the grounds that it gave the Crown, as a litigant an advantage. In the latter case, a similar argument was deployed regarding the use of section 17 notices which the Commissioner issued in support of an application for a Mareva injunction. In both cases, the use of section 17 notices was supported by the Court.

Regarding the Chesterfield decision, Priestley J said:

> \[17\] If Fogarty J's dicta were to be advanced in support of a proposition that section 17 is tantamount to a procedural nuclear weapon which can be deployed by the Commissioner in an unfettered way on a civil litigation battlefield, then I disagree. The power to issue a section 17 notice is a conferred statutory power. As such it is clearly reviewable under the Judicature Amendment Act 1972. The TAA has specific purposes. The Commissioner has defined statutory duties including the duty to protect the integrity of the tax system (section 6). An ultra vires or improper use of section 17 which might, as Simon France J has observed, be discernible on a case by case analysis, to gain an otherwise unachievable advantage in a civil proceeding might well be amenable to judicial review."

There are then, certain limits to the operation of section 17 but His Honour declined to specify what they might be other than hinting at illegality or impropriety.

Regarding the operation of section 256 CA, His Honour accepted both parties' proposition that the purpose of the section is to ensure that no creditor obtains company information to the detriment of other creditors. In the Tasman Pacific case, as a matter of statutory interpretation Laurenson J held that section 256 was dominant, with the result that the inspection right contained in section 131 of the Insolvency Act 1967 was not incorporated into the CA by section 302(1).

He accepted however, that although the Commissioner is a creditor, his status as a creditor of the company is purely incidental. He seeks to inspect the company's accounts and records, not as a creditor, but for the legitimate purpose of advancing an investigation. That purpose is clearly permitted under section 17 of the TAA.

> "\[26\] I am satisfied that the Commissioner is legitimately invoking section 17 for the purpose of investigating a company's taxation liability. Significantly, the Commissioner signalled a GST audit just over a week before the company appointed a liquidator."

The applicants submitted that nonetheless, the CA is binding on the Crown and that for whatsoever purpose, the Commissioner must apply to the court first. This would allow the court to both oversee the liquidation and check on any potential abuse of section 17. His Honour declined to place such an obstacle before the Commissioner:

> "\[35\] However, the obligations which flow from a valid section 17 notice such as that issued by the Commissioner on 3 June 2005 cannot, in my judgment, be avoided merely because the Commissioner is a creditor to whom section 256(1)(a) applies.  
>   
> \[36\] In cases where the Commissioner is arguably invoking his section 17 power unreasonably or for questionable or improper reasons, then the appropriate redress is to seek judicial review. This is not such a case.  
>   
> \[37\] The Commissioner, pursuant to his statutory duties, is endeavouring to ascertain the company's correct taxation liability. To that end he is entitled to use section 17.  
>   
> \[38\] In my judgment, the fact that the Commissioner might be a creditor in a company's liquidation, who would otherwise have to obtain permission to inspect materials in possession of the liquidator under section 256(1)(a)(ii), does not make obtaining such an order a condition precedent to complying with section 17 of the TAA."

Accordingly, the Court declined the liquidator's application.

Section CB 6 - date of acquisition of land and intention
========================================================

2016 case note – TRA found land acquired on date of settlement and disputant did not have an intention to dispose of the land on that date – s CB 6.

Case

TRA 003/15 \[2016\] NZTRA 07

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 2007

### Summary

This is a decision of the Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") finding that, for the purposes of s CB 6 of the Income Tax 2007 ("Act"), a land is acquired earlier than the date of registration. In this case the TRA found that the land at issue was acquired on the date of settlement and the disputant did not have an intention to dispose of the land on that date. 

### Impact

The TRA decision means that in terms of purchases of land before the introduction of s CB 15B of the Act (before 22 November 2013), the date of acquisition occurs earlier than the date of registration and determination of the acquisition date will depend on the facts of the case.

### Facts

The disputant, who built up a successful business engaged in a property related activity, entered into a sale and purchase agreement in September 1996 for the purchase of a semi-rural property ("the Property") for $490,000.

The transaction was settled on 29 November 1996 and the transfer was registered on 14 March 1997.

In 1995 and 1996, there was publicity in the local newspapers relating to council proposals in the area. Under a draft plan released in 1996, the Property was identified for medium density residential development.

The disputant sold the Property in 2012 for $3,300,000.

#### Commissioner's position

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner') contended that it is the registration of an instrument under the Land Transfer Act 1952 ("the LTA") that is the event which creates or transfers a legal interest in land. On this basis, an assumption that land is acquired when an equitable interest is acquired cannot be applied in the context of s CB6 of Act.

#### Disputant's position

The disputant's position was that the LTA was not authority for the date land is acquired for taxation purposes and that current case law showed an equitable interest in land can exist without the interest being registered on the title (the introduction of s CB15 has clarified the acquisition date of land for the purposes of s CB6, however, this provision only applies to purchases after 22 November 2013).

### Decision

**_Issue 1: Acquisition of property for purposes of s CB 6 of the Act_**   

Judge Sinclair considered that for the purposes of s CB 6(1) of the Act, the date of acquisition is to be established at an earlier stage than the date of registration. She noted that depending on the facts, this date could arguably be when the taxpayer obtains an estate or interest under the particular agreement for sale and purchase (_Bevin v Smith_ \[1994\] 3 NZLR 648 (CA)) or when the agreement becomes unconditional (_Beetham v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[1973\] 1 NZLR 575 (HC)).

Judge Sinclair also considered the definition of "land" and considered that the definition includes both equitable and legal interests and that the word "land" in s CB 6 of the Act encompasses the acquisition of either a legal or an equitable interest in land.

Based on the evidence, she concluded that the earliest date she could be satisfied of the disputant's involvement as purchaser of the Property was the date of settlement. Therefore, for the purposes of s CB 6(1) of the Act, the date of acquisition of the Property by the disputant was 29 November 1996.

Because of her factual findings (mentioned below), Judge Sinclair did not consider it necessary to determine the earliest date when acquisition could have occurred.

**_Issue 2: Purpose or intention of disposal for purposes of s CB 6 of the Act_**

Judge Sinclair found the disputant to be a credible witness. Her Honour accepted the disputant's evidence that she had no expectation of a sale at the time the sale and purchase agreement was signed.

Judge Sinclair, having considered the totality of the circumstances, concluded that for the purposes of s CB 6 of the Act the disputant had the intention of making the Property her home at the date of the acquisition. 

The Commissioner submitted that even if it was found that the disputant did intend to live in the Property, the disputant also had the intention to develop or dispose of the Property at some future time (when the zoning changed). The Commissioner referred to an Inland Revenue file note of August 1997 which stated that the disputant intended to develop the Property into 30 sections.

Judge Sinclair noted that there is no evidence of any plan for a subdivision or that such a development was contemplated. Her Honour, having found that the disputant decided not to move in to the Property before she made her Goods and Services Tax claim in May 1997, noted that the statements made in the file note relate to events after the disputant had decided not to live in the Property.

Under cross examination, the disputant stated that "ultimately years down the track" she would sell the Property. Judge Sinclair considered this to be simply a reflection of the disputant's general position with regard to property ownership

In relation to the totality of the circumstances, Judge Sinclair made the following findings:

1.  The nature, quality and location of the Property were consistent with the disputant's stated intention to purchase the Property as her home.
2.  The disputant's prior activities and experience do not extend to direct knowledge and involvement in property development so that no inference can be drawn that this was her intention at the date of acquisition of the Property.
3.  There was no evidence of any pattern of purchasing land to be held for development long term. 
4.  There was no contemporaneous evidence that at the time of the acquisition the disputant purchased the land deliberately to sit on it waiting a zoning change.
5.  Despite the disputant's knowledge of the property market and its potential value, it could not  be inferred that the disputant had the purpose or intention when she purchased the Property to hold it pending a zoning change and then dispose of it (either developed or undeveloped).

Judge Sinclair concluded the disputant had discharged the onus of proving she did not have the intention or purpose at the time of acquisition to subdivide and sell the property and therefore the amount received from the the sale of the Property was not assessable income under s CB 6 of the Act.

Security for costs ordered
==========================

2010 case note - High Court upheld the CIR's application on the basis that the plaintiff was impecunious and that the CIR had a strong case - stay of proceedings.

Case

DT United Kingdom Ltd V CIR

Legislative References

High Court Rules, Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The High Court upheld the Commissioner's security for costs application on the basis that the plaintiff was impecunious and that the Commissioner had a strong case.

### Impact of decision

This decision confirms the position in _Reefdale Investments Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2004) 17 PRNZ 229, that the Commissioner can make an application for security for costs in respect of a tax challenge. As this decision is purely a procedural matter it will have no direct tax implications.

### Facts

This case relates to an application by the Commissioner for security for costs and for a stay under rule 5.45 of the High Court Rules.

Digi-Tech (Communications) Ltd ("Digi-Tech") owned intellectual property rights in three products - Freerider, Terminal Adapter and DFS DBUSS.

Digi-Tech sold its intellectual property rights in these products to a number of subsidiaries, including DT United Kingdom Ltd ("DT UK"). DT UK bought the intellectual property rights for $395.1 million by way of paper transaction.

On 25 January 2002, DT UK sold the intellectual property rights to Fifth Investments Ltd, a related company, for $8.1 million by way of a loan from DT UK to Fifth Investments Ltd.

Digi-Tech reported the sale of the intellectual property rights as a capital receipt and therefore not taxable. DT UK bought the intellectual property rights with a purpose to resale, therefore reported the purchase price as expenditure on the revenue account.

The Commissioner sought valuation advice and found that the value of the intellectual property rights was realistically only in the order of $500,000 rather than $395 million. Accordingly, the Commissioner took the position that this transaction amounted to tax avoidance under section BG 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 and made an adjustment and issued shortfall penalties. The assessments made by the Commissioner are the subject of challenge in these proceedings.

The Commissioner was concerned about the likely impecuniosity of the taxpayer as DT UK had filed nil returns for the 2005 and 2006 income tax years, except for claiming a loss of $389-odd million. Further it did not file tax returns for the March 2007, March 2008 and March 2009 income years and it is not presently trading. DT UK had already properly conceded the point that it would be unable to pay the Commissioner's costs if it was unsuccessful with its tax challenge. Notwithstanding that concession, DT UK opposed the Commissioner's application for security for costs and a stay on the grounds that it had a strong case and in the interest of justice.

### Decision

The Court held that "there is no dispute that the threshold has been established ... there is good reason to believe that the plaintiff is unable to pay the defendants costs if the plaintiff is unsuccessful in its challenge".

The plaintiff had conceded the point in his affidavit "... that due to its financial position it is unable to pay costs if it is unsuccessful in this proceedings".

The Court, looking at the merits of the case, noted at paragraphs \[21\] and \[31\] that in considering the issues of the substantive proceedings, the Commissioner had a "stronger" and a "better hand". However, the Court also noted that even though the plaintiff's case was weak, it was not frivolous or vexatious and the plaintiff did have an arguable case.

The Court referred to the Court of Appeal case of _McLachlin v MEL Network Ltd_ (2002) 16 PRNZ 747 and _Reefdale_ as part of the balancing exercise for the use of its discretion and held applying the usual principals that "... there is no reason why the Commissioner should be subject to this proceeding continuing without being protected as to costs".

General observations were also made in regards to section BG 1:

1.  At present, the tide is running strongly in favour of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue in tax avoidance litigation. The tax team in the Crown Law Office has had such success in its tax avoidance cases as to have a significant effect on the Government's financial position.

The Court held that appropriate security would be $90,000 payable in two tranches. The proceedings are stayed pending payment of security by the plaintiff.

The process used was a self- assessment to the Business Case and the Business Blueprints that were formed to deliver on the business case objectives. This document is the basis for the final Gateway review of the BT Programme, completed in April 2022. The final Gateway review is a Gate 0, a strategic assessment focused on the achievement of the investment objectives and outcomes set out in the Business Case. The intent of transformation was to deliver a modern, digital revenue system that made tax and payments simpler and more certain for customers. This has been achieved. The capabilities delivered as part of the transformation programme are reducing effort for customers, enabling them to do far more for themselves, and providing them with certainty sooner. They are enabling other organisations who play key roles in the revenue system to better serve their clients. And new capabilities are enabling Inland Revenue itself to work far more efficiently and effectively. A comprehensive programme of policy changes has been implemented. This has provided the foundation for some fundamental and far-reaching changes such as the introduction of automatic issuing of end-of -year income tax assessments for individuals. As each release went live, policy changes were introduced to help simplify things for customers and improve the administration of products. Vastly improved online services make it easy for customers to see and track their tax and social policy affairs. All their information is in one place in their myIR account, which is robust, reliable, and available when they need to use it. Most individuals and families now only need to check the information we hold about them. Routine transactions such as these have been automated and moved online, which is freeing us up to help support customers with more complex circumstances. The information we hold is more accurate and near real time and we are better able to analyse and act on it. We can now respond far more quickly to help customers pay and receive the right amounts. C hecks now happen at the time of a transaction, so errors are picked up at the earliest possible opportunity. For example, a round 150,000 applications for either the small business cashflow (loan) scheme (SBLS) or resurgence support payment (RSP), implemented in response to COVID-19, were stopped by up front checks. A further 168,000 applications for the RSP were referred to our experts to review. Prior to transformation, it would simply not have been possible for us to check this volume of applications and make payments to customers quickly. A high trust model no longer has to mean high risk. For the first time, we have a single, end-to-end view of our customers. All transactions across all products are held in our new system START 1 . Not only does this make it much easier to support customers; it also makes it much easier for new products to be added as the full customer base is already there in one place. Common processes that all products rely on such as registration, payments, and myIR access are already in place. This means that new products can be added at considerably lower cost and effort. This was evidenced by what we were able to achieve with the COVID-19 response initiatives, both in terms of the speed at which we were able to stand up new products, but also our ability to assess risk on a customer-by -customer basis. 1 START stands for simplified tax and revenue technology and is the name we have chosen for the GenTax software provided by FAST Enterprises LLC 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] We have significantly expanded and improved our digital channels. In turn this has enabled a far wider range of organisations to participate in the revenue system. We now partner with a much wider variety of organisations and make more of the information we hold readily available to them, with appropriate security permissions. We are increasingly partnering with others to deliver services to New Zealanders. F or example, working with the software industry to enable businesses to use their own systems to meet their obligations. Decision-makers have significantly more agility to make changes to policy and legislative settings. Common rules and established design patterns mean that new products or services can be implemented much more quickly. Products such as the SBLS and the RSP were available to customers within weeks, with funds in their account within days of their application. These timeframes were simply unthinkable prior to transformation. We are now able to work at a pace which was not previously possible. The way Inland Revenue itself works has changed significantly. A new organisation design centred around customers and their needs, n ew intelligence and knowledge management tools which enable us to harness the power of the information we hold, and a new enterprise support services platform enabling our people to self-serve are helping us to work more efficiently and effectively. Management layers have been streamlined to support the move to broad-based roles, with leaders focusing on managing people rather than managing work or tasks. Devolved decision making is empowering our customer-facing staff to resolve more issues for customers at first contact. The amount of revenue we collected grew by 50% for the year ended 30 June 2021 compared to the year ended 30 June 2016, the last full year before transformation began. Over the same period, the number of our full-time equivalents reduced by 28%. We have completely simplified our technology landscape with the majority of our services now supplied and supported by trusted partners and vendors. We now have a significantly smaller technology team focused on managing the vendors and service levels. The buy rather than build approach is now well ingrained. The investment made in transformation has created the capabilities that are enabling us to operate successfully in the digital age. There are opportunities to further build on what has been achieved, particularly for some of the internal systems and processes our people use. We have plans in place to continue the work to fully embed and leverage the capabilities that have been delivered. 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] What business transformation set out to achieve In November 2015, the government agreed to invest in transformation to reduce customer effort and cost, improve compliance levels, make policy changes faster and more cost effectively, improve systems resilience, and make Inland Revenue more efficient. Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme involved a combination of changes to policy, process, technology, and people capabilities. It has been far more than an upgrade of technology and has changed every aspect of the way Inland Revenue operates: • Simplifying policy and legislative settings. • Making more intelligent use of information to proactively ensure customers get it right from the start. • Fitting revenue processes seamlessly into people’s lives. • Creating an organisation that works together and with partners better, and empowers its people to improve outcomes for customers. • Implementing a modern technology platform (START) that is digitally based and highly automated. Transformation provided the opportunity to fundamentally review how the revenue system is administered to make tax and payments simpler and more certain for customers. The intent was to deliver a modern, digital revenue system that enabled customers to do as much for themselves as possible in a way and at a time that suited them. The intended outcomes of transformation are shown in the fi gure below. Figure : Outcomes of transformation The programme had 6 investment objectives: • Improving agility so that policy changes can be made in a timely and cost-effective manner. • Minimising the risk of protracted system outages and intermittent systems failure. • Improving the customer experience by making it easier and simpler for our taxation and social policy customers, with a particular focus on enhanced digital provision of services. 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] • Delivering new and more effective services to improve customer compliance and help support the outcomes of social policies. • Increasing the secure sharing of intelligence and information to improve delivery of services to New Zealanders and improve public sector performance. • Improving productivity and reducing the cost of providing Inland Revenue’s services. Implementation of customer-facing changes is now complete, with six releases across four stages implemented successfully on time and under budget. The modern, digital, revenue system envisaged by transformation is now in place. The programme will close by 30 June 2022, once final decommissioning is complete. 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] What transformation has delivered In just over 5 years, Inland Revenue has successfully transformed the revenue system. From 2017 to 2021, six releases across four stages progressively moved products to new systems and processes and significantly improved the services available to customers. The first customer-facing changes were implemented in February 2017 and the final changes in October 2021.The starting point was GST, as it was a simple, stand-alone tax, to prove the approach. We learned and adapted as we went through each release, which made the final release run exceptionally smoothly, despite including child support. During the programme a significant amount of data was migrated, including 29 million customer accounts, 77 million returns and 470 million transactions. A touch under 270,000 tests were completed and 747 hours were spent moving information and data from the old to the new system. We directly contacted customers and tax intermediaries more than 5 million times, some more than once, and ran around 600 in-p erson seminars and 70 online webinars to ensure that customers and those that represent them knew what to expect and when. We ran almost 1,200 classroom training sessions for our people , with many, many more held online once COVID-19 arrived, to ensure they were ready to support customers. The programme has been delivered on time, under budget and has achieved the intended outcomes 2 . We achieved this while continuing to deliver services to New Zealanders, navigating earthquakes and building closures, and supporting the government to respond to a global pandemic. We have reflected on the factors that made it possible to successfully implement a multi- year, multi-st age, highly complex programme. These include: • Invest in the right capability. We recruited an experienced team with a track record in delivering transformational change. • Choose the right partners. Having the right partners is critical and we developed very strong partnerships with our delivery partners and made our core technology decisions early. • Lead from the top. Transformation can’t be an add on to a busy day job. • Develop a clear vision and roadmap. The programme roadmap set out the overall phasing and strong programme disciplines ensured we remained on schedule. We managed scope tightly by strongly rel ying on out-of -the-box processes to avoid unnecessary configuration or customisation. • Establish strong and effective governance. This was instrumental in establishing the disciplines needed for successful delivery and was supported by a robust approach to risk management and active financial management practices. • Build and maintain stakeholder and customer support. Actively engaging with customers and stakeholders helped us to put customer needs at the centre of our thinking. • Take your people on the journey. From early on, we were open with our people about what the changes would mean, including being a smaller organisation at the end. A significant investment in capability development readied our people for their next opportunity, whether that was with Inland Revenue or not. The programme will close by 30 June 2022 as planned, having delivered what it set out to achieve. 2 The March 2022 Cabinet paper titled Inland Revenue’s Final transformation update and the Final Programme Business Case Addendum describe and confirm the outcomes that have been achieved and confirm the funding to be handed back to the Crown. 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Assessing what transformation has delivered Inland Revenue has regularly and transparently reported its progress throughout the transformation programme. Reporting has been comprehensive, ranging from detailed tracking of delivery progress each fortnight, through to reporting every 6 months to Cabinet. Now that the programme is nearing its end, Inland Revenue has conducted self-assessments at different levels of detail to determine whether the intended outcomes have been achieved. All conclude that the outcomes of transformation have been achieved. The assessments completed are complementary, as shown in the table below. Table: Self-assessments completed by Inland Revenue Focus of assessment Description Documentation Outcomes Assessment of the outcomes achieved through new capabilities Final Cabinet paper Final addendum Capabilities Assessment of the capabilities enabled by functional changes Self-Assessment to BT Business Case (this document) People, process, policy and platform changes Assessment of the functional changes delivered Detailed assessments There are undoubtedly opportunities to continue the work begun in the programme to ensure that Inland Revenue makes the most of the new capabilities delivered to further improve outcomes for New Zealanders. 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Approach to this assessment In 2014/15, business solution blueprints were developed that outlined how Inland Revenue would move from its current ways of working to future ways of working. The blueprints described how Inland Revenue would need to operate in the future to ensure it could continue to meet the needs of New Zealanders. Blueprints were developed for seven areas: • Core tax and social policy • Customer experience • Intelligence led • Technology change and Technology enterprise integration • Organisation design • Policy • Enterprise support services. In late 2021/early 2022, following the final release in the transformation programme, Inland Revenue completed a self-assessment of the progress made in delivering the capabilities described in the blueprints. This built on an earlier self-assessment conducted in July 2020. The self-assessments confirm that the changes delivered by transformation have provided Inland Revenue with the capabilities required to administer a modern, digital revenue system. As the programme progressed, in some areas the intent of the blueprints was superseded by developments, such as the evolution of technology, and/or events such as earthquakes and pandemics. In some cases the blueprints were augmented with more detailed scoping documents including solution blueprints that further translated the intent of the high-level design into more practical solutions. And as we have progressed through transformation we have made design decisions to deliver on the outcomes that are more relevant and have taken advantage of our commercial-off -the-shelf (COTS) products and emerging technology offerings. 9 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Core tax and social policy The changes made to our core tax and social policy systems and processes were intended to make tax and social policy as easy and as self-manageable as possible. We aimed to reduce uncertainty, reduce the effort required to comply, and reduce complexity for all participants in the revenue system. This would be achieved by: • Using common services and business rules. • Removing mundane, routine work enabling our people to focus on higher-value interactions with customers. • Improving the accuracy and timeliness of the information we hold. • Capturing information correctly the first time. • Responding earlier and more effectively to customers’ events and circumstances. • Enabling greater use of customers’ natural systems. Assessment The examples provided in the table below are illustrative of the outcomes that have been achieved and support the assessment rating, rather than an exhaustive list of all the changes introduced. Capability Assessment Commentary Common services and business rules Achieved There are established design patterns within START, our new core system. This validates our decision to select a commercial-off -the-shelf (COTS) solution and is providing greater agility. Now that core patterns are established, it is quicker and easier to add new products as the change is more incremental. This approach enabled us to quickly support the Government’s response to COVID-19. It also results in fewer post go-live issues once existing design patterns are adhered to. For example, the Resurgence Support Payment (RSP) shares a common design with the small business cashflow (loan) scheme (SBLS). The RSP was announced by the Minister of Finance on 15 December 2020 and went live for the first time on 23 February 2021. It would not have been possible to meet these timeframes prior to transformation. Focus on higher value interactions Achieved High-volume, simple transactions have moved online as intended and changes in customer behaviour are freeing us up to provide more personal support to customers who have complex needs. Processing times are much faster, with many transactions processed straight through. This provides customers with certainty sooner. For example, for the year ending 30 June 2021, 95% of KiwiSaver members’ contributions were transferred to their scheme providers within two days. Previously it took an average of 20 to 23 working days. This means members funds are invested more quickly. Around 93% of GST returns are processed straight through, ensuring customers get valid refunds quickly. Through their myIR account customers can file returns, make payments, advise us of changes in their circumstances, and apply for support. As at 31 December 2021, 99% of returns were filed digitally. 10 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Capability Assessment Commentary Customers who can are using self-service options. For example, customers can set up instalment arrangements themselves online. From 1 July to 31 December 2021, 44% of instalment arrangements were set up automatically through myIR. Previously, customers would have had to contact us to set this up. We know that customers who set up their own arrangements are more likely to stick to them and pay the amount they owe. Improved accuracy and timeliness of information Achieved New reporting requirements for employment and investment income information were introduced progressively from 1 April 2018 to 1 April 2020. The year ended 31 March 2021 was the first full year we received employment income information every payday and more detailed investment income information more regularly. This is helping to ensure customers increasingly pay and receive the right amounts during the year. For individuals, end-of-year refunds and bills to pay have reduced as intended in the 3 years since they have been automatically assessed as shown in the graphs below. Since the year ending 31 March 20219, we have been automatically issuing individual customers with their end-of-year income tax assessment. Th is w as the most significant change to the tax system in almost 20 years for individual customers. We now pre-populate information in customers’ myIR accounts and calculate the refund or tax to pay for them. Customers only need to let us know if this information is incorrect or incomplete and refunds are automatically paid into customers’ bank accounts. Since automatic assessments were introduced, we have paid around $1.8 billion directly into people’s bank accounts. Prior to transformation, customers had to work out for themselves whether they were due to receive a refund and then apply for it. Some used intermediaries to do this for them, who then charged a percentage of the refund as their fee. Social policy customers are also benefitting from the significant improvements we have made in receiving and processing information in a timely way. \[Information redacted\] Information captured correctly Substantially achieved New systems and processes are reducing errors. Higher levels of automation and rules built into systems mean straight forward transactions are processed with no human intervention. For example, around 93% of GST returns are processed straight through. We have also enabled a wider range of partners to access and update the data we hold to ensure it is correct. For example, the IRD number validation service is being used by banks, KiwiSaver providers, tax agents and payroll providers to ensure that their 11 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Capability Assessment Commentary clients are correctly identified thus improving data quality and reducing error rates. The introduction of payday filing has had an impact on the time small-to-medium sized businesses spend on their compliance obligations. There is an opportunity to reinforce the wider benefits of payday filing. Data quality has improved considerably through transformation as data has been checked and updated prior to each release. It will require on an on-going focus to ensure quality is maintained. We are continuing to implement our data and information governance programme. Two immediate areas of focus are improving how we record and report collection and sharing of data, and building the capabilities of our people. Earlier and more effective responses to customer events and circumstances Achieved We are now better able to target activity. We can proactively notify customers about upcoming events. For example, before the 2021 end-of-year square up for Working for Families customers we contacted all families new to the scheme to let them know what to expect. Using analytics we identified disaster support workers whose unplanned income, as a result of the Whakaari/White Island eruption, could have led to a loss of support or benefits. We intervened to stop this happening. We proactively notify customers about their obligations. Since August 2021, we have been s ending information to customers (or their agent) within a month of a property sale reminding them that if the sale is subject to income tax due to the bright-line rule, then any profits must be declared in their income tax return when it becomes due. Voluntary disclosures have increased as a result. Greater use of customers’ natural systems Achieved Businesses are able to meet their obligations through their natural business systems. They can file through software and easily provide Inland Revenue with information at the time they’re carrying out a normal business process. For example, reporting employment income information when they do their payroll. As at 31 December 2021, just over 210,000 small to medium sized businesses and tax agents were using business accounting or payroll software to manage their GST obligations. Conclusion Our core technology and processes are now flexible and agile, cheaper for the government to run, and support simplicity, efficiency and predictability for customers. 12 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Customer experience We set out to make tax and social policy as painless and manageable as possible, by reducing effort and maximising certainty for customers when dealing with us. This would be achieved by: • Basing services around customers’ circumstances and life-events. • Removing manual work and focusing on higher-value tasks facilitating compliance. • Expanding and improving our channels to enable customers to self-manage. • Improving our ability to communicate with and educate customers. • Developing a customer-centric workforce. • Leveraging our partner network to embed interactions at natural points for customers. Assessment The examples provided in the table below are illustrative of the outcomes that have been achieved and support the assessment rating, rather than an exhaustive list of all the changes introduced. Capability Assessment Commentary Basing services around customers’ needs Achieved All customer information is now held in one place, providing a full view of customers’ circumstances. This is enabling us to help ensure customers pay and receive the right amounts during the year. For example, to help ensure people receive the payments they are entitled to, each week we identify between 50 and 100 customers who should be receiving Working for Families tax credits that aren’t and get in touch with them. This was not possible before transformation. Customer-centric design practices have been used extensively when designing our digital self-service channels. This has allowed us to better understand customers’ circumstances and needs and design our services to meet these. This design ethos has also been applied in building services that support customers in their natural systems, where co-design has allowed us to optimise the data exchange through application programming interfaces (APIs) connecting us to software providers. Focus on higher value interactions to facilitate compliance Achieved We are now able to work more efficiently and effectively when transactions are identified that do require a closer look. Automated rules enable the right checks and balances to be put in place upfront so things that need to be looked at get stopped and those that don’t get processed more quickly, providing certainty to customers sooner. \[Information redacted\] Expand and improve channels Achieved Use of digital channels has increased massively, while equivalent ‘analogue’ options have declined. For example, the number of myIR sessions has nearly tripled from around 17 million for the year ending 30 June 2016, the year immediately before transformation began, to more than 50 million for the year ending 30 June 2021. Customers access our services from the platform of their choice, be it a busy parent checking their working 13 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Capability Assessment Commentary for families tax credits from a mobile device, or an accountant seamlessly filing returns through their accounting software integrated with our application programme interfaces (APIs). A huge amount of the growth in myIR sessions, nearly 20 million sessions each year, are the result of customers accessing myIR from a mobile device. This was not possible before transformation. A suite of new gateway services was made available in April 2021. They provide improved support and are enabling external partners to securely query and update the data we hold about customers in real-time from their systems. These APIs are heavily used by tax agents and software providers. The improvement in the accuracy and timeliness of this data benefits Inland Revenue, its partners, and the other government agencies with whom we share data. This shift in interaction patterns fundamentally changes the way customers and those who interact with them communicate and transact with us and re-shapes their experience of us as a service organisation. Greater ability to communicate with and educate customers Achieved Multiple new platforms and channels have been implemented as part of the programme and are supporting communication to and education of customers. Our public website, www.ird.govt.nz, has been completely rebuilt and all content rewritten to make it easier for customers to search, access and understand. This has helped customers to better manage their tax affairs and entitlements. The analytical capabilities in START and the data and intelligence platform enable us to better target our messaging and activity to customer need. We have also introduced web and text messaging, along with broader notifications in myIR. The introduction of automatic end-of-year income tax assessments for individual customers has educated them about the need to ensure their tax rates are correct, in particular the prescribed investor rate applied to some investment income, and that all their income is reported to us. Notwithstanding the huge success that the revamped myIR has been, there are opportunities to improve how information is presented and how we describe things to make it simple for customers to understand what they need to do. For example, we refer to processing dates whereas customers are interested in payment dates. Further enhancements to myIR to reduce confusion could further reduce customer contacts. The upgrade to online services as part of the October 2021 release has fix ed some, but not all, usability issues. The one area that will require on-going work is customer notifications. Notifications c ould benefit from a focus on simplifying legislation and operational risk tolerances being reviewed. Developing a customer centric workforce Achieved New organisation groups were established in February 2018 to enable a stronger focus on meeting customers’ needs - two Customer & Compliance Services groups, one focused on individuals, families and micro- businesses and one on small, medium and significant enterprises. All our people are now on broad, capability-based roles enabling them to provide a wider range of services to customers. Management layers have been streamlined 14 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Capability Assessment Commentary to support the move to broad-based roles, with leaders focusing on managing people rather than managing work or tasks. Devolved decision making is empowering our customer-facing staff to resolve more issues for customers at first contact. In addition, now that all the products we administer are in one place, our people have been provided with the opportunity to cross-skill in areas such as voice and families to resolve a wider range of issues for customers. Our ability to re-prioritise work and re-direct people to support customers with COVID-19 products is evidence of our ability to easily and quickly move resources to the areas of greatest customer need. Leveraging our partner network Achieved Through transformation, the role of third parties in the revenue system has been significantly expanded. Services are increasingly being delivered in partnership with other organisations in both the public and private sectors. Use of software platforms by customers has increased, in particular the big accounting and business management platforms, the banks and payroll providers (employers and payroll intermediaries). Previously our digital channels were not available to many software platforms so most customers used a combination of myIR, phone and paper. During transformation we were able to set standards and parameters for third parties to meet. We now need to maintain strong standards and a clear view about what we want to achieve as the eco-system expands further to ensure we retain agility. The recently released Issues Paper addresses this issue. To continue to be successful in the future, we will need on-going capability to respond to emerging demand and to continue enabling partners. It is also important we recognise that product and service evolution now requires complex change management across multiple parties with long lead times. Conclusion Customer experiences have significantly improved as a result of transformation. Digital services put customers in control, enabling them to do as much for themselves as possible in a way and at a time that suits them. We have organised ourselves around customer segments and enabled a far wider range of intermediaries and organisations to better manage their clients’ affairs. 15 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Intelligence led The intent of our intelligence-led work is to ensure we apply insights at the right time when making decisions. We aimed to significantly improve the way we collect, store and analyse data and information and make it readily available when it is needed to our people. This would be achieved by: • Incorporating a wider range of data from business partners and third parties. • Providing actionable insights to support right-time decision-making by people and systems. • Providing a single, richer view of our customers and their behaviours. • Significantly improving the way knowledge is collaboratively created, shared and reused. Assessment The examples provided in the table below are illustrative of the outcomes that have been achieved and support the assessment rating, rather than an exhaustive list of all the changes introduced. Capability Assessment Commentary Incorporating a wider range of data Achieved We receive more frequent and more detailed income information which is resulting in more accurate assessments for customers. We can now pre-populate the data we hold about customers and associate different sources of income with a customer. For example, investment income information is now pre- populated in customers’ myIR accounts enabling them to ensure they are on the correct prescribed investor rate (PIR). Prior to transformation, it was not possible to do this and, as a result, approximately 1.5 million people were on an incorrect PIR. If they were paying too much tax as a result, they could not get this refunded. \[Information redacted\] We now have more confidence in sharing the data we hold with others. Having more up-to-date employment income information has enabled us to effectively support the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) in delivering the COVID-19 wage subsidy scheme. Information about self-employed individuals, employers and employees was shared with MSD which enabled many applications to be automatically approved. Many however needed further clarification and initially a direct 0800 number was established for MSD staff to call us. A portal has been in place since 11 June 2020 and allows approved MSD people to access the information they need to verify applications directly, reducing the number of calls and the manual work, and ensuring applications are processed efficiently. Providing actionable insights to support decision making Achieved The analytical capabilities in both the data and intelligence platform and START, our new core platform, are making it easier for customers to comply and harder not to. A significant amount of non- compliant activity can now be stopped at the earliest possible stage. For example, in the first week of April 2021, 68% of customers filing their IR3s who received a wage subsidy as part of the COVID-19 response were either 16 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Capability Assessment Commentary not including it or including an incorrect amount. Within a week, we p re-populated this information for customers. Figures as at the end of July 2021, show that around 75% of customers were then getting it right. Around 4,000 returns were stopped by Integrity Manager. If nothing had been done, this figure would have been significantly higher and customers trying to finalise their returns would have experienced considerable delays. This shows how quickly we can now react to what customers are doing and make changes to help them get things right and provide them with certainty sooner. Compliance is increasingly occurring at the time of a transaction. For example, checks are built into application processes for COVID-19 products. A single view of customers Achieved All customer information is now held in START, providing a full view of customers’ circumstances. Text analytics mean we can automatically analyse customer notes in START each day to see what people are calling us about and why. Previously, team leads would call one another daily to discuss call trends. myIR provides full visibility to customers of the status of their applications. For example, customers are able to apply for and track the progress of their paid parental leave application, view next payment details, and view and maintain their personal details. Customers and their employers no longer have to provide an income estimate, as we pre-populate customers’ income for them as part of the application process. Previously, everything was paper based. Significantly improved knowledge management Achieved The way we store and access information has been completely over-hauled through transformation. Stax is our enterprise records management system and is where we store finalised business information. Security permissions ensure sensitive information is locked down and that documents are held, accessed, and shared appropriately. Our new intranet, called Haukāinga, an intelligent, context-based search is in place. This enables our people to quickly search for and find the information they need to do their jobs. Te Mātāwai is the primary source for our knowledge content. It includes instructions, guidance and experience for tax and social policy products and Inland Revenue processes. A new and improved tax technical website for tax professionals has been very well received. The site makes rulings, determinations, interpretation statements and other tax technical documents readily accessible and easily searchable. Conclusion The quality and frequency of the data we collect has improved and a significant investment has been made in analytics. The focus is now on real time integrity, providing opportunities to intervene earlier when customers get it wrong, either accidentally or deliberately. This 17 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] reduces the need for post-return work, whether that is debt collection or audit and investigation. 18 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Technology change and Technology enterprise integration We set out to improve the quality, agility, availability and predictability of our systems and services to reduce the risk of failure. This would be achieved by: • Using proven, commercial-off -the-shelf (COTS) applications to support a highly digital and responsive revenue system. • Implementing an up to date, scalable and redundant technology infrastructure. • Rationalising and consolidating applications and decommissioning systems no longer needed. • Ensuring FIRST (our old system) could co-exist with START (our new system) until the completion of the programme. Assessment The examples provided in the table below are illustrative of the outcomes that have been achieved and support the assessment rating, rather than an exhaustive list of all the changes introduced. Capability Assessment Commentary Proven COTS applications Achieved All the products we administer are now running on START – the name we have chosen for the COTS package supplied by FAST. The decision to go with a COTS application for our core processing system has proven to be a key one. In October 2021, as part of the final release we upgraded to the latest version of FAST’s software, which included a significant upgrade to online services. In our old environment, if we had had to build these improvements ourselves, the cost would have been considerably higher and it would have taken considerably longer. GenTax was a fit-for -purpose revenue package that was fundamental to us achieving the outcomes we committed to deliver in return for the government’s investment. In addition to START, and in line with the all-of- government strategy of moving to digital first and cloud-based solutions, we have adopted a number of other COTS applications: • Sitecore – manages the content of all our public facing websites, as well as our internal intranet. • Microsoft 365 – the platform on which all our staff operate. This enabled us to roll out laptops and tablets to all our people which allowed us to react to and operate seamlessly during the recent COVID-19 disruptions. It also ensures all information created by any staff member is stored securely centrally, thus reducing the risk of data loss. • Oracle cloud applications – a fully cloud based ‘as- a- Service’ solution supporting all our finance and human resources functions, which we have named Ātea. • Oracle web centre content – supports our knowledge and document management platform, which we have named S tax. • ServiceNow – Supporting our IR wide Service Desk. 19 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Capability Assessment Commentary • SAS – a managed suite of products making up our data and i ntelligence platform (DIP). • Microsoft Sentinel – an information security repository allowing us to manage any information security risks or incidents. • One Identity Manager – a cloud-based service that enables identity governance and administration including privileged access management. • Atlassian (Jira, Confluence) – a suite of products supporting project delivery and risk and issue management. Systems are configured to our requirements with minimal customisation. Our focus is now on buy rather than build and we have significantly simplified our technology landscape. As a result, we have considerably reduced the number of people required to support our technology environment. The changes made to our technology team are significant and reflect changes to the mix of skills, capabilities and resources now required. Overall, around 90 people remain in the team, compared to approximately 330 prior to transformation. Up to date, scalable and redundant technology infrastructure Achieved Our infrastructure continues to perform very well as evidenced by its stability in coping with a significant increase in volumes. The third round of automatic income tax assessments in 2021 saw our systems handle substantially higher loads than in 2020. Our systems would simply not have been able to cope with the volumes we experienced as recently as 2-3 years ago. We consistently exceeded our system availability targets during 2020/21. The number of critical priority (P1) incidents we are experiencing has declined, with few if any affecting customer-facing services. We have moved to a new workplace environment, where everyone is mobile-enabled. This is enabling us to respond quickly and smoothly to disruptions, such as COVID-19 and building closures. The evergreen nature of the services and products that we now use to deliver our services, including our technology infrastructure, means these are all delivered as-a-service and kept up to date by our trusted partners and vendors. As a result, our services and products will always be up to date. Three disaster recovery exercises have been successfully run, with the most recent in November 2020. Our new workplace tools have enabled us to continue to deliver services for customers through several significant disruptions in recent years. These include earthquakes, building closures due to seismic issues, and the COVID-19 pandemic. It was not possible for us to operate remotely effectively prior to transformation, as our experience following the Kaikoura earthquake in late 2016 showed. At that time, it quickly became clear that we were grossly under-prepared for an event that meant we did not have physical access to our buildings. Very few of our people had laptops and we did not have the network or security infrastructure to enable the few who did to work remotely effectively. As a result of that experience and the realisation we could not afford for this to happen again, work was accelerated to ensure 20 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Capability Assessment Commentary that as many of our people as possible could work remotely easily and effectively if the need arose again. Rationalising, consolidating and decommissioning old applications and systems In progress and forecast to be achieved As at January 2022, we had decommissioned approximately 81% of our heritage systems, and removed about 30% of the infrastructure components from our heritage data centres. There is no direct correlation between applications and infrastructure, as much of the infrastructure supports multiple applications. Our heritage core processing system, FIRST, was decommissioned on 1 December 2021. Our high-level timetable is : • From 1 December 2021 until early April 2022, we will shut down old heritage systems, archive any data that is to be retained, and then remove the systems and databases. • In April 2022, once all the systems have been removed, the network connections and supporting services will be shut down, and the process of dismantling and disposing of the infrastructure will begin. • We remain on track to exit our heritage \[Information redacted\] data centres by 30 June 2022. Co-existence Achieved Co-existence, running old and new systems in parallel, was among the most complex challenges we faced and was the biggest risk we faced at the beginning of the programme. In an innovative approach, we p artnered with Accenture to access a global network of the critical coding resources required to make changes to heritage systems. To extract processing from heritage systems, a ‘co- existence solution’ was designed, built and tested ahead of Stage 1. This solution was then adjusted for every release as one by one products and the mastering of data were migrated to our new system. The co-existence solution was an undoubted success as all our systems kept running through multiple releases. In addition, the approach we took minimised the impacts of co-existence on customers and stakeholders as much as possible. Conclusion Our technology is reliable, robust and available when customers need to use it and can now be re-configured quickly and easily to accommodate changes. Our systems are no longer the constraint when making changes, provided requirements are simple and clear, established design patterns are adopted, and data sources are well understood. 21 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Organisation design Our aim through transformation was to become a proactive, customer-centric organisation, putting our customers and their compliance at the centre of everything we do. We recognised the need to work in different ways both within Inland Revenue and with our partners so we can more effectively serve New Zealanders. This would be achieved by: • Adopting a customer-centric organisation model. • Harnessing the power of all the information we hold. • Working in multiple ways, including with our partners. • Having greater innovation and change capability. • Having effective partnerships and alliances across Government and the private sector. • Having a more diverse knowledge based workforce. Assessment The examples provided in the table below are illustrative of the outcomes that have been achieved and support the assessment rating, rather than an exhaustive list of all the changes introduced. Capability Assessment Commentary A customer-centric organisation model Achieved Our organisation design has fundamentally changed to support the move to a customer-centric, intelligence- led, agile, and inclusive organisation. The first of our new organisation groups were established in February 2018 to enable a stronger focus on meeting customers’ needs - two Customer & Compliance Services groups, one focused on individuals, families and micro-businesses (CCS-I) and one on small, medium and significant enterprises (CCS- B). The Information & Intelligence Services (IIS) group was established at the same time to help keep the customer at the heart of everything we do. Organisation design changes were progressively introduced in the following years to reshape our functions. As part of the re-design, management layers have been streamlined to support the move to broad-based roles, with leaders focusing on managing people rather than managing work or tasks. With the establishment of CCS-I and CCS-B we adopted a new model for delegations, empowering our customer-facing staff to resolve more issues for customers at first contact. Harnessing the power of our information Achieved The intelligence-led programme brought together our data, analytics, information and knowledge streams, helping us to make timely decisions and reach the right outcomes for customers. The Intelligence Centre houses a collection of insights developed from ours and others analytical efforts. It houses documents, presentations, reports, and dashboards produced by Inland Revenue and others, organised by topic for ease of locating, and automatically delivered to people who subscribe to updated content. It enables our people to have easy and timely access to insights about key areas of our 22 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Capability Assessment Commentary business, whether they are using Inland Revenue- managed computers, mobile devices, or their own devices. Haukāinga has been a game changer. The intelligent search function links our people to all the tools and information they need to support customers, including, Corporate information, Te Mātāwai, our external website and Guided Help. Working in new ways Achieved Working as part of a networked team is now standard practice across Inland Revenue. This was amply demonstrated by the way we responded to COVID-19. Implementing new products such as the small business loan scheme and the resurgence support payment in the timeframes required meant that multi-disciplinary teams had to come together from the outset and work with a high degree of collaboration. Teams were brought together remotely from across our different business groups in different parts of the country, and from other government agencies when required. Tools and technology enabled all the necessary expertise to be brought together to design and implement a new product from end-to-end at pace. Networked teams also focus on improving how we run the day-to-day business. For example, a networked team from CCS-I and IIS analyse customer contacts to inform the automatic income tax assessments process every year. The issuing of automatic income tax assessments is still a relatively new process, having run for the first time for the year ending 31 March 2019. Improvements are made each year, for example issuing assessments more quickly. W e are continuing to focus on how we can make this process run as smoothly as possible, including how we communicate with customers. This is reducing the time customers have to wait to hear the outcome of their assessment and is significantly reducing contacts. Greater innovation and change capability Achieved Our response to COVID-19 is the clearest proof of our ability to innovate and deliver change. In early 2020, we implemented a number of new products and services in a matter of weeks. A t the same time we were supporting customers, delivering Release 4 of our transformation, organising our people to work from home and preparing for the automatic income tax assessment process. It simply would not have been possible to do this prior to transformation. We have established a new Planning Design and Delivery function (PDD) within CCS-B to provide an enduring home for the capability to manage change and effective end-to-end planning as the transformation programme comes to an end. Many of those appointed to roles in PDD have significant previous experience working in the programme. Effective partnerships and alliances Achieved Our new systems and processes have assisted other agencies to support the government's response to COVID-19. • Using our analytics capabilities we quickly and easily checked for any compliance issues with wage subsidy applications, developing a total risk score to support MSD in administering the subsidy. • PAYE data is shared with other government agencies such as the Treasury and MSD to better understand the country’s economic position during 23 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Capability Assessment Commentary the various COVID response levels. As PAYE is some of the fastest data to market, it means Government can respond quickly to what the data shows. In 2017 after our first release, we recognised the need to build our external relationship management skills to reflect the impact of digital change on our customers and delivery partners. As a result, we have strengthened our relationships with many external organisations, recognising their needs and ways of working in our design, notably accounting and payroll software providers. While this has been fully delivered, as other agencies transform, it is likely we will need to make changes to our systems. Some of these relationships are highly complex and we may consider looking at ways to reduce this complexity where we could benefit Inland Revenue and other government agencies. More diverse, knowledge-based workforce Substantially achieved All our people are now on broad, capability-based roles that focus on outcomes, providing people with more scope to shape their development. Capability-based roles set the platform for people and their leaders to focus on a match between strengths, aspirations and business need and allow for varied and interesting work, matching business need with personal aspirations. This is enabling our people to focus on the areas of greatest need, such as supporting the response to COVID-19 for example. We have invested significantly in our people through transformation. Many have had the opportunity to develop their skills by working directly on the programme and significant training programmes have been conducted ahead of each release. On average, our front line people have had around 3 days’ of mandatory training for each release, equating to 18 days of training overall per person. Roles are focused on transferable skills such as customer service or digital literacy, as well as new capabilities such as data analytics. This is enabling people to build their capabilities as work changes. COVID-19 has had an impact in this area. Some of the change activity we had planned was deferred to enable our people to focus on supporting customers and to enable us to support the Government’s response. Some of the work we had planned to do to further embed the new ways of working will now continue on beyond the end of the programme. Given the impact of COVID-19, we ran out of headroom with our people to complete this earlier. We will continue to focus on up-skilling our people and supporting their development. For example, we are beginning to see our people rotating between customer segments. Conclusion We are a customer-focused organisation, better at using the information we hold to continually improve how we deliver services to customers. We are highly collaborative, both within Inland Revenue and when working with others, both in the public and private sector. Our assessment is that we have laid the foundations and are well set up to mature our approach and further drive the six shifts. 24 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Policy Changes to policy and legislative settings were required to frame and support the modernisation of the revenue system. This would be achieved by: • Supporting the use of digital technology in the provision of services and administration. • Leveraging configurable systems and design patterns to help reduce timeframes for policy changes. • Improving the accuracy, certainty and ability for customers to be compliant with minimal burden. • Providing the Commissioner with a more flexible structure to support All-of Government goals while maintaining security and privacy of customer information. Assessment The examples provided in the table below are illustrative of the outcomes that have been achieved and support the assessment rating, rather than an exhaustive list of all the changes introduced. Capability Assessment Commentary Support the use of digital technology Achieved The design of new products is digital by default, with exceptions minimised to support straight-through processing. Digital filing has been mandated for employers since 1 April 2019, with some specific exceptions. We enabled use of customers’ natural systems by setting out the employment information to be provided rather than prescribing a form and the information to be included in it. More income is withheld at source and provided digitally, which helps support compliance. Out-dated legislative references have been removed, for example ‘by post’. Leverage configurable systems and processes Achieved Our ability to respond quickly to COVID-19 is the best demonstration of what is now possible. The speed with which products introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have been implemented has been enabled by using established design patterns within START. The small business cashflow (loan) scheme (SBLS) was implemented in 39 working days from the initial decision to begin some preparatory work until the launch of the SBLS. It took just 10 days from when the Government confirmed its intentions until the SBLS was launched. The resurgence support payment was announced on 15 December 2020 and applications opened for the first time on 23 February 2021. 25 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Capability Assessment Commentary Improved accuracy and certainty for customers Achieved Changes to employment and investment income reporting are helping to ensure that customers pay and receive the right amounts during the year. For most individuals, tax is being correctly withheld and assistance provided at the time it is needed. These changes to income reporting requirements enabled more far-reaching changes to be made. • A new year-end process for individuals has been in place since the year ending 31 March 2019, meaning refunds are automatically paid to customers. • Previously, the information needed to close a student loan took time to arrive, as employer monthly schedules (replaced by payday filing in April 2019) were filed at the end of the following month. This meant the majority of loans were overpaid by the time we took any action to close them. In most cases, multiple contacts with customers were required to sort things out. This meant delays in closing the loan and refunding overpayments. Customers could wait months for overpaid amounts to be refunded to them, resulting in unnecessary frustration. Overall, each account took about 40 to 45 days to finalise and required considerable follow up with employers and customers. Now, the vast majority of loan closures are processed overnight. For example, between January and June 2021, 97% of straightforward closures were processed overnight. Several changes were made to provisional tax rules to reduce the impact on customers of getting things wrong. The accounting income method (AIM) option for provisional tax was introduced, enabling small businesses to better match their provisional tax payments to when they earn their income. AIM means businesses can pay smaller amounts of provisional tax more often and get refunds of overpaid provisional tax during the year. Until AIM, businesses paid provisional tax at set times of the year, regardless of when they earned their income. Legislative changes are enabling our analytical capabilities to help support compliance. For example, we can now let employers know when an employee’s tax code is incorrect and provide the correct code. Short process rulings were introduced on 1 October 2019 as a way for individuals and smaller businesses to apply for a binding ruling on how a tax law applies to a situation. Support all-of-Government goals Achieved We already work with many other agencies to deliver outcomes for customers. With MSD, we distribute Working for Families payments. We jointly administer student loans with the Ministries of Education and Social Development (StudyLink). We administer paid parental leave for the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. We also have a range of information-sharing arrangements in place, including with the Department of Internal Affairs, the New Zealand Police, the Ministry of Social Development and the Accident Compensation Corporation. We are committed to playing our part in realising a more joined-up and citizen-focused Public Service. 26 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Capability Assessment Commentary A good example of how much more efficiently and effectively we can work as a result of transformation is the portal we established for MSD to improve the administration of the wage subsidy scheme introduced in response to COVID-19. T o enable MSD to self-serve the majority of queries, we provided Ministry staff with read only access to the relevant information held in START. It took just 15 working days from when the portal was approved by our governance forums until it was up and running. Conclusion The government now has substantially improved agility for the products we administer. 27 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Enterprise support services Enterprise support services (ESS) are the internal processes and systems that support the day-to-day running of Inland Revenue, for example finance, procurement and human resources. The changes made through transformation were about improving our performance, adopting integrated enterprise tools and systems, and supporting our people to achieve. This would be achieved by: • Simplifying, standardising and integrating processes. • Reducing highly administrative or manual processes, extending self-service functions, and providing access to the information our people need to do their jobs. • Enabling our people to make informed and well-considered timely decisions. • Using a digital first approach and automating tasks wherever possible. Assessment The examples provided in the table below are illustrative of the outcomes that have been achieved and support the assessment rating, rather than an exhaustive list of all the changes introduced. Capability Assessment Commentary Simple, standard, integrated processes Achieved We have adopted out-of-the box processes for finance, procurement and human resources. The software, which we have named Ātea, is an integrated toolset that supports activities such as onboarding of new people, buying and paying for the things Inland Revenue needs, and managing our financial processes. By adopting an ‘off the shelf’ solution, we can take advantage of improvements as they are introduced by our supplier. Ātea and the related processes are, in the main, delivering our core system requirements and providing an appropriate control environment for transactions. The governance of processes across Inland Revenue sits in Enterprise Design and Integrity, its enduring home in our new organisation design. There are different levels of maturity, with front office processes more mature than back office processes. Overall, with regards to simplified, standardised and integrated processes we are partially standardised and still developing in this area. The majority of the work still to do is focussed on change management. Enabling self-service Partially achieved Users across Inland Revenue are not finding the system and related processes as intuitive or simple as expected. Support and training material has not consistently provided the assistance required to address this challenge. As a result, users are having trouble completing tasks. Many transactions require assistance from the core delivery teams. 28 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Capability Assessment Commentary Supporting decision-making Partially achieved We have improved our enterprise performance management framework and considerably enhanced our planning framework. A new planning process and initiative management lifecycle have been implemented and we are starting to build out supporting tools such as value and prioritisation frameworks. Enterprise planning processes and tools have been transitioned to Enterprise Design and Integrity, their enduring home in our new organisation design. There are some gaps in data and information flows between modules within Ātea and with \[INFORMATION REDACTED\], and some role and access privileges are preventing users from accessing everything they need. Some functionality was deferred from the original implementation scope. For example, the lack of insights and reporting is compounding the usability issue, resulting in the current practice of off- system workarounds within Excel/PowerBI. Increased automation Partially achieved Users across Inland Revenue are having trouble completing tasks, there is an increased risk of data and process error, and off-system workarounds are becoming increasingly abundant. Many transactions require assistance from the core delivery teams to either enable the transaction or to resolve data quality issues from user error. As a result some tasks are not yet automated. Conclusion Ātea is working, however in some areas it can be improved. An additional factor is our decision in March 2021 to move our existing payroll solution to a cloud-based solution (provided by \[INFORMATION REDACTED\]) rather than implement a completely new payroll solution. As a result, we have some rework to do and will take the opportunity to optimise how Ātea and the \[INFORMATION REDACTED\] solution work together. 29 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] Opportunities Of the 34 assessed in this review: • 28 are rated as Achieved • 2 are rated as Substantially Achieved • 3 are rated as Partially Achieved ( all in enterprise support services) • 1 is rated as In progress and forecast to be achieved. This section looks at the work planned to address the 3 capabilities rated as Partially achieved. Enterp rise support services - enabling self-service, s upporting decision-making and increasing automation In August 2021, our Strategic Governance Board approved a programme of work to optimise Ātea. The focus of this work is on improving user experiences, reducing manual effort, and improving the quality of information to deliver improved insights and better decision-making. A large part of this work is as a result of making the decision to move our payroll solution into the cloud rather than procure new. We implemented an Oracle cloud solution for our enterprise support services (i.e. human resources, procurement and finance). Moving our payroll to the cloud has required us to address the Oracle design and while we are doing this, we will also optimise Ātea in areas that we now see can be better.

Mahi ā-kiri, kaimahi rānei Self-employed or employee
====================================================

There is no single test to decide if you're employed or self-employed.

The working conditions in your contract or agreed verbally will determine your status. You or your employer describing your job as “employment” or “self-employment” will not decide your status.

Self-employed guidelines
------------------------

You're likely self-employed if you answer “yes” to most of these questions:

*   Do you provide the major assets or working equipment needed for your job?
*   Do you provide or pay for your own training?
*   Do you decide or control how you work?

For example:

*   when you take holidays
*   when, where and what hours you work
*   the standard or quality of work
*   how much you get paid and how.

Do you invest or risk your own money in the activity? For example:

*   Could you sell the business?
*   Do you support the business with your own money?
*   Are you responsible for losses or your own bad management?
*   Are you responsible for management and investment decisions?

Are you responsible for getting the work done?

*   Can you get other people to work with you or for you, without needing to get permission from anyone else?
*   Do you pay these people from your own money?
*   Can you do work for other people?
*   Do you advertise to get yourself more work?
*   Do you get someone else to do the job if you cannot?
*   Does your contract say you’ll be penalised if you stop work, or leave without finishing a project?
*   Do you have to fix work that isn’t as good as it should be, in your own time and at your own expense?

Employee guidelines
-------------------

You're probably an employee if you answer “yes” to most of these questions:

*   Do you have to do the work yourself, instead of hiring someone to do it for you?
*   Can someone tell you what to do on the job, or when or how to do your work?
*   Are you paid at a set rate?
*   Can you get overtime pay or penal rates?
*   Do you work set hours, or a given number of hours each week or month?
*   Does someone else decide the amount and quality of the sales or output you need to achieve?
*   Do you work at the premises of the person you are working for or somewhere that person decides?
*   Are other people who do the same sort of job as you treated as employees?
*   Are you under an employment contract or any law that says how your relationship with your “employer” should be run?
*   Are you prevented from doing work for anyone else?
*   Does the person you work for set the rules or procedures you must follow?

If you answered “yes” to most or all these questions, but you are not treated as an employee with PAYE deducted from your pay, you will need to contact us.

Casual, short-term, temporary or part-time work
-----------------------------------------------

If you have more than one part-time job, or work for several different people, you need to go through these questions for each job.

You can be employed and self-employed at the same time. For example, you could be employed as a part-time shop assistant and run a business from your home.

Tax for self-employed people
----------------------------

If you are self-employed, you are responsible for your own tax. This means that you must:

*   tell us that you are in business
*   complete an individual tax return (IR3) each year
*   budget to make regular payments of provisional tax and end-of-year income tax
*   register for GST if your turnover was over $60,000 in the last 12 months or will be over $60,000 in the next 12 months.

If you meet the tests for being self-employed, tax may still have to be deducted from payments you receive.

Ngā kaikirimana kainoho tākuhu Self-employed resident contractors
=================================================================

Self-employed resident contractors including resident entertainers
------------------------------------------------------------------

All payments (excluding GST) made to you as a contractor make up your gross (total before tax) income. This includes payments received to cover work-related expenses (allowable deductions). You should receive an annual summary of earnings from us showing your gross earnings and tax on schedular payments.

Does tax have to be deducted from the schedular payments
--------------------------------------------------------

Yes, unless one of the following applies:

*   you have an exemption certificate
*   you have a 0% special tax rate certificate
*   the payments are made to your company and they're not payments being made under certain labour hire arrangements.

[Schedular payments](/income-tax/withholding-taxes/schedular-payments)

Filing a tax return
-------------------

You need to file an annual income tax return detailing your gross (before tax) income, the tax already deducted from that income and any allowable deductions for expenses. This enables you to work out the total tax on your taxable income and will determine how much tax you need to pay or be refunded, if any.

If you are providing services as a company, you'll need to file an Income tax return companies (IR4) or if you are providing services as an individual, you'll need to file an Individual tax return (IR3) income tax return.

Deductions from your gross income
---------------------------------

There are a variety of allowable deductions for work-related expenses you can make from your gross income when completing your tax return. You must keep invoices and receipts as evidence to support all expenses claimed.

[Self-employed](/roles/self-employed)

Paying provisional tax as well as tax on schedular payments
-----------------------------------------------------------

If you owed more than $5,000 in tax at the end of the last tax year or you expect to owe more than $5,000 at the end of this tax year, you may need to pay provisional tax.

Please note that having an exemption from tax deductions does not remove any responsibility you may have to pay provisional tax.

[Provisional tax](/income-tax/provisional-tax)

Registering for goods and services tax (GST)
--------------------------------------------

If your gross (total before tax) income, including per diems and allowances, was more than $60,000 over the last 12 months or is likely to be more than $60,000 over the next 12 months, you must register for GST.

[All Income tax dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[Income tax])

When you sell your shares in a look-through company (LTC) you're an “exiting owner”. You're treated as disposing of your share of the look-through company's property. You have to pay any tax associated with this sale.

When you have to pay tax
------------------------

Exiting owners only need to declare and pay tax on the sale of look-through company shares if the income is over certain amounts - "thresholds". These thresholds do not apply when the look-through company status is revoked or if the company is liquidated.

### $50,000 threshold

You must declare and pay tax on the sale of shares if you're paid more than $50,000, minus liabilities, above the total net book value of your share of the look-through company's property. If you've sold any look-through company shares in the past 12 months these amounts will also be counted.

If your income from these sales is higher than the $50,000 threshold, the entire amount is treated as your taxable income.

### If your income from look-through company share sales is less than $50,000

The entering owner (whoever buys the shares from you) is treated as getting their [interests](/api/glossary/item?id={7FADE619-56C8-4CB6-927E-9D73E9450919})
 in the look-through company's underlying property for the same cost as you originally got them. 

### If your income from look-through company share sales is $50,000 or more

The entering owner is treated as getting their [interests](/api/glossary/item?id={7FADE619-56C8-4CB6-927E-9D73E9450919})
 in the look-through company's underlying property for the amount they paid for the shares.

What to do in specific situations
---------------------------------

### Trading stock threshold

If the look-through company's total yearly turnover is $3 million or less in the year that shares are sold, exiting owners do not have to make a revenue accounting adjustment for trading stock.

### Accounting for depreciation

Exiting owners do not have to account for depreciation recovery or loss on their share of any [depreciable tangible asset](/api/glossary/item?id={3A2DA44C-1299-44C9-BB39-2CB0AB2B9EAA})
 if the asset's total cost was $200,000 or less when the look-through company first got it.

### Financial arrangements

Exiting owners do not need to perform a [base price adjustment](/api/glossary/item?id={D5926441-BDEF-49A1-B35B-A47A20F166C8})
 for any interest the look-through company holds in a financial arrangement if:

*   the look-through company needed to enter the arrangement as part of its business, but the arrangement is not the main part of the look-through company's business
*   you are not in the business of holding financial arrangements.

### Short term sale and purchase agreements

Exiting owners do not need to declare or pay tax on [look-through interests](/api/glossary/item?id={7FADE619-56C8-4CB6-927E-9D73E9450919})
 that included a short term agreement for sale and purchase - this is excluded income.

### If the look-through company property includes female breeding livestock

If the livestock is valued using the national standard cost scheme or cost price method, the entering owner may be treated as if they had originally purchased and held the livestock.

How to sort out income and losses after a change in shareholding
----------------------------------------------------------------

As a look-through company owner, you're treated as holding the company's property and assets directly in proportion to your effective look-through interest. If the look-through company's shareholding changes during the year, you must work out your share of income and losses.

There are 2 methods you can use:

*   the average yearly interest
*   the accounts method using the actual [look-through interest](/api/glossary/item?id={7FADE619-56C8-4CB6-927E-9D73E9450919})
    .

You can only use the actual look-through interest method if all owners agree.

### If the look-through company's assessable income is $3 million or more during a 12 month period

You may need to use the accounts method if we decide it will provide the most accurate allocation of income and losses. We’ll contact you if we decide the look-through company must use this method.

\[ IN CONFIDENCE\] Inland Revenue r eport: Transformation s tatus update: September 2021 Date: 29 September 2021 Priority: Medium Security level: In confidence Report number: IR2021/413 Action sought Action sought Deadline Minister of Finance Note the contents of this report None Minister of Revenue Note the contents of this report None Contact for telephone discussion (if required) Name Position Telephone Greg James Deputy Commissioner, Transformation Proactive release: This document has been released by Inland Revenue under section 18(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This release supports the purposes of the Official Information Act 1982 by increasing progressively the availability of official information to the people of New Zealand. Withheld under s18(c)(i) of the OIA 2 IR2021/413: Transformation status update: September 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 29 September 2021 Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue Transformation status update: September 2021 Executive summary 1. This report summarises transformation progress and highlights f or September 2021. 2. While we have mostly absorbed the impacts of the Asteron building closure and COVID- 19 alert level changes, there is still some risk to the release. We have had approval from our “Go-Live Committee” to proceed to the next checkpoint and, as such, we are still tracking towards go-live over the Labour Day weekend. Our planning assumption is that we will close to customers at 3pm on Thursday 21 October 2021 and re-open at 8am on Thursday 28 October 2021. This means that Inland Revenue will be closed for three business days. 3. There are some major customer events around the time of go-live. As we have for previous releases, we are working to ensure customers are not disadvantaged. We have shifted payment dates for Working for Families and paid parental leave so that customers receive their payments ahead of the closure. The filing and payment dates for GST and income tax are being extended from 28 October to 4 November 2021, as discussed with you by the Commissioner (IR 2021/415 refers). 4. We have evaluated contingency options should go-live be delayed for any reason. There are two final check points in the lead up to go-live. On 18 October 2021 we will seek permission to begin cutover and the go/no-go decision will be made on 27 October 2021. 5. As part of this report, we are seeking your agreement to the final monthly status update being provided to you in late February 2022/early March 2022. We propose to provide two further updates to you between March and June 2022 on the work underway to complete all deliverables, including decommissioning of heritage systems, and to close the programme. 6. This report also provides an update on our progress for the year ending 30 June 2021 with realising the benefits we committed to deliver in return for the government’s investment in transformation. 7. Transformation’s Red, Amber, Green (RAG) status remains amber overall, as shown in table 1 below. The schedule key has deteriorated to amber as we, our delivery partners and vendors continue to manage the impacts of the COVID-19 Alert Level changes. Table 1: Transformation’s RAG status 8. Table 2 on the next page shows programme expenditure to date on this page and planned expenditure on the next page. 4 IR2021/413: Transformation status update: September 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Recommendations 12. I recommend that you: a) Note the contents of this report. Noted Noted b) Agree that the final monthly status update will be provided to you in late February 2022 or early March 2022, with two further updates to be provided between March and June 2022 on work to complete and close the programme. Agreed / Not Agreed Agreed / Not Agreed c) Note that for 2020/21, Inland Revenue has achieved seven out of the ten indicators tracking achievement of the investment objectives for transformation. Noted Noted Greg James Deputy Commissioner, Transformation 29 September 2021 Hon Grant Robertson Hon David Parker Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue / /2021 / /2021 5 IR2021/413: Transformation status update: September 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Stage 4 second release 13. This final release will move Child Support to new systems and processes and upgrade the online services all customers use and the START software our people use. 14. While the closure of the Asteron Centre and the COVID-19 Alert Level 4 lockdown have been very disruptive to the release, the team have mostly absorbed the impacts without any effect on the critical path. 15. Solution design for Child Support is now complete and is under change control. Business System Testing (making sure START works as expected) is 99.5% complete and is largely in defect management mode. The team are tracking test execution, dependencies, and defects daily. Development verification testing is 99.8% complete 1 . 16. The second round of scaled business simulation (SBS) testing (testing of key end-to- end processes) has been completed, with a 98% test scenario pass rate. The third and final round of SBS testing is scheduled to begin on 27 September 2021. 17. The third and final round of mock go-live testing (a dress rehearsal for go-live) ran to schedule from 16 to 23 September 2021. We are still seeing data issues from FIRST as part of the conversion processes and continue to work to resolve them. Based on the results of the three mock go-lives, we expect the cutover to new systems and processes to take six days. Our current planning assumption is that customer-facing services and channels will shut down at 3pm on Thursday 21 October 2021 and re-open at 8am on Thursday 28 October 2021. This means Inland Revenue will be closed to customers for three business days. 18. While there is no ideal time to be closed to customers, going live over a public holiday weekend does allow us to minimise the impacts for customers and intermediaries as much as possible. There are some major customer events either side of the weekend and, as we have for previous releases, we will work to ensure that customers are not disadvantaged by our closure. • Working for Families and paid parental leave payments normally due to be paid on 26 October 2021 will be brought forward and paid on 21 October 2021. • The day we re-open, 28 October 2021, is a major filing and payment date for GST and a filing day for PAYE for most businesses. The filing date for returns and payment of income tax (including provisional tax) and GST has been extended to 4 November 2021 with your approval (IR2021/415 refers). 19. Further COVID-19 related support initiatives were not factored into our thinking at the time we chose Labour Day weekend to go live, as this was well before the current outbreak. If further rounds of support are required around the time we re-open, it could have an impact on our ability to support customers with any queries after go-live or with their applications for COVID-19 support if needed. 20. On 23 September 2021, the Portfolio Governance Committee (PGC) approved a further checkpoint in our readiness assessment framework. The checkpoint results indicate that, while there is still some risk remaining due to the COVID-19 alert level changes, the release is proceeding through its go live checkpoints. 21. The PGC agreed to delegate authority to the go-live committee for the checkpoints to be run immediately before we begin closing our customer-facing services and during the cutover to new systems and processes. The next check point will be on 18 October 2021 and will seek permission to begin cutover, followed by a checkpoint on 27 October 2021 which will be the go/no-go decision for go-live. As has been the case for previous 1 For common areas we conduct verification testing, which focuses on fields, rules, and validations. Business system testing is undertaken for complex or high-risk areas. 6 IR2021/413: Transformation status update: September 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] releases, the go-live committee is chaired by the Commissioner and includes seven Deputy Commissioners. 22. As we do before each release, we have evaluated multiple contingency options should we need to delay go-live for any reason. Readying our people 23. Our contingency plan for training has been implemented (IR2021/309 refers). The first two weeks of mandatory classroom training sessions for people who work with child support customers were delivered virtually, with positive feedback. All remaining classroom sessions will be delivered virtually. Mandatory online training for people who use START and/or support customers with myIR is also underway. Readying our customers 24. We have continued directly contacting customers to let them know what the October 2021 changes mean for them or those they represent. • On 2 September 2021, we sent information to tax agents about the changes coming to myIR for them and their clients. This is the second of four rounds of direct contact with intermediaries. • On 6 September 2021, we also sent information to businesses and employers about the changes coming to myIR. This is the first of three rounds of direct contact with these customer groups. • On 13 September 2021, we sent information to child support customers about the changes they can expect to see, including improvements to the payments process, legislation changes, and improvements to myIR. This is the first of three rounds of direct contact with child support customers. 25. Targeted digital advertising began on 6 September 2021, with examples of the visuals used for targeting our key audiences shown below. • There are approximately 5,500 intermediary organisations (including tax agents, PAYE intermediaries, payroll bureaus, and bookkeepers) with around 25,000 individual logins, representing around 2.5 million customers. • There are approximately 680,000 business customers, including 200,000 employers, 40,700 significant enterprises, and 640,000 small businesses or sole traders. 7 IR2021/413: Transformation status update: September 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] • There are approximately 320,000 child support customers, including liable parents and receiving carers. • In addition to digital advertising, we are also running “out of home” placements for child support customers, in family environments such as sports, leisure and recreation centres. This activity will cover the October 2021 school holiday period when families are more likely to visit these locations. 8 IR2021/413: Transformation status update: September 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] • There are approximately 1.5 million individuals with a myIR account. 26. A myIR login pop-up on the home page of our website will appear when customers login or hover over the login button, to explain the changes made. This functionality has not been available for previous releases. 27. We continue to update the information on our website, including directing customers and intermediaries to webinars as they are published. We will shortly publish two more webinars, one on child support and one on changes for employers and businesses. Animated videos are available on our website explaining the changes to myIR. 28. We have also included content about the changes in factsheets, our own newsletters and government newsletters and have provided content for industry groups to include in their own communications. 29. At the beginning of October 2021, we will hold an open home for other government agencies involved with child support changes. 30. Day 1 packs will be sent to intermediaries and businesses and employers on the day we re-open (Thursday 28 October 2021 is our planning assumption). These will also be available on our website. Other updates Online services performance 31. Previously we reported some concerns around our overnight batch window running late and impacting business day operations (IR2021/307 refers). A number of changes have been made that have dramatically improved performance. We are now confident that the additional processing required once child support has moved to new systems and processes can be completed overnight. Independent quality assurance 32. In June 2021, we commissioned KPMG to complete a twelfth independent quality assurance review and eleventh technical quality assurance review (IQA12/TQA11). The review focused on readiness to go-live with the October 2021 release and also considered progress in other areas including decommissioning and payroll relocation. 33. Fieldwork took place in July 2021. We have now received KPMG’s draft report. The draft report makes 27 recommendations raised across 21 review areas: • No recommendations were rated red (major risk/issue). • Thirteen recommendations were rated amber (medium risk/issue). 9 IR2021/413: Transformation status update: September 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] • Ten recommendations were rated y ellow (low risk/issue). • Four recommendations were rated green (good practice). 34. The thirteen amber recommendations relate to automated controls and role mappings (two), change management, stakeholder engagement and communications (five), testing (four), and business continuity/disaster recovery planning (two). 35. We will provide a report on the findings of the review to the Minister of Revenue, once KPMG have finalised their report. Monthly status updates 36. We have been providing monthly updates regarding the status of the transformation programme to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue since January 2014. As the programme is nearing completion, we have been considering when these updates should cease. 37. We propose to provide you with a final status update in late February or early March 2022, covering the period up until the end of February 2022. By that stage, we will have completed early life support for the final release and will be well advanced with decommissioning and programme close down activity. 38. In addition, the final progress update will have been provided to Cabinet (IR2021/309 refers.. 39. We propose to provide you with two further updates between March and June 2022, with timings to be confirmed, to provide visibility of the progress we are making with completing remaining deliverables, including decommissioning of heritage systems and processes, and activity to close down the programme. Benefit realisation 40. There are three main measures of success for transformation: • easier for customers • reduced time and cost to implement policy (policy agility), and • administrative savings to Inland Revenue. 41. For 2020/21, we achieved 7 out of 10 of the lead and lag indicators that are the agreed basis for monitoring our progress in achieving these three outcomes. These are shown on the table on the next page. 11 IR2021/413: Transformation status update: September 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 42. The indicators we achieved for the year ending 30 June 2021 are: • 98% of returns were filed electronically against a target of 75%. • Customer facing e-channels were available 99.6% of the time, above the target of 99.4%. • The value of the time saved by small-to-medium sized businesses since 2017/18 is $640 million, compared to a target of $590 million. This indicator uses the results of our 2021 study on the time and cost of doing business incurred by small businesses as one of the inputs to this calculation. We will report in full on the findings of the survey to the Minister of Revenue shortly. • The increase in assessed Crown revenue is rated as achieved based on increases in proxy measures, given the difficulty of direct attribution. Both the percentage of returns filed on time and filed electronically increased to 94% and 98% respectively. • We have rated the system resilience objective as substantially achieved, which is ahead of where we expected to be at this point in the programme. • $205 million in administrative savings have been achieved since 2017/18, compared to a target of $195 million. 43. The indicators that were not achieved for the year ending 30 June 2021 are: • 82% of customers said they find it easy to comply against a target of 88%. While most customers find it easy to comply, this measure is tracking up more slowly than expected. • The 2021 study on the time and cost of doing business incurred by small businesses indicated that businesses are spending 5 fewer hours a year (the target for 2020/21 was 15 hours) meeting their tax obligations than they were in 2013, which is the baseline. The COVID-19 pandemic has created very challenging business conditions, particularly for small-to-medium sized businesses. There is a significant amount of Government support available to businesses affected by the pandemic, but they need to apply for and demonstrate they are eligible for this support. In addition, we have been encouraging businesses to stay on top of their compliance obligations by filing on time, even if they are not in a position to pay the amounts owing. • For 2020/21, we achieved an annual savings target of $87 million against a target of $100 million, however, we are ahead of the cumulative target and the trend is positive with annual savings increasing year-on -year. Further cost savings will be realised in 2021/22 and 2022/23 following the completion of changes to our organisation design and the decommissioning of all our heritage systems and processes. Key risks and issues 44. The transformation programme’s risk profile remains amber, with a future trend of amber. An amber profile means that risks and mitigations are reasonably defined and understood, and support is needed from senior leaders to actively manage specific issues in some areas. 45. We are actively managing two issues. 46. One new issue (a risk that has been realised) was raised during the month regarding transferring historic child support suspense account balances to START. A proposed resolution will be presented to our Enterprise Priorities and Performance Committee (EPPC) at the end of September 2021. If accepted, this will close this issue. 12 IR2021/413: Transformation status update: September 2021 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 47. We continue to monitor the issue relating to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the delivery of the programme. There are no concerns to report at this time. 48. The issue raised last the month regarding the need for alternative accommodation to be found for critical resources on the programme as a result of the closure of the Asteron building has been closed. Alternative accommodation has been secured for Wellington-based staff, including programme resources. 49. As at September 2021, the programme has a total of 45 open risks 6 , of which 10 are reported to the PGC. 50. The status of one risk reported to the PGC improved during the month. The residual 7 rating of the risk relating to the potential for a delay in go-live of the October 2021 release due to the Asteron building closure improved from very high to high. This risk is now unlikely (a 3% to 10% chance) to occur as alternative accommodation has been found. 51. There has been no change in the status of any of the other risks reported to the PGC since the last report. 52. The top three risks for transformation are: • Realising the benefits we committed to deliver in the timeframes indicated; • Possible changes in payments once child support is moved to new systems and processes and; • The potential for delay of the final release as a result of the Asteron building closure. Coming up in the next two months 53. Key activities over the next two months include: October 2021 • Final checkpoints in our readiness assessment framework. • Planned go-live of child support on new systems and processes and upgrade of our online services. • Planned beginning of early life support. November 2021 • Planned continuation of early life support. 6 During September 2021, one programme risk was closed. 7 The predicted level of risk once all proposed actions have been implemented.

Ngā pitomutunga ratonga Service endpoints
=========================================

Digital service providers can connect to our gateway services through either cloud or desktop - they'll be directed to the appropriate endpoints.

Cloud-based connection endpoints
--------------------------------

A centralised cloud location can connect through mutual TLS certificates. These need to be exchanged before connection to each environment.

On the cloud endpoint we have the ability to throttle traffic from digital service providers whose heavy usage may cause issues for other digital service providers.

| Subject | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Purpose | Default endpoint to connect digital service providers to our gateway services |
| Client application type | Cloud |
| Constraints | Only for source locations with client side TLS certificates. |
| Mutual TLS | We trust the certificate the digital service provider associates with the TLS connection as the client for mutual TLS connections and use it to identify the digital service provider and the web service they are using. |
| Minimum TLS version | 1.2 |
| Port | 4046 |
| End-user authentication and authorisation | *   The Token Auth (OAuth 2.0) process is used to authenticate end-users using their myIR logon and password and grant 3rd party software consent to access their information.<br>*   Requires an online user to enter their myIR logon and password to grant the application access to their Inland Revenue information. |
| Organisational authentication and authorisation | The M2M mechanism uses a client signed JSON Web Token (JWT) to sign messages, which lets us identify the data owner (service provider or a customer of a service provider). |
| Firewalling in production | *   No IP address restrictions.<br>*   Access limited by certificate enrolment. |
| Firewalling in non-production environments | *   Endpoints are firewalled and IP address whitelisting needed.<br>*   Access limited by certificate enrolment. |

Desktop connection endpoints
----------------------------

A desktop server location must connect through one-way TLS.

No client side X509 certificates are required.

| Subject | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Purpose | Additional endpoint provided to facilitate connecting from desktops which might be:<br><br>*   high volumes of sources addresses<br>*   transient client IP addresses<br>*   not realistically associated with client side TLS certificates<br>*   not individually integrated to setup certificate trust. |
| Client application type | Desktop/native applications. For connecting from multiple decentralised clients. |
| Constraints | *   Less scalable.<br>*   Subject to tighter security controls.<br>*   Less able to be shielded from heavy usage of the service by others.<br>*   OAuth2 refresh tokens will not be offered. |
| Mutual TLS | Server side TLS only. |
| Minimum TLS version | 1.2 |
| Port | 443 (default https port) |
| End-user authentication and authorisation | *   The Token Auth (OAuth 2.0) process is used to authenticate end-users using their myIR logon and password and grant 4th party software consent to access their information.<br>*   Requires an online user to enter their myIR logon and password to grant the application access to their Inland Revenue information. |
| Firewalling in production | No IP address restrictions. |
| Firewalling in non-production environments | Firewalled - IP whitelisting needed for gateway service endpoints. |

Endpoint URLs
-------------

The endpoint URLs for the mock services (sandbox), test and production environments will be provided to digital service providers as part of the integration process.

Delegated permissions
---------------------

These services let a user retrieve only the data of customers that their credential (as represented by the OAuth token) has access to.

If an account or its data is targeted by the request parameters but the user does not have permission, an error will be returned. This access will depend on delegation permissions set up in myIR.

Timeouts
--------

Our gateway services typically have a 60 second timeout configured, although this may be adjusted after testing.

Service of Notice of Response sent to incorrect address sufficient
==================================================================

2007 case note – whether taxpayer entitled to deregister for GST purposes - Notice of Response, service, legal privilege, authorized to act for taxpayer (s 14).

Case

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue v LGH Thompson

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

This was an appeal against the decision of a Taxation Review Authority, AAP Willy, in which he held the taxpayer was entitled to deregister for GST purposes.

### Background

The High Court allowed the Commissioner's appeal in part, consistently with the Court of Appeal's decision in _Lopas v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2006) 22NZTC 19,726, holding that the taxpayer was not entitled to deregister for GST.

The Commissioner also appealed a finding of the Taxation Review Authority (TRA) that the evidence of the tax inspector was wrong, and that he knew this to be wrong at the time he gave it. On this issue, His Honour stated that he was not persuaded that the TRA was wrong. The Court, however, described the failing as an omission, which the TRA might have regarded as an unacceptable degree of carelessness. The Court also pointed out the TRA did not say the tax inspector was untruthful, and accepted the letter was posted when the inspector said it was. The Court indicated the criticism may have focused more on a degree of carelessness, which the TRA found inexcusable.

The Court also dismissed the taxpayer's cross appeal on the issue of service of the notice of response (NOR). It held (1) the NOR had been served in time, (2) the evidence of the accountant that he had taken the NOR to the taxpayer was not subject to legal professional privilege and was not therefore inadmissible, and (3) was sufficient to prove service of the NOR in time.

### Facts

The taxpayer de-registered himself for GST in November 1999, claiming that his income for the succeeding 12months would be less than $30,000. However, the Commissioner re-registered him in August 2000. The taxpayer then issued a NOPA on 9 October 2000, dealing with de-registration. The Commissioner responded by issuing a NOR on 29 November 2000, sending it not to the tax agent who had been nominated in the NOPA, but to the accountant who had served the NOPA. Upon receipt of the NOR, the accountant arranged a meeting with the taxpayer and his solicitor on 30 November 2000. At the meeting, the accountant "tabled" the NOR.

A dispute arose between the taxpayer and the Commissioner as to whether the taxpayer was entitled to de-register himself, and as to whether the NOR had been properly served. The TRA held that the taxpayer was entitled to de-register himself. The TRA also held that the NOR had been served on the taxpayer, even though the method of service did not comply with section 14 Tax Administration Act 1994. Nevertheless, that method was not fatal as section 14 TAA  was facilitative, not mandatory. The TRA also held evidence of the meeting between the taxpayer and the accountant was admissible to prove that the taxpayer did receive the NOR.

The Commissioner appealed against the TRA's decision, on both the issue of entitlement to de-registration and on the issue relating to whether the accountant was authorised to receive the NOR. However, the parties were agreed that the Commissioner‘s appeal relating to the taxpayer's entitlement to de-registration should be allowed, following the Court of Appeal's decision in _Lopas v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2006) 22 NZTC 19,726. The remaining issue thus requiring determination was that of service of the NOR.

Even though the TRA had determined that issue in the Commissioner's favour, the Commissioner appealed against certain findings of the TRA in relation to that issue. The Commissioner contended that the TRA was wrong to hold that the accountant was not an agent for the purposes of section 14 TAA, and that the TRA was wrong to hold that a tax inspector had given evidence about service he knew to be wrong.

The taxpayer cross-appealed against the TRA's decision on the same issue. He contended that (a) the NOR had not been served because compliance with section 14 TAA was mandatory and the accountant who prepared the NOPA was not his agent; (b) the evidence that he had received the NOR was not admissible because he had received it at a meeting that was the subject of legal professional privilege; and (c) that evidence was inadequate because it proved only that the NOR had been discussed at the meeting.

In response, the Commissioner contended that he had complied with section 14 TAA, because he had sent the NOR to the accountant, who was authorised to act on behalf of the taxpayer. The Commissioner also contended that the evidence from the accountant that he had taken the NOR to the meeting could not be privileged because privilege was confined to confidential communications between a solicitor and client for the purpose of giving or getting advice.

### Decision

The High Court dealt with the issues in the following way:

The NOR had been served on the taxpayer in time, even though the method of service did not comply with section 14TAA. His Honour stated that if the Commissioner did not agree with a taxpayer's NOPA, he must notify the taxpayer (section 89G TAA). Notification may be given by any of the means specified in section 14 TAA, thebeing expressed in permissive terms. The prescriptive and formal nature of the disputes procedures did not compel departure from the normal meaning of the word "may". His Honour agreed with Baragwanath J's comments in _Hieber v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2002) 20NZTC17,774, that section 14 TAA was facilitative, not mandatory. However, the Commissioner would be well advised to comply strictly with section 14 TAA when it comes to service as it is important that taxpayers know to whom notices are being sent. The Commissioner must prove that the taxpayer who issued the NOPA had received the NOR, unless he can rely on the deeming provisions of section 14 TAA relating to postal service or service on an agent.

His Honour accepted that, in the present case, the accountant was the taxpayer's agent as he had held himself out as such by serving the NOPA. However, the question posed by section 14 TAA in relation to an agent was whether the person concerned was authorised to act on behalf of the taxpayer. That was a question of fact. A taxpayer may appoint a number of agents in a tax dispute but authorise only one of them to accept service of documents. Since the taxpayer in the present case had, in his NOPA, designated another firm as his agent for service, the Commissioner could invoke the agency provisions of section 14 TAA only by serving the NOR on the designated firm. Had the NOPA been silent about service, the inference that the accountant was the taxpayer's agent for service would have been irresistible.

However, that was not the end of the matter. His Honour held that the evidence from the accountant was admissible, and sufficient, to prove that the NOR had been served in time. The NOR itself was not privileged. It was the Commissioner's document, willingly disclosed. The Commissioner had not sought to prove the contents of the NOR by calling the accountant; rather, he had sought to establish only that it had been given to the taxpayer at the meeting. His Honour stated that privilege does not extend to communications between a client and a third party, unless the third party is an agent of the client or the solicitor and the communication passes through the agent as an intermediary: _Three Rivers District Council v The Governor and Company of the Bank of England_ (No6) \[2005\] 1 AC 610, 654, para 50 (HC). A communication from an employee or an agent acting otherwise than as an intermediary for the purpose of getting legal advice will not attract legal advice privilege: _Three Rivers District Council v The Governor and Company of the Bank of England_ (No 5) \[2003\] QB 1556, 1574 (CA).

In the present case, the tabling or delivery of the NOR was a communication between the accountant and the taxpayer. The delivery provided a convenient occasion for legal advice; getting legal advice was however not the purpose of the delivery. The accountant was not engaged as an intermediary to get legal advice. Accordingly, the delivery of the NOR did not attract legal advice privilege. His Honour also stated that the NOR was not covered by litigation privilege, which applied to confidential communications between solicitor, client and third party for the dominant purpose of enabling the solicitor to advise or act in litigation. So far as the conduct of anticipated litigation was concerned, the delivery of the NOR in the present case was merely a collateral fact: _Brown v Foster_ (1987) 1 H&N 736; _Dwyer v Collins_ (1852) 7 Ex 639; _Brown v Bennett_ (No 2) \[2002\] 1WLR713, 769.

On the issue relating to the evidence of the tax inspector, His Honour stated that he was not persuaded that the TRA was wrong. The TRA"s criticism may have been focused more on the carelessness of the tax inspector, which the TRA found inexcusable.

Services for Customers
======================

The overarching purpose of this appropriation is to deliver a customer-centric, integrated tax and entitlement service experience for New Zealanders that is agile and intelligence-led.

We achieved 21 of 28 output performance measures.

Services for Customers is a multi-category appropriation with 5 categories:

*   Services to Ministers and to Inform the Public About Entitlements and Meeting Obligations
*   Services to Process Obligations and Entitlements
*   Management of Debt and Unfiled Returns
*   Investigations
*   Policy Advice

What we intend to achieve
-------------------------

This appropriation is intended to ensure customers find it easy to meet their tax and social policy obligations and receive the payments they’re entitled to. 

We start this section with our overall results for this appropriation and present the results for each of the 5 categories on the following pages:

[Services to Ministers and to inform the public about entitlements and meeting obligations](http://)

[Services to process obligations and entitlements](http://)

[Management of debt and unfiled returns](http://)

[Investigations](http://)

[Policy advice](http://)

How we performed
----------------

We carefully balanced resources across our work programme, with an increased focus on compliance activities. We prioritised activities based on factors such as addressing areas of risk and key customer issues.

Most customers want to do the right thing. This is reflected in the high proportion of customers who file returns on time, with levels increasing to 96.4% in 2023–24, and pay on time. The economic climate has meant a small decline in customers’ ability to pay in full and on time. The value of payments made on time has remained high at 94.0%.

| 2024 | 96.4% | 88.2% | 93.1% |

Performance measure results
---------------------------

This year, we achieved 1 out of 2 of the overarching performance measures in the Services for Customers multi-category appropriation.

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |Actual and target percentages of tax returns and payments made on time between 2023 and 2025

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Percentage of returns filed by customers on time | 96.2% | 95% | 96.4% (achieved) | 95% |
| Percentage of tax payments made by customers on time | 88.8% | 90% | 88.2% (not achieved) | 90% |
| Not achieved—The target for this measure was increased from 85% to 90% from July 2022 in response to an uplift in performance resulting from IR’s move to the new START system. Although we have achieved over 90% for some months during the year, our highest year-end result was 89.9% in 2020–21. Since then, economic conditions have impacted businesses and households’ cashflow and ability to pay in full and on time. On-time payment compliance declined across most tax types: GST dropped from 87.1% to 85.5%, employer activities from 92.2% to 91.8% and non-individual income tax from 86.3% to 85.8%. |     |     |     |     |

All targets are unaudited.

Setting aside a judgment
========================

2012 case note – High Court has no power to set aside its judgment on questions of law that have been the subject of appellate decision.

Case

Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Redcliffe Forestry Venture Ltd

Legislative References

High Court Rules, Tax Administration Act 1994, Income Tax Act 2004

### Summary

The High Court has no power to recall or set aside its judgment on questions of law that have been the subject of appellate decision.

### Impact of decision

The assessments confirmed by the Supreme Court in _Ben Nevis_ were not improperly obtained. Arguments based on fraud in this case are collateral attacks, which cannot be sustained.

The Court of Appeal order remitting the proceeding back to the High Court and the possible consequential strike-out application by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") was overturned. The judgment of the High Court was reinstated.

### Facts

On 19 December 2008, the Supreme Court delivered judgment in an appeal by investors and loss-attributing qualifying companies over their participation in a forestry development project known as the Trinity scheme (_Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2008\] NZSC 115). The Supreme Court's judgment upheld the assessments made by the Commissioner that the Trinity scheme was a tax avoidance arrangement.

On 15 September 2009, Redcliffe Forestry Venture Ltd and six other Trinity investors, along with Garry Muir, a director of Redcliffe and the architect of the Trinity scheme (together "Redcliffe"), brought proceedings against the Commissioner.

Redcliffe sought orders setting aside the judgment of the High Court, delivered by Venning J in 2004, on the ground that the Commissioner had obtained that judgment by knowingly presenting a "false case" in the High Court.

Redcliffe alleged that the Commissioner had deliberately refrained from putting material facts and law before the High Court so as to secure a judgment the Commissioner knew would not have been available if there had been full and frank disclosure of the legal position.

The specific allegation was that the Commissioner knowingly and wrongly applied a depreciation allowance to expenditure incurred by the Trinity investors under subpart EG of the Income Tax Act 2004 when subpart EH8(1) required that the expenditure be calculated under its provisions.

Under rule 5.49 of the High Court Rules, the Commissioner objected to the jurisdiction of the High Court to consider Redcliffe's application as the 2004 High Court judgment had been upheld by the Supreme Court. The Commissioner applied for orders dismissing Redcliffe's proceeding on the ground that the High Court judgment they sought to set aside is final and cannot be reopened.

The Commissioner's application was successful and Venning J dismissed Redcliffe's proceeding. Redcliffe appealed to the Court of Appeal arguing that the Commissioner should have brought the objection based on the finality of the earlier judgment by applying to strike out Redcliffe's proceeding under rule 15, not rule 5.49. Redcliffe alleged that they had been denied an opportunity to amend their pleadings, and to meet any strike-out application with affidavit evidence of the alleged fraud.

The Court of Appeal accepted these arguments, allowed the appeal, and remitted Redcliffe's case to the High Court where the Commissioner could apply under rule 15 to strike out the proceeding. The Commissioner appealed to the Supreme Court.

### Decision

#### _Whether the Commissioner's challenge to the claim was appropriately brought under rule 5.49_

Rule 5.49 allows a defendant to protest the jurisdiction of the Court to hear and determine a proceeding on the basis that the Court has no power to entertain the claim.

The Court of Appeal considered that the Commissioner confused the jurisdiction of the Court to grant relief with its jurisdiction to entertain and decide a claim for relief. Similarly Venning J had erred by confusing the High Court's power to grant relief by setting aside the 2004 judgment with its jurisdiction to hear and determine the setting-aside proceeding.

The Supreme Court found that these were not the arguments advanced by the Commissioner. The Commissioner had accepted that the High Court has the threshold power to determine the limits of its jurisdiction in relation to the plaintiffs' proceeding.

The Commissioner's argument was that the High Court had no "jurisdiction" because jurisdiction now lay with the Supreme Court on an application by Redcliffe to recall the judgment of the Supreme Court. This contention relates to the High Court's power to hear and decide Redcliffe's proceeding rather than whether the Court can grant the relief it seeks.

The Supreme Court found that the Court of Appeal had not addressed this argument. The Commissioner's objection to the High Court's jurisdiction fell within one of the categories of cases to which rule 5.49 applied. The Supreme Court found that a proper function of rule 5.49 was to determine whether the High Court was competent to decide the dispute.

The Supreme Court found that the Court of Appeal's approach to interpreting the meaning of "jurisdiction" under rule 5.49 was too restricted. Rule 5.49 expresses an unqualified right to challenge a court's jurisdiction to hear and determine a proceeding.

Redcliffe's allegations did not constitute a case capable of leading the High Court to set aside the 2004 judgment. The Supreme Court held that the High Court lacks jurisdiction to determine whether the Supreme Court's legal conclusions in _Ben Nevis_ were wrong.

The Commissioner's objection to the High Court's jurisdiction under rule 5.49 was soundly based and should have been upheld.

#### _Whether the judgment of the High Court should in any event have been upheld_

The Supreme Court began with a discussion of the principle of finality in litigation and the fraud exception. The principle of finality in litigation makes conclusive final determinations reached in the judicial process. Unless a judgment of a Court is set aside on further appeal or otherwise set aside or amended according to law, it is conclusive as to the legal consequences it decides: _R v Smith_ (\[2003\] 3 NZLR 617 (CA)).

The principle of finality in litigation reflects both the public interest in there being an end to litigation and the private interest of parties to court processes not being subjected by their opponents to vexatious re-litigation.

The principle of finality in litigation is attended with limited exceptions when justice requires. Exceptionally the law allows judgments to be attacked _inter alia_ on grounds of fraud: there must be conscious and deliberate dishonesty and the Court's judgment must be obtained by it.

The rationale for allowing a fraud exception to finality is that it is right that a party who can show that his or her ability to mount an effective case was compromised by the fraudulent conduct of the other party, should not be bound by a judgment which was thereby obtained.

Where such allegations are made, the plaintiff is required to discharge the onus of showing it has a case with an evidential foundation amounting to a prima facie case of fraud. The plaintiff also has the onus of establishing that the new evidence is sufficient to justify a new trial.

The Supreme Court then considered whether Redcliffe raised a tenable case involving the fraud exception. Redcliffe alleged that the Commissioner had a statutory duty under section 89F of the Tax Administration Act 1994, to refer, in notices of proposed adjustment, the "existence, application and effect" of subpart EH8, but deliberately and as part of a litigation strategy, did not do so.

Redcliffe's overall claim was that the Commissioner had suppressed the true legal position, presented a false case to the High Court, and thereby procured a judgment, based partly on the wrong provisions of the Income Tax Act 2004.

The Supreme Court found that the fraud exception to the finality of judgments does not apply to legal errors allegedly made in the reasons for judgment, even if a party's conduct is said to contribute to the making of the alleged error.

Where the fraud exception to finality is properly invoked, the party challenging the judgment will be able to show that his or her ability to mount an effective case was compromised by the fraudulent conduct of the other party.

The Supreme Court found that the fraud exception is not applicable in the instant case. The legislative subpart allegedly concealed was at all times present in the legislation and was thus inherently incapable of concealment. It was also raised in evidence by the Commissioner.

The judgment of the High Court was correct and was reinstated. Redcliffe's proceeding was dismissed.

[All Income tax dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[Income tax])

Business asset sales can involve a mixture of:

*   taxable (revenue) assets like trading stock, accounts receivable, personal property bought for resale, or patents
*   depreciable (capital) assets like plant or machinery
*   non-taxable (capital) assets like business goodwill.

The buyer and the seller can choose how much of the sale amount belongs to each type of asset. This is called allocating the sale price. It affects the tax paid, and the tax benefits or profits received. Typically, a higher proportion of:

*   taxable and depreciable assets will benefit the buyer as they can claim expenses and depreciation
*   non-taxable assets will benefit the seller as this reduces their taxable income.

Where the buyer and seller agree on amounts allocated
-----------------------------------------------------

Where the buyer and seller agree on how the sale price is allocated between taxable, depreciable and non-taxable assets then these values should be used for tax purposes.

The agreement should be made and documented before either the seller or buyer files their income tax return which includes the tax position for the sale. Neither party needs to notify us about the agreement unless requested.

If we consider the agreed amounts do not reflect the asset’s market value, we may allocate amounts using certain thresholds for low value depreciable assets.

From 1 July 2021, where 2 or more assets are sold, the buyer and seller should agree on the amount to allocate to each asset class based on market value.

Where buyer and seller do not agree on amounts allocated
--------------------------------------------------------

Where the buyer and seller do not agree on amounts allocated and the total purchase price is $1 million or more, or where the only assets are residential land (including buildings and chattels) with a purchase price of $7.5 million or more the following rules apply.

Within 3 months of settlement of the transaction, the seller:

*   may determine the amounts allocated
*   must notify both the buyer and us of the amounts. The amounts cannot be less than the greater of the market value or the sellers tax book value for the assets.

If the seller does not determine and notify the amounts to the buyer and us within the 3-month timeframe, then within a further 3 months (within 6 months of settlement) the buyer:

*   may determine the amounts allocated
*   must notify both the seller and Inland Revenue the amounts. The amounts cannot be less than the market value for the assets.

Once a valid notification is made by either party the amounts must be used by both the buyer and seller for income tax purposes.

If the buyer does not make a notification within the further 3-month timeframe then:

*   we may allocate amounts to each asset
*   any tax deduction that the buyer is entitled to may be denied until the following years tax return.

Note – Where we allocate an amount to each asset we may use an allocation made by either the buyer or seller notified after the 3 or 6 months timeframes, or based on market value subject to certain thresholds for low value depreciable assets.

### Notification

Notification can be made through myIR as a web message or in writing.

The notification should include the phrase “Purchase Price Allocation” in the subject line.

The following details are required in the notification:

*   Both parties name, IR/GST number and contact details
*   Date of agreement to the transaction
*   Date of settlement
*   Global/total price
*   Price allocated to each class of property sold - trading stock other than timber or a right to take timber, timber or a right to take timber, depreciable property, other than buildings, buildings that are depreciable property, financial arrangements, and purchased property where disposal does not give rise to assessable income for the seller or a deduction for the purchaser.
*   A statement that the amounts have been allocated in accordance with section GC 21.

You may wish to provide supporting documents such as the sale and purchase agreement and the notification provided to the other party.

Further detailed information is available in a special report published during April 2021 on our Tax Policy website.

If we find that the buyer and seller did not allocate the sale price in reasonably the same way in their income tax returns, or did not allocate it in line with market values or tax book values where required, then we are likely to:

*   investigate the sale
*   set our own allocation for tax purposes
*   reassess any incorrect GST or income tax returns (whichever applies):

In the case of a disagreement between us and you, it’s your responsibility to prove that your sale price allocation is correct.

This can take a while and can lead to a tax bill for either side. It’s best to talk early with a tax professional to make sure you get the details of your sale right from the start.

Selling business assets - Capital Coffee Roastery

Jesse sells his business ‘Capital Coffee Roastery’ to Connall for $200,000. It’s a sale made up of taxable and non-taxable assets.

The business is being sold as a going concern and meets the GST requirements, so the supply is zero-rated for GST – neither side pays nor receives GST on the sale.

Jesse and Connall work together along with their accountants and tax advisors to allocate the sale/purchase price to each type of asset. Based on market value, they both agree that the:

*   coffee beans, bags, and other trading stock are worth $30,000 – these are taxable (revenue) assets
*   factory and roasting equipment are worth $70,000 – these are depreciable (capital) assets
*   business’s good reputation to its customers (goodwill) is agreed to be worth the remaining $100,000 – this is a non-taxable (capital) asset.

As the seller, Jesse must declare the $30,000 worth of taxable assets as income in his income tax return. He may also need to make an adjustment to account for the clawback of some of the $70,000 factory and roasting equipment that he previously claimed depreciation on.

As the buyer, Connall can claim $30,000 as an expense in his income tax return for the trading stock. He can also claim depreciation on the $70,000 factory and roasting equipment.

Neither Jesse nor Connall will declare income or claim expenses for the $100,000 allocated to business goodwill.
N, Operational Guidelines: Section 6A Settlements Internal Use Only Dat e: 22 June 2016 To: I nvestigations and Advice Managers Investigations Managers LTS Managers Fr om: Graham Tubb Group Tax Counsel Guidelines on Operational Approach to Settling Disputes Prior to Challenge Introduction 1.In terpretation Statement IS 10/07 ( the Statement) confirms that Inland Revenue can “settle” disputes prior to litigation, pursuant to section 6A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the TAA). 1 Accordingly, it is important to set out the principles and processes by which Investigations & Advice might settle a dispute (or a potential dispute). These G uidelines apply to settlements that occur at any stage of the disputes process prior to the filing of a challenge in the Taxation Review Authority or the High Court. They also apply to the settlement of cases prior to the commencement of the disputes process. 2.Th ese Guidelines consider the following issues: i.W hether the decision being made is a settlement or something else? ii.Who is involved in making the decision? iii.What process is required before settlement can occur? iv.What does the decision itself involve? v.What factors will be relevant when deciding whether to settle? 3.Each of these issues is considered separately below. Additional resources are available on the LTS intranet Settlements pages: \[I nternal intranet link removed\] 1 At paragraph 156. 1 CLASSIFIED IN CONFIDENCE – INLAND REVENUE HIGHLY PROTECTED REVISION: JUNE 2016 General Approach 4. Both the courts and the Statement are clear that the Commissioner’s care and management responsibilities allow for and support the settlement of appropriate disputes. These Guidelines provide guidance in balancing the competing principles that must be taken into account when considering settlement. This requires a consideration of whether the particular settlement complies with the dual duties of collecting the highest net revenue practicable over time (s ection 6A) and protecting the integrity of the tax system (s ection 6 ). 5. The starting point is that, where the facts are clear and the law is settled, the Commissioner must apply the law correctly. This will not always be the situation, which is one of the principal reasons for preparing these Guidelines. Even when the position is clear, however, there may still be a basis for accepting an outcome which does not fully reflect the strict legal position. 6. Settlement decisions are to be made by considering the seven factors that are discussed below and determining how important each factor is to the particular dispute. All features of a settlement situation should fall within one or more of these factors. Section 6A does refer to the compliance costs of taxpayers and this is not one of the seven factors, but it will be considered as part of the integrity of the tax system and/or voluntary compliance factors. 7. The final task is to stand back and confirm that the decision to settle (or not) is consistent with the dual duties noted above. Above all, the decision to settle should be measured against the impact it may have on voluntary compliance. A too rigid approach can potentially undermine perceptions about compliance, though this is more likely if we too quickly accept a taxpayer’s proposal. One: Deciding whether a section 6/6A decision is required 8. It is first important to determine whether a settlement (as opposed to something else) is being considered, since different scenarios can arise when we are in dispute (or potentially in dispute) with a taxpayer. 9. For the purposes of these Guidelines, a “settlement” or “compromise” involves t he use of the Commissioner’s general discretion under sections 6 and 6A to accept less tax than would apply if the Commissioner’s position were correct. This decision occurs before any re-assessment and is made despite the Commissioner having a clear view of how the law applies to the relevant facts in the dispute. The settlement can only be accepted or rejected where the criteria set out below have been considered and a decision has been made by a person holding a section 6A delegation. 10. This can be contrasted to other decisions relating to disputes such as: (a) An exchange of information or arguments which enable either Inland Revenue or the taxpayer to change its view on how the law applies to that taxpayer’s situation. In such a case, the matter will be resolved on the basis of that changed understanding, resulting in either an agreed adjustment or the d ispute being abandoned by the Commissioner. This is a “resolution” of the dispute rather than a “settlement” or “compromise”. SPS 15/01 Finalising Agreements in Tax Investigations sets out the principles for finalising agreements in tax investigations by resolving issues that are in dispute. (b) In the process of quantifying a disputed amount of, say, suppressed income, which is inherently uncertain, a manager may agree to assess an imprecise, but 2 CLASSIFIED IN CONFIDENCE – INLAND REVENUE HIGHLY PROTECTED REVISION: JUNE 2016 approximately correct amount ( e.g. for the purpose of a default assessment). These Guidelines are not relevant to that scenario. Similarly, these Guidelines do not apply in relation to discussions on cases similar to Penny & Hooper v CIR, where the Commissioner can agree a reasonable amount to be returned by the taxpayer though the application of s ection BG 1. (c) Management decisions about exactly which periods are to be investigated (e. g. four years rather than three), while arguably a reflection of care and management powers, can usually be made in the normal course of administration of an investigation without compromising an established liability. As a result, these Guidelines will not need to be considered in these circumstances. Conversely, if the years in question have already been quantified, and a proposal involves Inland Revenue abandoning the proposed adjustments for, say, one year out of four, these Guidelines will need to be applied. In some cases a general decision might be made about a class of case – technically this would be a care and management decision. An example is found in the agreed approach set out in Revenue Alert 11/02 concerning the Penny & Hooper case. These cases involve the discretion under section GB 1, rather than section 6A directly, but section 6A principles were applied to determining the overall approach. (d) Certain discretions might be triggered on the basis of information provided or submissions made by the taxpayer, with particular respect to either the write-off of debt (sections 176 and 177), the remission of certain penalties or interest (s ection 183D) or similar remission provisions. This might be logically regarded as a form of settlement, but it is not an exercise of the Commissioner’s care and management powers under s 6A. I t is a legitimate exercise of other discretions, albeit arising in the context of resolving a taxpayer’s liability to tax. An example is the situation in which the taxpayer, although disputing the proposed adjustment in the hope that it will go away, is prepared to acknowledge that they have probably got it wrong, but they are unable to pay the tax for financial or other reasons. If a legitimate case for write-off of the debt can be made, there is no reason why the Investigations team, with assistance from Collections, cannot reach a two-part agreement (first as to the basis of the assessment and second as to recovery). Another example could be around our discretion on reconstruction of tax avoidance arrangements. We can call this sort of situation a “discretionary resolution”. (e) A manager may make a decision to not commence an investigation (even if an eventual discrepancy seems reasonably certain, after a risk review for example) for a number of reasons including time bar considerations, the tax at stake is low or the collectability of the tax is limited. This is a resource allocation decision rather than an actual compromise for the particular investigation or dispute. This decision is still in a sense made under section 6A. However, this type of decision is outside the scope of these Guidelines. Two: Who can exercise the delegation and when? 11. Both accepting and rejecting any settlement offer is an exercise of the care and management responsibility, so it must be considered by an appropriate delegation holder ( even in circumstances whereby a settlement offer is obviously frivolous). 12. For the purposes of these Guidelines, those with the general care and management discretion will be the Deputy Commissioner (Service Delivery), Director (Litigation Management), Group Manager (Investigations and Advice), Investigations and Advice Manager (Investigations and Advice) and the Group Tax Counsel (Investigations and Advice). Settlements post the filing of a challenge should only 3 CLASSIFIED IN CONFIDENCE – INLAND REVENUE HIGHLY PROTECTED REVISION: JUNE 2016 be made by the Director (Litigation Management). Any settlements in the post- adjudication period but prior to challenge need to be discussed with the Director (Litigation Management). 13. Any recommendation to the delegation holders to use care and management to settle an actual or potential dispute is subject to c ritical t ask as surance (CTA), generally by a Senior Tax Counsel, National Adviser Technical Standards or a Senior Solicitor approved by the Group Tax Counsel. The current list of senior solicitors who can review a settlement proposal for Critical Task Assurance purposes is contained on the intranet page maintained by LTS: \[Internal intranet link removed\] Investigations Managers and LTS Managers as decision-makers 14. Investigations Managers and LTS Managers have a more limited discretion. They are empowered to settle a dispute, with careful reference to the criteria set out in these Guidelines, where t he settlement offer does not include the cancellation of losses or an undertaking to not use available losses and: (a) The core tax in dispute is less than $100,000; or (b) The settlement offer involves the Commissioner conceding less than $50,000 (including use of money interest (UOMI) and shortfall penalties) of the amount in dispute. 15. Investigations Managers and LTS Managers may also reject any settlement offer where the amount offered represents less than 50% of the core tax potentially in dispute (whether or not the core tax is less than $100,000). 16. Any care and management recommendation to an Investigations or LTS Manager is subject to Critical T ask Assurance by another LTS Manager, Senior Tax Counsel, LTS Team Leader, Senior Solicitor or Senior Technical Advisor. Some g eneral l imitations and issues Where other case/periods are in dispute: 17. Investigations Managers and LTS Managers should only exercise their delegation if they are confident that the dispute is not similar to other investigations or disputes being undertaken. Where a settlement is intended to apply to multiple investigations, or could potentially impact on another investigation or dispute, or could reasonably be seen as inadvertently providing a precedent for settling a similar investigation or dispute, the decision to settle the dispute should be made by a person holding the general care and management delegation. Where a similar case is in litigation 18. Litigation Management Unit (LMU) involvement: All decision-makers (including general care and management delegation holders) should not, regardless of the weight which would otherwise be given to the criteria, agree to settle a dispute (or reject a settlement offer) with a taxpayer if litigation has commenced in respect of another period for the taxpayer on the same issue, or in respect of an associated entity such as a partnership or similar business grouping involving the taxpayer or associated parties. In these cases, no settlement decision is to be taken except with LMU approval. 4 CLASSIFIED IN CONFIDENCE – INLAND REVENUE HIGHLY PROTECTED REVISION: JUNE 2016 19. Investigations or LTS should be liaising with LMU management in any event to ensure that any such settlement does not impact on any live proceedings. Use of tax losses 20. Taxpayers sometimes offer to pay disputed tax through the reduction of tax losses. 21. Our general settlement policy is not to accept income tax losses to pay any tax owing (shortfall penalties are able to be paid with tax losses; see below). This is because the payment of any tax should be the priority and because the cancellation of losses generally requires that an artificial assessment be first raised as part of any settlement. Losses as payment of tax will only be permitted by a general care and management delegation holder (i.e. not an Investigations Manager or LTS Manager) in the following circumstances: • The tax losses are used to pay income tax only and not other tax types. For the avoidance of doubt, income tax does not include taxes which have been treated as income tax by s YA 2; and • The taxpayer has paid the core income tax to the fullest extent possible. In other words, where there is the ability to pay the core tax, the use of tax losses is not appropriate. The taxpayer’s ability to pay will need to be discussed with Collections; and • The tax losses to be used as payment would very likely have been used within the next two tax years. In other words, the elimination of the losses means there will now be taxable income in the following two years on which tax will be payable; and • The taxpayer’s compliance history is good and there are no future voluntary compliance concerns. This means that in cases of avoidance and evasion, the use of tax losses will not be appropriate. Similarly, if the losses are not themselves legally supportable ( e.g. because they have been generated from an avoidance arrangement), they may not be used for these purposes. 22. In this way, the use of tax losses in settlement will mean that the disputed tax will effectively be paid within the next two years. This provides the taxpayer with a limited timing benefit, but one that could be acceptable in the circumstances. Note that losses can be used to offset income in the usual way and the prohibition against using tax losses does not apply to those situations. 23. Tax losses may also be used to pay shortfall penalties – see sections IA 3(1) and IW 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The use of tax losses in this way is therefore not subject to any care and management approval. 24. If the reduction in available tax losses is part of the settlement, then the settlement deed will need to record the a ssessment of the loss balance carried forward. The Commissioner will stipulate in the deed that this loss balance carried forward figure will be included in the taxpayer’s next income tax return to be filed. 25. The use of any losses should not in any case however be recorded as constituting a payment for imputation credit or other tax credit purposes. 5 CLASSIFIED IN CONFIDENCE – INLAND REVENUE HIGHLY PROTECTED REVISION: JUNE 2016 Settlement periods 26. Usually the settlement applies naturally to the periods in dispute. Sometimes it can be a viable settlement option to limit the periods in dispute by conceding one or more of the earlier periods, for example, if the criteria below appear to indicate that as an option, such as where the evidence is less clear (increasing the litigation risk) for that period. 27. In unusual cases, the settlement agreement can relate to future (I.e. not-yet disputed) periods, but only in respect of an arrangement which is continuing for a definite period (which shouldn’t be more than say two years), and not in the case of tax avoidance arrangements. However as the key goal is to achieve full compliance, agreeing to future tax returns being made on a known incorrect basis should be quite rare. Collections Work 28. Though generally all settlements should be on the basis of payment in full, in rare cases it is desirable to resolve payment and collection issues at the same time as settling the tax dispute. Investigations staff should work closely with Collections staff to determine whether it is appropriate to apply the debt provisions such as instalment arrangements. Sections 6 and 6A settlements should not be a substitute for the correct application of write-off provisions, such as sections 176 and 177C: see examples 9 and 10 in the Statement. Personal guarantee or security 29. To support collection of the settlement amount, a personal guarantee or security may be appropriate as a term of settlement in certain circumstances. In such a case, the settlement should not be finalised until the personal guarantee or security has been approved for Critical Tax Assurance purposes. Please refer to the taking of securities item in the CTA matrix for further explanation. LTS must assist if a personal guarantee or security forms part of a settlement. At what stages in the dispute process can a case be settled? 30. Settlement can occur at any point in the investigation and dispute phases ( and can also occur later, e.g. in the conference phase, see below). This includes the period prior to the issue of a NOPA. However the Commissioner will only be in a position to settle prior to the issue of a NOPA if the Commissioner: - has determined what amount is properly assessable; - has a thorough understanding of the taxpayer’s position; and - understands how all of the principles discussed below apply in the context of the case in question. 31. However, these Guidelines do not apply to settlements that occur after the taxpayer has been re-assessed and has challenged the assessment. In those circumstances, the decision to settle rests with LMU. As previously mentioned, LMU should be consulted for any post-adjudication but pre-challenge settlement offer. LMU may also form an integral part of settlement decisions made under these Guidelines (as may Crown Law), 2 particularly in relation to assessing dispute risk. In addition, no 2 Consistent with the Protocol agreed between Inland Revenue and Crown Law: see http://www.crownlaw.govt.nz/uploads/irdprotocols.pdf. 6 CLASSIFIED IN CONFIDENCE – INLAND REVENUE HIGHLY PROTECTED REVISION: JUNE 2016 settlement decision is to be taken except with LMU approval if litigation has commenced in respect of: - another period for the taxpayer on the same issue; - a partnership, company group or similar business structure involving the taxpayer or associates and the disputed issue; - a very similar legal issue involving other parties. What taxes can be the subject of settlement? 32. Disputes about most tax types can be the subject of settlement (but not student loans). Different compromises may occur in relation to one aspect of the settlement amount but not others. However, generally this means: (a) We may compromise on the quantum of core tax in dispute, if a compromise is clearly justified in terms of these Guidelines. In particular, protecting the integrity of the tax system means that the general body of taxpayers should not perceive that disputing a tax issue with us will always lead to a tax bill that is less than core tax. As such, the other factors supporting settlement need to be increasingly compelling, the smaller the percentage of core tax the taxpayer is offering to pay. It is preferable to compromise on shortfall penalties rather than core tax, in most cases. (b) We can compromise on the quantum of shortfall penalties imposed in a settlement. It is also possible to impose a lower level of penalty if that is appropriate (for example imposing an unacceptable tax position penalty rather than an abusive tax position penalty). However, the need to act consistently with sections 6 and 6A is more readily apparent where the penalty that would be otherwise imposed on the taxpayer is at the serious end (for example, abusive tax position or evasion penalties). (c) The amount of UOMI should generally follow the amount of core tax payable (as reduced if applicable). The purpose of UOMI is to compensate the Crown for being out of pocket through the taxpayer not paying tax on time. This purpose would be generally undermined if we regularly accepted settlements that did not have any UOMI imposed on the settled amount or it was overly discounted. In other words, if settlement results in reduced core tax assessments, UOMI will be lower than if full core tax was paid. However, UOMI may be compromised below that flowing from the level of core tax payable in some circumstances. Section 183D sets out that the Commissioner may remit UOMI (and penalties). The Standard Practice Statement on this section (SPS 15/02) states that remission occurs when the UOMI is correctly charged at the time, but it is decided to relieve the taxpayer of liability. While a compromise of UOMI is different from remission, the SPS provides useful guidance. The SPS does not allow remission where the non-compliant action was the result of a genuine oversight or a one- off situation. It does provide that charging UOMI would be unreasonable where the taxpayer has received incorrect advice from an Inland Revenue officer or the taxpayer has relied on incorrect information in an Inland Revenue publication. Analogously, reducing UOMI in a settlement in these circumstances would be appropriate. Section 120W provides that UOMI is not payable where the taxpayer relied on the “Commissioner’s official opinion”, as defined in s 3. If that definition applies, the inapplicability of UOMI will not be a compromise of UOMI and will fall outside these Guidelines. Note that taxpayers are allowed to use tax pooling to reduce their UOMI exposure and so the effect of tax pooling should not be seen as a compromise by the Commissioner of UOMI. 7 CLASSIFIED IN CONFIDENCE – INLAND REVENUE HIGHLY PROTECTED REVISION: JUNE 2016 33. In addition to simply adjusting the taxable amount for a period, consideration can be given to agreeing to limit the periods affected, to use a lesser penalty type, or to apply a different valuation methodology, where there is flexibility within the law to do so. These approaches should be applied with great care however with precedent in mind. Three: The General Process for Considering a Settlement 34. Ordinarily, the process for agreeing or rejecting a settlement will involve the following steps: Pre-Decision 35. The settlement proposal will have been provided to (or in some circumstances initiated by) Investigations or LTS. The team considering the dispute (or potential dispute) will analyse whether they think accepting the offer would be consistent with our care and management responsibilities – taking into account the matters covered in these Guidelines. Offers/counter-offers by Commissioner 36. There will be circumstances where settlement seems appropriate, but not on the terms offered by the taxpayer. In those circumstances, it may be appropriate to provide a counter-offer recommendation that is consistent with sections 6 and 6A for the delegation holder’s consideration. Once that has been signed off the counter- offer can be formally made to the taxpayer. 37. The Inland Revenue case team may have also had further discussions with the taxpayer’s advisors regarding the potential settlement. Where potential settlement discussions occur between a taxpayer and the case team, it needs to be made clear that: (a) Those discussions are on a ‘without prejudice’ and confidential basis; (b) Any proposed settlement will need to be approved by the relevant s 6A delegation holder; and (c) Any agreed settlement will need to be formalised through the execution of a deed to be prepared by Inland Revenue. Facilitations during conference phase 38. Where the subject of settlement arises during a facilitated conference: (a) Any settlement discussion at the facilitated conference should be clearly distinguished from discussions about the legal and factual issues in dispute. The discussion should be directed by the facilitator who should ensure that, as far as possible, all of the factual differences between the parties have been resolved. The facilitator should only support the request for a settlement discussion if satisfied that positive engagement has been made by the parties in trying to resolve the issue in other ways. (b) The facilitator should ensure the parties understand that the settlement discussion is on a “without prejudice” basis and that the dispute facilitation itself is on hold while the settlement discussions take place. A “without prejudice” 8 CLASSIFIED IN CONFIDENCE – INLAND REVENUE HIGHLY PROTECTED REVISION: JUNE 2016 discussion is one that is subject to ‘settlement privilege’. This means that documents and communications related to the attempt to settle do not have to be disclosed as part of any litigation. For a detailed explanation, see the discussion in the forthcoming SPS on legal advice and other privilege. (c) The facilitator should also ensure that the Inland Revenue officers who are involved in the settlement discussion are aware of these Guidelines and the need to obtain sign-off at the appropriate delegated level (whether the recommendation is to settle or not to settle). 39. It must be made clear to the disputant that any settlement discussions will proceed in accordance with the criteria and processes set out in these Guidelines. In particular, taxpayers need to be aware that settlement on a “splitting the difference” or purely arbitrary basis to conclude the dispute is not acceptable. 40. Depending on the result of settlement discussions, the parties may need to reconvene the conference phase or to bring the conference phase to an end. Recommendation memo 41. Once those discussions have been completed, the team should draft a memorandum that provides a recommendation to the relevant decision-maker. That memorandum will need to take into account the settlement criteria set out in these Guidelines. The memorandum should have been approved by an Investigations Team Leader (or an Investigations Manager where they are not making the settlement decision). The recommendation will also be Critical Task Assured to confirm that it is consistent with Sections 6 and 6A and these Guidelines. Additional resources are available on the LTS intranet Settlements pages: \[Internal intranet link removed\] The Decision-Making Framework 42. Once the decision-maker has received the Critical T ask Assured recommendation to settle (or reject the offer), he or she will decide whether to accept or reject the proposed settlement in accordance with Part 4 below. That decision can of course be contrary to the recommendation provided by the relevant officers. 43. The delegation holder’s decision will be based on a balancing exercise using the factors described in part 5 below. This ensures that, whatever decision is made, it is consistent with the Sections 6 and 6A obligations. I t is obviously important that the decision-maker clearly documents the decision-making process. This will include what the decision is, what information he or she has had regard to in reaching the decision and the reasons for the decision. 44. A settlement process guide is included on the LTS resources page here: \[Internal intranet link removed\] Post-decision 45. Rejection of the settlement offer: If the delegation holder has decided to reject the offer, the taxpayer will need to be informed. Often the taxpayer asks for reasons why the offer was not acceptable. It is appropriate to briefly explain why the offer was rejected. In most cases, the explanation will be that the core tax 9 CLASSIFIED IN CONFIDENCE – INLAND REVENUE HIGHLY PROTECTED REVISION: JUNE 2016 payable and/or shortfall penalties and/or UOMI was too low given the Commissioner’s view of the application of the settlement factors. In particular, the adverse impact on voluntary compliance and tax system integrity should be stressed as the important reasons why the offer was not acceptable. If settlement was rejected on the basis of precedentiality so that only full core tax (and penalties if relevant) is acceptable, we should advise the taxpayer of this position. This eliminates the time and resources needed for making and considering further unacceptable offers. 46. Accepting the proposal – drafting of settlement deed: If the delegation holder’s accepts a settlement proposal, its terms will need to be formalised in writing and will need to be signed by the delegation holder on behalf of the Commissioner. This will normally be by way of a deed, which s hould be prepared by LTS. Normal terms of any settlement would make clear reference to: (a) our intended assessment including penalties; (b) the taxpayer’s obligations in terms of future compliance; (c) the confidential and non-precedential nature of the settlement; (d) the provision of information; (e) the manner in which the settlement is to be effected (for example, if an instalment arrangement is to be entered into, this should be captured and follow the appropriate process in respect of such arrangements); (f) an y guarantees or security required; (g) the consequences of non-payment or default if payment is not required; and (h) the position relating to consequential adjustments (including to other tax types, periods, or related parties). 47. Please contact LTS to confirm the appropriateness of any particular draft settlement deed. A template is available on the LTS Settlements page: \[Internal intranet link removed\] 48. The usual process is for the taxpayer to sign the deed first and then the Commissioner. 49. Letter Agreements: A less formal exchange of letters can also give effect to the agreed settlement, if the core tax being resolved is small (under $50,000), the issue is not precedential and approval is obtained from a general care and management delegation holder. The template offer letter should be used in these circumstances. This can be found on the LTS website. The offer letter should be signed by an Investigations Manager or LTS Manager. 50. If the Commissioner issues a settlement offer letter which is not subject to conditions, it is important to note that, if a taxpayer accepts the Commissioner’s offer, there will likely be a settlement agreement which the Commissioner could not resile from. It is therefore very important that any offer letter is reviewed by LTS. 51. Settlement Register: The Investigations Team must then summarise the decision to settle by completing the form and sending this to the Group Tax Counsel’s PA, who maintains a register of section 6A settlement decisions for future reporting and integrity purposes. See the Settlements page on the LTS website and the Knowledge Base (Settle an audit case – No Adjudication) for further information. Four: The Decision Itself 10 CLASSIFIED IN CONFIDENCE – INLAND REVENUE HIGHLY PROTECTED REVISION: JUNE 2016 52. Before deciding on the proposed settlement’s merits, the decision maker will need to ensure that certain ‘threshold’ issues have been satisfied. These are: (a) Is all the relevant information held? A decision to settle can only be made if the decision maker is fully informed. T he Investigations team will need to have obtained sufficient information (from the taxpayer, third parties and, where necessary, independent experts), together with legal input from LTS (and sometimes LMU, OCTC or PAS) , to determine whether its position is robust. If the decision maker considers that there is potentially more relevant information that could impact on the decision, he or she should request that information from Investigations and/or LTS; and (b) With that information, is the Commissioner’s position correct? A settlement is only appropriate where we still consider that our view of how the law applies to the taxpayer’s facts is correct. Although any dispute will involve risks, where it is considered that the taxpayer’s position clearly represents the better view of the law, the Commissioner should not be considering settlement. In those circumstances, the Commissioner should withdraw from the dispute. 53. Once the decision-maker is satisfied that there is sufficient information to determine that Inland Revenue is correct, he or she then needs to decide whether or not the proposed settlement should be accepted. The starting point for that decision involves the following: (a) Inland Revenue is under an on-going obligation to apply the law. As such, a compromise for less than the properly imposed amount (including UOMI and penalties where relevant) can only be entertained when it is consistent with our care and management responsibilities. The starting point is that taxpayers are obliged to pay the correct amount of tax and a departure from that should only be mandated after a careful application of the criteria in these Guidelines. (b) In this regard, while it is important to consider the factors described below in combination when considering the particular settlement proposal, the overriding obligation is to ensure that any settlement decision is consistent with collecting the highest net revenue over time, protecting the tax system’s integrity and promoting voluntary compliance by taxpayers. The decision to settle a dispute or not must be consistent with those objectives. This means that factors specific to the settlement proposal not discussed in the Guidelines may still be relevant to the process. (c) In most circumstances, consideration of the factors described in the next section will involve a balancing exercise. This is because some of those factors may favour settlement whereas others may suggest a settlement should not be entertained. For example, where a settlement involves significant resources and complexity, there may well be net savings if the dispute was settled and high dispute risk if it is not. This needs to be tempered by the possible negative impact a settlement may have on promoting voluntary compliance, both in relation to that taxpayer and taxpayers more generally, where the settlement becomes more widely known. Five: The Factors to be Considered 54. These Guidelines provide a framework for making consistent decisions about settling or compromising actual or potential disputes, by making it mandatory to consider a number of factors, which will generally be relevant to any settlement decision. The ones that will generally be more relevant to settlement decisions are discussed first. In particular, the last two categories discussed (tax in dispute and taxpayer’s ability 11 CLASSIFIED IN CONFIDENCE – INLAND REVENUE HIGHLY PROTECTED REVISION: JUNE 2016 to pay) are ordinarily unlikely in their own right to justify accepting or rejecting a settlement proposal. 55. Decision-makers should not assume that particular factors will always be the most relevant to the proposed settlement under consideration. They will often require application or balancing in different ways in different factual scenarios. For example, what involvement the taxpayer had in a scheme (e.g. in designing or promoting it), has the taxpayer co-operated to date and what stage is the dispute at (e.g. what level of resource has already been committed?). Finally, it is important not to take into account any irrelevant factors. 56. The portion of the Interpretation Statement dealing with settlement agreements, which forms the basis of these Guidelines, is attached. The non-exhaustive list of criteria, mentioned at paragraphs 151 to 161 in the Statement, should be used as a guide. 57. The following commentary expands on and explains those criteria in a more practical context. The criteria discussed below are consolidated into seven factors, which should adequately address any circumstances which arise in a dispute context. There may be times when a direct reference to the criteria specified in the Interpretation Statement itself is also appropriate, in decision-making, but this should not generally be necessary. Factor One: Inland Revenue’s Resources Section 6A(3) confirms that the use of our resources and the compliance costs imposed on taxpayers are two relevant factors when applying care and management. In terms of our resources, the question is whether those finite resources could be better used for other purposes. 58. The decision-maker should consider the resources necessary to develop the dispute from this point onwards, including litigation costs, against the revenue to be gained. 59. More complex cases will clearly occupy more time and cost more. T he dispute will often involve senior technical and investigative staff, as well as external consultants and advisors. There is also the possibility of procedural and other impediments being placed in the way of the dispute, which all need to be taken into account. 60. Secondly, the decision maker is entitled to take into account the alternative use of Inland Revenue’s resources, or the “opportunity cost”. In the past we have occasionally considered that bringing a dispute to an end, particularly where it is about a small quantum of tax can be more economical than continuing and succeeding in the case itself. In those circumstances, opportunity costs are valid considerations. Compromise may be preferable where there is another large different case looming, involving considerably more tax in dispute where it is strategically more important for Inland Revenue to apply investigation resources to that case instead. 61. It might be useful to establish a reasonable figure for the commitment of resources going forward in the dispute, and weigh that against the revenue at stake. By this we do not mean just the revenue at stake in terms of the particular individual dispute. We would also need to take into account the wider implications of the dispute. That is, if there are 100 other similar cases (which can be determined by discussing the proposed settlement with people such as portfolio holders in Investigations, LTS or with LMU) that would be affected by this decision, then that needs to be considered (al though this might happen under the Precedential Value 12 CLASSIFIED IN CONFIDENCE – INLAND REVENUE HIGHLY PROTECTED REVISION: JUNE 2016 factor below). This is ultimately about determining (or at least estimating) what is the “net revenue” in terms of section 6A which could be affected by the decision. 62. This factor will favour a settlement where the resource that Inland Revenue will need to deploy (in terms of personnel time and cost mainly, but also taking into account possible external costs such as expert advice etc.) to fully complete a dispute outweighs the benefit achieved. This may be relevant where, for example, a historic dispute involving a single taxpayer with little tax at stake and no precedent value is still likely to require significant Inland Revenue resources (e.g. because of the complexity of the issue and the need for expert advice). 63. By contrast, it may be a more neutral factor where the dispute will not require significant additional resources (e.g. the dispute builds on work previously done by the Commissioner). In any case it needs to be balanced against the other factors. Factor Two: Likelihood of Success in the Dispute There is risk in any dispute that our view will not be accepted. What must be weighed here is the extent to which our position may or may not succeed in the dispute. It is possible that our position may not be accepted by either a court or the TRA. In considering the likely dispute risk, a number of factors need to be considered: interpretative uncertainty; evidential issues; and administrative or procedural concerns. Each of these needs to be separately taken into account. 64. Although we consider we have the better view of the law, there is still a risk that a court will disagree with that position. What must be weighed here is the likelihood of succeeding where there is uncertainty as to the law or the facts. So, for example: (a) The relevant legislation may not have been previously considered by the Courts or there may be commentary on the law suggesting it can be interpreted in different ways. A lternatively, it may be a novel application of settled law (such as a novel capital v revenue issue). (b) Where the propositions of law are not in doubt, there may still be dispute risk arising from the standard of the evidence. This can be either factual or expert opinion evidence. So, the credibility of a witness may be an important factor. Similarly, there may be uncertainty where the taxpayer’s expert is at odds with ours (over, for example, a valuation issue). (c) Finally, there will be rare occasions where administrative or procedural issues heighten our dispute risk. This may occur in relation to something like time bar (in a novel setting) or where we are alleged to have made a tentative assessment. 65. LTS will be able to assist with this generally, but what is required is an aggregate assessment of the matters that impact on IR’s chances of succeeding. This will often require discussions to occur with LMU and, occasionally, the Crown Law Office. In particular, where there is a very significant dispute (either because it will act as a precedent or because of the quantum of tax involved) LMU’s advice on litigation risk should be obtained. 66. This factor becomes increasingly relevant to a settlement decision as our chances of succeeding are lessened. Conversely, where there is little or no litigation risk (for example, a scheme replicates in all material respects a case which has been considered by the courts), then this factor will generally not be very relevant. 13 CLASSIFIED IN CONFIDENCE – INLAND REVENUE HIGHLY PROTECTED REVISION: JUNE 2016 Again, there is always some risk of failure, but decision-makers should not be excessively swayed by this. The other factors remain critical. Factor Three: Promoting Voluntary Compliance This may involve promoting voluntary compliance generally or in relation to a specific taxpayer. Where the promotion of voluntary compliance relates to taxpayers generally, it will be closely aligned to protecting the tax system’s integrity, which is considered separately below. 67. The starting point is that a settlement that is too low does not encourage voluntary compliance. 68. A careful judgment must be made about the potential impacts of a settlement, on both the particular taxpayer, any related parties and on taxpayers in general (e.g. if the matter was to become widely known). 69. In respect of the particular taxpayer, the decision maker is entitled to take into account the past compliance record of those involved in the dispute. If this is particularly bad, then it is less likely that a settlement would be contemplated. The taxpayer’s known appetite for tax risk may also impact on their likely compliance with the settlement terms or future compliance in general. 70. Their compliance behaviour could also be affected by the type of dispute in question (even if the taxpayer had generally been compliant). F or example, if it is a question about evasion or avoidance it is less likely that we would want to settle. See also the Integrity of the tax system factor below. 71. Whether a taxpayer has disclosed a particular tax position taken may be a relevant consideration. A taxpayer can voluntarily disclose a potential tax shortfall, albeit that the taxpayer does not accept that the full shortfall should be paid, often because there may be arguments which suggest a contrary view. Such a disclosure usually indicates that the taxpayer is attempting to be compliant and this should be encouraged. However, a voluntary disclosure where an audit commencement has been indicated is a far less persuasive a reason for settling. 72. The decision-maker should also take into account the likely future compliance of the taxpayer. Sometimes we can legitimately say that we are confident that the taxpayer now understands the error which has occurred, has taken steps to fix it and will be compliant in the future (perhaps because there is very good past compliance behaviour). This can be important in terms of promoting voluntary compliance, since continuing to vigorously pursue the dispute might well undermine that future compliance. It is particularly important except in quite rare cases to obtain a clear undertaking that the disputed items will be treated correctly in future returns however. 73. This factor will be more relevant where a decision to settle may affect the behaviour of other taxpayers. The obvious example is where other taxpayers have similar disputes (e.g. in a mass marketed scheme situation). As mentioned, in these circumstances the settlement of individual cases should not occur unless there are very strong reasons to settle. T he existence of a settlement, if publicised, may often undermine the general perception of other taxpayers, and lead to a net loss of integrity, especially if the issue in the dispute is a common one. A unique or “one off” dispute, if settled, is less likely to have this effect. 74. A dispute where the taxpayer has sought a ruling application is also a factor that the Commissioner might take into account in terms of taxpayer compliance. A ruling 14 CLASSIFIED IN CONFIDENCE – INLAND REVENUE HIGHLY PROTECTED REVISION: JUNE 2016 application generally indicates a taxpayer wishing to be compliant by seeking the Commissioner’s view of the tax treatment of an arrangement. As such, this should be seen more favourably than an issue identified in an audit. Awareness of the Commissioner’s view of the tax treatment of an arrangement should not generally be seen negatively in a settlement context, especially where the issue is not straightforward. Ultimately, the taxpayer has brought the issue to the Commissioner’s attention via the ruling application and this should be encouraged. 75. However, the Commissioner should generally take a harder line in cases of tax avoidance and should certainly do so where evasion is alleged. A slightly more favourable approach might be made for those avoidance cases where the taxpayer is not the instigator or promoter of the tax avoidance, was likely to be unaware of the avoidance and has taken reasonable steps in the circumstances to check the tax treatment. 76. It is possible in some cases that a settlement will improve not only the individual taxpayer’s compliance in the future, but that of associates, and other taxpayers if they became aware of the now-compliant behaviour. 77. The issue becomes more neutral if settlement is unlikely to positively impact on either general or specific voluntary compliance. Factor Four: The Integrity of the tax system Here we are concerned with the impact that any settlement may have on perceptions about the tax system’s integrity. Will the general body of taxpayers’ confidence in the tax system and the way we administer it be enhanced or reduced if we settle a particular dispute? 78. Another important factor is the potential impact which settlement may have on public perception of the tax system’s integrity. 79. The meaning of “integrity of the tax system” is set out in s 6(2). The section refers to taxpayer perceptions of that integrity. It also refers to the Commissioner acting fairly and within the law and the corresponding rights of taxpayers in this regard. Under this section, taxpayers also have rights to be treated with no greater or lesser favour than other taxpayers. 80. One question which arises from s 6(2) is therefore whether taxpayers would see the Commissioner’s approach to settlement at a discounted amount as reasonable. Or is the Commissioner being overly lenient or unduly harsh in her approach to settlement given the circumstances? In other words, does the proposed settlement give the general body of taxpayers confidence that the tax system is operating fairly and consistently. So me of the issues discussed above may be relevant again here (e.g. large tax at stake or aggressive tax planning). However, it is important to appreciate that any decision to settle can either promote or detract from this overarching objective. 81. Where we are perceived to be “lenient” on a particular type of taxpayer or making concessions on a perceived difficult area (e.g. evasion or avoidance, but also many areas of “black letter” complexity), then the public may have less regard for the tax system. On the other hand, a similar reaction could occur if we invest a great deal of resource disputing an issue that is either not material or is otherwise unmeritorious. So where there is little tax at stake, and no general clarifying proposition of law is likely to fall out of the dispute, rejecting an individual’s reasonable settlement offer may adversely impact on taxpayers’ perception of the system’s integrity and trust in Inland Revenue. 15 CLASSIFIED IN CONFIDENCE – INLAND REVENUE HIGHLY PROTECTED REVISION: JUNE 2016 82. To restate, by contrast, the public may have more confidence in the tax administration if the reverse occurs – i.e. we stay the course in a dispute with difficult issues or aggressive taxpayers, but settle cases where taxpayers have attempted to be compliant, or that have a small amount of tax at stake and do not impact on taxpayers more generally. 83. The tax system’s integrity may also be impacted where we are considering a settlement proposal that is comparable to one that we have accepted in relation to a materially similar dispute. There would need to be appropriate reasons provided as to why a comparable settlement would not be accepted by us, but this is an extremely difficult area, as it is important that Inland Revenue does not find its hands tied and has the flexibility to treat different fact situations appropriately. Therefore, if possible, settlements should be made on the basis that they are not indicative of what might be agreed in a future case, and the terms are to be kept strictly confidential. Factor Five: Precedential Value of the Dispute A settlement is more likely to be approved if it is confined to its own facts and will not impact on other taxpayers. By contrast, it will be more difficult to justify a compromise where the dispute may impact on a number of taxpayers or we would like the position to be made more certain. 84. The value of a dispute, in terms of its impact on others, may be two-fold. First, there is the impact it may have on other taxpayers in comparable situations. Secondly, there may be a need to have uncertainty in the relevant law clarified for a much wider group. 85. If we consider that a particular dispute will formally or indirectly determine the Commissioner’s position in relation to either a number or category of taxpayers or of an issue generically, then it is often not desirable that such a dispute should be settled. For example, if we are in dispute with a taxpayer over whether certain expenditure is capital or revenue expenditure and consider that the issue may apply to the same or similar facts across an entire industry, then this factor would favour the dispute continuing rather than settling (even where other factors might indicate settlement). Similarly, where the dispute relates to a potential tax avoidance arrangement that a number of taxpayers have replicated, this would count against settlement, at least unless significant consideration has been given nationally to the approach to the particular type of arrangement. In such circumstances, continuing and resolving (rather than settling) the dispute may ultimately positively impact on matters such as voluntary compliance and resource savings, if only by clarifying the law. 86. Please also note the comments above limiting the ability to settle where other directly relevant litigation or disputes are already under action. This must be checked with LMU. 87. We may also want to pursue a dispute in circumstances where the law is unclear and obtaining clarity on the law will also promote voluntary compliance. A decision to settle might not be contemplated where, for example, it is unclear whether an individual is entitled to claim a deduction for certain accrual or interest expenditure and the interpretation of the provisions could have far-reaching implications (for many other investors). The implications of disputing (and losing) may instead be that the Commissioner receives a multitude of relatively small s 113 applications requiring a significant amount of Inland Revenue resources. 16 CLASSIFIED IN CONFIDENCE – INLAND REVENUE HIGHLY PROTECTED REVISION: JUNE 2016 88. Conversely, where the dispute is relatively fact specific and is not going to provide any guidance for other taxpayers in like situations, the case for settlement is greater, so this factor becomes less relevant to resisting a settlement proposal (however consider the comments above in respect of factor five). 89. Finally, the terms of the settlement (as opposed to whether we settle at all), although confidential can be seen as creating a precedent. While each case should be approached on its merits, we need to be very mindful of this if there are likely to be other similar cases to resolve. Factor Six: Quantum of Tax in Dispute Obviously the greater the potential tax in dispute, the more compelling the other reasons for settlement need to be. Determining the tax at risk is relatively easy for a simple dispute but an aggregation of tax at risk might be required when there is a comparable arrangement involving a number of taxpayers. In the latter situation, the tax at risk may be closely aligned to the dispute’s precedential possibilities. 90. The amount of tax which is affected by the possible settlement is also relevant. There are overlaps with the other criteria of course. So, for example, if the tax is quite small, then it is relatively easy to see that applying substantial Investigation, LTS and LMU resources, which could easily exceed the tax in dispute, could produce a negative net revenue figure. This would never be a decisive factor on its own, but should certainly be taken into account. 91. Where the revenue at stake is very large, say in the millions of dollars, this will be a significant factor in deciding to continue the dispute. Of course, the higher the dispute or litigation risk, the greater the chance that some or all of the tax will not be able to be assessed. Factor Seven: The Taxpayer’s Capacity to Pay There may be situations in which the ability to receive a settlement payment from the taxpayer increases or decreases over time. 92. The primary aim is to correctly assess the taxpayer. It is sometimes legitimate to consider whether Inland Revenue would eventually recover the full tax, UOMI and penalties if the dispute continues. That is, an agreement now with the taxpayer to a reduced assessment and the payment of that assessment may increase the revenue collected compared to an assessment and payment in the future without that agreement. That may be the case if funds are currently available for the taxpayer to pay on the basis of a compromised settlement, but there is a real possibility that the funds will not be there in the future. In this way this factor may be a relevant consideration, though it should not obscure the primary aim of correctly assessing the taxpayer 93. Where the taxpayer’s capacity to pay is an issue, it is recommended that the investigations team liaise with the C ollections unit to see whether they have any views on collection issues relating to the taxpayer. 94. Section 177C(3) of the TAA states that outstanding tax is not written off if a taxpayer is liable to pay abusive tax position (ATP) or evasion penalties. Even where ATP penalties are only proposed, clearing a tax debt with losses is something that the Commissioner would not consider is appropriate. 17 CLASSIFIED IN CONFIDENCE – INLAND REVENUE HIGHLY PROTECTED REVISION: JUNE 2016 95. The fact that the taxpayer is currently insolvent and not able to pay the tax could also be a relevant consideration if all other things were evenly balanced, but not otherwise. For example, certain cases on care and management, including Raynel v CIR (2004) 21 NZTC 18,583 or Clarke and Money v CIR (2005) 22 NZTC 19,260, clearly indicate that we are not required to cease recovery action just because the taxpayer may be insolvent, per Clarke and Money: In the exercise of his discretion under section 177 the defendant is fully entitled to consider a whole range of factors including the circumstances which led to the plaintiffs' taxation debts; the nature and extent of the plaintiffs' co- operation and negotiating stance; the speed with which they have provided requested information and the extent of that information; his obligations under section 6 and section 6A(3); and matters of consistency in administration. In those circumstances, there are solid care and management reasons for continuing to pursue a dispute or take recovery action in the face of serious non-compliance regardless of whether the taxpayer can pay. Inland Revenue has other powers with respect to debt. Summary 96. To summarise, where considering a “settlement” of a tax liability in a dispute, the starting point is that the law should be applied correctly and that we should seek to recover all of the tax which is due. R ecognising that we cannot do so in all cases, and where a dispute is commenced with the taxpayer these Guidelines provide: (a) a set of criteria which can be taken into account, depending on the particular case; and (b) some guiding principles as to how much weight should be applied to those criteria. 97. A proposal relating to the application of those criteria to the dispute in question needs to be set out in writing by the Investigations and Advice staff involved, and a decision made by a delegation holder with assistance from LTS (Critical Task Assurance at a high level) and potentially LMU (depending upon the stage at which the dispute has reached) or possibly Crown Law. 98. The decision to settle should always be measured against the impact it may have on voluntary compliance and the integrity of the tax system. While we seek a proportional and balanced outcome, by default the law should be applied, and Inland Revenue should be cautious in departing from the legal position. An y other approach can potentially undermine public perceptions about compliance and the integrity of the tax system. Graham Tubb Group Tax Counsel 18 CLASSIFIED IN CONFIDENCE – INLAND REVENUE HIGHLY PROTECTED REVISION: JUNE 2016 Attachment – Extract on Settlements from Interpretation Statement IS 10/07, October 2010 Settlements and agreements 151. The courts have held that, under section 6A(2) and (3), the Commissioner can enter into: (a) Settlements where taxpayers dispute the interpretation of law or facts on which their liability has been assessed (Accent Management Ltd v CIR (2006) 22 NZTC 19,758 (HC); Accent Management (No 2) v CIR (CA); Auckland Gas Co Ltd v CIR; and AG v Steelfort Engineering; Fairbrother v CIR). (b) Agreements as to the payment of outstanding tax, penalties and interest (Raynel v CIR). 152. The courts have explicitly held that the Commissioner can settle litigation on a basis that does not necessarily correspond to his view of the correct tax position if he considers that doing so is consistent with section 6A(3) and section 6: Accent Management Ltd (No 2) v CIR (CA); Foxley v CIR (2008) 23 NZTC 21,813. The courts have implicitly suggested that the Commissioner can give effect to settlements by way of an amended assessment, but it is not entirely clear whether this is done under section 6A(2) and (3), or only where authorised by another provision. However, it is clear that the Commissioner can amend an assessment under section 89C(d) to reflect the terms of a settlement: Accent Management Ltd (No 2) v CIR (CA). 153. That the Commissioner can settle litigation might seem inconsistent with the conclusion reached earlier that the Commissioner cannot alter taxpayers’ obligations and entitlements: see paragraphs 69–73 above. However, the courts have made clear that the Commissioner is not exercising any power to alter taxpayers’ obligations in entering settlements. The courts have held that settlements do not involve the Commissioner “assuming and exercising a power of dispensing with and suspending of laws, and the execution of laws, without consent of Parliament”: Accent Management Ltd v CIR (HC) at paragraph 74. 154. In taking this position, the courts have emphasised that settlements are made where the taxpayer’s obligations and entitlements are legitimately disputed and, therefore, the Commissioner will need to undertake litigation to collect the full amount of tax he considers owing. The courts have recognised that the Commissioner may consider, in light of the litigation risk, that the resource required could be better used elsewhere to maximise the net revenue collected. In Accent Management Ltd (No 2) v CIR (CA), William Young P held (at paragraph 15): This \[the Commissioner’s ability to enter settlements\] represents an undoubted shift from the approach adopted in \[Brierley Investments\]. The change in policy is justified by recognition that the Commissioner has limited resources and the function of collecting “over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law”. Major tax litigation is expensive and places a heavy strain on the human resources available to the Commissioner. The Commissioner must be permitted to make rational decisions as to how those resources can be best deployed. Further, “sensible litigation, including settlement, decisions” must necessarily allow for litigation risk. 19 CLASSIFIED IN CONFIDENCE – INLAND REVENUE HIGHLY PROTECTED REVISION: JUNE 2016 155. In holding that the Commissioner is authorised to enter settlements, the courts have given effect to a key outcome intended to be achieved by enacting section 6A(2) and (3). The ORC report shows that it was specifically contemplated that section 6A(2) and (3) would authorise the Commissioner to enter settlements (ORC report, section 8.2): One significant implication from the objective \[that the Commissioner will collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law\] is that IRD will be entitled to enter into compromised settlements with taxpayers, rather than pursue the full amount of assessed tax, in cases where there are legitimate differences of view about the facts in dispute and the costs of litigation are high. 156. The courts have not specifically considered whether the Commissioner can settle tax disputes before litigation or the formal disputes process has started. The Commissioner considers that, in principle, there is no impediment to him doing so. The Commissioner may consider that settling will enable his resources to be better used to maximise the net revenue collected. The Commissioner’s position and responsibilities before litigation or the formal disputes process has started are not inherently different to his position and responsibilities during litigation. However, the litigation processes often results in him possessing more information than he did before. Accordingly, the Commissioner will consider settling before litigation or the formal disputes process has started only if satisfied that he has sufficient information on which to make an informed decision. As with his other powers, the Commissioner will prescribe which officers have the delegated authority to decide whether to settle. 157. The case law is clear that the Commissioner can enter settlements with taxpayers if he considers doing so is consistent with section 6A(3) and section 6. It is not possible to list all the factors the Commissioner may consider in deciding whether to settle. Ultimately the decision must be determined by consideration of all factors relevant to the particular case. However, the following, non-exhaustive list identifies some of the factors the Commissioner could consider relevant (depending on the circumstances of the particular case): (a) the resources required to undertake litigation; (b) the alternative uses of those resources; (c) the amount of the tax liability at stake; (d) an assessment of the litigation risk (e.g., the likelihood of the Commissioner succeeding); (e) the implications of the Commissioner succeeding (in whole or part) if litigation is undertaken; (f) whether settling or litigating would better promote compliance, especially voluntary compliance, by all taxpayers; (g) the amount the taxpayer would pay if the Commissioner were to settle; (h) whether the subject matter of the dispute might be determinative of, or have broader application to, other situations; (i) whether the Commissioner would be prepared to settle on an equivalent basis with other taxpayers in a similar position; 20 CLASSIFIED IN CONFIDENCE – INLAND REVENUE HIGHLY PROTECTED REVISION: JUNE 2016 (j) the uncertainty in the tax system that might be created should the subject matter not be authoritatively determined by the courts; and (k) the likely effects on taxpayer perceptions of the integrity of the tax system of settling or litigating. 158. As already stated, the factors identified above are not exhaustive. Some of these factors may not be relevant and additional factors may be relevant given the circumstances of any particular case. It is for the Commissioner to decide on the appropriate weighting given to the relevant factors in a particular case. 159. Tax disputes sometimes involve several taxpayers. The Commissioner may need to decide whether to settle with each of the taxpayers individually. In such situations, the Commissioner is not required to settle, or to settle on the same terms, with all taxpayers involved in the litigation: Accent Management Ltd v CIR (HC), at paragraphs 79–86; and Accent Management Ltd v CIR (No 2) (CA), at paragraphs 20–22. However, the Commissioner will be aware that consistency of treatment for taxpayers with the same circumstances is an important consideration under section 6A(3) and section 6. Accordingly, in tax disputes involving several taxpayers, the Commissioner will generally settle on an equivalent basis with those taxpayers he considers share the same circumstances. By contrast, the Commissioner may settle on a different basis with those taxpayers he considers are in different circumstances. Different circumstances might include, for example, the taxpayer’s willingness to settle, the timing of the settlement offers in relation to the progress of the litigation proceedings, the state of the case law at the time, and the Commissioner’s perception of the culpability of the taxpayers involved: Accent Management Ltd v CIR (No 2) (CA) at paragraph 21. Because settlements reflect the circumstances of the particular litigation and of the taxpayers, they are not necessarily indicative of how the Commissioner will deal with similar issues in the future. 160. In deciding whether to settle litigation, the Commissioner will act consistently with the Protocol between the Solicitor-General and Commissioner of Inland Revenue, dated 29 July 2009 (available at the Crown Law Office website: http://www.crownlaw.govt.nz ). This means that the Commissioner will consult with the Solicitor-General, who is responsible for the conduct of Crown litigation; and that litigation settlements will be jointly approved by Crown Law and Inland Revenue (except where the settlements concern debt matters and summary prosecution in which Inland Revenue solicitors represent the Commissioner). The Commissioner may also consult the Solicitor-General before entering a pre- litigation settlement if the subject-matter is central to a significant dispute in litigation. 161. Finally, where the Commissioner has entered into a settlement or agreement, he will not resile from it except if: (a) the Commissioner is acting pursuant to a condition in the settlement or agreement that allows him to resile; (b) the taxpayer has failed to adhere to the settlement or agreement; or (c) the settlement or agreement was entered into on account of misrepresentations by the taxpayer, or the taxpayer failed to make full disclosure before the settlement or agreement was entered into. 21 CLASSIFIED IN CONFIDENCE – INLAND REVENUE HIGHLY PROTECTED REVISION: JUNE 2016

Shareholder continuity: Directors' knowledge provision
======================================================

Amendments have been made to the directors' knowledge provision under the shareholder continuity tax rules. Applies from 1 April 2005.

**_Section YC 15 of the Income Tax Act 2007; and section OD 8(5) of the Income Tax Act 2004_** 

Amendments have been made to the directors' knowledge provision under the shareholder continuity tax rules (section YC 15 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section OD 8(5) of the Income Tax Act 2004). The amendments exclude minor "off-market" transactions from the scope of the provision in order to provide more certainty and clarity when applying the provision.

### Background

The shareholder continuity and tracing rules govern the carry forward of tax losses and imputation credits to ensure that the benefits from these are enjoyed, in general, by the same persons who were shareholders when the benefits were incurred or derived. The standard tracing rules require tracing the ownership of shares in a company through to the ultimate natural person shareholders.

There are a number of concessions that simplify the standard tracing rules, in particular, with respect to listed companies. These concessionary rules are subject to section YC 15, under which shareholder continuity is deemed to be breached when the directors of a company know or could reasonably be expected to know, that the requirements of any continuity provision would not have been satisfied.

While there is uncertainty as to the interpretation of the current section, on its plain words, it seems that directors are presumed to be aware of all "off-market" transactions.

The frequency with which some minor "off-market" transactions occur (eg, employee share schemes) means that the application of section YC 15 may limit access to the tracing concessions for at least some listed companies. In such cases, the effect is that these companies may then be required to undertake full tracing, which may be onerous.

In addition, it is considered that, given section YC 15 is an anti-avoidance rule, when applying the provision, companies should only have to include in their continuity calculation those transactions which their directors would know of or which it is reasonable to expect the directors to know of. It is unlikely that company directors will have either actual or constructive knowledge of minor "off-market" transactions. Therefore, these transactions should not be taken into account in applying the section.

### Key features

Section YC 15 is amended to exclude from its scope minor "off-market" transactions, ie, share transactions occurring outside of a recognised stock exchange (examples are employee share schemes, dividend reinvestment plans and small private sales between shareholders).

More specifically, the Act amends section YC 15 to exclude the following transactions from its scope:

*   "off-market" transactions between less than 5 percent shareholders in a company in the income year; and
*   "off-market" transactions between a company and its shareholders which in aggregate are less than 5 percent of the shareholding in a company in the income year.

This is in order to remove current uncertainty about how the section should apply with respect to "off-market" transactions and to reduce compliance costs.

### Application date

The amendments apply retrospectively, for income years beginning on or after 1 April 2005.

### Detailed analysis

The rationale for excluding the above transactions is that, when applying the provision, companies should only have to include in their continuity calculation those transactions of which their directors have knowledge or of which it is reasonable for their directors to have knowledge. Furthermore, given that the purpose of the directors' knowledge provision is to target share transactions intended to take advantage of the tracing concessions, companies should not have to count minor transactions which are unlikely to be mischievous in nature.

Accordingly, in line with the existing approach under the directors' knowledge provision, on-market trading between minor shareholders should be excluded. This is consistent with the tracing concession under the shareholder continuity rules which provides that persons having a less than 10 percent direct interest in a company are treated as a "notional single person" - thereby preventing the need for companies to trace ownership changes in relation to their minor shareholders.

##### _New paragraph (iv)_

"Off-market" transactions between shareholders with less than 5 percent holdings, eg, small private sales, should be excluded because companies are unlikely to be aware of such transactions. The proposed 5 percent threshold aligns with the threshold that exists under securities law for triggering disclosure by shareholders of their interests in a New Zealand-listed company to that company. The 5 percent holding test applies both before and after any transaction (ie, the holding must be less than 5% both before and after the transaction).

##### _New paragraph (v)_

With respect to off-market trading where the company is a party, a de minimis of 5 percent is appropriate in order to exclude minor "off-market" transactions which are undertaken in the company's ordinary course of business, eg, employee share schemes and dividend reinvestment plans. This is measured on an income year basis (ie, pro rating of the 5 percent threshold is not required if the continuity period is less than an income year).

The wording is also intended to cover the common scenario under an employee share scheme where a company transfers shares to a trustee who holds the shares on trust for the benefit of company employees and then subsequently transfers the shares to those employees.

[All Income tax dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[Income tax])

You may be able to carry a loss forward if at least 49% of your company's voting shares do not change hands during the year the loss was made, as well as the year it'll offset income. This is the shareholder continuity test.

If you want to carry losses forward for several years in a row, you'll have to check shareholder continuity for each year.

If one of the shareholders of your company is another company, you may need to work out the voting interests of the people who own the shareholding company. You will not need to do this if your company has more than 24 non-associated shareholder or if the shareholding company holds less than 10% of your company.

Calculating voting interests
----------------------------

If your company has shares with different voting rights, you'll need to calculate each shareholders voting interests based on their shareholder decision making rights and the number of shares they have. There are 4 issues in which a shareholder may have decision making rights.

*   Dividends.
*   The constitution of the company.
*   A variation in the capital of the company.
*   The appointment of a director.

To work out the voting interests of each shareholder, you need to work out the percentage of the company's shares they hold which give them the right to vote on each of these four issues. Add these 4 values together and divide them by 4 to work out their total voting rights.

Example - Bike City Ltd

Bike City Ltd has 200 shares on issue. Tane holds 100 of shares that give him the right to vote in all decisions the company makes. Tane's mother, Aroha, holds 100 shares that only give her the right to vote on company decisions related to dividends.

Tane holds 50% of the shares which give a shareholder the right to vote on decisions related to dividends and 100% of the shares that allow them to vote on decisions related to the other three issues. Their voting interest is:

(50 + 100 + 100 + 100) ÷ 4 = 87.5%

Aroha holds 50% of the shares which give a shareholder the right to vote on decisions related to dividends and 0% of the shares for each other issue. Her voting interest is:

(50 + 0 + 0 + 0) ÷ 4 = 12.5%

Market value circumstances
--------------------------

The voting interest requirement of the shareholder continuity test does not apply if your company has a market value circumstance, such as:

*   the company having on issue a profit related or substituting debenture to which section FA 2 or FA 2B of the Income Tax Act 2007 applies
*   the company having on issue a share on which the payment of a dividend is guaranteed by another person
*   certain options over the company’s shares being on issue.

Instead, the company can only carry a loss forward if shares with a market value of at least 49% do not change hands during the continuity period.

Part-year loss offsets
----------------------

If a shareholding change occurs partway through a [tax year](/api/glossary/item?id={963329E3-7E3C-493A-9C3B-6EDA8DB83DDC})
, you may want to carry forward a loss in either, or both, of the following ways.

1.  You might choose to claim the loss from a previous year against the company income for the part of the tax year before the change.
2.  You may also want to carry forward a loss from after the change to a future tax year.

However, you cannot claim a loss from before the shareholding change against income earned after the change.

| The loss you're claiming | How to claim the loss in your Companies income tax return - IR4 |
| --- | --- |
| A loss carried forward from a previous year. | You can claim this loss against company income earned for the part of the year before the change in shareholding. |
| A loss from after the change in shareholding. | You can carry this loss forward to a future tax year. |

Providing adequate accounts for part-year loss offsets
------------------------------------------------------

For either or both these ways, you'll need to send us adequate accounts by uploading them as attachments with your Companies income tax return – IR4. They must show that a loss:

*   carried forward from a previous year is only being offset against income earned before the change in shareholding
*   to be carried forward to a future year only occurred after the change in shareholding.

As part of your attachments, you'll need to show us:

*   when the shareholding change occurred
*   the income and expenses that relate to the periods before and after the change.

Claiming losses
---------------

File a Companies income tax return – IR4 to either claim or carry forward losses or do both. These reduce a company’s income and the amount of tax it needs to pay.

To claim a loss for the tax year it happened in, make sure you write the correct amount under ‘Amount claimed this year’.

To carry forward a loss, you'll need to list the correct amount under 'Net loss to carry forward'. In the following year's IR4 tax return, this will be the loss brought forward.

Te tiaki ngātahi i tētahi tamaiti, i ētahi tamariki rānei Sharing care of a child or children
=============================================================================================

Recognised care is the amount of care a person provides for a child. It's taken into account in the [formula assessment](/api/glossary/item?id={685B102C-017F-44EE-BB14-BF34C28EE726})
.

A parent who provides care for a child at least 28% of the time can have this taken into account in the formula. A [parent](/api/glossary/item?id={4B4E9057-5321-4C5B-9F4E-3D13C76FAEE5})
 or [non-parent carer](/api/glossary/item?id={EF4ECDD5-93C8-4DA4-952F-11ABC20A7BAF})
 will only receive child support payments if they provide ongoing daily care for at least 35% of the time.

How recognised care works
-------------------------

We know that the more care you provide a child, the higher your costs will be. The child support formula uses a care cost percentage which includes the costs of raising children. 

### Allocating a care cost percentage to the amount of care provided

After the amount of ongoing daily care is determined, we use a care cost percentage to recognise the direct costs of providing care. The more care a parent provides a child, the higher their costs will be.

### Nights per year test

We generally work out care based on the number of nights per year a person cares for a child. If we decide that the nights test is not a true reflection of the amount of care provided, we will establish the amount of care based on the time a person is responsible for the daily care of the child.

*   28% is about 2 nights per week or 103 nights per year.
*   35% is about 5 nights per fortnight or 128 nights per year.

Parents who care for their child more than 65% of the time have a care cost percentage of at least 76%. When a parent's care cost percentage is 76% or more, they will not have to pay child support.

So it is possible to have a child support formula assessment where no one pays or receives child support. For example, when one parent has much higher income than the other, but also has at least 9 nights of care per fortnight.

[Work out how many nights per year a child is in my care](/child-support/types/formula-assessment/amount/nights-per-year-calculator)

### The care needs to be ongoing

We must establish whether a care arrangement is ongoing and not just for a short-term break, for example school holidays. This is important because the law requires a child's care be ongoing to be recognised for child support.

Each person should keep notes in a diary or calendar of when they care for a child in case there is a dispute over care in the future.

### Court orders or parenting agreements

If parents and carers cannot agree on the care details for a child, we can use a parenting agreement or order, unless there is good reason not to. If a parenting agreement or order is not in place, we will look at the situation and make a decision based on the information we have.

### When your care changes

Tell us if there's been an ongoing change to care arrangements for a child.

You can:

*   update the care details by completing the Change of circumstances section under 'More ...' in myIR.
*   call us, especially if the other parent is on the phone with you
*   Complete a Change of circumstances - ir116 form
*   send us a letter

We’ll confirm the change with the other parent and update your records. Your payments may change as a result.

If we cannot confirm the change with the other parent, or if they disagree, we may ask you for more information.

[Update my child support details](/child-support/managing/details/update)

[Child support - contact us](/contactus/child-support)

### Our Recognised care questionnaire

We may ask you to complete a Recognised care questionnaire  - IR120 to help us make a decision.

This form asks for information about the care you and the other parent provide.

Ngā wāhi noho rangitahi, mā ngā manuhiri hoki Short-stay and visitor accommodation
==================================================================================

Short-stay and visitor accommodation is when you're renting out your residential property to guests for up to 4 consecutive weeks at a time.

Examples of property rental online marketplaces are Airbnb, Bookabach and Holiday Homes.

Short-stay and visitor accommodation overview
---------------------------------------------

Your guests do not see your property as their main home.

Short-stay and visitor accommodation includes:

*   a room in your house
*   your whole house
*   another residential property – not your main home such as an investment property or a property you [intend to sell](/api/glossary/item?id={A3637F26-4574-4352-B0EB-9A273CC990AA})
    
*   a cottage, caravan or sleep-out on your property
*   a holiday home.

Short-stay and visitor accommodation does not include accommodation for residential tenants, boarders, or care home residents. It also does not include student or emergency accommodation.

Income tax obligations
----------------------

So that you can calculate your income and expenditure correctly you:

*   need to keep records of all income earned and declare it in your income tax return, subject to some limited income exemptions
*   need to keep records of expenses you can claim as deductions.

GST obligations
---------------

Your online marketplace will collect and pay GST on all short-stays rented through their platform.

For GST you must:

*   tell the online marketplace you're using your name, IRD number and GST registration status and if it changes
*   register for GST if you have earned or will earn more than $60,000 from all taxable activities including short-stay and visitor rental income in any 12-month period
*   keep all records of your income and expenses.

There are opt-out rules for large GST-registered accommodation owners. If you meet the criteria, you can be responsible for the GST obligations including collecting and paying GST and providing taxable supply information to customers.

[Opt out rules accommodation](/sharing-economy/online-marketplaces/gst-on-listed-services/opt-out-rules-accommodation)

If you're also renting out your accommodation directly to customers for example using your own website, the ordinary GST rules apply and you may have to pay GST on this income. 

Long-term accommodation provided through an online marketplace
--------------------------------------------------------------

There's no GST to pay on rental income from long-term residential renting. You also cannot claim GST on your long-term rental expenses.

This is generally the case if the accommodation is used by the customer as their home and comes under the Residential Tenancies Act 1986.

GST applies to all supplies of accommodation in a commercial dwelling, for example a hotel, motel, boarding house, or camping ground, regardless of the length of time the accommodation is provided for.

The rules that allow for a reduced rate of GST for accommodation provided for 4 weeks or more do not apply if the accommodation is supplied through an online marketplace.

When you get paid directly by guests
------------------------------------

When you receive payment directly from guests, the operator of the app or website may still be required to account for GST on the supply. This is the case when they are treated as an [online marketplace](/api/glossary/item?id={89DCEE22-82EC-4535-AE11-9873FDE8EE3C})
 and the supplier of the services.

The online marketplace may collect the GST they owe us from you directly.

When this occurs, the online marketplace may ask you for information so they can meet their GST obligations. This may include asking you for the amount paid and the date of the payment for the service. 

Listing short-stay and visitor accommodation using a property manager or agent
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You may use a listing intermediary who lists short-stay and visitor accommodation on an online marketplace on your behalf. Common examples are property managers and agents.

In certain circumstances the listing intermediary may collect and pay the GST on the accommodation (and any connected services) supplied through the marketplace.

The listing intermediary will administer the flat-rate credit scheme. You can read more about this.

[Drivers, deliverers and accommodation owners](/sharing-economy/sellers-of-listed-services/gst-for-listed-services)

Transitional rule for accommodation bookings made before 1 April
----------------------------------------------------------------

The transitional rule means online marketplaces and listing intermediaries (such as certain property managers) do not have to use the marketplace rules for short-stay accommodation booked before 1 April 2024.

If you are GST-registered and your online marketplace or listing intermediary lets you know they are using the transitional rule, you need to collect and pay GST on the relevant bookings under the normal rules.

If you are not GST-registered, you do not need to do anything. If your online marketplace or listing intermediary uses the transitional rule, you will not get any flat-rate credits for the relevant bookings.

Nga whiu takarepa Shortfall penalties
=====================================

We may charge you a shortfall penalty if you underpay your tax because your return is wrong, or if you don’t file a return you should have filed.

There are five types of shortfall penalty, each with its own penalty rate.

Reasonable care
---------------

Reasonable care is about making sure you meet your tax obligations. You need to have good recording systems to make sure income and spending are properly recorded. You need to make sure you’re giving any tax agents the right information. 

When deciding if you have not taken reasonable care, we consider:

*   the complexity of the law and transaction
*   the amount and seriousness of the shortfall
*   accidental errors
*   professional advice you received
*   the difficulty and expense of taking precautions against a shortfall occurring
*   your age, health and background.

If you’re a business customer, we’ll also consider:

*   the size and nature of the business
*   the internal controls in place
*   the business's record keeping practices
*   any systems failures.

The penalty for not taking reasonable care is 20% of the tax shortfall.

Unacceptable tax position
-------------------------

A tax position is a decision that you might make when filing a tax return. Tax positions are sometimes used to reduce or delay paying tax.

An ‘unacceptable’ tax position is a decision you've made that's more likely to be wrong than right. Unacceptable tax positions cannot be seriously considered by a court as being reasonable decisions.

A penalty will be charged when the tax shortfall:

*   resulted from a tax position that was more likely to be wrong than right
*   is in income tax
*   is more than both $50,000 and 1% of the taxpayer’s total tax figure for the relevant return period.

The penalty for an unacceptable tax position is 20% of the resulting tax shortfall.

Gross carelessness
------------------

In tax matters, ‘gross carelessness’ is when you've shown:

*   no care managing your tax
*   little or no thought to the consequences
*   unreasonable behaviour leading to a high risk tax shortfall.
*   The gross carelessness payment penalty is not based on whether you were careless on purpose or by accident.

The penalty for gross carelessness is 40% of the resulting tax shortfall.

Adopting an abusive tax position
--------------------------------

An abusive tax position is a tax position used for the main purpose of not paying tax. The penalty for abusive tax positions is 100% of the resulting tax shortfall.

If you promote, offer, sell or issue a tax arrangement to 10 or more investors in a tax year and it involves an abusive tax position, you will be liable for a promoter penalty.

The promoter penalty will be the sum of the tax shortfalls your investors could have obtained. This means that if the arrangement affects income tax, the promoter penalty is calculated on the maximum tax-related benefits of each investor at the rate of 39 cents in the dollar.

If a promoter is penalised, the penalty on the investors is reduced from 100% to 20%.

Tax evasion
-----------

Tax evasion may involve:

*   evading the assessment or payment of tax, on your own or another's behalf
*   using deducted or withheld tax for anything other than its lawful purpose
*   failing to make a legally required deduction or withholding tax
*   getting a refund or payment of tax that you know you are not entitled to
*   enabling someone else to get a refund or payment of tax you know they are not entitled to.

The penalty for evasion is 150% of the resulting shortfall.

In some cases, we would prosecute instead of asking you to pay the evasion shortfall penalty. This could mean imprisonment for up to five years and a fine of up to $50,000.

If you’re an employee acting on behalf of your employer, you would face a penalty if you:

*   fail to deduct or withhold tax for them
*   use tax for anything other than payment to Inland Revenue.

In practice, a senior employee who issues an order to do this may be held accountable.

Raising shortfall penalty amounts
---------------------------------

A shortfall penalty may be increased by 25% for obstructing an Inland Revenue officer. Obstruction may include:

*   refusing reasonable access to your business premises
*   destroying relevant records
*   lying and falsifying details
*   deliberate delays to frustrate enquiries.

There is also a criminal penalty for obstruction.

Ngā tohu mō tētahi tinihanga Signs of a scam
============================================

Here are some common signs of a scam.

| What scammers may do | Our approach |
| --- | --- |
| The scammer may be threatening. They may say you will be arrested immediately if you do not respond. | We would not use intimidating language or threaten you with sudden arrest. |
| The scammer may pressure you to make a decision quickly. | We would not pressure you to act immediately, without warning. |
| The scammer might demand money. They might want to be paid in unusual ways such as gift cards (for example iTunes cards), bitcoins or money transfer systems. | We will only ask for payment using our official methods.   <br>  <br>[Ways of paying](/managing-my-tax/make-a-payment/ways-of-paying) |
| The scammer might ask for passwords to your online accounts. | We will never ask for your password. |

Email and text scams
--------------------

We do not put refund amounts, or links to myIR in our emails or texts.

Scam emails may have links or come from email addresses that are wrong, but look almost right. For example ird.co.nz, ird.qovt.nz or ird.gov.nz. Our correct address is **ird.govt.nz**

To check a link, use your mouse to hover over it. The address will appear in a box or at the bottom of your screen. Make sure the link is correct before you click on it.

Phone scams
-----------

If you get a suspicious call from someone claiming to be from Inland Revenue, ask for their name and number. You can then contact us on one of the numbers listed on our website, to confirm the call you received was genuine.

[Contact us](/contactus)

Social media scams
------------------

Our only official social media accounts are on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. We also have a YouTube channel. 

Scammers may use fake versions of a social media account to try and contact you. They may pretend to be Inland Revenue staff. To check that a social media account is official:

*   **Look at the number of followers.** Fake social media accounts often show only a few followers. Our official Facebook account has over 79,000 followers, LinkedIn over 42,000 followers and Twitter more than 5,000 followers.
*   **Check the activity on the accounts****.** For example the number of posts or tweets made and how often they are made.
*   **See when the account was created.** Our Facebook account was created in 2013 and Twitter in 2011.

We will never ask for personal or financial information through social media posts. We do not use any type of direct messaging.

What we will not say
--------------------

Scam emails, texts or social media posts are often badly worded with a lot of spelling mistakes. We try to use language that is as clear as possible. We do not use terms like:

*   dear citizen
*   fiscal activity
*   excess payment
*   our department or Department of Taxes
*   NZ Govt Tax Refund
*   IRD Customer Portal or IRD Revenue portal. 

Stolen IRD number
-----------------

Although uncommon, fraudsters sometimes use another person's IRD number to claim tax refunds or tax credits. Some signs that someone else might be using your IRD number are:

*   The bank account or address in myIR Secure Online Services is not yours.
*   You have received a notice of assessment from us for a return you did not file.
*   A return you have not filed is showing as filed.

If you have a tax agent and think any of these may have happened to you, check with them to make sure they have not made any changes to your details. If your tax agent has not made the changes, or you're still unsure, find out what to do if you've been scammed.

Ngā tikanga whakamāmā mō ngā utu whakawhiti Simplification measures for transfer pricing
========================================================================================

Learn about our simplification measures aimed at reducing compliance costs in situations that are likely to present a low transfer pricing risk.

Reducing compliance costs 
--------------------------

New Zealand's transfer pricing rules have always been about striking a balance between protecting the tax base and containing compliance costs. We have implemented a range of simplification measures targeted at reducing compliance costs in situations that are likely to present a low transfer pricing risk.

Low value-adding intra-group services 
--------------------------------------

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has introduced an elective, simplified approach for pricing low value-adding intra-group services. We recognise that there are considerable benefits for taxpayers in aligning our practice with international standards. 

We have adopted this simplification measure for qualifying low value-adding intra-group services. We initially applied a threshold for this measure of $1 million.  The threshold requirement has been removed for income years commencing on or after 1 April 2021.

Qualifying services may be priced at cost plus a 5% mark-up without the need to provide benchmarking. Detailed guidance on the definition of low value-adding intra-group services, the internationally agreed simplified charging mechanism, and documentation expectations are contained in the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations 2022, Chapter VII Special Considerations for Intra-Group Services, Section D.

[Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations - OECD](https://www.oecd.org/tax/transfer-pricing/oecd-transfer-pricing-guidelines-for-multinational-enterprises-and-tax-administrations-20769717.htm)

In summary, qualifying services: 

*   are supportive in nature 
*   are not part of the core business activity of the multinational group 
*   do not involve unique and valuable intangibles, or the assumption or control of significant risk by the service provider.

The approach is not applicable where the services are also provided to unrelated customers.

We will periodically review the application threshold for this simplification measure.

For previous years, we applied an administrative practice for services described more fully in paragraphs 559, 561 and Table 8 of our October 2000 Transfer Pricing Guidelines (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 10 (October 2000), Appendix). The de minimis threshold for this administrative practice had been regularly reviewed and was increased from $600,000 to $1 million with application from 1 January 2015. This administrative practice does not apply for income years commencing on or after 1 July 2018.

Application of New Zealand's interest limitation rules to outbound loans
------------------------------------------------------------------------

New Zealand's interest limitation rules restrict interest deductions on cross-boarder related party borrowings by requiring certain related-party loans between a non-resident lender and a New Zealand-resident borrower to be priced using a restricted approach. Detailed guidance on the new approach is in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No 3 (April 2019).

[Tax Information Bulletin - Vol 31 No 3 - April 2019](https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/tib/volume-31---2019/tib-vol31-no3)

Where New Zealand-resident lenders correctly apply the restricted approach to set the interest rate on their loans to related non-resident borrowers, we will consider the result to be arm's length. This is on the basis that the amount deducted by the non-resident borrower in the foreign jurisdiction does not exceed the amount returned as income by the New Zealand-resident lender.

Small value loans
-----------------

For small value loans (that is, for cross-border associated party loans by groups of companies for up to $10 million principal in total), we currently consider 175 basis points (1.75%) over the relevant base indicator is broadly indicative of an arm's length rate, in the absence of a readily available market rate for a debt instrument with similar terms and risk characteristics.

Transactions priced in accordance with this simplification measure are likely to present a low transfer pricing risk and as such no further benchmarking is required. Our next review of interest rates for small value term loans is scheduled for 30 June 2025.

For previous years, indicative rates for small value term loans have been as follow.

| Previous years | Indicative rates |
| --- | --- |
| 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024 | *   1.75% on a maximum principal of $10 million. |
| 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2023 | *   2.5% on a maximum principal of $10 million. |
| 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2022 | *   3.75% on a maximum principal of $10 million. |
| 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2020 | *   3.25% on a maximum principal of $10 million. |
| 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2019 | *   3% on a maximum principal of $10 million. |
| 1 July 2015 to 30 June 2018 | *   2.5% on a maximum principal of $10 million. |
| 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015 | *   2% on a maximum principal of $10 million. |
| 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014 | *   2.75% on a maximum principal of $2 million. |

Small wholesale distributors 
-----------------------------

Foreign-owned wholesale distributors (that is, firms that purchase and on-sell goods to other firms without significant transformation) are the most common multinational business form encountered in New Zealand. We will continue to monitor the profitability of these firms. 

For foreign-owned wholesale distributors with an annual turnover of under $30 million, we currently consider a weighted average earnings-before-interest-tax-and-exceptional-items (EBITE) ratio of 3% or greater is broadly indicative of an arm's length outcome, in the absence of readily available transactional data for that distributor's transfer pricing transactions or other comparable market data for distributors operating with similar risk characteristics. 

Transfer pricing outcomes in accordance with this indicative ratio are likely to present a low transfer pricing risk and as such no benchmarking is required to support the arm's length nature of the distributor's weighted average EBITE ratio. 

We will periodically review this simplification measure.

### OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS - Simplified and Streamlined Approach for Baseline Distribution Activities

New Zealand has opted not to apply the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS’s simplified and streamlined approach to in-country baseline marketing and distribution activities – formerly referred to as Amount B. As such, its introduction does not change our current rules or practice. The existing simplification measure for small foreign-owned wholesale distributors remains available and existing transfer pricing rules apply in all other cases.

Simplifying tax obligations
===========================

**28 March 2018**

Legislation designed to simplify interactions with the tax system has passed its third reading in Parliament and now awaits Royal Assent.

Revenue Minister Stuart Nash says the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Bill sets the annual rates of tax for the 2017-18 tax year and implements four broad policy changes. It will:

*   Reform the administration of PAYE (wage and salary deductions) to require employers to provide more timely information to IRD
*   Reform the way banks and other institutions provide information to IRD about investment income
*   Modernise the taxation of employee share schemes  
*   Extend the bright line test on residential investment properties from two years to five years.

“This is a bill which benefits ordinary New Zealanders. In designing these measures, we were careful to take into account people’s unique circumstances,” Revenue Minister Stuart Nash says.

“The bill provides better income information to give more accurate Working for Families entitlements and it will also reduce the number of people getting into debt. The bill achieves this by providing Inland Revenue with accurate and more timely information from the payers of employment and investment income. 

“The other major aspect of this bill is to modernise and strengthen the tax rules relating to employee share schemes. We want to make sure that the tax treatment of employee share schemes is broadly similar to the tax treatment of other forms of remuneration.

The extension of the previous government’s bright-line test from two years to five years will help dampen property speculation and make homes more affordable. The extension means that profits from residential investment properties which are bought and sold within five years will generally be taxable. 

“This proposal will ensure that residential property speculators pay income tax on their gains and makes property speculation less attractive. We need investment which grows the economy and creates jobs, not the sort of investment which distorts the residential housing market. This measure will bring fairness back into the tax system,” Mr Nash said.

Frequently asked question
-------------------------

### Dates of application

#### Question:

What is the date of application for the double tax agreement (DTA) for Singapore?

#### Answer:

The DTA entered into force on 12 August 2010. According to the entry into force formulation at paragraph 1(b) of Article 25 of the DTA, the provisions of the DTA will therefore apply in Singapore in respect of tax chargeable for any year of assessment beginning on or after 1 January 2012 (that is, year of assessment 2012, and later years of assessment).

However, understanding what this means in practice requires an understanding of how tax is imposed in Singapore.

The following links to the website of the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore \[Individuals: [http://www.iras.gov.sg/irasHome/page.aspx?id=1526](https://www.iras.gov.sg/IRASHome/Individuals/Locals/)\
; Companies: [http://www.iras.gov.sg/irasHome/page04.aspx?id=1392](https://www.iras.gov.sg/IRASHome/Businesses/Companies/)\
\] clarify that, in Singapore, income tax is assessed on a preceding year basis.

This suggests that the provisions of the DTA will apply in Singapore to income earned during calendar years beginning on or after 1 January 2011 (or, for companies with a financial year that does not coincide with the calendar year, during any financial year ending in 2011) and thereafter. For withholding tax rates on dividends, interest and royalties, New Zealand Inland Revenue understands that the provisions of the DTA will apply in Singapore to income earned from 1 January 2011.

As New Zealand Inland Revenue cannot provide advice on the tax systems of other jurisdictions, any questions on this matter should be referred to the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore.

Ngā hinonga iti, wawaenga hoki Small and medium enterprises research and evaluation
===================================================================================

To better understand the tax compliance costs of small and medium enterprises (SME), we have undertaken research designed to produce a vast array of compliance cost-related information.

Small and medium enterprises compliance cost reports
----------------------------------------------------

### 2021 SME tax compliance cost report

The 2021 SME tax compliance cost report outlines the results from a survey of 14,063 small business done in April to June 2021.

A significant change to the tax system occurred when payday filing became mandatory for all employers in April 2019. There has been some increase in compliance times since 2018 but overall, annual compliance time is lower than 2013. While the COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative effect on cashflow and trading conditions for some, most small businesses believe the ease of meeting their tax responsibilities is the same as a year ago and the time involved is acceptable.

Improvements to the digital experience when dealing with Inland Revenue are continuing to be noticed and match the trend of more businesses adopting software and online services that support their business operations.

### 2018 SME tax compliance cost report

The 2018 SME tax compliance cost report outlines the results from a survey of 6,003 small business done in September to October 2018. It shows the amount of time that small businesses spend on their taxes is the same as 2016, but costs have risen. Stress is a little higher and some businesses are struggling with changes to regulations or processes, but many are finding improvements made to Inland Revenue’s website and digital services are making things easier.

### 2016 SME tax compliance cost report

This report outlines the results from a survey of 4,028 small businesses about the time and cost of doing business taxes.

### 2014 SME tax compliance cost report

This report outlines the results of a qualitative study that was undertaken with small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to identify practical ideas that would help reduce their effort and stress in dealing with Inland Revenue.

### 2013 SME tax compliance cost report

This report outlines the results from a survey of 1,206 small business done between November 2013 and January 2014.

### 2004 SME tax compliance cost report

This report compares the results of the 2013 survey with the 2004 survey of small business compliance costs.

Small business support expanded
===============================

**18 December 2020**

• Eligibility criteria broadened to include new businesses

• SMEs able to draw down loans more than once

• Milestone reached as 100,000 SMEs tap into cheap working capital

More small businesses will be eligible to take out interest-free loans under changes announced today to a government cashflow scheme.

Revenue Minister David Parker said one of the Government’s top economic priorities after taking office was to extend the Small Business Cashflow Loan scheme for three years and extend the interest-free period to two years.

“We have extended the purpose of the scheme and will enable borrowing for investment in new equipment and digital infrastructure,” David Parker said.

“In addition, firms can draw down a second loan, if they still meet eligibility criteria and have repaid the original loan in full. We want to keep viable businesses afloat where we can.

“Some firms have promptly repaid their original loan and may wish to draw down another loan as circumstances change. More businesses will have access to this line of credit to help them prosper.

“There are encouraging signs for our economy, but the global economic outlook remains uncertain. The scheme provides a backstop for small and medium businesses. The changes deliver on our election commitments,” David Parker said.

Small Business Minister Stuart Nash says cashflow support for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) has been central to government efforts to accelerate the economic recovery and sustain businesses and jobs.

“The interest-free loans have proven a popular and fast way to access finance. We are delighted to reach a milestone of 100,000 SMEs who have drawn on this government support to the tune of $1.6 billion.

“Many businesses have also repaid their loans as the economy continues to open up. Around 6,500 SMEs have so far made more than $45.4 million in repayments.

“As the economy moves into recovery and rebuild we are also broadening the eligibility criteria so more businesses can access support. Businesses established after 1 April 2020, which have existed for six months, will now be eligible for a loan if they meet other eligibility criteria.

“We are also changing the requirement that a business must have experienced a decline in actual or predicted revenue of at least 30 per cent in any 30-day period from January to June 2020, compared with the same period in the previous year.

“The new criteria are that businesses can demonstrate an actual drop in revenue of at least 30 per cent because of COVID-19, over any 14-day period in the previous six months, compared with the same 14-day period a year ago.

“If the applicant was not in business a year ago, the 14-day period can be compared with the same or similar period in the previous month. Businesses must also declare that the drop in revenue is due to COVID-19, and have records to support this.

“I’m particularly pleased that micro businesses, with between one and five staff, have made good use of the scheme. Around 82 per cent of loans are to firms with one to five employees. Around 92 percent of loans are to firms with 10 or fewer staff.

“The firms are diverse. Most loans have gone to SMEs in construction and building (17%), accommodation, restaurants and cafes (12%), those offering professional, scientific or technical services (10%), retail trade (9%), and manufacturing (7%).

“The decision to extend the interest-free loan scheme is designed to give confidence to our smallest businesses and keep up the momentum of recovery. The Government is continuing to back the business community,” Stuart Nash said.

The expanded eligibility criteria come into effect in February 2021.

Small businesses urged not to delay loan application
====================================================

**21 May 2020**

Inland Revenue is urging small businesses, looking at applying for the Small Business Cashflow scheme, to do so quickly.

Inland Revenue administers the Government’s Small Business Cashflow scheme, handling loan applications, payment and repayments. The scheme has just 22 days to run until it stops on 12 June.

Inland Revenue spokesman Richard Philp says 47,318 businesses have already applied for the loans for small businesses struggling with loss of revenue due to COVID-19.

“The Small Business Cashflow \[Loans\] Scheme  was successfully set up and implemented quickly. Applications opened on 12 May and in the first ten days Inland Revenue received and approved 45,290 (97 per cent),” Richard Philp says.  
   
“That’s $784.9m in loans out the door, usually within a couple of days of being received and verified. 88 per cent of those loan applications were from people who also received the wage subsidy.  
   
“It’s been done almost exclusively online with 99.8 per cent of all applications successfully made through Inland Revenue’s secure online service, myIR.  
   
“Typically, it’s been very small businesses applying for the Scheme. 46 per cent of approved loans applicants have between 2 and 10 employees.  And 43 per cent are sole traders with the business owner the only person working in the business.  
   
"The Scheme ends on June 12, so it only has around three more weeks left to run. My advice is that any businesses wanting to apply for a loan should check out what information and documentation they need to apply, gather it together and apply online.  
   
“Otherwise, they’ll run out of time,” Richard Philp says.

It’s essential that people fully understand the loan terms and conditions as set out in the loan contract which are available on IR’s website [www.ird.govt.nz/covid-19](https://www.ird.govt.nz/covid-19)
.

“If there is information missing, that could be a reason for declining a loan application”, Richard Philp says.  
   
“Also, if there are any facts or circumstances which have not been disclosed that make any information untrue, inaccurate or misleading, then this could cause a loan to default.  A defaulted loan must be repaid immediately.

“The scheme has been developed and implemented by IR staff working from their dining room tables or temporary home offices. And they’ve briefed tax agents and accountants about it while working from home. I’m very proud of the work they’ve done."

To be eligible for a loan, a business or organisation must have 50 or fewer full-time-equivalent employees and be eligible for the Wage Subsidy Scheme even if they have not applied for the subsidy.  The business must also have a sound plan to be viable and ongoing, and it must hold information on file to verify this.

In most cases, businesses will be entitled to a loan amount of $10,000 plus $1,800 per full-time-equivalent employee, to a maximum of $100,000. Currently, the average loan amount approved is $17,331.22.

The loan has a five-year term and must be repaid by 31 July 2025. Businesses should speak with their financial advisors before applying.

The XSD schema structure for gateway services are:

*   Common.xsd
*   ServiceCommon.xsd
*   SpecificProduct.xsd

All schemas for different services import a common.xsd which has some data types specific to Inland Revenue.

This common.xsd will be used in other gateway services outside of the //namespace and must be kept up to date.

You can view and download the operations, schemas and data definitions for each service in our services catalogue.

[Services catalogue](/digital-service-providers/services-catalogue)

SOAP messages structure
-----------------------

All messages require a header containing the **Action:** parameter. The body must contain a structured XML payload.

Refer to the WSDL for the correct addresses. Refer to samples or the WSDL element wsdl:binding/soap12:operation/soapAction for the URL to use.

The online WSDLs for gateway services define an 'any' XML request and response structure, which then relies on a group of XSDs to define the data structure of those requests and responses.

Each request and response type will define a lower, 'wrapper' element. To simplify analysis and code generation, a development-oriented version of the WSDL and XSDs is provided with the build pack that has the 'any' elements replaced with relevant types.

Schema (XSD) validations
------------------------

When you send structured XML through gateway this will be checked against our published XSDs.

This is partially a late binding validation, performed after an authentication review. The message structure of these services is a simple request/response.

The XML request will be checked for well-formed XML before the schema validation. Responses to these requests will be in XML format and defined by the same schemas as requests.

Any XML submissions in the body that do not match the provided schemas will not be accepted. Incorrect namespaces will also fail validation against the published schemas.

Any malformed XML will instantly be rejected before any schema validation.

Solicitor's undertaking
=======================

2006 case note - Court upheld decision that taxpayer breached undertaking and the compensation amount upheld - solicitor's undertaking, abuse of process.

Case

Manu Chhotubhai Bhanabhai & Douglas Mark Andrew Burgess v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

GST Act 1985

### Summary

The Court of Appeal upheld the High Court decision that Mr Bhanabhai had breached the undertaking given and the amount of the compensation awarded was upheld.

### Facts

The defendants were barristers and solicitors acting for two companies, Nautilus Developments Limited ("NDL") and Golden Gate Holdings Limited ("GGH"). The companies were group registered for GST purposes under Nautilus. Both companies were involved in a construction project of a block of residential apartments in Hobson Street, Auckland.

The companies accounted for GST output tax on the erroneous understanding that it was payable only when sales were settled. On 17 April 1997 the matter was finally resolved between the parties and it was agreed that GST would be payable on settlement in respect of the units with contracts entered into prior to July 1996, a concession on the part of the Commissioner. GST on agreements after July 1996 was to be accounted for on the basis of the normal time of supply rules, being the receipt of the deposit (July 1996 being the date on which the company had received a letter outlining an original proposal for agreement).

As a result of the agreement being reached a GST refund was due to NDL. However, to ensure that GST payments in respect of the pre-July 1996 contracts were actually paid on settlement an undertaking was required to be given by the defendants, and it was given, signed by Mr Bhanabhai. The undertaking given on 17 April 1997 was written in the following terms:

> "We are the solicitors for Golden Gate Holdings Ltd. We have been instructed to settle the sale of the units in the development and we undertake that on settlement of units 3F, 5A, B, C, D, E, F, 6A, B, C, D, E and F, we will forthwith pay to you the GST component of the sale consideration."

The arrangements made on 17 April were supplemented by further arrangements made in a meeting on 21 April between Mr Cunningham and Mr Davison and confirmed by correspondence on the same day between Mr Cunningham and the accountant.

UDC was the principal lender to the development. On 9 June 1998 s92 Property Law Act Notices were served calling up the mortgage. On 9 June 1999 UDC had not enforced the Notices and Parkhurst Investments Limited (the defendant being a director and shareholder) took over the securities. On 10 June 1999 GGH went into liquidation, NDL already being liquidated in September 1998.

The liquidator, Mr Montgomerie, issued proceedings against the Directors of NDL seeking to recover over $2 million on behalf of the unsecured creditors, including over $1 million claimed by the Commissioner. This proceeding was later settled for $500,000. The settlement monies were sufficient only to cover the liquidator's costs and no dividends were paid to the creditors.

The undertaking of 17 April 1997 was not met and the Commissioner sought an order that the defendants pay the GST which it undertook to pay or damages for the equivalent sum.

### Decision

In the High Court, Laurenson J found for the Commissioner and the amount of $300,000 was awarded. This reflected the contribution already made by Mr Bhanabhai towards the liquidator's settlement. Costs and interest were also awarded to the Commissioner.

The case was appealed by Mr Bhanabhai and the Commissioner cross-appealed on the amount of costs awarded.

The appeal raised the following issues:

1.  Was the undertaking given by Mr Bhanabhai personally or on behalf of the developers?
2.  If given personally, did the undertaking apply if UDC insisted on (and was entitled to) all proceeds of sale or to settlements not effected through the firm?
3.  If given personally, was the undertaking overtaken by subsequent events?
4.  Should the Judge in the High Court have granted relief to the Commissioner on orthodox principles associated with undertakings?
5.  Is the claim by the Commissioner an abuse of process given the settlement of the proceedings brought earlier by the liquidator?

With regard to (a), the Court of Appeal was not minded to interfere with the factual findings made by Laurenson J. They read it also as an undertaking by the firm as if it was on behalf of the developers there was no reason for it to be given by the solicitors.

With regard to (b), the Court concluded that if Mr Bhanabhai was not prepared to ensure that he was in a position to give effect to the undertaking, or to accept the consequences of not being able to do so, then he should not have given the undertaking. Mr Bhanabhai was in a far better position than Mr Cunningham, both to recognise the practical contingencies which might affect his ability to give effect to the undertaking and to assess the risk that those contingencies might crystallise. Mr Bhanabhai was in a position at least to influence the timing of the settlements.

With regard to (c) the Court held that there was nothing in the latter arrangements made on 21 April which impugns the continuing effectiveness of the undertaking. The arrangements entered into on 21 April were primarily addressed to units which were not the subject of the 17 April undertaking.

With regard to (d) the Court held that the undertaking was unconditional and the firm simply failed to honour it. The undertaking was relied on by the Commissioner and should be enforced.

With regard to (e) the Court held that the claim on the undertaking was not an abuse of process for the reasons that the liquidator in the first proceedings was acting independently and settlement was not assented to by the Commissioner. The claim by the liquidator was different to that of the Commissioner conceptually. The liquidator was seeking relief based on the contention that the directors had breached their duties to the company whereas the Commissioner's claim is that Mr Bhanabhai incurred a direct responsibility to the Commissioner in respect of the undertaking.

With regard to (f) the Court saw no basis to interfere with the discretionary determination of the Judge in awarding costs on a 2B scale.

Sort student loan repayments before heading overseas
====================================================

**27 October 2022**

With New Zealand’s borders open again it’s no surprise an estimated tens of thousands of young Kiwis are planning a move overseas.

For many young people, this is an opportunity to use their newly-earned skills and qualifications on the world stage. To live away from family, and to see the world. It’s also a time of increased responsibility and some home-related pressures remain including repaying a student loan.

The result of not managing student loans can impact borrowers in real ways when they return to New Zealand, and that’s why knowing about the obligations and planning ahead is so important.

Once someone is away from New Zealand long enough to be considered ‘overseas-based’, the student loan changes from something that happens in the background to something that requires active management.

The change to being considered ‘overseas-based’ depends on how long a borrower is outside New Zealand -fewer than 153 days is considered ‘New Zealand-based’. Away more than 184 days, and it’s ‘overseas-based’. There’s an ‘Overseas travel calculator’ available in myIR.

When a borrower becomes overseas-based, student loan payments are no longer taken from salary or wages and borrowers have to make the payments themselves. This means finding a [payment method](https://www.ird.govt.nz/managing-my-tax/make-a-payment/ways-of-paying/paying-from-overseas)
 that works best for their situation and ensures the payments are made on time.

The amount owed each year is based on the size of the loan, not what someone earns, so the loan repayments are a set amount. Each year there are [two repayment dates](https://www.ird.govt.nz/student-loans/living-overseas-with-a-student-loan/repaying-my-student-loan-when-i-live-overseas)
 - 30 September and 31 March. People can pay fortnightly or monthly, likely saving interest and help paying off the loan faster 

Interest will now be applied to student loans from the day after someone leaves New Zealand. This interest is applied at a rate of 2.8%. Interest is calculated daily and added to the loan balance at the end of the tax year. Late payment interest applied to the overdue amount is 6.8% (made up of 2.8% base interest and 4% penalty interest).

However, in some cases, the student loan can remain [interest-free](https://www.ird.govt.nz/student-loans/moving-overseas-or-returning-to-new-zealand/i-am-moving-overseas/can-i-keep-my-student-loan-interest-free-overseas)
, depending on the reason a borrower is overseas.

There is the option of a ‘[temporary repayment suspension’](https://www.ird.govt.nz/student-loans/moving-overseas-or-returning-to-new-zealand/i-am-moving-overseas/temporary-repayment-suspension-for-student-loans)
 if people want to take a break from repayments. IR needs to know either before someone leaves New Zealand or within 6 months of leaving.  During a temporary repayment suspension, interest is still charged to your loan (2.8%), but repayments are not required.

Tips for people to stay on top of student loan obligations:

*   **Register for a myIR and set up notifications to stay in touch with IR while overseas**
*   **Set up small, regular repayments**
*   **Let IR know sooner than later if there’s an issue paying on time.**
*   [**Nominate someone**](https://www.ird.govt.nz/managing-my-tax/getting-someone-to-act-on-my-behalf/nominated-person/let-someone-act-on-your-behalf)
     **in New Zealand to manage the loan.**

Sovereign's appeal dismissed by the Court of Appeal
===================================================

2013 case note - Court of Appeal dismissed Sovereign's appeal of income tax assessments for the 2000–06 income years - accrual rules, capital/revenue distinction.

Case

Sovereign Assurance Company Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994

### Summary

The Court of Appeal dismissed Sovereign Assurance Company Limited's ("Sovereign") appeal of its income tax assessments for the 2000–06 income years. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") reassessed Sovereign in accordance with the accrual regime on the basis that the refundable commission transactions under the treaties were a financial arrangement pursuant to subpart EH of the Income Tax Act 1994 ("the Act").

### Impact of decision

This decision reinforces the Court's acceptance of the primacy of the accrual rules over other provisions in the Income Tax Acts. It also provides (obiter) discussion on the capital/revenue distinction by the Court of Appeal.

### Facts

This appeal relates to the tax treatment of cash flows arising under certain reinsurance treaties entered into between Sovereign and a number of German reinsurance companies. By agreement, the treaty between Gerling-Konzern Glonale ("Gerling") and Sovereign was accepted as being representative of the treaties with the other German reinsurance companies (Hanover Re and Cologne Re ).

The treaties provided for two money flows between Sovereign and Gerling:

1.  a premium paid by Sovereign to Gerling to reinsure a defined portion of the life insurance policies issued by Sovereign. In return, Gerling assumed liability to make payment of a defined portion of any claim that was subsequently made (referred to as the "mortality risk"); and
2.  the commission paid by Gerling to Sovereign (quantified as a multiple of the initial premium received by Sovereign on new policies).

Sovereign then made "commission repayments" to Gerling, in defined portions, out of subsequent years premiums for as long as those policies remained in force. Sovereign was not required to pay these "refundable commissions" if any individual policy lapsed. (This description of the money flows was that used by the Commissioner and the Courts rather than by Sovereign and the German Reinsurers themselves, see \[72\].) However, there were overall arrangements between Sovereign and Gerling as moderated by a bonus account. The bonus account kept track of total money flows in both directions with an ultimate purpose of enabling the calculation of any profit share to which Sovereign would become entitled if the bonus account went into credit after the reinsurer was fully repaid.

Sovereign accounted for those money flows by returning the refundable commissions as assessable income when they were received from Gerling and then deducting the commission repayments (being the base component received from Gerling plus the interest component) as a deductible expense when paid to Gerling. Sovereign's position was that the money flows were components of a contract of insurance that could not be "unbundled" and in their entirety were an excepted financial arrangement.

The Commissioner had reassessed Sovereign in accordance with the accrual regime on the basis that the refundable commission transactions under the treaties were a financial arrangement pursuant to the Act.

In the High Court, Dobson J agreed with the Commissioner that these four flows of money under the treaties could be "unbundled" for tax purposes and it was only the tax treatment of the flows of money attributable to the refundable commission payments and commission repayments that were the subject of the appeal.

In the High Court, Dobson J upheld the Commissioner's assessments on the basis that the refundable commission payments and repayments between Sovereign and Gerling constituted a financial arrangement for the purposes of the accrual rules and were taxable in accordance with subpart EH of the Act. The deduction of the interest component was spread over the life of the arrangement. Accordingly, the refundable commission payments received by Sovereign from the German reinsurers were not accessible income and the commission repayments were not deductible expenses as returned by Sovereign in the 2000–06 income years.

On appeal, Sovereign argued that the transaction fell within section EH 10(2) of the Act so that the accrual rules did not apply (this was an argument that the base component of the transaction was attributable to a sale of property). Sovereign argued that the refundable commissions received were income earned by "sales of cash flows" from ceding the persistency risk (the risk that new life insurance contracts would be cancelled by the insured before the costs incurred in writing a new policy were recouped) to the German reinsurers. Sovereign further argued that, while there was a financing element to the treaties, they were not loans because the treaties did not provide a requirement for the commissions to be repaid. Sovereign argued there was merely an "expectation" to make the repayment of the refundable commissions. Therefore, in Sovereign's submission, the refundable commissions were not a "debt or debt instrument" for the purposes of the accrual rules (as per the definition of financial arrangement in EH 14 of the Act).

The Commissioner argued that the refundable commissions were subject to the accrual rules and that only the interest component was deductible (and spread).

### Decision

Harrison J (also giving the reasons of Miller J as White J gave his own reasoning) dismissed Sovereign's appeal and upheld the Commissioner's assessment. At \[48\]:

*   We agree with Mr Goddard. In this Court, as in the High Court, Mr McKay accepts that the commission transactions fell within the broad definition of a financial arrangement. The financing component of the treaty was an arrangement whereby Sovereign obtained money from Gerling (the commission payments) in consideration for promising to pay money in the future (the commission repayments). This element of deferred consideration is central to the rules. So, too, is the regime's inherent dilution of the orthodox distinction between capital and revenue, ensuring a neutral tax treatment regardless of form. The focus is on the economic effect of the transaction - in this case the commissions and other repayments.

Harrison J then went on to discuss (from \[61\] onwards) the legal nature of the base component and the principles and case law relevant to the capital/revenue distinction. His Honour concluded that the refundable commission payments were not derived as income and that the repayment of the base component of the commission repayment was not incurred in deriving income. His Honour stated, at \[125\], that the legal character of the commission arrangements was that of a loan.

White J agreed with the majority's decision that the Commissioner's application of the accrual rules was correct. He stated, at \[130\], that in his view, it was not necessary to address Sovereign's submissions on the basis that the accrual rules did not apply.
