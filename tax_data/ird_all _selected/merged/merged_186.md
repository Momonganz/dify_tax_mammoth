Our roadmap for creating change
===============================

The focus areas below work together to meet our representation goals, and cannot be looked at in isolation. Attracting more Māori to Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake means there's an accountability to ensure the environment is supportive of Māori to be Māori and able to bring their full selves to work, and to supporting their career and development. Many of the actions that were initiated over previous years are now being embedded, are part of business as usual, or are part of a continuous cycle of improvement. These actions are not captured as part of this roadmap, which sets out new actions or actions yet to be completed.

Attraction and recruitment
--------------------------

This focus includes actions that contribute to increasing the overall representation of Māori at Inland Revenue Te Tari Taake. Insights can improve our processes to attract more Māori to want to work here. Leveraging multiple different sources and partners to source Māori candidates with the capability we need can create awareness of our organisation as an employer. Attracting more Māori to a range of roles – not specifically ‘Māori roles’ will support a positive shift in representation.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |Attraction and recruitment
| Focus area | Detail | Milestones |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Targeted recruitment**  <br>Recruitment sourcing targets Māori talent and hiring leaders and our Talent Acquisition team are having deliberate conversations about the type of capability they need, including cultural capability. | *   Leverage job boards, talent pools and non-traditional sourcing channels to encourage more Māori talent to apply for a range of roles, not just ‘Māori’ specific roles.<br>*   Explore partnerships with external agencies to attract more Māori.<br>*   Explore mechanisms to target recruitment for technical and leadership roles, aligning to our representation goals.<br>*   Continue to have pathways for graduates and explore other opportunities for Māori that are early in career. | **Q2 2025**  <br>Targeted recruitment approach/approaches. |
| **Cultural capability in Talent Acquisition  <br>**Talent Acquisition team are confident having proactive conversations about sourcing with hiring managers and are able to influence leaders to consider broader capability (including Māori) when hiring externally. | *   Grow the Talent Acquisition team's cultural capability and understanding of Te Ao Māori.<br>*   Work with hiring managers and panel members to ensure they have an understanding and knowledge of Te Ao Māori to provide a positive experience for Māori candidates. |     |

Career and development
----------------------

This focus supports the development of our internal people, through active partnership and working together, ensuring that our practices and processes like Whanake and learning assist Māori to achieve career goals. Supporting non-Māori to grow their Māori cultural capability creates a supportive environment for Māori. Improving our talent management processes increases how visible Māori talent is for career advancement. Over time, this focus supports our representation goals to increase Māori in technical and leadership roles.

The actions listed below are specific targeted examples that relate to Māori and/or underrepresented communities in general. Our enduring approach to supporting the development of our people, includes a focus on supporting leaders to develop their skills to lead diverse teams.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |Career and development
| Focus area | Detail | Milestones |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Workforce development system**  <br>From individual performance and development conversations (Whanake) through to broader talent conversations - Māori are visible and supported to achieve career goals and outcomes in a way that works for them as Māori. | *   Create talent management tools that create more visibility of Māori talent.<br>*   Leaders and leadership teams are having purposeful conversations about Māori talent. |     |
| **Development opportunities  <br>**Leverage development programmes that support our focus to increase Māori in our leadership pipeline alongside other equitable development opportunities. | *   Work with Māori to promote and increase the visibility and requirements of existing programmes, making it easier to apply.<br>*   Review the wrap-around support and approach to enable people to plan and prepare alongside their leaders.<br>*   Conduct a scan of the external offerings and ensure that we are maximising the opportunities for Māori to develop. |     |

| **Tuakana-Teina  <br>** | *   Whānau Māori have a kaupapa as part of their moemoeā. |     |

Leadership and the role of people leaders
-----------------------------------------

This focus brings together actions that specifically relate to how people leaders should support their people, with the wider focus on leadership as a capability. Leaders are crucial to how we recruit and develop Māori and support careers. They role model inclusive practices and behaviours and can influence change across the organisation.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |Leadership and the role of people leaders

Our wider working environment
-----------------------------

This focus brings together actions that create an environment that supports and enables Māori. Working towards becoming a te Tiriti-based organisation and incorporating te ao Māori into our wider working environment supports Māori to want to work here and stay.

Services for Customers (2023)
=============================

The overarching purpose of this appropriation is to deliver a customer-centric, integrated tax and entitlement service experience for New Zealanders that is agile and intelligence-led.

28/35 targets achieved.

Services for Customers is a multi-category appropriation with 5 categories:

*   Services to Ministers and to Inform the Public about Entitlements and Meeting Obligations
*   Services to Process Obligations and Entitlements
*   Management of Debt and Unfiled Returns
*   Investigations
*   Policy Advice.

What we intend to achieve
-------------------------

This appropriation is intended to ensure customers find it easy to meet their tax and social policy obligations and receive the payments they’re entitled to.

We start this section with our overall results for this appropriation and present the results for each of the 5 categories:

[Services to Ministers and to Inform the Public About Entitlements and Meeting Obligations](/about-us/publications/annual-corporate-reports/annual-report/annual-report-2023/our-performance/our-services/our-services-for-customers/services-to-ministers-and-to-inform-the-public-about-entitlements-and-meeting-obligations)

[Policy advice](/about-us/publications/annual-corporate-reports/annual-report/annual-report-2023/our-performance/our-services/our-services-for-customers/policy-advice)

How we performed
----------------

This year, we focused on supporting customers who were adversely affected by the weather events and economic conditions while ensuring we upheld the integrity of the tax and social policy system. We had to make some tough trade-off decisions, reducing some non-automated compliance activities while keeping a focus on high-risk compliance areas.

Most customers want to do the right thing. This is reflected in the high proportion of customers who file returns on time, with levels increasing to 96.2% in 2022–23. However, the recent weather events and the economic climate have impacted customers’ ability to pay in full and on-time. Although levels are still relatively high, there was a small decrease to 88.8%.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |Percentage of returns filed by customers and payments made by customers on time between 2017 and 2023.
| Year | Returns filed by customers on time | Tax payments made by customers on time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2017 | 85.0% | 87.9% |
| 2018 | 85.4% | 87.9% |
| 2019 | 85.2% | 86.8% |

| 2022 | 95.7% | 89.4% |
| 2023 | 96.2% | 88.8% |

Performance measure results
---------------------------

This year, we achieved 1 out of 2 of the overarching performance measures in the Services for Customers appropriation.

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |Actual and target percentages of tax returns and payments made on time between 2022 and 2024

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Percentage of returns filed by customers on time | 95.7% | 90% | 96.2% (achieved) | 95%[1](#note1) |
| Percentage of tax payments made by customers on time | 89.4% | 90% | 88.8% (not achieved) | 90% |

1 [Changes to measures and targets](/about-us/publications/annual-corporate-reports/annual-report/annual-report-2023/our-performance/changes-to-measures-and-targets)

Not achieved - This measure reflects compliance levels for customers paying their tax obligations in full and on time. Recent weather events and the current economic climate is impacting on customers’ ability to pay in full and on time. On-time payment compliance declined across all tax types: GST, income tax and employment activities, with each making up around one-third of total payments. Employment activities consistently achieves above 90%, while income tax payment timeliness levels are the lowest, contributing to 41% of all late payments.

We increased the targets for both on-time measures from 85% in 2021-22, to 90%.

All targets are unaudited.

Our workplaces (2023)
=====================

Te Tari Taake Inland Revenue is based in 17 cities and towns across Aotearoa. We have 21 permanent offices. We run a property programme that takes opportunities to:

*   modernise workplaces, and
*   ensure our sites are robust for the future and reflect emissions reduction initiatives.

Where circumstances allow, we’re reducing our footprint and co-locating with other agencies.

This year, we:

*   completed seismic assessments of most properties
*   upgraded the security and operation of front-of-house facilities at 6 locations, with enhanced accessibility for customers
*   neared completion of the refits of the Asteron Centre in Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington and our office in Māwhera, Greymouth following seismic upgrades.

Show all

Upgrading Asteron

Asteron Centre is the home site to over 20% of our people. The building has undergone a seismic upgrade that required removal of a substantial portion of our existing 12 year-old fitout.

We have reduced our footprint in Asteron due to lower people numbers and a workspace re-design that supports more flexible, activity-based working. Our lease reduced from 8 to 5 floors from December 2022, with an annual saving of $5.8 million.

Reducing costs in our refit of Asteron has been a focus throughout this project. Where it was more cost effective, we have re-used the existing fit-out, our old furniture or furniture from other agencies.

For example, Te Rua Mahara o te Kāwanatanga Archives NZ has donated shelving and we’re using some existing kitchenware. We chose to buy generic furniture instead of initial specifications from the project architect, saving $350,000.

We also installed re-locatable meeting pods instead of building permanent meeting rooms.

The workplace re-design has kept our diverse workforce in mind by providing, for example, accessible kitchen benches and gender-neutral bathrooms.

Environmental factors have been a key consideration. We have worked with a relocation partner that deconstructs and recycles furniture that is of no further use. 54 tonnes of carpet have been donated instead of being sent to a land fill, saving 33.6 tonnes of carbon. 

How we performed

We monitor 6 indicators of the performance of our property portfolio and vehicle fleet against organisational goals and government guidelines - 2 of 6 indicator targets were achieved.

Our buildings need to comply with fire safety regulations and the Building Act 2004. All have a current building warrant of fitness and evacuation procedures. We worked with landlords to put regular trial evacuation schedules back in place after they were suspended due to COVID-19. Our target this year was not achieved because 1 remaining trial took place in July 2023, outside the 2022–23 timeframe.

NABERSNZ is a system for rating the energy efficiency of office buildings. We have completed assessments of our larger sites: 10 met the minimum acceptable rating. The landlord in 1 remaining building is working to address an issue.

10 of our 12 metro sites met a space utilisation target of no more than 16 square metres per person. We have planned recruitment in the 2 sites that fell outside the target.

Our teams used the vehicle fleet more this year as they stepped up community engagements and visits. However, work that we needed to prioritise this year, such as supporting customers affected by weather events, kept our people in the office. This limited community activities to an extent and contributed to our fleet utilisation being lower than our target.

*   86% of legislative compliance requirements were met by their due date against a target of 100%, up from 74% in 2022.
*   100% of non-legislative compliance requirements were met by their due date against a target of 100%, up from 96% in 2022.
*   100% of front-of-house facilities met security standards against a target to 100% (new measure).
*   91% of NABERSNZ building energy efficiency assessments rated a 4 or more for existing buildings and 5 for new buildings. Target: 100% (new measure).
*   83% of metro buildings where the square metre utilisation is no more than NZ Government Property Group guidelines. Target: 100%. Up from 77% in 2022.
*   18% utilisation of bookable vehicles against a target of 45%, up from 7% in 2022.

Outcomes of the Transformation Programme
========================================

The transformation programme sought to reduce customer effort and cost, improve compliance levels, make policy changes faster and more cost-effectively, improve systems resilience and make IR more efficient.

The capabilities delivered are reducing effort for customers, enabling them to do far more for themselves, and providing them with certainty sooner. Third parties are playing a much greater role in the tax and social policy system, and we are increasingly partnering with others to deliver services.

In just over 5 years, IR successfully transformed the tax and social policy system. From 2017 to 2021, we progressively moved products to new systems and processes and significantly improved the services available to customers. As products were moved, policy changes were made at the same time to help simplify things for customers and improve how we administer the tax and social policy system. The programme was delivered on time, under budget and has achieved the intended outcomes, with improvements delivered across all the indicators we use to track progress.

Read more about the results in our 2022 Annual Report and at:

[Programme Business Case](/about-us/business-transformation/where-we-started/programme-business-case)

We also share lessons at the close-out of our transformation at:

[What we learnt](/about-us/business-transformation/what-we-learnt)

While the transformation programme closed on 30 June 2022, we committed to continuing to track and report against its benefit commitments until 2023–24. This is the final year of reporting against these commitments.

We deliberately set ourselves aspirational targets in return for the investment made in transformation. We did not achieve all the benefits we set out to. However, improvements were delivered across all benefit measures. We recognise there is more work to do to reduce effort for smaller businesses and we are continuing to focus on making it easier for businesses.

We achieved 7 out of the 10 quantitative indicators in this final year of reporting. The measures achieved relate to digital uptake, system availability, system resilience, additional Crown revenue and administrative savings. Digital uptake is well above target at 99% and a significant contributor to agility, our systems are highly resilient and available 99.9% of the time, we have delivered more than $500 million in administrative savings and achieved the increases in Crown revenue we committed to.

*   The percentage of customers who find it easy to comply increased to 84% in 2023–24. This measure remained relatively stable during the period from 2016–17 to 2021–22 when changes resulting from the transformation programme were being implemented. It has now returned to the level it was at in the 2015–16 year, the last full year before transformation began. We always expected that customers would take time to become familiar with the changes made.
*   Results from our 2024 survey of SMEs show the target reduction in compliance effort was not achieved. SMEs reported saving 4 hours compared to a target of 18 hours. The value of the time saved by SMEs was also behind target. SMEs say the things that make it hard for them include keeping up with changes to the tax and social policy system, getting timely responses to queries, meeting filing and information requirements and increased costs for professional advice and software.

The transformation programme closed on 30 June 2022, and we committed to continuing to track and report against its benefit commitments until 2023–24. This is the final year of reporting against these commitments.

1The 2020–21 SME compliance cost survey has been used as an indicative result. Note the result has been updated to reflect corrections for 2 errors: incorrect filing frequencies for some respondents and the treatment of partial responses where no time estimates were provided that were incorrectly included as 0 rather than being excluded.

2The value of the time saved is calculated using the number of SMEs and hours saved multiplied by the percentage of customers filing returns electronically and the dollar value of an hour spent by SMEs on tax. The number of SMEs, hours saved and the value of an hour are obtained from SME compliance cost survey results.

3Achievement of additional Crown revenue is measured through case studies and proxy measures given the difficulty of direct attribution .

CASE STUDY – FamilyBoost

Performance indicator: target achieved

The Coalition Government committed to implement a new FamilyBoost payment by 1 July 2024. The timeframe was tight, with FamilyBoost to be delivered at the same time as other significant changes to personal tax thresholds and other tax credits. We needed to identify feasible system and process options that could be delivered within the timeframe, and what trade-offs would be required to the preferred policy and process settings to make this happen.  

Options were prepared for Ministers’ direction, building off standard design patterns and principles, established tax administration settings and reusing existing technology from similar products, namely Working for Families Tax Credits and donation tax credits. The design was kept as simple as possible with a focus on reusing existing data and working within existing business models as much as possible, whether within IR or the private sector. These approaches meant we could deliver a solution quickly. While the customer experience will not be as smooth and low effort as desired, we will improve it over time.

Because FamilyBoost was developed as part of Budget 2024, there was limited ability to consult with customers early in the process, requiring reliance on our knowledge and understanding of customer behaviour and preferences, and the understanding of the early childhood education (ECE) sector by the Ministry of Education. Experience with policy frameworks for the design of family-based payments was used. 

On 25 March 2024 the Government announced it was introducing FamilyBoost. The design quickly shifted to testing with ECE service providers and software vendors that supply invoicing technology. This ran alongside a communication and public education plan. Policy settings were finalised and legislation was drafted in May 2024, introduced on 30 May and enacted on 4 June 2024, with payment eligibility commencing from 1 July 2024. People are able to claim at the end of each quarter so the first payments are expected to be issued in October 2024.

Ngā putanga Outcomes
====================

Our goal was to deliver a modern, digital revenue system that makes tax and payments simpler and more certain for customers. New Zealand now has a revenue system that is:

*   based around customers’ needs
*   easy to understand and interact with
*   using near real-time information
*   digital and highly automated
*   based around systems and software doing most of the work
*   more responsive, flexible, and certain for customers
*   future proofed to accommodate change.

As products were moved to new systems and processes, we made policy changes at the same time to help simplify things for customers and improve how we administer products. Policy changes have enabled fundamental changes such as automatic end-of-year income tax assessments for individuals to be introduced.

Online services make it easy for customers to see and track their tax and social policy payments and to do what they need to do. All their information is in one place in their myIR account, which is robust, reliable, and available when they need to use it. Routine transactions have been automated and moved online so people don’t have to contact us. Our systems handle around 50% to 60% more transactions than previously with peak loads up to 200% higher.

The information we hold is more accurate and near real time and we are better able to analyse data from multiple sources and act on it. Most individuals and families now only need to check the information we hold about them. We can now respond far more quickly to help customers pay and receive the right amounts. Checks now happen at the time of a transaction, so errors, whether accidental or deliberate, are picked up at the earliest opportunity. This reduces the need for later debt collection or audit work.

For the first time, we have a single, end-to-end view of our customers. All transactions across all products are held in our new system. This makes it much it easier to support customers and for new products to be added at considerably lower cost and effort than before. This is because common processes that all products use such as registration, payments, and myIR access are already in place.

The speed with which we were able to make new products available in response to COVID-19 and our ability to look at risk on a customer-by-customer basis shows what can now be done. The Small Business Cashflow (loan) Scheme, the Resurgence Support Payment and the COVID-19 support payment were available to customers within weeks, with funds in their account within days of a successful application.

We now partner with a much wider variety of organisations and make more of the information we hold readily available to them, with appropriate security permissions in place. For example, we work with the software industry to enable businesses to use their own systems to meet their tax obligations.

Our redesigned website helps customers to search easily for up-to-date content. Or they can use guided help – a decision tree tool, first introduced in 2020 to help customers identify the most relevant COVID-19 support options for their business. Our people too can find the information they need quickly with intelligent search capability that links information sources and presents the most relevant content to them, including on their mobile phone.

Our new organisation design is centred around customers and their needs, with new intelligence and knowledge management tools enabling us to make the best use of the information we hold. A new enterprise support services platform is helping our people to self-serve and to work more efficiently and effectively.

We have completely simplified our technology with most of our services now supplied and supported by trusted partners and vendors. Our technology team is now much smaller and focuses on managing our vendors and their service levels. The ‘buy rather than build’ approach is now well ingrained.

Outstanding claims reserve - consequences on transfer
=====================================================

Legislative changes clarify the tax position of general insurance companies following a transfer of business during an income year. Applies from 1 Oct 2012.

_Sections DW 4(6), ED 3 and EY 5(4) of the Income Tax Act 2007_

Technical changes have been made to the Income Tax Act 2007 to clarify the tax position of general insurance companies when there is a transfer of business partway through an income year.

### Background

The Income Tax Act 2007 allows general insurers a deduction for movements in the outstanding claims reserve (OCR) - or income depending on the nature of the actual movement. Changes in the OCR were measured on an income year basis. This meant that the rules did not provide an appropriate closing value if the OCR for a particular line of general or non-life insurance business was transferred at a point in time other than at the end of an income year.

### Key features

New section ED 3 sets out a legislative code for the transfer of OCR balances for general insurance.

### Detailed analysis

#### How the rules work

Under the Income Tax Act, a deduction connected with movements in a general insurer's outstanding claims reserve (or income depending on the nature of the actual movement) is calculated on an income year basis. The deduction is allowed (or income derived), by reference to sections CR 4 and DW 4, for general insurers who use IFRS 4 for determining their tax position.

If, in an income year, an insurer (insurer A) transfers its insurance contracts to another insurer (insurer B), insurer A is required to make a part-year calculation of its OCR on the day the transfer occurs to determine its closing value. Any movement between the opening and closing balance gives rise to a deduction or income to insurer A.

The amount calculated by insurer A immediately before the transfer is treated as insurer B's new OCR opening balance. Deductions for any claims underlying the opening OCR balance for insurer B are allowed as the claims are met - section DW 4(5). A consequential change to section DW 4(6) ensures that the capital limitation does not apply to amounts transferred to insurer B for the purposes of section DW 4(5).

If insurer B has a different opinion about the value of the OCR, any adjustment to the value should ultimately be reflected post-transfer through the closing balance for the income year in which the transfer occurred.

##### Example

As part of a strategic shift in its market position, Insurer A sells a block of its insurance book to another New Zealand insurer (Insurer B).

The opening balance of the OCR for the relevant block of business is $500,000. As part of Insurer B's due diligence work it is agreed that the OCR value for the block of business is $450,000 - the difference arises because legal action regarding the validity of claim falls in favour of Insurer A.

On 29 June, Insurer A transfers the block of business including the relevant OCR balance. Insurer A records the closing balance of the OCR at the time of transfer as $450,000 and recognises income of $50,000 under section CR 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007 ($500,000 \- $450,000).

Insurer B records the opening balance of the OCR as $450,000. Shortly after, an appeal against the earlier decision about the claim goes against the insurer and Insurer B increases the OCR balance to $510,000.

During the year, Insurer B meets claims totalling $250,000(deductible under section DW 4(5)) and new insured events arise that add a further $400,000 to the OCR.

At the end of the tax year, 31 March, Insurer B's OCR closing balance is $660,000 ($450,000 + $60,000 \- $250,000 + $400,000). As the balance has increased from $450,000, Insurer B is able to claim a deduction for $210,000 (section DW 4(3) $450,000 \- $660,000).

#### Applying the new rules to earlier income years

The changes apply to transfers that occur on and after 1 October 2012.

To facilitate responses by insurers to the enactment of the Insurance (Prudential Supervision) Act on 7 September 2010, insurers have the option to apply new section ED 3 to earlier income years if the transfer occurred on and after 7 September 2010 and:

*   the transfer was to a non-resident who does not carry on a business in New Zealand; and
*   the transfer was made for the purposes of complying with the Insurance (Prudential Supervision) Act 2010.

#### Consequential change to section EY 5(4)

To mirror the point in time the closing balance should be valued under section ED 3, a consequential change has also been made to the transfer rules of life insurers - section EY 5(4) refers.

### Application date

The changes apply to transfers made on and after 1 October 2012, but can be backdated in limited circumstances to 7 September 2010, the date the Insurance (Prudential Supervision) Act 2010 was enacted.

Appeal Status

Appealed

Outstanding proceedings not a "substantial dispute" for the purpose of setting aside a statutory demand where there are finalised tax challenges
================================================================================================================================================

2013 case note – dismissal of application by Trinity investors to set aside statutory demands based on assessments confirmed by the Supreme Court.

Case

Bristol Forestry Venture Limited and Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Companies Act 1993

### Summary

The Judgment dismissed an application by Trinity investors to set aside statutory demands based on assessments confirmed by the Supreme Court. The application relied on another proceeding seeking to dispute the validity of the Court's previous decisions in relation to the Trinity scheme.

The Judge declined to make an order for immediate liquidation but required full payment in 10 working days, failing which liquidation can be applied for.

Costs were awarded to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue.

### Impact of decision

There is no substantial dispute for the purposes of section 291 of the Companies Act 1993 where an assessment, which has been challenged and confirmed, might be set aside in some future appeal.

### Facts

The Judgment relates to applications made by Bristol Forestry Venture Limited ("Bristol") and Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Limited ("Ben Nevis"), ("the plaintiffs") to set aside statutory demands.

The plaintiffs were involved in the Trinity tax avoidance arrangement and the statutory demands relate to their 1998 assessments, which were ultimately confirmed by the Supreme Court in _Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd & Ors v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2008\] NZSC 115, \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289.

The plaintiffs' application seeks to have the statutory demands set aside or (in the alternative) an order declaring that the documents are not statutory demands. The application relies primarily on another proceeding which seeks to dispute the validity of the Court's previous decisions in relation to the Trinity scheme (_Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Limited & Bristol Forestry Venture Limited & Bradbury & Peebles v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2013\] NZHC 2361; this decision was reserved at the date of hearing).

### Decision

Associate Judge Faire dismissed the application to set aside the statutory demands. Having reached that conclusion, the Judge considered that the appropriate course in this case is not to order the immediate liquidation of the companies but, rather, to make an order in terms of section 291(1)(a) of the Companies Act 1993. Accordingly, the Judge ordered that both plaintiffs pay the sums due under the statutory demands within 10 working days, failing which the Commissioner may apply to put the plaintiffs into liquidation.

#### _Substantial dispute_

The Court was required to determine whether there was a substantial dispute as to whether or not the debt is owing or is due. It was for the plaintiffs to show a fairly arguable basis upon which they are not liable for the amounts claimed.

In considering whether the ongoing proceeding (which disputes the validity of previous decisions in relation to the Trinity scheme) is a substantial dispute as to whether or not the debt is owing or is due, the Court held (at \[39\]):

*   The challenge judgments, unless declared invalid, bring to an end any right to question liability to pay the shortfall penalties and interest by the operation of section 109 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The result is that, as the position currently stands, the debt is not a contingent or prospective debt. It is a debt which is currently due.

The Judge also stated:

*   \[41\] Unless a judgment is stayed, there cannot be a substantial dispute over the debt it establishes. The possibility that a present existing and enforceable debt might be set aside in the future under a subsequent appeal does not give rise to a general dispute about the existence of the debt.  
    \[42\] Accordingly, I conclude that the first ground advanced by the plaintiffs in reliance on section 290(4)(a) of the Companies Act 1993 fails. The ancillary ground related to it, namely that the debt is not yet due, fails for the same reason. The challenge process has been completed. Section 109 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 applies. There is, therefore, a debt that satisfies the definition of a statutory demand as prescribed by section 289 of the Companies Act 1993.

#### _Serving the statutory demands was an abuse of process and they could be set aside on other grounds_

The Court considered whether or not the demands ought to be set aside on other grounds under section 290(4)(c) of the Companies Act 1993. Associate Judge Faire held (at \[48\]):

*   I cannot, in this case, find any specific factor - whether it is policy, a matter of principle or the justice of this case - that would justify the application of section 290(4)(c) of the Companies Act 1993 in respect of the application. The defendant was entitled to issue a statutory demand in reliance on judgment which brought to an end the challenge process and which, as a consequence of section 109 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, prevents the position being disputed in a court, or in any proceedings "on any ground whatsoever".

**_The statutory demands were not capable of being statutory demands_**

The Judge recorded that the plaintiffs relied on other matters and that this ground had been pleaded simply to emphasise the plaintiffs' proposition that any debt owed to the Commissioner was not yet due, and therefore a demand for it did not satisfy the requirements of section 290(4)(a). The Judge considered that this submission was encompassed in the other grounds.

### What is the appropriate order?

Having reached the conclusion that the statutory demands should not be set aside, the Court considered whether to make an order under section 291(1)(a) or 291(1)(b) of the Companies Act 1993. The Commissioner invited the Court to place the companies into immediate liquidation under section 291(1)(b).

The Court reviewed the authorities and considered that the general rule is that a winding-up order will not be made on a petition founded on a debt which was genuinely disputed. When the Court makes an immediate order for liquidation under section 291(1)(b), it bypasses the normal procedures of a liquidation application. There is no advertising and no opportunity is given to shareholders or other creditors to be heard about whether a liquidation order should be made or not. The scope for an inquiry to exercise discretion under section 241 is limited. Even though a presumption of inability to pay debts under section 287(a) may not be established, the company will be treated as unable to pay its debts. This means before taking the "short-cut route" under section 291(1)(b) there must be clear evidence the company is insolvent.

The Court further noted a number of factors for not placing the plaintiffs into immediate liquidation, namely:

1.  the indebtedness to the Commissioner could well be satisfied by the shareholders and no evidence was before the Court as to the shareholders' ability to adopt this course;
2.  no advance warning of the immediate liquidation application was given to the companies and perhaps the opportunity for evidence of the shareholders ability to satisfy the debt was not available;
3.  the liquidation of the plaintiffs will not bring the matter to a conclusion as the shareholders can carry on with the proceedings that they have signalled;
4.  it was not readily apparent that there was a need for an early appointment of a liquidator; and
5.  wider considerations arise at the point that the Court must determine whether it will exercise its discretion to order a liquidation of a company than those that apply to an application to set aside a statutory demand.

The Court concluded the appropriate course of action was an order under section 291(1)(a) of the Companies Act 1993 (rather than section 291(b)(1)) ordering the plaintiffs to pay within 10 working days, failing which the Commissioner can apply to have the plaintiffs liquidated.

Over-market payments to a related person in the course of business
==================================================================

2006 case note – avoidance - disputant paid an above-market income to an administration assistant provided by a related company with carry-forward losses.

Case

TRA Decision Number 15/2007

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994

### Summary

The disputant had entered into an arrangement to pay an above-market income to an administration assistant provided by a related company. As that company had significant carry-forward losses, a significant tax advantage accrued to the disputant. This was held to be so by the Taxation Review Authority ("TRA").

### Facts

This case involved challenges to assessments for the 2002 to 2005 income tax years.

Prior to the years in question, the disputant, a real estate agent, directly employed a sub-agent to assist in making property sales on his behalf. He also directly employed an administration assistant whom he paid $15.00 per hour and worked approximately 20 to 25 hours per week.

The administration assistant provided support to both the disputant and his sub-agent even though the disputant paid for these administrative services. The disputant contends that he had a problem in that he was unable to on charge the sub-agent for the administrative services so a new arrangement was created which would allow him to on charge any future sub-agent for these services.

The disputant entered into a contract with OSL, of which he was the sole director and equal shareholder with his wife, to supply him with management and administrative services. OSL had losses brought forward of $192,844.82 and under the contract; OSL provided an administration assistant to the disputant and charged him $65.00 per hour plus Goods and Services Tax ("GST") for her services. OSL paid the administration assistant $15.00 per hour.

The disputant obtained an inflated income tax deduction for the $65.00 plus GST he paid to OSL but did not suffer the full economic consequences of that. The annual profits of OSL were transferred to the disputant who received them as capital because they were repayments of a shareholder's loan by him to OSL. The disputant was thus able to claim a deduction of $64,659 in each year while the administration assistant was only paid $16,388.

### Decision

#### The Fee Charged

Judge Barber held that payment of $65.00 plus GST per hour was very excessive in marketplace terms, for administrative support in the real estate industry. It was almost four times what needed to be paid, what had previously been paid, and what was in fact paid by OSL to the administration assistant. He also commented that a multiplier rate of 3.869 used by the disputant to arrive at the $65.00 per hour rate was "ridiculously high".

#### Tax Avoidance

Judge Barber held that the arrangement amounted to tax avoidance. He found the fee of $65.00 per hour for an administration assistant's services to be excessive, un-commercial and integral to an arrangement which decreased the disputant's taxable income by providing him with an inflated deduction, without him suffering the economic consequences of paying the higher administration fee.

From any sensible tax approach, there was little to be gained by the new structure because the multiplier used for the administration assistant's services for the charging out by OSL to the disputant was out of line with commercial sense.

#### Reconstruction

Judge Barber accepted that there is no requirement on the Commissioner to reconstruct but stated that, whenever reasonably possible, the Commissioner should take the extra step of trying to resolve the disputed issues over tax avoidance by a sensible and agreed reconstruction.

Judge Barber accepted however that this was not an appropriate case for an agreed reconstruction as there was no evidential basis on which to do so. No satisfactory evidence was put to the Authority as to what an appropriate commercial rate or mark-up for a company providing administrative support in the real estate industry would be and Barber J therefore agreed with the Commissioner's approach not to reconstruct.

#### Shortfall penalty

Judge Barber found for an unacceptable interpretation rather than an abusive tax position because he accepted that the disputant, having been advised by his accountant on the arrangement, honestly thought the structure was valid at law. The shortfall penalty was fixed at 20% with a reduction for previous good behaviour.

Overseas contractor found to have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand
===========================================================================

2013 case note - overseas contractor found by Taxation Review Authority to have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand – Diamond, residency.

Case

TRA 43/11; \[2013\] NZTRA 10

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994, Income Tax Act 2004

### Summary

This was a case about tax residency and whether the disputant continued to be a New Zealand tax resident in the four years after he left New Zealand to work overseas. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") considered that the disputant was a New Zealand tax resident for the first four years he was working overseas because he had a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. The disputant argued that he did not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand during this period.

The Taxation Review Authority ("TRA") found for the Commissioner and also found that the disputant was liable for a shortfall penalty in each of the tax years in question for taking an unacceptable tax position.

### Impact of decision

The decision is consistent with the Commissioner's view that in evaluating whether a person has a permanent place of abode, it is necessary to consider all the relevant circumstances, and that there must be a dwelling that can be the person's place of abode. It is also consistent with the Commissioner's view that someone with strong ties to New Zealand can have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand despite a lengthy absence (the taxpayer was absent for up to four years in the years in dispute in this case).

The Commissioner considers that the result in this case turns largely on the particular facts.

The Commissioner has been asked for her views about two particular aspects of this case. The Commissioner's comments on those aspects are as follows:

*   A person with dependent children in New Zealand will not necessarily have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand if they have a close relationship with their children and make regular trips back to see them. Such connections need to be viewed in light of the totality of all of the taxpayer's circumstances. It was the totality of the circumstances in TRA 43/11 that led Judge Sinclair to conclude that the taxpayer had a permanent place of abode in New Zealand in the years in question; no one factor was determinative.
*   Paying child support or other financial support to people in New Zealand may be relevant, as with any other economic connections to New Zealand. In TRA 43/11, Judge Sinclair noted that the taxpayer paid child support and contributed to other expenses for his children in New Zealand. An aspect of this case was the fact that the level of financial assistance was substantial.

The Commissioner has published an Interpretation Statement on tax residence, which covers how to determine if someone has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand for the purposes of section YD 1 (see _IS 14/01: Tax residence_ at [www.ird.govt.nz/technical-tax/interpretations](/internet/ird/technical-tax/interpretations/2014/interpretations-2014-index.html)
). Taxpayers and their agents should refer to this statement for the Commissioner's view on the tax residence rules.

### Facts

The disputant is a former New Zealand soldier who left New Zealand in July 2003 to work as a security contractor. He worked in Papua New Guinea and Iraq during the tax years in question (the tax years ending 31 March 2004 to 2007 inclusive). During those years, the disputant did not pay income tax on his foreign earnings.

The Commissioner assessed the disputant as a New Zealand resident under section OE 1(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994 and Income Tax Act 2004 on the basis that he had a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. The disputant challenged this assessment, submitting he had been (and remained) a non-resident from the date he left New Zealand (July 2003).

### Decision

#### Residency

The TRA noted that the phrase "permanent place of abode" is not defined in the legislation, and that case law provides guidance when determining whether a person has a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. The TRA observed that the test is an objective test and considers the totality of the circumstances.

Here the TRA examined, in considering the overall circumstances, the following points:

*   place of abode (ie, whether the disputant had an available dwelling in New Zealand);
*   intention to be away permanently;
*   employment;
*   other ties with New Zealand (including time spent in the country, family relationships, investments, other property, and tax affairs); and
*   connections outside New Zealand.

##### Place of abode

The disputant held an investment property in New Zealand owned through an LAQC in which he held shares with his ex-wife. The property was tenanted. However, both the disputant and his ex-wife recognised the property was beneficially the disputant's and that it was only held by the LAQC for tax reasons. The TRA found that it was unlikely the ex-wife would have refused to cooperate with the disputant if the disputant had wanted to obtain possession of it, and so accordingly it was available to him as a dwelling.

The TRA found that the fact the property was an investment property and was tenanted did not outweigh it being available to the disputant as a dwelling. The TRA observed that Judge Barber had decided in _Case Q55_ (1998) 15 NZTC 5,313 that an investment property could be regarded as a potential place of abode. The TRA considered that in the present case, notice could have been served on the tenants at any time if the disputant had wished to return to live in the property. As noted above, the TRA considered it unlikely that the disputant's ex-wife would have refused to cooperate.

The TRA considered it important that the property was situated in a locality where the disputant had continuing family and economic ties.

##### Intention

The TRA found that, while no contemporaneous documents were produced to show the disputant's intention to leave New Zealand permanently, the length of time he spent out of New Zealand supported the disputant's assertion that this was his intention. However, such an intention is not determinative.

##### Employment

The TRA accepted the disputant's employment involved carrying out security work in hot spots around the world and so had no association with New Zealand. His contract in Papua New Guinea had been for 12 months and there was no evidence of any right of renewal. His contracts in Iraq were 13 months each. There was no certainty of renewal at the end of each contract, though in the relevant period his contract had been renewed (as it had in the years after the relevant period).

##### Continuity and duration of presence in New Zealand

The TRA noted the disputant was not continuously absent from New Zealand, but returned to visit family every five to six months, spending on average 42 days a year in New Zealand during the relevant period.

##### Family ties

The TRA considered that the disputant's continuing relationships with his children and ex-wife were significant factors in favour of him having a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. The disputant tried to speak to his children every Sunday while in Iraq. He would spend time with his ex-wife and children while visiting New Zealand, and had holidays with the children in other countries. He also continued to pay child support and a substantial amount of other expenses for the children. This ongoing relationship distinguished this case from _Case U17_ (1998) 19 NZTC 9,174, in which the taxpayer was estranged from his children.

The disputant also maintained a close relationship with his ex-wife, who was in effect his financial advisor and business partner. She held powers of attorney for him and managed his affairs in New Zealand.

##### Economic ties

The majority of the disputant's income continued to be spent in New Zealand on child support, expenses for the children, and on his property investments. The disputant continued to invest in New Zealand after he left the country. The TRA noted that in _Case U17_, the taxpayer also kept assets in New Zealand. In that case the taxpayer also invested further in New Zealand, subsequent to his departure from New Zealand, to provide for his family and to finance his business in Singapore. However, the TRA considered that the disputant's property investments were more closely linked with New Zealand than that in _Case U17_ because of the disputant's on-going business relationship with his ex-wife.

The TRA did not place any weight on the fact the disputant maintained bank accounts for mortgage payments on his properties, that he had a superannuation fund and life insurance policy, or that he had tax obligations in New Zealand relating to his business interests. Nor did it place any particular weight on the fact the disputant transferred the ownership in his vehicles to his ex-wife two years after he left New Zealand. However, the TRA did observe that the taxpayer not selling his vehicles at the time of his departure did not support the view that he had at that time formed an intention to leave permanently.

##### Connections outside New Zealand

The TRA did not place any weight on the fact the disputant had not established roots in Iraq and thought that understandable given the country's security situation and the nature of the disputant's employment.

##### Conclusion

The TRA found that looking at the circumstances overall, the disputant continued to have a strong and enduring relationship with New Zealand. In particular, he had an available dwelling and maintained close family and financial ties to the country. Accordingly, the TRA held that the disputant was a resident of New Zealand for tax purposes for the years in dispute.

#### Shortfall penalties

Counsel for the disputant submitted that the line in terms of whether someone has a permanent place of abode is not clearly defined, and that it takes judgement and discernment to weigh the particular facts. The TRA accepted that it requires judgement and discernment to get residency status correct. However, it considered that the arguments supporting the disputant's position were not substantial when the circumstances were considered in their totality.

In arguing that the disputant's position was "about as likely as not to be correct", counsel for the disputant also referred to the Commissioner's public statements that an absence of three years would generally be enough for a person to be a non-resident. However, the TRA found there to be no evidence the disputant knew of those statements and relied upon them.

Accordingly, the TRA found that the tax position taken by the disputant was not "about as likely as not to be correct".

The disputant was liable to pay a shortfall penalty for taking an unacceptable tax position in each of the relevant years, reduced by 50% for previous behaviour.

The disputant has appealed this decision.

Ngā rōpū mahi hī ika nō tāwāhi e mahi ana i Aotearoa Overseas fishing crew working in New Zealand
=================================================================================================

If you have come to New Zealand to work as crew on a fishing vessel with a certain type of visa, you'll pay tax on the money you earn at a special rate.

Your employer will take the tax out of your wages before they pay you.

Qualifying as overseas fishing crew
-----------------------------------

Overseas fishing crew are skilled workers from overseas who come to New Zealand to work on vessels in New Zealand waters.

You need a Fishing Crew Work Visa to do this job. You can only work for the employer named in your visa. Talk to your employer about getting a visa. You can also read about it on Immigration New Zealand’s website.

[Fishing Crew Work Visa (Immigration New Zealand)](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/apply-for-a-visa/visa-factsheet/foreign-crew-on-fishing-vessels-work-visa)

What you need to do
-------------------

### Get an IRD number

Your IRD number is a tax identification number that keeps track of the tax you pay. It helps make sure you pay the right amount.

Keep your IRD number when you go back home. You'll need it if you work in New Zealand again.

### Fill in a tax code form

Your employer will give you a Tax code declaration form IR330 to fill out. You can also download the form here and give it to your employer.

Use the tax code NSW to make sure your employer deducts the right amount of tax.

If you do not provide your employer with your IRD number and the right tax code, you’ll have the highest rate of tax deducted.

### Pay tax

Every time you get paid your employer will take tax from your wages before they pay you.

You do not have to do a tax return before you go back home.

If you do not establish a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, you'll be treated as a non-resident taxpayer during your period of employment. The usual 183-day rule does not apply. Therefore, if you, for example, earn interest from a New Zealand bank account, you'll pay tax at the non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) rate. As long as the rate is correct, you should not have to file a tax return for this income either.

If you do establish a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, you'll need to pay tax on your worldwide income. Make sure you know these criteria by checking our tax residency section for individuals.

21 May 2019 1 UNCLASSIFIED Overview – Short-stay accommodation items Income Tax and GST – Tax implications of providing short-stay accommodation These items explain your tax obligations if you rent out your home, a room in your home, or a separate residential property or dwelling. These items focus on short-stay accommodation provided through peer-to- peer platforms such as Airbnb or Bookabach. The items cover the different circumstances in which accommodation is provided. We’ll add to this series of documents in the future. Work out which items are relevant to your circumstances by using the applicable flowchart, based on whether you are providing: Accommodation in your own home OR Accommodation in a separate property Renting a room Renting whole home Flatmate Boarder Guest(s) Tenant See Inland Revenue’s IR1037 guide See if you’re eligible to use the standard cost method in DET 19/01 Otherwise, use the actual cost method in QB 19/05 See if you should register for GST in QB 19/09 See if you’re eligible to use the standard cost method in DET 19/02 See Inland Revenue’s investment property section Accommodation in your own home Key terms Boarder: a person (often a student) who pays for residential accommodation including regular meals and other associated care, activities and benefits that usually occur in a domestic household. F latmates: means a group of people who each pay a share of the residential accommodation costs. G uest: means the person provided with short-stay accommodation. S hort-stay accommodation: means accommodation provided for up to four weeks in a dwelling that is not the guest’s principal place of residence. Tenant: a person renting a property under a residential tenancy agreement Overview – Short-stay accommodation: Published date 2 UNCLASSIFIED DET 19/02 – Short-stay accommodation Determination Simplified rules for some short-stay accommodation hosts There are simplified rules that can be used by many hosts who provide short-stay accommodation in their own home. We have set standard nightly costs for deductions that qualifying hosts can claim. The standard costs reflect the likely average costs incurred by hosts providing short-stay accommodation in their home. The standard costs for the 2019-20 income year are $50 a night (subject to CPI adjustment) if the host owns their home, and $45 a night (subject to CPI adjustment) if the host rents their home. If you qualify to use the rules, you can choose to use the standard nightly costs. This means you don’t have to work out the actual costs you incurred (which would involve apportionment calculations). Income from short-stay accommodation guests up to the amount of the standard costs would not have to be declared. You would only need to declare the income in excess of the standard cost amount. Who can use the rules? You may be able to use the rules if: Is it used privately? See if you should register for GST in QB 19/09 No Yes MUA rules explained in QB 19/07 Standard rules explained in QB 19/08 See Inland Revenue’s investment property section Renting a separate dwelling on your property Renting a separate property Accommodation in a separate property See if you should use MUA rules or standard rules in QB 19/06 Overview – Short-stay accommodation: Published date 3 UNCLASSIFIED -you don’t rent out rooms in your home for more than 100 nights in the year (counting each room that’s rented out separately); -the property isn’t held in a trust, or if it is you paid all of the costs for the year for the use of the property (eg, mortgage interest or rent, insurance, rates, and repairs and maintenance); -the short-stay accommodation isn’t provided as part of a GST taxable activity; and -you’re a natural person (eg, an individual not a company). The full criteria for using the rules are in the determination. DET 19/02 (Inland Revenue) QB 19/05 – Renting out your own home Income tax rules when renting out your own home If you can’t use the standard-cost approach in DET 19/02, or you don’t want to, your deductions will be based on your actual costs related to earning the income. Expenses that relate solely to your rental activity (eg, advertising fees) are 100% deductible. But mixed expenses, that relate to both your rental activity and your own use of your home (eg, mortgage interest, insurance and rates), need to be apportioned. This QWBA will help you understand how to calculate the percentage of your mixed expenses that’s tax deductible. These rules are set out in QB 19/05 “What are my income tax obligations if I rent out my home or a separate dwelling on my property as short-stay accommodation?” QB 19/05 (Inland Revenue) QB 19/06 – Which income tax rules apply? Dwellings used privately and also rented out You may be providing accommodation in a separate property or dwelling that’s not your own home, but that you sometimes use privately. For instance, you may have a holiday home you sometimes use yourself and sometimes rent out. Another example is a sleepout on your property that you sometimes rent out and sometimes use as accommodation for family or friends. In these situations, there are different rules for apportioning your expenditure between income- earning use and private use that could potentially apply. The different rules are: T he “mixed-use asset” rules OR The standard tax rules You will need to work out which rules apply so you can meet your income tax obligations. The key factor is whether the property is unused for 62 days or more in the income year. If it is unused for 62 days or more, the “mixed-use asset rules” apply. Otherwise, the standard tax rules apply. The full criteria are in QB 19/06 “What income tax rules apply if I have a dwelling that I sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and sometimes use myself?” QB 19/06 (Inland Revenue) Overview – Short-stay accommodation: Published date 4 UNCLASSIFIED QB 19/07 – Applying the mixed-use asset rules The mixed-use asset rules apply in situations where assets are sometimes used privately, sometimes used to earn income, and are also unused for 62 days or more during the income year. The rules ensure that an appropriate proportion of the expenses that relate to the “unused” period is deductible. The proportion that’s deductible is based on the amount of income-earning use relative to the total use of the asset. The mixed-use asset rules are explained in the QWBA, which covers: •what rental income is taxable; •what income is exempt; and •what proportion of your expenses are tax deductible. For further details, see QB 19/07 “How do the mixed-use asset income tax rules apply to a dwelling that I sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and sometimes use privately?” QB 19/07 (Inland Revenue) QB 19/08 – Applying the standard rules This QWBA is relevant if you’ve determined that for a particular income year the dwelling is subject to the standard rules, not the mixed-use asset rules. The main difference between the standard rules and the mixed-use asset rules is how you calculate what proportion of expenses you can deduct. Under the standard rules, the proportion of expenses that’s deductible is based on the amount of time the asset is used for, or available for, income-earning. For further details see QB 19/08 “ How do the standard income tax rules apply to a dwelling that I sometimes rent out as short-stay accommodation and sometimes use privately?” QB 19/08 (Inland Revenue) QB 19/09 – GST registration Can I register for GST? Provided you have a “taxable activity” of continuously and regularly supplying (or intending to supply) short-stay accommodation to guests for payment, you may register for GST. If your supplies exceed $60,000 in a 12-month period you must register, otherwise registration is voluntary. Voluntary registration is not right for everyone as there are on-going compliance requirements and you may have to pay GST when you stop providing short-stay accommodation or sell your property. Further details can be found in QB 19/09 “ Can I register for GST if I supply short-stay accommodation to guests in my home or holiday home?” QB 19/09 (Inland Revenue)

Own-home LAQC was tax avoidance arrangement
===========================================

2009 case note – Taxpayer rented home from loss attributing qualifying company in which she was sole shareholder – tax avoidance.

Case

TRA Decision No 16/2009

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994 and Income Tax Act 2004

### Summary

The Court held that because Mrs B rented her residential home from an LAQC in which she was the sole shareholder there was a tax avoidance arrangement.

### Impact of decision

This is the first "own-home LAQC" case to be considered by the Courts.  
This case provides clear authority that a taxpayer cannot use an LAQC structure to claim deductions for expenditure that would otherwise be of a private or domestic nature.  
This judgment is consistent with the Department's published view in various publications such as Revenue Alerts RA07/01, the Smart Tax Weekly Bulletin 20 July 2004 and 4 December 2007, and an Inland Revenue media release on 19 July 2004, to inform taxpayers and tax advisors that the Commissioner considers such an arrangement could constitute a tax avoidance arrangement.

### Facts

Mrs B settled a family trust on 23 November 2002. Mrs B was trustee of the family trust along with her accountant. Mrs B was also a discretionary beneficiary under the trust along with Mrs B's daughter.

An LAQC was incorporated on 7 November 2002 with Mrs B as its sole shareholder and the accountant as its sole director. LAQC status was granted with effect from 31 March 2003.

The LAQC became the registered proprietor of a residential property. The purchase price of $290,000 was financed by a $292,000 loan from the family trust (with interest). The trust financed that loan by borrowing $292,000 from Mrs B. Mrs B had borrowed $160,000 from the Public Trust. The Pubic Trust loan is repayable by Mrs B over 20 years. The LAQC provided security by a mortgage over the residential property to the Public Trustee. (There is no clear evidence as to how Mrs B obtained the further $132,000 to make up the loan from her to the trust.)

The LAQC entered into a tenancy agreement with Mrs B. Mrs B pays $300 per week to the Public Trust Office for payments due on her borrowings. This $300 is treated by the LAQC as rent paid by Mrs B to it. Neither the LAQC nor the family trust has bank accounts.

As a result of the residential activity, the LAQC has returned losses for the four years ended 31 March 2003 to 2006 inclusive. The losses were attributed to Mrs B by the LAQC and allowed Mrs B to reduce the amount of income tax she would otherwise have had to pay.

The Commissioner formed the opinion that the above facts constitute a tax avoidance arrangement for the purposes of sections BG 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Income Tax Act 2004. As such, the Commissioner can counteract any tax advantage obtained under section GB 1 of the relevant Acts.

### Decision

The parties agreed that there was an arrangement \[paragraph 62\] but the disputant denied that it was a tax avoidance arrangement. Judge Barber went on to determine whether or not the arrangement should be void for tax avoidance.

At paragraph 44, Judge Barber said that the main judgment of the Supreme Court in _Ben Nevis_ constitutes a comprehensive statement of law of income tax avoidance in New Zealand.

Judge Barber applied the _Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Limited and Ors v CIR_ \[2008\] NZSC 115; \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289; \[2009\] 24 NZTC 23,188 (SC)two-step approach. He agreed with the Commissioner that when looked at in isolation, each of the component parts of the arrangement entered into by the disputant falls within the ambit of the specific black letter taxing provisions and regimes \[paragraph 63\]. Judge Barber also agreed with the Commissioner that when viewed as a whole, the arrangement entered into by the disputant is not of a kind that would conceivably have been contemplated by Parliament when enacting the LAQC and deduction provisions \[paragraph 65\].

Judge Barber agreed with the Commissioner that the arrangement was artificial and contrived \[paragraph 69\].

Judge Barber found that the arrangement allowed for deductions that would otherwise be private or domestic expenditure and not deductible \[paragraph 72\].

Judge Barber held that there is a tax avoidance arrangement and the whole arrangement is void. As a consequence Judge Barber held that section GB 1 should be applied to counteract the tax advantage obtained.

Panel statement RAP 002: Process for resolving potential unintended legislative changes in the Income Tax Act 2007
==================================================================================================================

Statement from the Rewrite Advisory Panel sets out the process for referral of unintended legislative changes in the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Introduction

1.  The Rewrite Advisory Panel (the Panel) is an independent committee formed to advise on the rewrite of the Income Tax Act 1994 (ITA 1994). The Panel's role includes considering whether any unintended legislative changes arise under the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA 2007).
2.  In 2007 the Panel was further invited to monitor and report back to Ministers on the ITA 2007 and its continuing consistency with the objectives of the rewrite project.
3.  The Panel will consider all issues submitted, and make recommendations to Government on how any unintended changes should be dealt with.
4.  This Panel Statement sets out the process for taxpayers and agents to refer potential unintended legislative changes in the ITA 2007 to the Panel, and how the Panel will deal with those issues. This Panel Statement is not intended to amend any part of Rewrite Advisory Panel Statement 001, although it repeats some of the content of the earlier Panel Statement.
5.  Potential unintended legislative changes identified in the Income Tax Act 2004 (ITA 2004) can still be raised with the Panel. The process for making submissions on potential unintended legislative changes in the ITA 2004 is outlined in the Rewrite Advisory Panel Statement RAP 001, which can be found on the [Rewrite Advisory Panel](http://www.rewriteadvisory.govt.nz "This link will open in a new window")
     website.

### Background

6.  The ITA 2007 is the fourth and final stage of New Zealand's income tax legislation Rewrite programme which aims to make the legislation clear, plainly expressed and easy to understand. This will assist with understanding tax rights and obligations.
7.  The rewrite programme introduced the alphanumeric numbering system and set out the core provisions in the ITA 1994; progressively rewrote the provisions into plain language and restructured the provisions into a more logical scheme through the ITA 2004 and the ITA 2007.
8.  The intention of the drafting of the ITA was to ensure no change to the pre-existing law was made, except in respect of a limited number of intended policy changes specified in Schedule 51 of the ITA 2007.
9.  In 2003, the Finance and Expenditure Committee (FEC) noted that unintended changes in the law may arise from the difference in language between the old and new Acts, despite the best efforts of the drafters to avoid this.
10.  The FEC proposed the appointment of an independent committee to review submissions regarding any differences between the old and new Acts and to recommend appropriate action. The Rewrite Advisory Panel was invited to take on this role.
11.  A formal process was called for to identify such issues and refer them to the Government for consideration.
12.  Upon identification of an unintended legislative change, the Government will decide whether to:
    *   enact an amendment to reinstate or modify the meaning of the pre-existing law, or
    *   permit the unintended change to be retained in the legislation.
13.  The Government will also decide whether the issue merits wider consultation under the generic tax policy process, eg, whether a Government Discussion Document is warranted
14.  The Rewrite Advisory Panel is currently chaired by David McLay and includes representatives from the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants (NZICA), the New Zealand Law Society (NZLS), The Treasury and Inland Revenue.

### Panel secretariat and administration

15.  Inland Revenue's LTS Technical Standards unit performs a secretariat role to support the Panel. The Secretariat undertakes administrative functions and maintains a database and website dedicated to the process.
16.  LTS Technical Standards is an Inland Revenue business unit comprising solicitors and technical advisors.
17.  The [Rewrite Advisory Panel](http://www.rewriteadvisory.govt.nz "This link will open in a new window")
     website provides the main avenue for new issues to be submitted by taxpayers and agents, and for tracking the progress of each issue. Issues can also be submitted by post to the Panel at the address provided at paragraph 30.
18.  This website contains:
    *   a description of the process
    *   details of the Panel members
    *   a register of issues and their status
    *   an online submission form.
19.  Recommendations of the Panel and outcomes of the process will be communicated to the person raising the issue, on the website and through other channels, depending upon the significance of the issue.
20.  "Unintended legislative change issue" - this term is used in this Panel Statement to refer to the identification of an instance when the meaning of a provision in the ITA 2007 has potentially changed from the meaning of the corresponding provision in the ITA 2004 and is not included in the intended policy changes listed in Schedule 51 of the ITA 2007.
21.  The complexity of each issue and the volume of issues will influence the length of time needed to complete the process. It is acknowledged that timeliness is important and issues raised through this process will be treated expeditiously.
22.  Issues raised by Inland Revenue will also follow this process.
23.  Maintenance items such as corrections of cross-references, spelling and punctuation in the ITA 2004 or ITA 2007 are considered by Inland Revenue officials. These items are reported to the Panel but are not considered in detail by the Panel. They are generally incorporated into an available Amendment Bill. A summary of maintenance items can be found in the Maintenance Items Log on the Panel's website.

### The process

24.  This section covers the following:
    *   Overview
    *   Submitting issues
    *   Content/form of submissions
    *   Inland Revenue analysis
    *   The Panel process
    *   Outcomes and communication
    *   Penalties and interest
    *   Disputes and rulings processes.

#### Overview

25.  A potential unintended legislative change issue can be referred to the Panel Secretariat. The Secretariat will refer all issues to the Panel and to Inland Revenue officials for their analysis and comment.
26.  Following Inland Revenue analysis, a report will be forwarded to the Panel to consider whether there is an unintended legislative change and to recommend a course of action. A copy of Inland Revenue's report will be made available to the submitter for their consideration and comment. The submitter may forward any comments to the Secretariat within 10 working days. If time is an issue, this should be raised with the Secretariat.
27.  Simple changes such as typographical errors or incorrect cross-references will also be brought to the Panel's attention, but it will not formally review these. (See paragraph 23.)
28.  Once the Panel has considered an issue it will make a recommendation to the Government. The Government will then determine the appropriate response to an unintended legislative change.

#### Submitting issues

29.  Potential unintended legislative change issues will come from a variety of sources, including:
    *   Inland Revenue
    *   taxpayers and their agents
    *   NZICA or NZLS tax committees
    *   any other interested persons.
30.  The Panel wants to ensure submitting issues for its consideration is straightforward. An issue can be submitted in the following ways:
    *   by using the online form on the [Rewrite Advisory Panel](http://www.rewriteadvisory.govt.nz "This link will open in a new window")
         website.
    *   by posting the appended form to:  
        *   Rewrite Advisory Panel Secretariat  
            PO Box 2198  
            Wellington
    *   through the Tax Committees of NZICA and NZLS
    *   through the websites of NZICA and NZLS.
31.  When received, each issue will be registered by the Secretariat, and an acknowledgement sent to the submitter. Concurrently the issue will be sent to the Panel.
32.  If a duplicate issue is received, the Secretariat will notify the submitter that the issue has already been raised and advise the status of the original issue. The Panel will be advised of duplications.

#### Content/form of submissions

33.  Each submission should include:
    *   the section reference under the ITA 2007
    *   the corresponding section reference under the ITA 2004
    *   a brief interpretation of the ITA 2004 (or earlier legislation)
    *   a brief interpretation of the corresponding provision under the ITA 2007
    *   a reference to any policy and practice under the ITA 2004 (or earlier legislation)
    *   practical examples of the effect of the change
    *   the name and contact details of the submitter.
34.  Additional documentation may also be included to support your submission.
35.  A form for submissions is appended to this Panel Statement (see Appendix below).

#### Inland Revenue analysis

36.  The Secretariat will refer every issue to Inland Revenue's LTS Technical Standards unit for analysis.
37.  Inland Revenue analysis involves researching the provision affected, both in its pre- and post-rewrite forms, identifying the interpretation of the corresponding provision prior to the rewrite and establishing a view as to whether or not there has been a change in the law.
38.  Inland Revenue officials will also highlight their preferred means of resolving the matter.

#### The Panel process

39.  Submissions will be referred by the Secretariat to the Panel in a timely manner, along with a report from Inland Revenue officials setting out their analysis, options and recommendation for dealing with the issue - the timing of this will depend on the complexity of the issue.
40.  The Secretariat will forward a copy of Inland Revenue's report to the submitter and the submitter may make further comment to the Secretariat within 10 working days from the date the report is sent.
41.  The Panel will meet as required to consider the issues and, in particular, whether there has been an unintended change in the law through the rewrite process.
42.  If the Panel considers there has been an unintended change in the law, it will make a recommendation to the Minister of Revenue as to the appropriate course of action, eg, whether the ITA 2007 should be amended or whether the change should be retained.
43.  In some cases urgency may be required, eg, in the case of a dispute with Inland Revenue over the interpretation of the ITA 2007. If this is the case, the Panel is prepared to consider the matter expeditiously. Any need for urgency will need to be brought to the Secretariat's attention at the time an issue is submitted. In such cases it may be necessary to depart from the process outlined above.

#### Outcomes and communication

44.  When an unintended legislative change is confirmed by the Panel, it will make a recommendation to the Government as to the preferred resolution. However, ultimately it is the Government's decision.
45.  The Panel anticipates that the Government will decide to:
    *   amend the ITA 2007 to reinstate the outcome given under the ITA 2004
    *   permit the unintended change to be retained in the legislation, or
    *   if the legislation is amended retrospectively, enact a savings provision to address the position of taxpayers who have relied on the unintended change.
46.  Given the circumstances of the case, the Government may also decide if the issue merits wider consultation, under the generic tax policy process, before any amendment is undertaken. The Government will also decide the application date of any amendment, and whether the Act will be amended retrospectively.
47.  Submitters will be notified directly of the outcome. The Panel's website will also record the outcome in the Issues Log.
48.  Inland Revenue will also publish the outcome of issues reviewed by the Panel in Inland Revenue's _Tax_ _Information Bulletin_.

#### Penalties and interest

49.  This process does not remove the need for taxpayers to take care in preparing tax positions. The following paragraphs summarise the position proposed by the Commissioner.
50.  In most cases when interpreting a rewritten provision under the ITA 2007, taxpayers will be able to rely on existing interpretations of the corresponding ITA 2004 provision. If a taxpayer has taken an acceptable tax position, a taxpayer will not be liable to a shortfall penalty.
51.  If the meaning of the ITA 2007 is unambiguous, it should be applied, even if it appears that there has been an unintended change.
52.  However, if a taxpayer has not taken an acceptable tax position then a shortfall penalty will be imposed.
53.  Inland Revenue has provided more details on the treatment of penalties and interest arising from unintended legislative changes in Standard Practice Statement 08/03 published in the _Tax_ _Information Bulletin_ Vol 20, No 10 (December 2008)_._

#### Disputes and rulings processes

54.  The unintended legislative change process set out in this Panel Statement does not affect the operation of the disputes process or the rulings process. The unintended legislative change process sits alongside those statutory processes.
55.  In each case, taxpayers and Inland Revenue will need to consider whether commencement of a dispute could be delayed or continuation of a dispute be suspended while an issue is referred through this process. This process does not override existing legislative time-bar or response periods.
56.  Please note the ITA 2007 contains savings provisions that allow existing binding rulings to continue to apply.

Parents’ payments to private school were not unconditional gifts, but were consideration for the supply of education services and subject to GST
================================================================================================================================================

The disputant challenged the assessments for goods and services tax made by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue for the seven six-monthly GST periods.

Case

XXX \[2018\] NZTRA 08

Legislative References

Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 s 2

### Summary

The disputant challenged the assessments for goods and services tax (“GST”) made by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) for the seven six-monthly GST periods (“the relevant tax periods”).

The disputant argued it was not liable to pay output GST on payments made by parents at one of their schools, as those payments were charitable donations and therefore were unconditional gifts. However, the Commissioner argued those payments were consideration for the provision of education services by the disputant and therefore liable for output GST. The Taxation Review Authority (“the Authority”) found in favour of the Commissioner.

### Impact

The decision will be applicable to a wide range of pre-schools and private schools which may have been treating parent payments as donations when the payments are consideration for educational services.

### Facts

The disputant was established under a Deed of Trust and was registered with Charities Services as a charity whose sector of operation was recorded as “education, training and research” with the charitable purpose of advancement of education. The disputant operates a primary school (“the School”).

The School was treated as a private school under the Education Act 1989 and thus received minimal state funding. The majority of funding for the School came from payments made by parents.

It was accepted that the disputant was registered for GST purposes and that it supplied education services in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity.

### Decision

_Were the payments consideration under the GST Act?_

The Authority found that to constitute “consideration”, it was not necessary that the supply be to the person providing payment, however there must be a sufficient connection (linkage or nexus) between the supply and the payment. This is highlighted by the reciprocity found in the expression “in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of” in s 2.

The Authority found that the s 2 definition of “consideration” clearly includes voluntary payments. There is no requirement for there to be “legally enforceable” reciprocal obligations as to hold such would be inconsistent with the definition.

Details of the School’s funding model as contained on its website, information sheets, and contribution forms sent to current and prospective students’ parents conveyed a clear expectation that parents would pay the amounts requested, or what they were able to afford, and the payments would be used to pay the School’s operating costs including salaries.

In 2013, a scholarship fund was introduced which allowed parents who were unable to commit to making payment of the required amount ($5,000), to meet the remaining amount. However, the Authority found that the concept had been introduced as another way to obtain contributions which may have been less embarrassing for those who did not pay the amount required.

Only six children (two from one family) were identified as having attended the school where either no parent contributions were paid or were not paid for substantial periods of time in the years from 2003 to 2015. In addition, financial contributions from parents ceased or substantially reduced when their children left the School.

Overall the Authority held there was a supply of education services by the disputant to the parents’ children and a payment made by parents to the disputant in connection with the supply of those services. This connection, the Authority said, was sufficient to satisfy the definition of “consideration” in s 2.

_Were the payments unconditional gifts made to the disputant?_

Consideration does not include any payment made as an unconditional gift, as defined in the GST Act. The Authority considered the decision of Judge Barber in _Case U37_ (2009) 19 NZTC 9,353 involving a religious organisation which had received payment from the lessor of premises occupied by the organisation. Barber J found that for there to be an unconditional gift, payment (to a non-profit body) must be voluntary and no direct valuable benefit may arise in the form of goods and services to the payer, or if such benefit does arise, it must not be _conditional or dependant_ on that payment (at \[42\]). The Authority considered that Judge Barber had contemplated that the benefit must not be conditional (contingent) or dependent (reliant) on the voluntary payment in order to be an unconditional gift.

In this case, the Authority found that owing to the School’s communications with parents, those parents were left in no doubt as to the cost of running the school and the need for contributions to be made by them at a level they could afford, in order to meet operating costs.

Whilst children were not excluded from attending the School if their parents were unable to make the contribution (meaning attendance was not “conditional” on making a contribution), the Authority found that the supply of education services by the disputant was “dependant” on the parents’ contributions. If such contributions were not made, the School would not have been able to operate. Furthermore, the Authority found that parents received a direct and valuable benefit because of their contributions being the provision of education for their children.

Accordingly, the Authority found that the contributions made by parents were not unconditional gifts for the purposes of the GST Act.

Part I - Income Tax Amendment Act 1988
======================================

Archived legislative commentary on Part I - Income Tax Amendment Act 1988 from PIB vol 175 May 1988.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 174, May 1988

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_.](/about/about-our-publications)

This Act amends the Income Tax Act 1976 to give effect to:

*   the repeal of the overtime and shift work rebate
*   the amendment to the Social Security Act 1964, which changed the age at which Family Benefit ceases from 16 years of age to 15 years
*   the inclusion of the Alhay Buhay Foundation Trust in the list of charitable organisations
*   changes to section 61 (incomes wholly exempt from tax) which provide:
    *   \- the exemption for income derived by disabled persons from sheltered workshops is increased from $25 to $50 per week
    *   \- income derived from ACCESS Training allowances is exempt
    *   \- certain special annuities are exempt.
*   changes to the definitions of "Variable Principal Debt Instrument" and "Implementation date"
*   changes to the treatment of Exchange Gains or Losses at close of business on 31 March 1987
*   an amendment to section 106B to ensure that certain persons in receipt of withholding payments are subject to the record keeping requirements
*   correcting an incorrect reference to the GST Act in section 140B
*   allowing a deduction for expenditure incurred in complying with both the Income Tax Act and the Goods and Services Tax Act
*   the repeal of the:-
    *   \- Co-operative Dairy Companies
    *   \- Co-operative Milk Marketing Companies
    *   \- Co-operative Pig Marketing Companies
*   respective appeal authorities
*   the intention of the fringe benefit tax provisions in relation to the calculation of low interest loans. In particular those loans issued prior to the introduction of FBT which do not have reviewable interest rates
*   the change whereby certificates of entitlement can be delivered by Inland Revenue directly to the Social Welfare Department.

### Section 1 - Short Title and Application

This section provides that this Act is to be read together with, and form part of, the Income Tax Act 1976. Where a specific application date is not provided for in any section of this Act, it will apply with effect from the 24th of March 1988, the day on which the legislation received the Governor General's assent.

### Section 2 - Overtime and Shift Work Rebate

The overtime and shift work rebate was repealed with effect from the 1st of October 1982. This amendment simply repeals the section of the Act (section 45) which granted the rebate.

This section comes into force on 1 April 1988.

### Section 3 - Overtime and Shift Work Recognition Authority

This section repeals section 46 of the Income Tax Act. Section 46 set up an Overtime and Shift Work Recognition Authority which is no longer required, following the abolition of the rebate.

This section comes into force on 1 April 1988.

### Section 4, 16, and 17 - Family Benefit Cessation

These sections amend sections 50C (Transitional Tax Allowance), 374D (Family Support), and 374E (Guaranteed Minimum Family Income) respectively.

These amendments are consequential changes made because of the amendments to the Social Security Act 1964, which changed the age at which Family Benefit ceases from 16 years of age to 15 years.

These amendments bring the Transitional Tax Allowance, the Family Support and the Guaranteed Minimum Family Income tax credits, into line with the cut off age for the family benefit.

These consequential amendments have no practical effect in relation to payments already made, but will apply to future payments.

These sections have been deemed to come into force on 1 October 1986.

### Section 5 - Rebate in Respect of Gifts and Money and Payment of School Fees

This section amends section 56A of the Income Tax Act 1976 which allows a rebate in respect of gifts of money and the payment of school fees. This amendment includes in the list of charitable organisations, the Alhay Buhay Foundation Trust.

This section shall apply to donations made on or after the 1st of April 1987.

### Section 6 - Incomes Wholly Exempt from Income Tax

This section amends section 61 of the Income Tax Act 1976 which provides for certain types of income to be wholly exempt from tax.

**Subsection (1) - Disabled persons from sheltered workshops**

This subsection increases the exemption from tax of income derived by disabled persons from sheltered workshops, from $25 to $50 per week.

This subsection applies to income derived on or after the 1st of April 1988.

**Subsection (2) - ACCESS training allowances**

This subsection exempts from tax, income derived from ACCESS Training allowances.

This subsection applies to ACCESS Training allowances derived on or after the 1st of April 1987.

**Subsection (3) - Monetary annuities from Consolidated Account**

This subsection retrospectively exempts special annuities that are granted, and not designated as taxable, by Cabinet.

This subsection applies to income derived from special annuities on or after the 1st of April 1982.

### Section 7 - Interpretation - Definition of "Variable Principal Debt Instrument" and "Implementation date"

Subsection (2) of this section removes from the definition of "variable principal debt instrument" all call debt that -

1.  Is denominated in New Zealand dollars and
2.  Does not contemplate further advances at call under the same financial arrangement.

Where an asset is sold and the vendor accepts as part settlement debt fixed in New Zealand dollars and at call (a common mechanism in estate-planning practice), that debt is not a variable principal debt instrument.

If in the above example the debt had been fixed in Australian dollars, sterling, deutschmarks or any other currency not New Zealand dollars the debt would be a variable principal debt instrument.

A financial arrangement that allows further advances at call (such as a cheque account whether in New Zealand dollars or any other currency) remains a variable principal debt instrument.

Subsection (1) of this section is consequential upon subsection (2). It deals only with those financial arrangements that were previously treated as variable principal debt instruments, but are now excluded from the definition of variable principal debt instrument by the enactment of subsection (2). Its only purpose is to provide an implementation date for those instruments.

The implementation date provided is 31 March 1987. All such financial arrangements entered into on or before 31 March 1987 are not subject to sections 64B to M of the Income Tax Act. All such financial arrangements entered into after 31 March 1987 are subject to sections 64B to M.

This section shall apply from the commencement of the accrual tax accounting regime.

### Section 8 - Transitional Provision for Variable Principal Debt Instruments - Treatment of Exchange Gain or Loss at Close of Business on 31 March 1987

**Subsection (1)**

This subsection repeals section 64K of the Income Tax Act and replaces it with a new section 64K.

The new section 64K(1) is exactly the same as the old section 64K, except that it is now a subsection. This is a drafting convenience and does not affect the meaning of the provision.

Section 64K(2) is the substantive new provision. It remedies an oversight in the law as it previously stood.

Section 71(5) of the Income Tax Act provides that section 71 shall not apply in respect of any financial arrangement to which sections 64B to M apply. Section 64L provides that income and expenditure in respect of a financial arrangement to which sections 64B to M apply are to be calculated pursuant to sections 64B to M. Section 104 provides a deduction for any expenditure or loss incurred, and income tax is levied only on income derived. Prior to the enactment of the accrual tax accounting regime unrealised exchange variations were not expenditure or losses incurred or income derived. Sections 64B to M did not previously provide any treatment for the unrealised exchange variation on a foreign currency denominated variable principal debt instrument at close of business on 31 March 1987.

Given that -

1.  Foreign currency denominated variable principal debt instruments are subject to sections 64B to M; and
2.  An unrealised exchange loss is not an expenditure or loss incurred and
3.  An unrealised exchange gain is not income derived -

any unrealised exchange variation on a variable principal debt instrument at close of business on 31 March 1987 was not brought to account for income tax purposes. If it was a gain, the gain was not assessable; if it was a loss, the loss was not deductible.

The new section 64K(2) brings such exchange variations to account on 1 April 1987. It applies only for the purpose of determining the income tax treatment of the unrealised exchange variation on a foreign currency denominated variable principal debt instrument at the close of business on 31 March 1987 and for no other purpose.

Section 64K(2) operates by -

1.  Deeming the variable principal debt instrument to have been repaid in full on 1 April 1987 (section 64K(2)(a) refers); and
2.  Providing that the amount of the deemed repayment shall be the same as the amount of the deemed acquisition price of the variable principal debt instrument on 1 April 1987 under section 64B(2) (section 64K(2)(b) refers) and
3.  Providing that, notwithstanding section 71(5), the amount of any exchange variation arising on the deemed repayment shall be dealt with under section 71 - that is, any loss is deductible if a deduction is allowed by section 71 and any gain is assessable if included in assessable income under section 71 (section 64K(2)(c) refers).

**Subsection (2) - Repeals**

This subsection consequentially repeals earlier amending legislation.

The amendments in section 8 of the Amendment Act apply from the commencement of the accrual tax accounting regime.

### Section 9 - Limitation of deduction for motor vehicles where insufficient records are kept

This section amends section 106B of the Tax Act which requires taxpayers to maintain records of motor vehicle usage to substantiate claims for expenditure and depreciation.

The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that persons in receipt of withholding payments who are not limited to claims for deductions by section 105 and the Fourth Schedule (being all withholding payments other than casual agricultural payments) are subject to the record keeping requirements. Prior to this amendment companies and employees were exempted from maintaining records of use of motor vehicles. However, the definition of "employee" in section 2 of the Act includes all persons in receipt of source deduction payments, which is further defined in section 6 of the principal Act to include withholding payments. As a result persons receiving withholding payments were not subject to section 106B, although they are in general treated as self employed persons for ACC levies and claims for expenditure.

**Subsection (1) - Record keeping requirement**

This subsection amends section 106B(2) by amending paragraph (a) so as that the record keeping requirements apply to:

"any person other than a company and other than a person who is subject to section 105 of this Act"

Persons subject to section 105 include persons in receipt of salary, wages, extra emoluments and casual agricultural payments (the latter being a withholding payment subject to the expenditure limitations of section 105). Therefore all persons in receipt of other withholding payments will be obliged to maintain the same records of use of motor vehicles as any other self-employed person.

Full details on the requirements of section 106B are contained in PIB 147.

**Subsection (2) - Application**

This section applies from the income year which commences on 1 April 1988.

### Section 10 - Accounting for goods and services tax

This section amends section 140B of the principal Act by removing an incorrect reference to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 and substituting the correct reference.

Section 140B(6)(a)(ii) of the Income Tax Act 1976 currently provides that the cost price of an asset for depreciation purposes shall be reduced by any amount of input tax deductible under section 20(3)(a) of the GST Act in relation to an adjustment made in terms of section 21(5) of the GST Act. The reference to section 20(3)(a) is incorrect as it is section 20(3)(e) of the GST Act that specifically provides for an input tax credit in respect of a section 21(5) adjustment.

**Subsection (1)**

This subsection replaces the expression "section 20(3)(a)" with the correct reference "section 20(3)(e)".

**Subsection (2) - Application**

This amendment applies with respect to the income year that commenced on the 1st day of April 1986 being the commencement date off section 140B of the Income Tax Act 1976. This is to avoid any confusion that may have arisen in relation to this drafting error.

### Section 11 - Expenditure relating to determination of liability to tax

This section amends section 165 of the principal Act by repealing this provision and introducing a new section that allows, as a deduction for income tax purposes, the expenditure incurred in complying with both the Income Tax Act and the GST Act.

Currently, the Income Tax Act does not contain any specific provision that would allow a deduction of the costs incurred by a registered person in complying with their GST obligations. It is arguable that expenditure incurred in respect of the preparation and filing of GST returns is deductible in terms of section 104(b) of the Income Tax Act as being expenditure necessarily incurred in the carrying on of a business for the purposes of producing assessable income. Costs incurred in objecting to assessments and determination of the Commissioner are not necessarily incurred in the carrying on of a business and therefore are not deductible in terms of that section.

To remove any uncertainty and recognise the fact that these costs are necessarily incurred by taxpayers in producing their assessable income, section 165 has been amended to allow a deduction for such costs. The costs incurred in complying with any GST obligation will be deductible unless income derived by the taxable activity carried on by the registered person is not assessable for income tax purposes.

**Subsection (1) - Expenditure relating to determination of liability to tax**

This subsection repeals section 165 of the Income Tax Act and substitutes a new section. The following is a commentary on the new section.

**Section 165**

**Subsection (1) - Interpretation**

This subsection defines for the purposes of this section the meaning of the terms 'goods and services tax payable', 'registered person', 'taxable activity' and 'taxable period' by reference to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985.

**Subsection (2) - Deduction Allowance**

This subsection provides a deduction, in calculating the assessable income of a taxpayer, for any expenditure incurred in relation to:

1.  The preparation and the filing of income tax returns.
2.  The preparation and the filing of GST returns.
3.  The preparation, institution, or presentation of an objection or appeal against an assessment or a determination made by the Commissioner in respect of a taxpayer under the Income Tax and GST Acts.
4.  A contribution by a taxpayer towards the expenditure of any other taxpayer. This applies where the other taxpayers expenditure is deductible under the provisions of this section and the contributing taxpayer has objected or appealed against an assessment or a determination on a related matter.

**Subsection (3) - Deemed Assessable Income**

This subsection deems any amount received by way of reimbursement, recovery, or by award of the Court in respect of an amount allowed as a deduction under this section to be assessable income.

**Subsection (4) - Exemption**

This subsection provides that no deduction shall be allowed under this section for expenditure incurred in relation to:

1.  A matter or assessment arising in relation to either an income tax return or a GST return where the Commissioner is of the opinion that the return was fraudulent or wilfully misleading.
2.  An offence under any of the Inland Revenue Acts.
3.  A penal tax assessment issued in terms of the Income Tax Act or GST Act provided that the assessment is not subsequently cancelled.
4.  An objection or appeal that the Commissioner considers is of an inconsequential or frivolous nature.
5.  A matter or assessment arising in relation to the GST Act in respect of a taxable activity carried on by the registered person that does not constitute a business for income tax purposes.

**Subsection (2) - Application**

This subsection provides that the new section 165 shall apply with respect to the tax on income derived in the income year that commenced on the 1st of April 1985. This will enable a taxpayer to claim for income tax purposes any expenditure incurred in relation to:

1.  The requirement to register for GST.
2.  The determination of taxable periods and accounting basis.
3.  The preparation and filing of GST returns.

It should be noted that the GST Act has also been amended to allow an input tax credit of the GST component of such expenditure (section 11 of the GST Amendment Act 1988 refers).

### Section 12 - Co-operative Dairy Companies, Section 13 - Co-operative Milk Marketing Companies, Section 14 - Co-operative Pig Marketing Companies

These sections amend sections 201, 202 and 203 respectively to replace references to the respective appeal authorities with references to the Taxation Review Authority.

The amendments come into force in the 1st of April 1988.

### Section 15 - Value of fringe benefit

This section amends section 336O(2) of the Tax Act, which provides the method to be used to calculate the value of low interest loan fringe benefits. In particular, the amendment is concerned with loans issued prior to the introduction of fringe benefit tax (1 April 1985) which do not have reviewable interest rates.

Non-reviewable interest rate loans issued prior to 1 April 1985 are valued for fringe benefit tax purposes at the non-concessionary rates of interest as specified in the Income Tax (Fringe Benefit Tax, Interest on Loans) Regulations 1985.

Prior to this amendment, in order to qualify as a non reviewable interest rate loan, there must have been an express provision in the loan agreement specifying that the interest rate was not subject to review. However, as a result of the High Court decision in the case of Waitomo District Council v CIR it was found that .section 336O(2)(b) may never have application because it is not legal practice to insert such a clause into a loan agreement. The Judge concluded that the wording of the proviso was not consistent with its intention. In his view the intention of the proviso was that there must not be an express provision for review of the interest rate in the loan agreement if it is to qualify as a non-reviewable loan.

**Subsection (1) - Value of fringe benefit - loans**

This subsection amends paragraph (b) of the proviso to section 336O(2) to realign the legislation with legal practice.

That paragraph now reads:

"The rate of interest payable on that loan is not subject to review."

**Subsection (2) - Application**

This section shall apply to the tax on fringe benefits provided on or after the quarter commencing 1 April 1988. However, as the High Court decision was made on 11 August 1987, being within the quarter which commenced on 1 July 1987, the Courts interpretation of the intention of the legislation will be applied in relation to that quarter and each subsequent quarter. Unless there is a current objection held on this matter for any quarter prior to that which commenced on 1 July 1987 no reassessments will be made. This amendment merely provides legislative authority to the Courts interpretation.

Where an employer considers that an agreement made prior to 1 April 1985 will now qualify as a non-reviewable interest rate loan that employer will be required to submit to the Department a copy of the loan agreement, any variations to that agreement and any relevant correspondence. From those facts, the Department will determine whether the loan qualifies as a non reviewable interest rate loan and whether the benefit to the employee should be valued using the non-concessionary rates of interest.

### Section 18 - Credit of Tax by Instalment

This section amends section 374G of the Income Tax Act 1976 which provides for the Family Support tax credit to be paid by instalments.

This section provided that where any Family Support was paid through the Social Welfare Department, the certificate of entitlement was to be delivered to the applicant who in turn delivered it to Social Welfare.

The amendment will now allow the certificate of entitlement to be delivered, by Inland Revenue, directly to the Social Welfare Department.

This section shall have effect from 24 March 1988, the date of Governor-General's assent.

### Section 19 - Additional tax to be charged if default made in payment of tax

**Subsection (1) - Additional tax imposition**

This section repeals paragraph (1) of section 398(2) of the principal Act and substitutes a new paragraph. The amendment corrects a drafting error which allowed a one-day grace period before the imposition of additional tax where there was a default in the payment of tax. This amendment removes the one day grace period so that additional tax is not imposed on any amount of tax remaining unpaid at the expiry of either the due date of the tax or the date of demand of the tax.

**Subsection (2) - Application**

Subsection (1) of this section applies to the payment of 1987 terminal tax and 1988 provisional tax.

Section 2 - Definition of Extra Emolument
-----------------------------------------

This section amends the definition of "extra emolument" where that definition relates to retiring allowances and redundancy payments.

As a result of amendments introduced in section 5 of the Amendment Act, retiring allowances paid on or after 1 October 1988 (as described in section 68(2) of the Tax Act) will be subject to FBT at 24 cents in the dollar. Redundancy payments (as defined in section 68) paid on or after 1 October 1988 will be subject to tax as follows:

*   5% of the specified sum will be deemed to be assessable income, and
*   where the Redundancy Payment exceeds the specified sum, the excess will be subject to FBT at 24 cents in the dollar.

The amendment to the definition of "extra emolument" ensures that:

1.  No part of the Retiring Allowance will be deemed to be an extra emolument, and<</li>
2.  Only 5% of the specified sum relating to redundancy payments (as defined) will be deemed to be an extra emolument.

Section 3 - Low Income Rebate
-----------------------------

Section 3 of the Amendment Act introduces a new section, 50D, to the principal Act to provide a rebate for low income earners. This rebate is designed to compensate low income earners for the increase in the lower marginal tax rate from 15 cents to 24 cents in the dollar.

This rebate is only available to natural persons, absentees do not qualify for the rebate.

The rebate, in general, increases at the rate of 9 cents in the dollar up to a maximum rebate of $855 at an income level of $9,500. The rebate abates at the rate of 4 cents in the dollar for every whole dollar that exceeds $9,500 income.

In general the rebate is calculated on income **EXCLUDING** income from interest, dividends, royalties, rents, or income derived from a trust. **FOR SUPERANNUITANTS** the rebate is calculated on income **INCLUDING** income from interest, dividends, royalties, rents, or income derived from a trust.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Paragraph (a) | of subsection 50D(1) provides that for National Superannuitants, the rebate is calculated at 9 cents in the dollar of assessable income up to $9,500 per annum INCLUDING income from interest, dividends, royalties, rents, or trusts. |
| Paragraph (b) | of subsection 50D(1) provides that for taxpayers, other than National Superannuitants, the rebate is calculated at 9 cents in the dollar of assessable income up to $9,500 per annum NOT INCLUDING income from interest, dividends, royalties, rents, or income derived from a trust pursuant to section 227 of the principal Act. |
| Paragraph (c) | For both classes of taxpayer the rebate is abated as follows. |
|     | X - Y |
|     | X is defined as; |
|     | Where the taxpayer is a national superannuitant $855. |
|     | Where the taxpayer is not a national superannuitant an amount equal to the lesser of $855 or an amount equal to9 cents in the dollar of assessable income excluding income from interest, dividends, royalties, rent, or income derived from a trust. |
|     | Y is defined as; |
|     | An amount equal to 4 cents in each complete dollar of the amount of the taxpayer's assessable income that exceeds $9,500. |

**Subsection 50D(2)** deals with the situation where the taxpayer qualifies for the Low Income Rebate for only part of the income year due to the taxpayer's arrival in New Zealand or departure from New Zealand during the income year.

Where the taxpayer is present in New Zealand for part of the income year, eligibility for the rebate is determined on the basis of the taxpayer's total assessable income for the income year, apportioned in relation to the number of days the person is present in New Zealand compared to the number of days in the income year.

**Subsection 50D(3)** gives the Commissioner the authority to determine the amount of the assessable income of the taxpayer having regard to the class or classes of income, where the taxpayer is present in New Zealand for only part of the income year.

**Subsection (2)** the Amendment Act deals with the transitional provisions that are needed for the 1988/89 income year because the Low Income Rebate comes into effect half way through the income year.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Paragraph (a) | Limits the 9 cent rebate to the half year equivalent of 4.5 cents in the dollar. |
| Paragraph (b) | Limits the maximum amount that can be claimed for the 1988/89 income year$427.50. |
| Paragraph (c) | Reduces the abatement rate for the1988/89 income year to 2 cents in the dollar on income over $9,500. |

**Subsection (3)** of the Amendment Act ensures that this rebate is taken into account in the computation of the taxpayer's income tax by amending section 57(2) of the principal Act to include the words "section 50D" in the list of rebates.

**Subsection (4)** Ensures that the transitional provisions that apply for the 1988/89 income year expire on the 1st of April 1989.

**Subsection (5)** of the Amendment Act provides that the Low Income Rebate comes into force on the 1st of April 1988 but the rebate will only be available for source deduction purposes after 1 October 1988.

This rebate will be incorporated into the new tax tables that take effect from 1 October 1988.

Section 4 - Incomes Wholly Exempt from Tax
------------------------------------------

Section 4 amends section 61 of the principal Act which deals with sources of income that are exempt from income tax.

**Subsection (1)** Repeals paragraph (11) of Section 61 which previously provided that gratuities granted or paid pursuant to the Defence Act 1971 to members of the territorial forces of New Zealand or the Air Force Reserve or as a cadet officer of the Air training Corps, were exempt up to a maximum amount of $300 in an income year. With the repeal of this paragraph such amounts are now fully taxable.

This treatment applies with effect from the tax on income derived in income year that commenced on 1 April 1988.

**Subsection (2)** Inserts a new paragraph (11A) into section 61 of the principal Act.

This new paragraph exempts from tax income derived from compensation payments distributed from the fund approved by the Minister in Charge of War Pensions and paid to ex-prisoners of war who were held in German concentration camps during World War II.

These compensation payments were only paid out in 1987 to ex-prisoners of war who were held in German concentration camps, with the intention that these payments would be exempt from tax and would thus not need to be declared for income tax purposes. Therefore this exemption is backdated to apply with respect to the tax on the income derived in the income year that commenced on the 1st of April 1987 so that none of these compensation payments will be subject to income tax.

If any taxpayer has included this type of compensation payment in the calculation of their assessable income, then they can apply to have their return reassessed.

**Subsection (3)** amends section 61(24) of the principal Act. This amendment makes a minor change to replace the approving authority for encouraging scientific or industrial research from the National Research Advisory Council, to the Royal Society of New Zealand.

This subsection applies retrospectively from 1 January 1987.

Section 5 - Retiring Allowances Payable to Employees
----------------------------------------------------

### Retirement and Redundancy

Sections 2, 5, 11, 12 and 13 of the Amendment Act relate to the tax treatment of Retirement Allowances and redundancy payments.

Previously lump sum retiring allowances and redundancy payments were subject to a concessionary tax regime whereby the lump sum was deemed to be assessable income to the following extent only:

*   5% of the specified sum (as defined in section 68)
*   Any excess over the specified sum.

This treatment has been discontinued for both types of lump sum payments and the tax treatment of redundancy payments paid on or after 1 October 1988 will differ from the treatment of retiring allowances paid on or after 1 October 1988.

### Redundancy Payments

A definition of "Redundancy Payment" has been introduced into section 68(1) of the Tax Act. (See section 5(2) of the Amendment Act). The intention of the definition is to restrict the concessionary tax treatment to payments resulting from genuine redundancies.

### Definition of Redundancy Payment

The definition of "Redundancy Payment" replaces the provisions of section 68(4) which provided that in certain circumstances a redundancy payment was deemed to be a retiring allowance paid on the occasion of a taxpayer's retirement. Subsection (4) is accordingly repealed. (Section (5)(1)(e) of the Amendment Act refers).

In order for a lump sum payment to qualify as a redundancy payment:

*   it must be made as a consequence of the termination of employment by an employer, and
*   the termination must be wholly or mainly as a result of the position of the employee becoming superfluous to the needs of the employer.

A lump sum payment to a seasonal worker can qualify as a redundancy payment as long as the above conditions are met. A payment relating to a seasonal lay-off would not qualify **unless** those conditions are met.

Other exclusions are:

*   Any lump sum payment made at the end of a fixed term contract, or a contract to complete a specific project. These severance payments do not constitute true "redundancy payments" and should be treated as monetary remuneration.
*   A payment made on the termination of employment, in lieu of notice. This is to be treated as monetary remuneration.
*   Paragraph (f) concerns the deferment of part of an employee's periodic salary or wages, in order to gain a tax free benefit when the employment is terminated. This type of arrangement would be an abuse of the "genuine" redundancy provision, and is therefore excluded.
*   Any payments made to a Director pursuant to a company's articles of Association are also excluded. Such payments would be treated as monetary remuneration.

The above exclusions are in addition to payments which are excluded from the operation of section 68 by subsection (5) of that section.

### Tax Treatment

The tax treatment of redundancy payments paid on or after 1 October 1988 will be as follows:

*   5% of the specified sum is deemed to be assessable income, and that amount will be subject to tax at source at the extra emolument rate, and
*   where the payment exceeds the specified sum, the excess is subject to FBT at 24 cents in the dollar. See examples in Appendix A attached.

### Specified Sum Amendments

Changes made to the definition of "specified sum" are:

1\. References to "employment or service" in the definitions of the term "specified sum", "year of service" and "season" have been amended to read "employment". (Section (5)(1)(a) of the Amendment Act).

2\. A limit of $20,000 is placed on the specified sum. i.e., Where the recipient has been employed by the same employer for ten years or more the specified sum will be the lesser of:

*   one third of the total remuneration paid in respect of that employment for the 3 years immediately preceding the date of redundancy, or
*   $20,000. (See section 5(3) of the Amendment Act).

Where the recipient has been employed by the same employer for less than 10 years the specified sum is calculated according to the formula:

a × b 10

Where:

*   a is the number of complete years of service of the taxpayer in that employment, and
*   b is the lesser of:
    *   one third of the total remuneration paid in respect of that employment for the 3 years immediately preceding the redundancy, or
    *   $20,000.

*   (see section 5(4) of the Amendment Act). Also see examples in Appendix attached.

3\. The term "total remuneration", as used in the definition of specified sum, is now defined in section 68. (See section 5(5) of the Amendment Act). The definition provides that only source deduction payments should be taken into account in calculating the specified sum.

### Subsequent Employment

A new subsection (3A) in Section 68 of the Tax Act, (as introduced by section 5(7) of the Amendment Act) applies where a taxpayer who retires from or is made redundant from one employment, is subsequently re-employed by that employer or any other employer and then made redundant from that employment. The effect of the provision is that for the purpose of calculating the specified sum relating to the second redundancy payment:

*   (a) The number of years that the taxpayer has been employed is limited to the number of years in the subsequent employment, and
*   (b) Total remuneration relates only to total remuneration derived during the period of the subsequent employment.

### Retiring Allowances

Retiring allowances paid on or after 1 October 1988 are deemed not to be assessable income in the recipients' hands but are subject to fringe benefit tax at 24 cents in the dollar. (See section 5(6) of the Amendment Act which repeals and substitutes section 68(2) of the Tax Act).

### Payments to Directors

Section (5)(1)(g) of the Amendment Act repeals paragraph (a) of section 68(5). The effect of that paragraph was that previously certain payments made to Directors were excluded from the operation of section 68. The treatment of lump sum payments to Directors on or after 1 October 1988 will be as follows:

_Redundancy Payments_

*   The definition of redundancy payment excludes "any payment made by a company pursuant to its Articles of Association to any of its Directors". Any such payment would be treated as monetary remuneration in the Director's hands.
*   A redundancy payment made to a Director, which was NOT pursuant to the Articles of Association could qualify for the concessional treatment, as long as the definition of redundancy payment was satisfied.

_Retiring Allowances_

*   Any lump sum payment which satisfies the conditions of section 68(2) would not be assessable income in the Director's hands but would be subject to FBT at 24 cents in the dollar.
*   Any other lump sum payments made by an employer would be monetary remuneration and subject to tax in the Director's hands.

### Payments to Shareholders or Related Persons

Existing provisions, see section 152 of the Tax Act, allow the Commissioner to disallow a deduction to an employer where the amount of a redundancy payment or retiring allowance paid to a shareholder or related person is considered to be excessive. Those provisions and the tax treatment of excessive amounts, (see section 152(4) of The Act), continue.

FBT will not be payable on any excess. For full details of the tax treatment of these amounts see Appendix B to this TPC.

### Payments to Armed Forces

Section 68(6) is unaffected by the amendments. Certain defined gratuities are excluded from the operation of section 68, and the tax treatment of those gratuities continues on the previous basis.

Section 6 - Transitional provision for herd scheme
--------------------------------------------------

This section amends a transitional provision in the livestock legislation dealing with the herd scheme. Livestock written up to herd values at the end of the 1987 income year are deemed to be valued according to the provisions of section 86A of the Tax Act. This ensures that in the 1988 income year those livestock take for their opening and closing value, the herd value declared for the 1988 income year. This means that any increase in herd values above the 1987 values does not create a tax liability. This achieves the so called "inflation proofing" effect of the herd scheme.

Section 7 - FBT Paid Overseas not Deductible
--------------------------------------------

This section amends section 106 of the Tax Act which disallows the deduction of certain types of expenditure. Specific mention is made in section 106 to fringe benefit tax paid in New Zealand but not to fringe benefit taxes paid overseas. This clause inserts a reference to fringe benefit taxes paid overseas to ensure that this expenditure is not deductible for New Zealand taxpayers.

The amendment takes effect from the income year commencing 1 April 1988.

Section 8 - Income Derived by Non-Specified Trusts
--------------------------------------------------

This section amends section 230 of the Tax Act. The exemption of $100 applying to income derived by non-specified trusts is withdrawn with effect from the income year commencing on 1 April 1988.

Section 9 - Determination of Specified Exemption
------------------------------------------------

Section 9 of this amendment Act deals with the specified exemption that a national superannuitant can earn before the surcharge starts to apply.

Section 336BA of the principal Act sets out the procedure for calculating the specified exemption for a national superannuitant's other income before the surcharge starts to take effect.

Section 9 of the Amendment Act decreases the specified exemption from $7,800 to $7,202 for recipients of the single rate of National Superannuation and from $6,500 to $6,006 for recipients of the married rate of National Superannuation. The combined specified exemption for a married couple has decreased from $13,000 to $12,012.

This section comes into force on the 1st of April 1989 and will apply to source deduction payments derived on or after that date.

**Subsection (1)**

Inserts the decreased specified exemption levels into section 336BA(1) of the principal Act.

**Subsection (2)**

makes a consequential amendment to section 336L(1A) of the principal Act in order to specify the pay period equivalents of the new exemption level of $7,202 for recipients of the single rate of National Superannuation for the purposes of the "SAJ" code.

**Subsection (3)**

Makes a consequential amendment to section 336L(2) of the principal Act in order to specify the pay period equivalents of the new exemption level of $6,006 for recipients of the married rate of National Superannuation for the purposes of the "MAJ" code.

**Subsection (4)**

Makes an amendment to section 356(1) of the principal Act. At present, national superannuitants who receive more than $6,500 of taxable income in addition to their National Superannuation are excluded from being "pay period taxpayers" as the term is defined in section 356(1) of the principal Act.

This subsection consequently amends that definition as a result of the new specified exemption levels to ensure that only those national superannuitants who receive more than $6,006 of taxable income in addition to their National Superannuation will be excluded from being "pay period taxpayers"

**Subsection (5)**

Repeals the previous amendments to the specified exemption level.

**Subsection (6)**

Is the application date subsection. It provides for this section of the Amendment Act to come into force in the income year that commences on the 1st of April 1989.

Section 10 - National Superannuitant Surcharge Rate
---------------------------------------------------

This section amends section 336 of the principal Act. The amendment introduces a new national superannuitant surcharge rate to take effect from the 1st of October 1988.

Subsection (1) - of the Amendment Act amends section 336D(1) of the principal Act with the effect of increasing the surcharge rate from 18 to 20 cents in the dollar for each dollar of the national superannuitant's other income.

**Subsection (2)**

Amends section 336(2)(a) of the principal Act to allow surcharge deductions to be made from the national superannuitant's other income at the new rate of 20 cents in the dollar.

**Subsection (3)**

Provides for the national superannuitant surcharge to be assessed at a composite rate of 19 cents in the dollar for the 1988/89 income year.

**Subsection (4)**

Repeals the previous amendments to the surcharge rate.

**Subsection (5)**

Provides that subsections (1) and (3) of this section will apply for the 1988/89 income year and every subsequent year.

**Subsection (6)**

Provides that subsection (2) of this section shall apply in respect of every source deduction payment made on or after 1 October 1988.

Section 11 - Corrections to Definition of Fringe Benefit
--------------------------------------------------------

This section corrects two drafting errors which occurred when section 336N(1) was amended by section 17 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 2) 1988. The other effects of section 11 are outlined under the explanation of sections 11-13 following.

*   Subsection (1) ensures that Contributions to the Government Superannuation Fund are "contributions to a designated fund", which has the effect that such contributions are subject to FBT at the rate of 24 percent and not 48 percent.
*   Subsection (2) amends paragraph (db) of the definition of Fringe Benefit by deleting the word "Superannuation" immediately preceding the word "contributions". This ensures that contributions to any friendly societies, sick, accident or death benefit funds, as qualified under the definition "Contribution to a non-designated fund" in section 17 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 2) 1988, will qualify for the 35 percent FBT rate rather than the 48 percent rate.

This amendment was needed because contributions in relation to these funds are not "superannuation" contributions.

Sections 11 to 13 - Fringe Benefit Tax on Retiring Allowances and Redundancy Payments
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These sections impose a fringe benefit tax liability on:

*   Lump sum retiring allowances (as described in section 68(2) as amended), paid on or after 1 October 1988 and
*   The amount by which a redundancy payment (as defined in section 68), paid on or after 1 October 1988, exceeds the specified sum.

(Where a retiring allowance or redundancy payment to a shareholder or related person is considered by the Commissioner to be excessive, the deduction for any excess is disallowed in calculating the employer's assessable income, and FBT is not payable on the excess. For full details of the tax treatment of these payments see Appendix B).

The rate of FBT which will apply to these payments is 24 cents in the dollar.

These effects are achieved in the legislation in the following way.

Section 11(3) inserts two new paragraphs in the definition of "Fringe Benefit" in section 336N:

*   (dc) Relates to retiring allowances deemed not to be assessable income under section 68(2).
*   (dd) Relates to any amount of a redundancy payment (as defined in section 68 of the Tax Act) which exceeds the specified sum (as amended by sections 5(1)(a), and 5(3) of the Amendment Act).

Section 11(4)(a) is a consequential amendment which is required simply as a result of the insertion of the new paragraphs (dc) and (dd) in the definition of fringe benefit.

Section 11(4)(b) amends paragraph (k) of the definition of Fringe Benefit in section 336N. Previous to the amendment FBT did not apply to any benefit to which section 68 applied. This paragraph makes the necessary amendment.

Prior to the passing of this Amendment Act paragraph (f) of the definition of fringe benefits provided that FBT did not apply to any benefit provided by a private company to a major shareholder. Section 11(5) makes the necessary amendment to ensure that FBT can be imposed where appropriate.

Paragraph (j)(ii) of the definition of fringe benefit in section 336N provided, prior to this Amendment Act, that FBT would not apply to any benefit which is income that is exempt from tax in accordance with Part IV of the Tax Act. Section 68 (in Part IV of The Act) exempts from income tax:

1.  Retiring allowances, and
2.  Any redundancy payment, other than 5% of the "specified sum".

In order to ensure that FBT can be imposed, section 11(6) introduces two new subparagraphs to exclude the relevant benefits from the operation of paragraph (j)(ii).

Section 12 amends section 336O of the Tax Act (value of fringe benefit). Two new subsections have been inserted. They are:

Subsection (3C) - where a lump sum retiring allowance is deemed not to be assessable income under section 68(2) of the Tax Act, the value of the fringe benefit is the amount of that lump sum payment.

Subsection (3D) - Where part of a redundancy payment is deemed not to be assessable income by section 68(2A) of the Tax Act, the value of the fringe benefit is the amount by which the payment exceeds the specified sum.

Section 13 amends section 336S. (Fringe Benefit Tax imposed). The rate of FBT applying to redundancy payments and retiring allowances is 24 cents in the dollar.

Section 14 - Family Support Credit of Tax
-----------------------------------------

Section 14 amends section 374D of the principal Act which deals with the family support credit of tax.

This section of the Amendment Act does two things. First, it increases from $15,000 to $16,000 the amount of income that a taxpayer, who is eligible for Family Support, can have before their Family Support starts to abate.

Secondly, the section increases the abatement rate from 18 cents to 30 cents in the dollar on so much of the taxpayer's income that exceeds $27,000. The new abatement rates and ranges are as follows:

On so much of the taxpayer's income that exceeds $16,000 but is not more than $27,000, the abatement rate is 18 cents in the dollar.

On so much of the taxpayer's income that exceeds $27,000, the abatement rate is 30 cents in the dollar.

These changes take effect from 1 October 1988.

Because the changes occur part way through the current income year, composite exemption levels and abatement rates are needed for the 1988/89 income year. These are as follows:

Where the taxpayer's income is less than $15,000, the abatement rate is zero.

On so much of the taxpayer's income that exceeds $15,000 but does not exceed $16,000, the abatement rate is 9 cents in the dollar.

On so much of the taxpayer's income that exceeds $16,000 but does not exceed $27,000, the abatement rate is 18 cents in the dollar.

On so much of the taxpayer's income that exceeds $27,000, the abatement rate is 24 cents in the dollar.

These abatement rates only apply for the 1988/89 income year and can be used in any 1988/89 assessments made after the date of assent of the Act (28 July 1988).

Section 15 - Guaranteed Minimum Family Income Credit Of Tax
-----------------------------------------------------------

Section 15 of the Amendment Act amends section 374E of the principal Act which deals with the Guaranteed Minimum Family Income Credit of tax.

Subsection (1) of the Amendment Act, amends section 374E(3) and 374E(4) to provide a Guaranteed Minimum Family Income of $15,288 inclusive of Family Support.

This amendment increases the Guaranteed Minimum Family Income from $270 to $300 per week inclusive of Family Support AND Family Benefit.

The formula in both subsections (3) and (4) of section 374E, has been changed. This change was necessary to ensure that GMFI is inclusive of Family Support in order to provide for greater flexibility in changing the GMFI level without creating high effective marginal tax rates where the family income exceeds the Family Support abatement threshold.

The new formula in section 374E(3) is as follows:

((x-y) x z/52) - w

Where;

**X** is the guaranteed Minimum Family Income Tax Credit of $15,288 per annum.

**Y** is the amount equal to the net specified income of the taxpayer for the income year.

**Z** is the number of weeks in the eligible period in which the person is a full-time earner.

**W** is the amount of Family Support that the person receives in the eligible period.

The new formula for section 374E(4) is as follows:

((x-y) x z/52) - w

Where;

**X** is the Guaranteed Minimum Family Income tax credit of $15,288 per annum.

**Y** is the amount of the net specified income of both spouses.

**Z** is the number of weeks in the eligible period in which the person is a full-time earner.

These changes to the Guaranteed Minimum Family Income legislation mean that the amount of GMFI that a taxpayer is entitled to will need to be calculated separately for each eligible period.

Subsection (2) of this Amendment Act provides that this section shall apply from the 1988/89 income year. Because these changes take effect from 1 April 1988, new certificates of entitlement, which take account of increased GMFI, will need to be issued.

Any excess entitlement in respect of the period from 1 April 1988 and the date the new certificate is issued will be available when the return is furnished at the end of the income year.

Section 16 - Credit of tax by Instalments
-----------------------------------------

Section 16 of the Amendment Act amends section 374G(3) of the principal Act which deals with credit of tax by instalments for Family Support purposes.

Previously the Commissioner could only issue a new certificate if the taxpayer applied for a new certificate of entitlement in person.

The amendment now allows the Commissioner to withdraw any certificate of entitlement and, if necessary, issue an amended certificate where the Commissioner is satisfied that the original certificate of entitlement was incorrect due to changes in the taxpayer's circumstances.

The section has effect from the date the legislation was enacted, the 28th of July 1988.

Sections 17 to 22 - Provisional Tax
-----------------------------------

### INTRODUCTION

Sections 17 to 22 deal with the new provisional tax regime. A general outline of the operation of the regime is provided below and is followed by a more detailed examination of each section.

The Government first announced its intention to change the provisional tax scheme in the Economic Statement released on 17 December 1987. A scheme along the basis of this announcement was introduced into Parliament in the Taxation Reform Bill (No. 4) and was referred to the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee who invited submissions on the bill. In the light of these submissions received the Government decided to defer the implementation of the announced scheme pending further consultation with tax practitioners. An interim scheme based largely on the current provisional tax provisions was enacted instead and will apply in respect of all provisional tax instalments that become due and payable on or after 7 November 1988.

### QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Attached as Appendix C of this PIB are a series of questions and answers which have been prepared to help explain the new provisional tax scheme.

### FLOW DIAGRAMS

Attached as Appendix D of this PIB are a series of flow charts outlining the provisional tax scheme.

GENERAL OUTLINE OF THE SCHEME
-----------------------------

As stated above, the new provisional tax scheme will only apply in respect of provisional tax payments that become due and payable on or after 7 November 1988. The existing provisional tax rules will therefore remain for provisional tax payments due and payable before this date.

The new scheme is provided for by way of a new Part XII in the principal Act and a number of amendments in other Parts.

The major features of the interim scheme are as follows:

**Provisional Tax - Past Year Income Boundaries**

*   Provisional Income Last Year of $3,000 or less The provisional taxpayer is not required to pay provisional tax this year but this provision is subject to the interest charging/paying provisions and the estimation provisions which may apply depending on the taxpayer's current year provisional income.
*   $3,001 - $100,000 Provisional Income Last Year Provisional taxpayers pay provisional tax equal to last year's residual income tax (as defined) increased by 10 percent. Company taxpayers may make an adjustment to last year's residual income tax to take into account the reduced company tax rate. This is a transitional arrangement for the 1988/89 income year only.
*   $100,001 plus Provisional Income Last Year Companies may continue to make an adjustment to last year's residual income tax to take into account the reduced company rate. Individual taxpayers are not required to pay provisional tax on the basis of last year's residual increased 10 percent but instead may pay provisional tax on the basis of last year's residual income tax with no increase. This is to give individual taxpayers some benefit from the drop in the higher marginal tax rates and is also a transitional arrangement for the 1988/89 income year only.

**Provisional Tax - Current Year Income Boundaries**

*   Current Year Provisional Income of $3,000 or less The taxpayer is not a provisional taxpayer so is not required to pay any provisional tax and cannot be charged or receive interest.
*   $3,001 to $100,000 Current Year Provisional Income If the taxpayer is an individual no interest is charged or paid on any under/over payments of residual income tax unless the individual choose to estimate residual income tax. All non-individual provisional taxpayers may be charged interest or paid interest where under/over payments of residual income tax occurs.
*   $100,001 to $1,000,000 Current Year Provisional Income All taxpayers may be charged interest or receive interest.
*   $1,000,001 plus Current Year Provisional Income Taxpayers are required to estimate their residual income tax liability by the 3rd instalment date. All taxpayers may be charged interest or receive interest.
*   Estimation All provisional taxpayers may choose to pay provisional tax on the basis of their estimated liability at any time up until the taxpayer's 3rd instalment date. Estimating taxpayers will receive interest or be charged interest where over/under payments of residual income tax occur.

**Interest for Under and Overpayments**

*   All provisional taxpayers, except individuals who derived less than $100,000 provisional income and who did not pay their provisional tax on the basis of an estimate, will be liable to pay interest at the rate of 10 percent per annum on the amount by which their residual tax for the year exceeds their provisional tax payments made by the date of the third instalment.
*   Where a provisional taxpayer pays provisional tax in excess of the residual tax liability, that taxpayer is entitled to receive interest at the rate of 10 percent on the amount of the overpayment.
*   If a taxpayer commences to be liable to pay provisional tax in the income year, the Commissioner may remit any interest payable by the taxpayer up to a limit of $100. This is a transitional arrangement for the 1988/89 income year only.

**Remission of Additional Tax or Interest**

*   The Commissioner's discretion to remit additional tax for underestimation of provisional tax has been tightened. Remission will now only be considered under limited circumstances.

DETAILED EXAMINATION OF THE LEGISLATION
---------------------------------------

**Section 17(1)** of the Amendment Act inserts a new Part XII into the principal Act.

The new Part XII consists of sections 375-390.

**Section 375 - Interpretation**

This section is the interpretation section and lists 3 definitions relevant to the new Part XII of the principal Act.

1.  **"Provisional Income"** This term is given a meaning which is fundamentally different from that used in the old Part XII. The term is used throughout the new Part and is particularly important in relation to determining whether or not a person is:
    1.  A provisional taxpayer;
    2.  Liable to pay provisional tax;
    3.  Required to make an estimate;
    4.  Liable to interest under the new section 398A or eligible to receive interest under the new section 413A of the principal Act.
2.  Provisional Income is defined as the taxpayer's assessable income **for the current year** other than:
    
    1.  Source deduction payments (as defined in section 6 of the principal Act); and
    2.  Non-resident withholding income (as defined in section 2 of the principal Act).
3.  Because provisional income is used to determine a taxpayer's treatment under the new scheme and not for the purposes of calculating the amount of provisional tax payable, the deduction of losses and subvention payments under section 188 and section 191 of the principal Act are not taken into account.
4.  **"Provisional Taxpayer"** This definition, which is also used throughout the new Part XII, differs from that previously in the Act to the extent that it excludes persons who do not derive more than $3,000 provisional income in the income year. Previously such persons were provisional taxpayer but merely relieved from their obligation to pay provisional tax. Like the former definition, the new definition also excludes companies that do not have a fixed establishment in New Zealand and which are not deemed to be resident in New Zealand within the meaning of Part IV of the principal Act. A provisional taxpayer is therefore basically a person who derives more than $3,000 provisional income (as defined above) in an income year.
5.  **"Residual Income Tax"** In the new Part XII of the principal Act, the term "residual income tax" is used for the purpose of calculating the amount of provisional tax a taxpayer is required to pay and also to calculate the additional tax for underestimation to which an estimating taxpayer may be liable. The term is also used in other Parts of the principal Act, but is separately defined as required. Residual income tax is basically the tax figure at step 8 in the income tax return. This is the amount on which provisional tax has been based in the past and, subject to the uplift factor, will continue to be based on in the new scheme. The amount of the residual tax is basically the amount of the tax assessed and national superannuitant surcharge to which the taxpayer is liable in respect of the income year, reduced by the amount of:
    *   (a) Any tax deductions made from source deduction payments.
    *   (b) The amount of any superannuitant surcharge paid by way of deduction from source deduction payments (including National Superannuation).
    *   (c) The amount of any Family Support or Guaranteed Minimum Family Income tax credits available under Part XIA of the principal Act.
    *   (d) The amount of any export incentives under section 156F or section 156G.
    *   (e) The amount of non-resident withholding tax paid.
    *   (f) The credit for any amount of foreign tax paid.
    *   (g) The credit allowed in respect of any tax paid on behalf of the taxpayer (being a beneficiary of a trust) by the trustee of the trust, or tax paid on behalf of the taxpayer by an agent of the taxpayer.

**Section 376 - Application of This Part**

This section is the equivalent of the former section 375 and sets out the application of the new Part XII.

**Subsection (1)** - provides for all provisional taxpayers (as defined in section 375) to be liable to pay provisional tax in accordance with the new Part XII.

**Subsection (2) -** states that the new provisional tax scheme will apply from the 1988/89 income year onwards.

**Section 377 - Amount of Provisional Tax**

This section sets out the amount of provisional tax a provisional taxpayer is liable to pay in respect of an income year. This is not to be confused with the amount payable in each instalment which is determined elsewhere in the Part.

**Subsection (1) -** establishes that the amount of provisional tax to which a person shall be liable in respect of an income year shall be an amount equal to 110% of the residual income tax of the previous year. (i.e. the amount shown in step 8 of last year's tax return increased by 10 percent.) This is the liability for all provisional taxpayers except those who derived less than $3,000 provisional income in the previous year (i.e. were not provisional taxpayers in respect of that year) or those who estimate their provisional tax liability.

Transitional Provision relates to 1989 year only. This applies to Provisional taxpayers with 1988 Provisional Income in excess of $100,000 - they may base 1989 Provisional Tax on 1988 Residual Income Tax without the 10% uplift.

**Subsection (2) -** relieves provisional taxpayers, who did not derive more than $3,000 provisional income in the previous year, from their obligation to pay provisional tax. Remember that taxpayers who do not derive more than $3,000 provisional income in the current year are, by definition, not provisional taxpayers.

Despite this provision, taxpayers who derive more than $1,000,000 in the current year will nevertheless be required to pay provisional tax on the third instalment date on the basis of their estimated liability. Similarly, interest may nevertheless be chargeable under the new section 398A of the principal Act.

**Subsection (3) -** liability. This subsection simply provides for the provisional tax liability for the year to be equal to the amount estimated, or last re-estimated, by the taxpayer.

**Section 378 - Allowance for Provisional Tax Paid by Agent**

This section is identical to the former section 382 of the principal Act. It provides for the provisional tax payable by a person to be reduced by any amount of provisional tax paid on that person's behalf by an agent.

**Section 379 - Taxpayer to Calculate Amount of Provisional Tax, Subject to Adjustment by Commissioner**

This section originates from section 384 in the former Part XII. Its purpose is to establish the amount of provisional tax to be paid before an assessment of the previous year's tax is made. For example, a taxpayer with a March balance date is required to furnish the tax return for the previous year by the 7th of July. This is also the date by which the first provisional tax instalment is due and payable. Because this means that the payment is due before an assessment is issued, the taxpayer has no accurate basis on which to pay the provisional tax. To overcome this problem, this section provides that the provisional tax payable shall be the amount calculated by the taxpayer in the return, subject to later adjustment.

**Subsection (1) -** provides that the amount of provisional tax a taxpayer is liable for shall be calculated by the taxpayer in the return in the manner required.

**Subsection (2) -** provides for the Commissioner to calculate the amount of provisional tax to which a taxpayer is liable if either:

1.  The taxpayer fails to furnish last year's return; or
2.  The Commissioner believes the return to be inaccurate or incomplete; or
3.  The person has not furnished a return but the Commissioner thinks the taxpayer is liable to pay provisional tax.

The amount of provisional tax calculated by the Commissioner under these circumstances will be treated as if it were the taxpayer's own calculation. Provisional tax payments will then be due and payable accordingly.

**Subsection (3)** - Following the determination of the provisional tax by the Commissioner, the Commissioner may issue a notice to the taxpayer setting out the amounts and times of provisional tax payments to be made. However, if the Commissioner fails to issue such a notice, the taxpayer will nevertheless be liable to the provisional tax.

**Subsection (4)** - prevents the application of the objections to the Commissioner's calculation under Part III of the principal Act.

**Section 380 - Payment of Provisional Tax by Instalments**

While section 377 sets out the amount of provisional tax a taxpayer is liable to pay in respect of the income of an income year, section 380 determines the amounts and times of instalments. The times of payment remain as before with 3 instalments required to be made in the fourth, eighth, and twelfth month of the taxpayer's accounting year. The actual dates are set out in the Eighth Schedule to the principal Act.

The section has been substantially rewritten from its predecessor which was the former section 385. The amount due in each instalment is now made explicitly clear and includes any "catch-up" from earlier instalments.

**Subsection (1)** - requires provisional tax to be paid in three instalments which become due and payable on the 7th day of the months specified in the Eighth Schedule to the principal Act. (i.e. the fourth, eighth, and twelfth month of the taxpayer's accounting year).

**Subsection (2)** - sets out the amount of provisional tax payable in each instalment in any case where the Commissioner has not issued a notice setting out the amounts of provisional tax payable. (i.e. before the previous year's return has been assessed.)

**Subsection (3)** - sets out the amount of provisional tax payable in each instalment that falls after the date on which the Commissioner issues a notice setting out the provisional tax due. (i.e. after the previous year's return has been assessed.)

**Subsection (4)** - provides for this section to be overridden by the provisions of the new section 381. (refer also to the commentary on that section.)

**Section 381 - Amount of Instalments Where Return Not Furnished**

This section originates from the former section 386 which dealt with interim returns. The section has been substantially redrafted to bring it into line with current practices.

The purpose of this section is to make provision for taxpayers who are not required to furnish the previous year's return by the due date of the first or second provisional tax instalment. These are taxpayers with early balance dates or taxpayers who are subject to the extension of time arrangements under section 17 of the principal Act.

Taxpayers may in this situation pay their provisional tax on the basis of their residual income tax for the year before last year. However, instead of increasing that tax by 10 percent, it must be increased by 20 percent. This arrangement only covers the first and second instalments. The provisional tax due on the third instalment remains based on the previous year's tax increased by 10 percent (see section 377(1)). If the return has not been furnished by that date, and the taxpayer pays an amount less than the correct amount (when this eventually becomes known), additional tax for late payment will be charged on the difference.

**Subsection (1)** - sets out to whom this section applies. I.e. Taxpayers who have legitimately not furnished their return for the previous year by the due date of the first or second provisional tax instalment.

**Subsection (2)** - provides for such taxpayers to pay their first and second instalments based on the residual tax for the year before last year, increased by 20 percent.

**Section 382 - Estimated Provisional Tax**

This section originates from the former section 387 and provides for provisional tax payments to be based on the taxpayer's estimated residual income tax for the income year rather than 110 percent of the residual income tax of the previous year. All taxpayers may use this basis of paying provisional tax in respect of any instalment during the year if they wish. Unlike the former section 387, these provisions are not restricted to taxpayers estimating downwards. Naturally, once a taxpayer has elected to use this basis for payment in respect of an instalment, all remaining instalments in respect of the income year must also be made on this basis.

While the option to estimate is open to all provisional taxpayers from any instalment date, taxpayers who derive more than $1 million provisional income must base their third instalment on an estimate. Such taxpayers can therefore not use last year's residual income tax increased by 10 percent as their basis for payment. Additional tax for underestimation will be charged under the provisions of the new section 384 (see commentary on that section for details.)

The provision for taxpayers to re-estimate their provisional tax during the income year is retained. Again re-estimates can only be made up to the date of the third instalment.

**Subsection (1)** - provides for any taxpayer to estimate their residual income tax for the income year and notify the Commissioner of that estimate. Under section 377(3) that estimate then becomes the provisional tax the taxpayer is liable to pay for the income year while section 380 sets out the amount payable in each instalment.

**Subsection (2)** - requires all taxpayers who derive more than $1 million provisional income in an income year to estimate their residual income tax for that income year and notify the Commissioner accordingly.

**Subsection (3)** - provides for provisional taxpayers to re-estimate their residual income tax at any time before the date on which their third instalment becomes due and payable.

**Subsection (4)** - provides for the Commissioner to estimate a taxpayer's residual income tax if the Commissioner has reason to believe the taxpayer's estimate is inadequate. The Commissioner's estimate is not subject to appeal but the taxpayer may submit a further estimate to replace the Commissioner's estimate.

**Subsection (5)** - restricts the amount the Commissioner may estimate under subsection (4) above in cases where the taxpayer was permitted to use last year's residual income tax as the basis for paying this year's provisional tax. The Commissioner may not require the taxpayer to pay more than the taxpayer would be required to pay if that taxpayer had not elected to make an estimate. However, no such limitation exists in respect of taxpayers who derived more than $1 million provisional income and who are required to make an estimate in respect of the third instalment.

**Section 383 - Overestimates to be Set Off Within Specified Group**

This section relates to wholly owned companies within a specified group of companies (as defined under section 191(4) of the principal Act). Companies within such a specified group may, for the purposes of the provisions relating to additional tax and interest, balance out any over and underpayments of provisional tax among each other.

For example, if one company in a specified group consisting of three companies overestimated and overpaid its provisional tax while the other two companies each underestimated and underpaid, the underpayments could be reduced by the amount of the overpayment in order to reduce the amount of interest and/or additional tax (including for underestimation) to be paid by the other members of the group.

**Subsection (1)** - restricts the application of this section to companies with 100 percent common shareholding within a group of companies. The section only applies for the purposes of:

*   section 384 - additional tax for underestimation.
*   section 398 - additional tax for late payment.
*   section 398A - charging of interest for underpaid tax.
*   section 413 - relief from additional tax.
*   section 413A - interest for tax overpaid.

**Subsection (2)** - provides for any company within a specified group of companies to allocate any overpayment of tax to any other company within the specified group to the extent that that company has underpaid tax. The Commissioner must be notified of any such allocation.

**Subsection (3)** - deems any provisional tax allocated by a company to another company in the specified group to be provisional tax paid by the company to which that tax was allocated rather than the company which actually paid the tax. The credit is deemed to be available on the date of the overpayment, not the date the transfer between companies takes place.

**Subsection (4)** - requires any company which allocates its overpaid tax to another company to notify the Commissioner in writing.

**Section 384 - Additional Tax Where Income Tax Underestimated**

This section replaces the former section 388 of the principal Act which charged additional tax of 10 percent where income was underestimated by more than 20 percent. This section has a number of notable differences to this former provision.

1.  Additional tax for underestimation is charged in any case where the taxpayer underestimates the **residual income tax** by more than 20 percent. Formerly the section operated on the basis of underestimation of income.
2.  Additional tax is charged on the difference between the provisional tax actually paid by the third instalment and the actual residual income tax for the income year. i.e. no longer on the difference between the estimate and 80 percent of the actual.
3.  The circumstances under which the Commissioner will remit the additional tax have been severely restricted. Taxpayers should therefore now expect to be liable to pay the additional tax unless one of the limited circumstances set out in subsection (3) apply.

**Subsection (1)** - limits the application of this section to provisional taxpayers who have estimated their residual income tax (and therefore their provisional tax), whether that estimate was a voluntary estimate or a required estimate, and the amount estimated is less than 80 percent of the actual residual tax calculated when the return for that year is assessed.

**Subsection (2)** - sets out the amount of additional tax to be charged. The amount is generally the difference between the provisional tax actually paid by the third instalment and the actual liability for the year.

As was the case under the former provisions, the amount of the additional tax is restricted in cases where the taxpayer voluntarily made an estimate. The additional tax is then restricted to the difference between the provisional tax paid by the third instalment and 110 percent of last year's residual income tax if this is less than the current year's actual residual income tax.

**Subsection (3)** - provides for the remission of additional tax if the taxpayer had underestimated the provisional tax because:

1.  The law was changed retrospectively and the change was made since the 1st day of the month before the third payment became due.
2.  The Commissioner changes a ruling.
3.  The taxpayer misinterpreted the law and that misinterpretation was entirely reasonable having regard to the circumstances of the case. The provision is primarily to protect taxpayers against the application of additional tax where that additional tax arose because of the taxpayers interpretation of areas of the law which are far from clear. It is not envisaged that this provision can be extended to cover situations where taxpayers have misinterpreted the law without taking reasonable precautions to find out their obligations. e.g. consult a tax professional.

**Subsection (4)** - deems additional tax charged under this section to be of the same nature as income tax and allows it to be recovered accordingly.

**Subsection (5)** - provides for the Commissioner to make an assessment of additional tax.

**Subsection (6)** - deems additional tax to be due and payable on the date of the third provisional tax instalment for the purposes of calculating the interest payable under the new section 398A of the principal Act which is inserted by section 19 of this Act. This means that interest will be charged (where applicable) on the additional tax.

**Subsections (7) and (8)** - originate from the former sections 388(6) and 388(7) which provided for the application of the objection provisions of Part III of the principal Act and the application of all other Parts of the principal Act as if additional tax were additional tax under section 398 of the principal Act respectively.

**Section 385 - Reduction of Provisional Tax in Cases of Relief from Double Taxation**

This section retains the former section 389 and allows the Commissioner to reduce the provisional tax payable by a taxpayer if the provisional tax required to be paid under Part XII of the principal Act is likely to be more than the residual income tax to which the taxpayer will be liable because of:

1.  Any exemption allowed under sections 289(3) or 289(4).
2.  Any credit for tax paid overseas under section 293.
3.  Any double taxation agreement.

**Section 386 - Alteration Of Provisional Tax By Commissioner**

This section originates from the former section 390 of the principal Act. It authorises the Commissioner to change the amount of provisional tax to which a taxpayer is liable. The change may result from an amended assessment, the refusal by the Commissioner to accept a taxpayer's estimate and the Commissioner replacing that estimate with the Commissioner's own estimate, or any other reason. The Commissioner must notify the taxpayer in writing when making such an adjustment.

If the amount of provisional tax is increased, any further amount payable must be paid by the date set out in the notice, but not within 30 days.

If the provisional tax is reduced and a refund results, the commissioner may set that refund off against any unpaid provisional tax or against any income tax owing in respect of a prior income year.

**Subsection (1) -** allows the Commissioner to make an alteration to the amount of provisional tax payable by a taxpayer and requires the Commissioner to issue a written notice of any such alteration.

**Subsection (2) -** provides for any increased provisional tax to be payable on the date specified in the notice but not within 30 days.

**Subsection (3) -** provides for any overpayment of provisional tax to be credited against any provisional tax overdue or any unpaid income tax in relation to a prior year.

**Section 387 - Voluntary Payments of Provisional Tax**

This section merely retains the provisions of the former section 391 and allows taxpayers to make voluntary payments of provisional tax in excess of that which is required to be paid under the principal Act.

**Section 388 - Assessment and Payment of Terminal Tax**

This section originates from the former section 392 of the principal Act and sets out the date by which terminal tax is to be paid. The due dates are set out in the Eighth Schedule to the principal Act and remain the eleventh month of a taxpayer's accounting year or 7 February, whichever is the earlier.

**Section 389 - Provisional Tax to Be Credited Against Tax Assessed**

This section retains the former section 393 and provides the authority to credit provisional tax against income tax.

**Section 390 - Application of Other Parts to Provisional Tax**

This section is the equivalent of the former section 394 of the principal Act and provides for the rest of the principal Act to apply to all amounts payable under Part XII as if those amounts were income tax levied under section 38.

**Section 17(2) -** is the application section for the new Part XII inserted by section 17(1). The new Part XII comes into force on 7 November 1988 and applies in respect of all provisional tax payments due on or after that date.

Section 18 - Additional Tax to be Charged If Default Made In Payment of Tax
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Section 18**of the Amendment Act amends section 398(5) of the principal Act by removing the word "wilful".

Section 398(5) provides the Commissioner with the power to set a new due date in respect of any tax to be paid following an assessment or re-assessment after the original due date has passed.

Under the previous wording of the section, the Commissioner was required to set a new due date in all cases unless it could be shown that the taxpayer was guilty of wilful neglect or default. The onus was therefore on the Commissioner to prove intent on the part of the taxpayer with the result that the setting of a new due date was virtually automatic.

The removal of the word "wilful" is intended to enhance the Commissioner's ability to refuse to set a new due date where the taxpayer is essentially at fault. In this way the taxpayer will not escape the imposition of additional tax for late payment which is levied under section 398.

**Subsection (1)** - removes from section 398(5), the word "wilful".

**Subsection (2)** - changes a reference in section 398(7) of the principal Act as a result of the new Part XII which was inserted by section 17 of the Amendment Act.

**Subsection (3)** - is the application provision and provides that this section will apply to the income year commencing 1 April 1988 and every subsequent year.

Section 19 - Interest to be Charged Where Residual Income Tax Exceeds Provisional Tax
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 19 inserts a new section 398A into the principal Act which provides for the charging of interest, calculated on a daily basis at a rate set by Order in Council, on the amount equal to the difference between the provisional tax paid by the third instalment and the actual residual income tax to which the taxpayer is liable for the income year. All provisional taxpayers are liable to this interest charge with the exception of individuals who neither estimated their provisional tax liability nor have provisional income over $100,000.

Interest is charged from the third instalment date to the date the tax is paid or the date for payment of terminal tax whichever is the earlier.

**Subsection (1)** - sets out the definitions of terms used in the new section 398A.

*   (a) "Residual income tax" has the same meaning as detailed in section 375 which was inserted into the principal Act by section 17 of the Amendment Act.
*   (b) "Specified rate of interest" is the rate at which interest is charged. The rate is set by Order in Council but will initially be 10 percent.
*   (c) "Trustee income" means the income a person receives as a trustee but does not include any income of the trust distributed to any beneficiary of the trust. This definition is used in subsection (2) which excludes such income from the exemption provided under that subsection.

**Subsections (2) and (3)** - set out to whom the new interest regime applies.

Section 398A applies to every person who is a provisional taxpayer except natural persons with current year provisional income not exceeding $100,000 and who did not estimate their residual income tax under section 382(1) of the principal Act. The effect of this exemption is that by far the majority of individuals (approx. 95 percent) will not be subject to the interest charge unless they choose to estimate their provisional tax.

The proviso to subsection (3) excludes a trustee from the exemption to the extent of any trustee income.

**Subsection (4)** - provides for the imposition of interest during the period starting with the day after the third provisional tax instalment is due and ending on the day the terminal tax becomes due.

**Subsection (5)** - sets out how the interest imposed under subsection (4) shall be calculated. This is in respect of each day in the period and using the formula set out in the subsection.

Notice that interest is payable on all income tax that remains unpaid including additional tax charged for underestimation or late payment. However, interest is not charged on interest. Although interest is calculated daily, it is therefore not compounding daily.

**Subsection (6)** - deems the interest payable to be of the same nature as income tax and can therefore be recovered as such. This has the additional effect of ensuring that interest charged under this section is not a deductible expense for income tax purposes since the deduction of income tax is expressly prohibited by section 106(1)(f) of the principal Act.

**Subsection (7)** - provides for the remission of interest if a taxpayer pays terminal tax before the due date. For example, where the Commissioner issues an assessment notice and the taxpayer pays the tax within 30 days, interest will only be charged up to the date of the assessment notice. The taxpayer therefore knows how much is required to be paid to clear the entire debit. If no payment is made in the 30 day period following the issue of the assessment, interest continues to be charged from the date of the assessment to the terminal tax date.

Because interest is remitted, a tax liability may arise under the accruals rules. This effect is currently under review.

**Subsection (8)** - provides for the specified rate of interest to be changed by way of Order in Council.

**Subsection (9)** - provides for the Commissioner to remit any interest charged under this section if the Commissioner is satisfied that the interest resulted from either:

1.  A retrospective change in the law, or
2.  A change in the Commissioner's ruling or interpretation of the principal Act.

The discretion to remit interest only relates to that amount of interest resulting from increased income tax payable due to the events outlined above. This means that taxpayers must generally expect to pay interest on tax underpaid and the Commissioner will have only restricted power to remit that interest.

**Section 19(2)** - is the application provision and provides for the interest regime to apply from the income year commencing 1 April 1988 and every subsequent year.

Section 20 - Interest On Tax Overpaid
-------------------------------------

Section 20 inserts a new section 413A into the principal Act to provide for the payment of interest by the Commissioner in any case where a provisional taxpayer has overpaid provisional tax. The section is symmetric to the new section 398A inserted by section 19. It applies to the same categories of taxpayers and over the same time period.

Two notable differences are:

1.  The definition of the term "residual income tax" differs from that in section 398A to the extent that the amount may also be a negative amount.
2.  The amount on which interest is paid is the difference between the income tax payable for the income year and the provisional tax paid by the due date for the third provisional tax instalment. This effectively means that a taxpayer will not receive interest on overpayments of provisional tax which result from payments made after that date. (e.g. voluntary payments of provisional tax).

Section 21 - Amendments Consequential Upon Sections 17 to 20
------------------------------------------------------------

Section 21 makes numerous minor amendments to various sections of the principal Act as a result of the new provisional tax rules introduced by sections 17 to 20 of the Amendment Act.

**Subsection (1)** repeals the definition of the term "estimated taxable income" which has now become redundant.

**Subsection (2)** redefines the term "provisional income" in section 2 of the principal Act as having the meaning assigned to it in the new section 375.

**Subsection (3)** redefines the term "terminal tax" in section 2 of the principal Act as including interest imposed under section 398A. In addition, reference is now made to section 388 rather than the former section 392.

**Subsection (4)** makes a consequential amendment to section 34 of the principal Act which deals with tax in dispute. The section is amended to make it clear that any interest imposed under the new section 398A on any tax in dispute shall be treated the same as that tax for the purposes of the tax in dispute rules. i.e. the payment of interest relating to deferrable tax is also suspended to the day of determination of final liability.

**Subsections (5) - (18)** make minor drafting amendments consisting mainly of changing references to sections in the new Part XII and the new sections 398A and 413A of the principal Act.

Section 22 - Transitional Provisions in Relation to Provisional Tax
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This section introduces certain provisions to apply for the 1988/89 income year only. These transitional provisions, which result mainly from the lowering of the income tax rates, are as follows:

1.  Companies who pay their 1988/89 provisional tax in accordance with sections 380 or 381 of the new Part XII (i.e. companies who do not estimate their provisional tax liability but instead pay on the basis of the previous year's tax) may make an adjustment to take into account the reduction in the company tax rate from 48c/$ to 28c/$.
2.  The provision is not extended to corporate trustees, in respect of trustee income, who pay tax at the trustee rate rather than the company rate.
    
    Companies who either choose or are required to make an estimate of their residual income tax can, by the mere fact that they are estimating their tax rather than income, take into account the lower tax rate.
    
3.  Taxpayers who commence to be liable to pay provisional tax in the 1988/89 income year but who were not provisional taxpayers in the 1987/88 income year may have any interest imposed under the new section 398A remitted if that interest is not more than $100.
4.  Provisional taxpayers who are individuals and who earned more than $100,000 provisional income in the 1987/88 income year, may pay their 1988/89 provisional tax based on their 1987/88 residual income tax without the 10 percent uplift. This partially compensates these people for the reduction in the personal income tax rates contained in section 23 of the Amendment Act.
5.  Subject to future change by way of Order in Council under section 398A(7) of the principal Act, the specified rate of interest for over and underpayment of tax is set at 10 percent.

**Subsection (1)** - provides for companies (other than corporate trustees to the extent of any trustee income) to adjust their provisional tax to take account of the lower company tax rate.

**Subsection (2)** - defines trustee income for the purposes of subsection (1).

**Subsection (3)** - Allows the Commissioner to remit interest calculated under section 398A in relation to a taxpayer where that interest does not exceed $100. This remittance can only apply where the taxpayer was not a provisional taxpayer in the 1988 income year. This provision is for new provisional taxpayers who may not be aware of their obligations and become liable for interest.

**Subsection (4)** - Initially sets the rate of interest applying in sections 398A and 413A of the principal Act at 10 percent.

**Subsection (5)** - relieves provisional taxpayers who earned more than $100,000 provisional income in the 1987/88 income year from having to increase their tax for that year by 10 percent as the basis of calculating their 1988/89 provisional tax.

**Subsection (6)** - is the application subsection and provides for the transitional measures contained in this section to come into force on 7 November 1988 and to apply to all provisional tax instalments due on or after that date.

Section 23 - Basic rates of income tax for Individuals for 1988/89
------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 23 inserts into the First Schedule of the principal Act the following composite tax rate scale for individual taxpayers which applies for the 1988/89 income year.

| Income range | Tax rate (cents per $1) |
| --- | --- |
| 0 - 9,500 | 19.5 |
| 9,501 - 30,000 | 27.0 |
| 30,001 - 30,875 | 36.0 |
| 30,876 and over | 40.5 |

This composite rate scale is a combination of the tax rates applying for the current tax year from 1 April 1988 to 30 September and the new rates applying from 1 October 1988 to 31 March 1989. This composite tax rate applies ONLY for the 1988/89 income year.

The composite rate scale should be used for all "early" 1989 assessments and special tax codes made after the date on which the Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 3) 1988 receives the Governor-General's assent, i.e., the 28th of July. This includes "urgent" refunds for taxpayers departing from New Zealand.

Taxpayers eligible for the low income rebate, who have either received an early 1989 assessment or who have filed their 1989 tax return and are yet to be assessed, can have their return assessed or reassessed on the basis of the new rebate and Income Tax rates.

Section 24 - Basic Rates of income tax for Individuals for 1989/90
------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 24 inserts into the First Schedule of the principal Act, the following tax rate scale for individual taxpayers which applies for the 1989/90 income year.

| Income range | Tax (cents per $1) rate |
| --- | --- |
| 0 - 30,875 | 24  |
| 30,876 and over | 33  |

Refer to the commentary on section 26 of the Amendment Act for the use of these rates for PAYE purposes from 1 October 1988.

Section 25 - Basic Rates of Income Tax for Non-Specified Trusts
---------------------------------------------------------------

This section amends clause 9 of the First Schedule to the Income Tax Act. The effect is that from the commencement of the 1989 income year (year commencing 1 April 1988) income derived by specified trusts and non-specified trusts will be subject to the same tax regime.

Previously income derived by specified trusts was subject to tax at the greater of:

*   A flat tax at the rate of 35 cents in the dollar.
*   Rates according to the individual tax scale.

Non-specified trusts were subject to tax at individual rates.

For the income year commencing on 1 April 1988 both types of trust will be subject to tax at the greater of:

*   A flat tax at the rate of 35 cents in the dollar.
*   Rates according to the individual tax scale.

The removal of the distinction between specified and non-specified trusts results from a recommendation by the Consultative Committee on International Tax Reform.

The uniform treatment of trustee income is an integral part of the overall International Tax Regime. Further legislation will be introduced in the Taxation Reform Bill (No. 5) to remove the distinction between specified and non-specified trusts from 1 April 1988.

It is proposed that from the 1989 income year, trustee income will be taxed at the top marginal rate for individuals (33 cents in the dollar). This amendment will be made in a subsequent Act.

Section 26 - Changes to the Second Schedule
-------------------------------------------

Section 26 makes the amendments necessary to incorporate the new tax rate scale (see section 24 of this Amendment Act), into the PAYE tax tables for use from 1 October 1988. It also changes the rates of tax in respect of secondary employment income, extra emoluments, and the no declaration tax rates from 1 October 1988.

**Subsection (1)** amends clause 3 of the Second Schedule which sets the "no declaration" rate of tax deduction. The rate has changed from two rates to one rate with effect from 1 October 1988. The new single rate is 33 cents in the dollar.

**Subsection (2)** amends clause 6 of the Second Schedule which sets the basic tax deduction rate which applies to secondary employment earnings at 28 cents in the dollar. This approximately reflects the new average marginal tax rate under the new rate scale.

**Subsection (3)** amends clause 9 of the Second Schedule to the principal Act which sets the basic tax deduction rate of extra emolument at 28 cents in the dollar.

**Subsection (4)** amends the appendix to the second schedule of the principal Act which inserts new PAYE tax tables which come into effect on the 1st of October 1988.

Sections 27-29: - Winding-up distribution tax
---------------------------------------------

### Comment

Sections 27, 28 and 29 of the Amendment Act, which were introduced into the Taxation Reform Bill (No. 4) by Supplementary Order Paper during the Committee Stages, give effect to one of the recommendations of the Consultative Committee on Imputation. The recommendation was accepted by the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue.

In its Report published on 15 April 1988 the Consultative Committee proposed the winding-up distribution tax ("WUD") as a transitional measure primarily to encourage companies which have ceased trading, or may be intending to cease trading, to wind-up. Under the imputation system to be introduced this year only tax paid on company profits for the 1989 and subsequent income years will qualify for imputation credits. It was considered therefore that the taxation at personal tax rates of pre-1989 retained earnings and other taxable reserves would be an obstacle to winding-up.

The Consultative Committee recommended that distributions of retained earnings or other taxable reserves made by companies during the period from 1 April 1988 to 31 March 1989 inclusive in the course of winding-up should be subject to a special "winding-up distribution tax" at the rate of 10 per cent payable by the company. The WUD tax is to be levied on all distributions which would otherwise have been taxable as dividends in shareholders' hands if distributed on winding-up. The WUD tax will not apply to distributions of dividends RECEIVED by the company after 15 April 1988 (non-qualifying reserves).

Shareholders receiving dividends from which WUD tax has been deducted and paid by the company will be exempt from tax on the amount of those dividends. The exemption will also apply to any such dividends received by non-resident shareholders with the effect that those dividends will not be subject to non-resident withholding tax.

### Legislation

The legislation giving effect to the WUD tax is contained in the Amendment Act and will not be incorporated into the Income Tax Act 1976. The provisions in the Amendment Act will be the legislative authority for the imposition of the WUD tax. However, as the legislation in the Amendment Act is read together with and deemed part of the principal Act, the provisions of the principal Act will apply to the WUD tax where appropriate.

### Section 27

This section provides the exemption from tax for shareholders who receive dividends which have been subject to the WUD tax. The exemption will only apply where the entire amount of WUD tax payable on any distribution (including any penalty by way of additional tax) has been paid on or before 31 May 1989.

There will be no exemption for shareholders where only part of the WUD tax (including penalties) has been paid by 31 May 1989. Any partial payment will be refunded to the company.

### Section 28

This section provides that companies will be liable for WUD tax where they pay dividends between 1 April 1988 and 31 March 1989 in the course of winding-up. For this purpose winding-up includes the dissolution procedure provided for in section 335A of the Companies Act 1955 ("short-form wind-up").

**Subsection (1)** imposes the liability for WUD tax on a company where it pays or distributes dividends to its shareholders. However, there is no liability for WUD tax in respect of dividends paid or distributed -

*   to a shareholder who is exempt from income tax, or
*   to a company that is exempt from income tax on dividends under section 63 of the Income Tax Act, or
*   from the non-qualifying reserves of the company (refer to explanation to subsection (3) of this section).

Under **subsection (2)(a)**, upon application in writing by the company, the Commissioner may exempt from WUD tax any company which has distributed dividends to its shareholders during the period from 1 April 1988 to 31 July 1988. It is intended that this provision will apply only where a company has distributed all of its reserves before the enactment of the legislation and has no funds remaining to pay the WUD tax. In such a case the exemption for shareholders in section 27 will not apply and the shareholders will be liable for income tax on those dividends.

Under **subsection (2)(b)** a company may be exempt from liability to pay WUD tax where the Commissioner is satisfied that all the dividends have been included in the assessable income of the shareholders. This provision will ensure that the liability for WUD tax does not remain once the dividends have been assessed for income tax in the hands of the shareholders.

**Subsection (3)** defines what is meant by non-qualifying reserves and also provides an ordering rule in order to identify the source of a distribution for the purposes of applying the WUD tax. Dividends are deemed to have been paid firstly from non-qualifying reserves of the company to the extent of those non-qualifying reserves. For example:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 31 March 1988 - Amount of revenue reserves | $5000 |
| 30 June 1988 - Dividends received by company | $1000 |
| 30 August 1988 - Dividends paid to shareholders | $3000 |
| 1\. Shareholders are liable for income tax on | $1000 |
| 2\. Company pays WUD tax on | $2000 |
| 3\. Shareholders are exempt from income tax on | $2000 |

### Section 29

**Subsection (1)** provides that every company liable to the WUD tax has to make a deduction of 10 per cent of the amount of the dividends paid or distributed at the time of making that payment or distribution. The WUD tax is to be calculated on the basis of the amount of the dividend received by the shareholders after the deduction of the WUD tax. For the purposes of the calculation of the amount of WUD tax, the correct result is achieved by calculating the tax on the same basis as GST is calculated on total sales, i.e., by taking the amount of the distribution before tax and dividing by 11 or multiplying by 0.0909.

**Example**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Amount of revenue reserves | $5000.00 |
| Amount of distribution (before payment of WUD tax) | $5000.00 |
| WUD tax payable (5000 divided by 11) | 454.54 |
| Dividends paid to shareholders | $4545.46 |
| WUD tax is 10% of dividends paid. |     |

**Subsection (2)(a)** provides the due dates for payment of the WUD tax. Payment is to be made to the Commissioner either -

*   on or before 31 August 1988, or
*   on the date of distribution,

whichever date is the later.

**Subsection (2)(b)** requires the company, upon making payment of the WUD tax, to furnish to the Commissioner a return in the prescribed form setting out the details required in the form. A new form (IR4B) has been developed for this purpose.

**Subsection (3)** sets out the late payment penalty provisions, i.e., 10% penalty compounding at six-monthly intervals.

**Subsection (4)** gives the Commissioner the discretion to make an assessment of the amount of WUD tax and any additional tax payable. The company may, on objection, establish either that the tax assessed is excessive, or that the company is not chargeable with the WUD tax or the additional tax.

**Subsection (5)** ensures that the assessment provisions of the Income Tax Act apply equally to a WUD tax assessment as to an assessment of income tax.

Under **subsection (6)** the provisions of the Income Tax Act relating to objections have the same application in respect of a WUD tax assessment as in respect of an assessment of income tax.

**Subsection (7)** prevents the WUD tax from being allowed as a deduction for income tax purposes.

**Subsection (8)** provides that, subject to the other provisions of the section, all the other provisions of the Income Tax Act apply to WUD tax as if it were income tax levied under section 38 of the Act and that WUD tax cannot be construed as income tax for the purposes of Part IV of the Act.

### GST Implications

The provisions of the GST Act 1985 apply to distributions of dividends by way of property (distributions in specie or in kind). The distribution of property constitutes the supply of goods for GST purposes.

Where the distribution of property is made by a company that is a registered person GST is payable on the value of the property. However, a distribution of a taxable activity as a going concern or part of a taxable activity as a going concern where that part is capable of separate operation is zero-rated for GST purposes.

Where the distribution of property is made by a company that is not registered or not liable to be registered there is no GST payable.

### Stamp Duty Implications

A distribution in specie of the assets of a company in liquidation to its shareholders is regarded as a conveyance from a trustee to a beneficiary and, as such, is exempt from conveyance duty under section 17(f) of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971. An exception is where a company does not appoint a liquidator in which case it is considered that the relationship of trustee/beneficiary does not arise for stamp duty purposes and the distribution is liable for conveyance duty.

However, the exception does not apply in the case of a short-form wind-up under section 335A of the Companies Act. In such cases it is considered that the absence of a liquidator does not prevent the creation of a trustee/beneficiary relationship between the company and its shareholders. The exemption in section 17(f) applies in those circumstances.

### Operational Details

Companies liable for the WUD tax will be required to pay the tax to the Masterton District Office which will act as a collection and receipting base on behalf of the Department. After payment has been received the Masterton Office will forward to the District Office where the company's file is held all the relevant information for verification and any other action as may be necessary.

=================================================

Archived legislative commentary on Part I - The Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1988 from PIB vol 174 May 1988.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 174, May 1988

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_.](/about/about-our-publications)

Section 1 - Short Title
-----------------------

This section provides for this Act to be read together with and be deemed part of the Income Tax Act 1976. It also provides that except where the Act contains a different application date, it comes into force on the 17th of March 1988.

Section 2 - Rebate for Support of Dependent Relative
----------------------------------------------------

This section repeals section 55 of the Income Tax Act 1976 which provided a rebate for the support of dependent relatives. This rebate is abolished with effect from 1 April 1988.

Section 3 - Rebate in Respect of Gifts of Money and Payment of School Fees
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section amends section 56A of the Income Tax Act 1976 which provides a rebate in respect of gifts of money and payment of school fees. The rebate available under this section for payment of school fees is abolished with effect from 1 April 1988. For the income year commencing on the 1st of April 1988, only donations to charitable organisations will be eligible for the rebate.

Section 4 - Special Exemption in Respect of Life Insurance Premiums and Other Specified Contributions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section gives effect to the announcement in the 17 December economic statement that the special exemption for life insurance premium payments and contributions to superannuation schemes will be abolished as from 17 December 1987. For the 1988 income year the amount of the special exemption is the lesser of:

*   Premia/contribution made between 1 April 1987 and 16 December 1987.
*   Maxima provided by the new section 59(5A).

### Subsection 1

\- Ensures that the operation of section 59(5) of the Principal Act (maximum levels for the special exemption) is confined to income years which commenced on or before 1 April 1986.

### Subsection 2

\- Inserts the new section 59(5A) in the principal Act. The new section provides that for the 1988 income year the maximum amount of the deduction allowable shall be:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| \*  | Where the taxpayer contributed to a subsidised superannuation scheme for the whole of the period 1.4.87-16.12.87 | $1,200.00 |
| \*  | Where the taxpayer did not belong to a subsidised superannuation scheme at any time during the period 1.4.87-16.12.87 | $1,400.00 |
| \*  | Where the taxpayer was a member of a subsidised superannuation scheme during any part of the period 1.4.87-16.12.87 | $1,200.00 increased by $23 for each month during which the taxpayer was **not** a member of a subsidised superannuation scheme during the period1.4.87 - 16.12.87. |

### Subsection 3

\- Provides that the special exemptions allowable in terms of sections 59(3) (special exemption for premiums) and section 59(4) (special exemption for superannuation contributions) cease in respect of insurance premiums or superannuation contributions paid on or after 17 December 1987.

Section 5 - Foreign Pension Funds
---------------------------------

Section 5 repeals the interest exemption in 61(20) for foreign pension funds. The exemption is removed as from 5 o'clock on 16 March 1988.

This measure is part of the general review of the taxation of life insurance and superannuation funds.

Section 6 - Standard Value of Livestock
---------------------------------------

This section amends section 86 of the Tax Act which deals with the setting of standard values for livestock. The standard values set annually for each class of livestock are, from the 1989 income year, 70 percent of a three year rolling average of declared average market values.

The amendment limits the standard value set each year for each class of livestock to a maximum of the average market value declared for that year. The reason for this is to limit the distortions created by any substantial downwards fluctuations in average market values which could mean the standard value for a year is set higher than the average market, or herd, value for that year (because of the effect of higher values of earlier years in the three year rolling average).

Section 7 - Valuation of High-Priced Livestock
----------------------------------------------

This section amends section 86C of the Tax Act which sets out the high priced livestock regime.

Two amendments are made to the regime.

1.  Livestock whose physical condition at the time of purchase makes them incapable of ever being used for breeding are excluded from the regime.
2.  The entry point for goats is raised from 3 to 4 times the declared average market value.

The amendments apply for the 1988 income year and all future years.

Section 8 - Transitional Provisions in Relation to Livestock Revaluation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section amends section 86G of the Tax Act which contains transitional provisions necessary for the change in livestock taxation.

Two amendments are made to section 86G.

### Subsection (1)

amends section 86G(2) which deals with the election of livestock valuation schemes in the transitional period. The legislation at present requires farmers who wish to make an election under section 85A for the 1988 or 1989 years to do so when furnishing their 1987 return of income (or earlier). However, this is not possible for persons who commence farming after furnishing their 1987 returns. The amendment ensures that a taxpayer commencing farming, or recommencing to farm a type of livestock that was farmed prior to the 1987 income year, is excluded from the transitional provision. The amendment makes it clear that new farmers, or existing farmers who purchase stock not farmed prior to 1987, can use section 85A and make their livestock valuation election for that stock when furnishing the return of income for the year in which the valuation is to first apply.

### Subsection (2)

amends section 86G(8) which sets standard values for the 1987 and 1988 income years. The same limitation as that imposed by section 6 of this Amendment Act is imposed on the 1988 standard values, i.e., 1988 standard values are limited to a maximum of the 1988 average market values. Any adjustment will automatically be made when the 1988 standard values are set.

Section 9 - Deduction for Expenditure or Loss Incurred in The Production of Income From Employment
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section amends section 105 of the Income Tax Act 1976 to repeal the deduction available to taxpayers for expenditure incurred in deriving income from employment.

This section also repeals;

1.  the standard deduction which is the lesser of $52 or 2 percent of the taxpayers income from employment: and
2.  the Fourth Schedule to the Income Tax Act 1976.

### Subsection (1)

repeals the existing section 105 and inserts a replacement section.

The effect of the amendment is that no deduction will be allowed for expenditure incurred in the production of income from employment after the 1st of April 1988. The only deduction available to taxpayers who derive this type of income will be in respect of the expenses incurred in having their tax return completed, which will continue to be deductible under section 165 of the Act.

In addition, no deduction will be allowed for depreciation on an asset to the extent that it is used in the production of income from employment after 1 April 1988.

### Subsection (2)

of section 9 amends section 336A of the Act (National Superannuitant Surcharge definitions) to repeal the definitions of "income from employment" and "standard deduction entitlement" for 1989 and future years as these are no longer required.

### Subsection (3)

of section 9 amends section 336B(1) of the Act (Calculation of other income for National Superannuitant Surcharge purposes) by removing item C from the formula in that subsection. (Item C took the standard deduction entitlement into account in calculating 'other income' of national superannuitants). The amendment applies for 1989 and future years.

Section 10 - Gifts of Money by Medical Practitioners to New Zealand Medical Education Trust
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section repeals section 145 of the Income Tax Act 1976 which allowed a deduction for gifts of money paid by medical doctors to the New Zealand Medical Education Trust. This deduction is to be abolished with effect from 1 April 1988. Gifts made on or after that date will be ineligible for the deduction, irrespective of the accounting year of the taxpayer.

Section 11 - Gifts of Money by Companies to Universities, Approved Institutions, and Individuals for Education or Research
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section repeals section 146 of the Income Tax Act 1976 which allowed a deduction for gifts of money made by companies to universities, institutes and individuals for study or research. This deduction is to be abolished with effect from 1 April 1988. Gifts made on or after that date will be ineligible for the deduction, irrespective of the accounting year of the taxpayer.

Section 12 - Contributions to Employees Superannuation Schemes
--------------------------------------------------------------

This section amends section 150 of the Act to remove the deduction previously available for contributions by private companies to subsidised employee superannuation schemes on behalf of employees who are "major shareholders" as defined in section 336N of the Act (essentially, shareholders who hold more than 10 percent of the shares or voting rights in a private company). The amendment is associated with the removal of the fringe benefit tax exemption for superannuation contributions and insurance premiums made by sections 17 to 20 of this Act.

Section 150 of the Act allows a deduction for payments made by employers to any subsidised superannuation scheme in respect of their employees. The section at present contains a provision to deny a deduction for contributions made in respect of employees who are "shareholder-employees" as defined in the section (essentially, employees who hold more than 20 percent of the shares or voting rights in the company).

The amendments made by sections 17 to 20 of the Amendment Act will impose a liability for fringe benefit tax in respect of insurance premiums and superannuation contributions which were previously exempted from the tax by paragraphs (1) and (m) of the definition of fringe benefit. However, the exemption from fringe benefit tax available in respect of benefits provided to "major shareholders" will continue to apply. For those employees the legislation denies the employing company deductibility of the cost of providing fringe benefits to them. This amendment to section 150 ensures the continuation of that effect in relation to payments that would otherwise be deductible under that section. In so doing, it harmonises with other provisions in the Act which deny deductibility for the cost of benefits provided to 'major shareholders'. The removal of deductibility for superannuation contributions made in respect of major shareholders applies to all contributions to subsidised employee superannuation schemes made on or after the 1st of April 1988. The company's accounting year is not relevant to this application date.

Sections 13 and 14 - Export Market Development and Tourist Promotion Expenditure
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The incentives provided by section 156F (export market development and tourist promotion incentive) and section 156G (export market development activities incentive for self-employed taxpayers) are being phased out over the 1988, 1989 and 1990 income years. The phase-out regime allows a tax credit to be paid at a rate which is greater than the current company tax rate of 48 cents. As the company tax rate has been reduced the rates for the incentives are amended by sections 13 and 14 of this Amendment Act as follows:

| Income Year | Old Rate | New Rate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Section 156F |     |     |
| 1989 | 58c | 42c |
| 1990 | 53c | 35c |
| Section 156G |     |     |
| 1989 | 58c | 42c |
| 1990 | 53c | 35c |

Section 15 - Partial Exemption for Mining Companies
---------------------------------------------------

Section 217 of the Income Tax Act provides that the amount of tax payable by a mining company on its taxable income from mining shall be two thirds of the amount that would otherwise have been payable. With the reduction of the company tax rate the Government has decided not to continue with this tax concession.

Section 15 of this Amendment Act repeals section 217.

Section 16 - Non-Resident Mining Companies
------------------------------------------

Currently these companies are liable to tax at 48 cents in the dollar. (See clause 4 of Part A of the first schedule). As from 1 April 1988 these companies will be taxed at the rate for non-resident companies of 33 cents in the dollar. This amendment achieves by amending section 221(3) to substitute the existing reference to clause 4 with a reference to clause 8.

Sections 17 to 20 - Fringe Benefit Tax
--------------------------------------

These sections impose a fringe benefit tax liability on those insurance premiums, superannuation contributions and payments to certain funds which were previously exempted from fringe benefit tax by paragraphs (1) and (m) of the definition of "fringe benefit" in section 336N of the Act. The liability is imposed in respect of all premiums and contributions paid on or after the 17th of December 1987. Premiums and contributions paid between the 17th of December 1987 and the 30th of June 1988 are deemed to have been provided during the June quarter, making the tax on them payable on the 20th of July 1988.

Fringe benefit tax on insurance premiums and contributions to superannuation and other funds which were previously exempt from the tax will be payable at two rates as follows:

*   _24 cents in the dollar for payments to:_
    *   \- superannuation category 1 schemes approved by the Government Actuary on or before the 17th of December 1987.
    *   \- sick, accident or death benefit funds (as defined in section 60 of the Act) which had been approved by the Commissioner on or before the 17th of December 1987.
*   _35 cents in the dollar for payments to:_
    *   \- superannuation category 1 schemes not approved by the Government Actuary on or before the 17th of December 1987.
    *   \- all superannuation category 2 schemes.
    *   \- sick, accident or death benefit funds (as defined in section 60 of the Act) which were not approved by the Commissioner on or before the 17th of December 1987.
    *   \- any fund that does not come within the definition of sick, accident or death benefit fund in section 60 of the Act but to which paragraph (d) of the definition of "specified fund" in section 59 of the Act applies. (Essentially, any fund which provides benefits solely in respect of personal accident, disease, sickness or death and which has been approved by the Commissioner for the purposes of section 59 of the Act but not for the purposes of section 60).
    *   \- any insurance fund of a friendly society that does not qualify for the 24 cents rate.
    *   \- any policy of life insurance or policy of pension insurance, as defined in section 59 of the Act, for the benefit of an employee or the spouse or any child of an employee.
    *   \- any policy of personal accident or sickness insurance, as defined in section 59 of the Act, for the benefit of an employee or the spouse or any child of an employee.

Fringe benefit tax on insurance premiums and contributions to superannuation schemes which were previously subject to the tax will continue to be liable for the tax at the rate of 48 cents in the dollar. (In particular, superannuation category 3 schemes).

**Section 17(4)** of the Amendment Act also removes the exemption in relation to tuition fees and examination fees paid by employers the education of employees or employees' children. (The exemption applied where the employer contracted with the educational institution for the education of an employee or an employees child. Reimbursement of expenses incurred by employees is monetary remuneration and falls outside the scope of fringe benefit tax).

The exemption is removed from the 1st of April 1988.

These effects are achieved in the legislation in the following way.

**Section 17(1)** inserts two new paragraphs, (da) and (db) in the definition of "fringe benefit" in section 336N. The purpose of this amendment is to enable the distinction to be drawn as to the types of payments which are subject to the tax at the rates of 24 cents in the dollar and 35 cents in the dollar respectively.

**Section 17(2)** is a consequential amendment which is required simply as a result of the insertion of the new paragraphs (da) and (db) in the definition of "fringe benefit".

**Section 17(3)** is a technical amendment. The definition of "expenditure on account of an employee" in section 2 of the principal Act includes insurance premiums other than those referred to in paragraph (b) of the definition. The effect is that the payments referred to in the exclusions from paragraph (b) have technically been subject to fringe benefit tax but have been exempted from the tax by the exemption provided in paragraphs (l) and (m) of the definition of "fringe benefit" in section 336N. With the removal of the exemption provided by those paragraphs with effect from 17 December 1987 these benefits are now liable for fringe benefit tax.

Paragraph (j)(ii) of the definition of fringe benefit exempts benefits which are exempt from income tax under Part IV of the Act, other than certain income to which section 73(2) of the Act applies. While the payments covered by the exclusion from paragraph (b) of the definition of "expenditure on account of an employee" are not specifically exempted from income tax, the amendment provided by section 17(3) of the Amendment Act removes any doubt as to the intention of the legislation. It excludes, from the exemption provided in paragraph (j) (ii), payments to which paragraphs (b)(i), (b)(ii) and (b)(iii) of the definition of "expenditure on account of an employee" apply, with effect from the 17th of December 1987. This makes it clear that these payments are liable for fringe benefit tax.

**Section 17(4)** repeals subparagraph (ix) of paragraph (j) of the definition of "fringe benefit". This subparagraph provides an exemption from fringe benefit tax for those tuition fees and examination fees paid by an employer in respect of the education of an employee, or the child of an employee, which would otherwise have been subject to fringe benefit tax.

This exemption is repealed with effect from the 1st of April 1988.

**Section 17(5)** effects the repeal of the exemptions contained in paragraphs (l) and (m) of the definition of fringe benefit.

**Section 17(6)** defines the expressions "contribution to a designated fund" and "contribution to a non-designated fund". These definitions are required because benefits which fall within the first of these definitions are subject to fringe benefit tax at the rate of 24 cents in the dollar, while contributions to the latter are subject to the tax at the rate of 35 cents in the dollar. The definitions are self explanatory, the contributions included being explained more fully in the introductory explanation of the effect of sections 17 to 20 of the Amendment Act set out earlier in this publication.

**Section 17(7)** introduces a definition of "specified insurance premium". As with the definitions inserted by section 17(6), this definition is included to clarify the types of insurance premiums which were previously exempt from fringe benefit tax and which will now be subject to the tax at the rate of 35 cents in the dollar.

**Subsections (8) and (9) of section 17** set out the application dates for the amendments contained in the section. The amendment contained in subsection (4), repealing the fringe benefit tax exemption for tuition fees and examination fees, applies from the of April 1988. From that date payment of fees which were previously exempt will be subject to fringe benefit tax at the rate of 48 cents in the dollar.

All the other amendments apply with respect to fringe benefits provided on or after the 17th of December 1987.

**Section 18** of the Amendment Act amends section 336O of the Act by inserting two new subsections. Section 336O is the section which sets out the rules governing the manner in which fringe benefits are to be valued. The new subsection (3A) provides that the value of any specified insurance premium is to be the amount of the premium paid by the employer. The new subsection (3B) provides that the value of any contribution to a designated fund or contribution to a non-designated fund is to be the amount of the contribution made by the employer. The amendment applies to all benefits provided on or after the 17th of December 1987.

**Section 19** of the Amendment Act amends section 336S of the Act in relation to the rate of fringe benefit tax. It provides that from 17 December 1987 fringe benefit tax will be payable at the following rates:

1.  48 cents in the dollar for all benefits other than those that are contributions to a designated fund, contributions to a non-designated fund or specified insurance premiums.
2.  24 cents fund in the dollar for contributions to a designated fund
3.  35 cents in the dollar for contributions to a non-designated fund and for specified insurance premiums.

**Section 20** does not specifically amend section 336T of the principal Act. Instead, it deems any benefit that consists of a contribution to a designated fund, a contribution to a non-designated fund or a specified insurance premium which was provided between the 17th of December 1987 and the 30th of June 1988 to have been provided during the June quarter. The effect is that the total value of those benefits must be included in the fringe benefit tax return for the June 1988 quarter and the tax paid on the 20th of July 1988.

Section 21 - Amount of Salary and Wages Where Superannuation Contributions are Deducted at Source
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the purpose of calculating tax deductions, an employer is required, in terms of section 341 of the Tax Act, to adjust the amount of the gross income where superannuation contributions are deducted at source. Section 21 repeals the provision with effect from 1 April 1988.

The adjustment under section 341 ensures that the aggregate of the amounts deducted under the provision during any year cannot exceed $1,200. As the change in the special exemption retains that maximum for the period 1 April 1987 to 16 December 1987 the operation of section 341 for 1988 is appropriate for taxpayers whose contributions exceeded $1,200 during the period 1 April-16 December 1987. However, it is not required after 1 April 1988 and is accordingly repealed from that date.

Section 22 - New Company Tax Rate and Consequential Changes
-----------------------------------------------------------

On 10 February 1988 the Minister of Finance announced that the new company tax rate was to be 28 cents in the dollar, for companies resident in New Zealand, and 33 cents for non-resident companies, and that these rates would apply from 1 April 1988.

Section 22 gives effect to this announcement and also makes several consequential amendments to Part A of the First Schedule to the Income Tax Act.

The effect of section 22 is that the following rate changes are made:

| Taxpayer | Old Rate | New Rate |
| --- | --- | --- |
|     |     | (for income year commencing 1.4.88) |
| New Zealand Resident Company | 48c | 28c |
| Non Resident Company | 53c | 33c |
| Insurers (to which sec 209 applies) | 53c | 33c |
| Non-Resident Mining Operators | 48c | 33c |
| Insurance Underwriters (to which sec 210 applies) | 53c | 33c |
| Trustees of Group Investment Funds | 48c | 28c |

**Section 22 (subsections 2 and 3)** also provides legislative authority for, companies who estimate their income for the income year ending 31 March 1989 under section 387 of the Act to use the new company tax rates for provisional tax purposes. Companies who use the previous year's income for provisional tax purposes for the year ending 31 March 1989 will need to continue to use the old company tax rates.

It should be noted that section 387 applies only to taxpayers who estimate that their income for the 1989 year will be less than 1988. It does not apply where taxpayers wish to estimate their 1989 income at a higher level than that achieved, or expected to be achieved, in 1988. In all cases other than those to which section 387 applies, the company tax rates that apply for the 1988 year must be used.

In cases where the income estimated for the 1989 year is significantly less than the 1988 figure, the company may be required to provide budgetary and other forecasts in support of the estimate. If the information does not support the estimate made, the Department will invoke the provisions of section 387(3) to require a higher amount of provisional tax to be paid. If the information supporting a company's estimate is not provided the provisions of section 387(3) will be invoked to require provisional tax to be based on the company's 1988 income. It should be noted, however, that if the Commissioner does invoke the provisions of section 387(3) for any reason, the provisional tax payable will be based on the new company tax rate of 28 cents in the dollar.

It is considered that section 383 would not allow the Commissioner to adjust the rate of provisional tax payable for 1989 to the new 28 cent rate in the absence of specific legislative authority.

Companies with early balance dates, who have based their provisional tax on estimated 1988/89 income may adjust the provisional tax payable on the second instalment by the provisional tax overpaid on the first instalment as a result of using the old rate of tax. This would apply to companies with balance dates falling in October and November.

Alternatively, if a company has paid its first instalment of provisional tax and wishes to take advantage of the estimation provisions of section 387 for any future instalment, it may use the new rate of tax in calculating future instalments.

The new rate of tax for companies resident in New Zealand is 28 cents in the dollar and for non-resident companies 33 cents in the dollar.

Section 23 - Twelfth Schedule
-----------------------------

This section amends the Twelfth Schedule to the Tax Act which sets out all the various types and classes of specified livestock.

The amendment makes four changes.

1.  Mixed age ewes are described as "rising three and four year ewes", rather than "three and four year old ewes".
2.  The "Five and six year old ewes" class is renamed "Rising five year and older ewes".
3.  The "Angora and Angora Crosses" type is redescribed as "Purebred and G1 to G3", rather than "Purebred and G1 to G4".
4.  The "Other fibre and meat producing goats" type is described as "including Cashmere or Cashgora producing and G4".

### Section 1 - Short Title

This section provides for this Act to be referred to as the Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act 1988 and to be read together with and deemed part of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985.

This Act is deemed to have come into force on the 24th of March 1988, the date on which the Act received the Governor-General's assent. It applies to supplies made on or after that date.

Sections 4, 5, 10, 15 and 16 have application dates other than the general application date (for details see commentary in respect of these sections).

### Section 2 - Interpretation

Section 2 repeals the definition of the term "secondhand goods" and substitutes a new meaning for this term.

The previous meaning of this term enabled it to be interpreted more liberally than was originally intended, insofar as it may have included goods that would normally not be considered to be "secondhand goods". Such goods would include newly manufactured goods, trading stock, livestock, and pets. The use of the words "... acquired for use, or held for use ..." gave rise to this liberal interpretation being possible.

The intention was that the term "secondhand goods" should apply to goods that had been previously owned by another person for their own use. This is the common meaning of the term "secondhand goods". This may still include such goods as trading stock, livestock, and pets where those goods have been previously owned by another person for their own use. However, it will ensure that for example livestock progeny does not constitute a "secondhand good".

The new definition gives secondhand goods their commonly understood meaning by not specifically defining the term. Instead, it merely excludes the following types of secondhand goods from the definition:

1.  A secondhand good that constitutes a fine metal.
2.  The fine metal component off a secondhand good that is made or manufactured from gold, silver, or platinum.

The reason for the exclusion of goods that are fine metals or contain a fine metal element from the meaning of "secondhand goods" is an inherent result of the exemption status afforded to the supply of fine metal. This is to ensure that a "secondhand goods" imputed tax credit is not available in these cases.

This new definition applies with effect to supplies made on or after 24 March 1988, the day on which this Act received the Governor General's assent.

Section 2(2) repeals section 2(7) of the GST Amendment Act 1986 which introduced the exclusion of fine metal from the meaning of "secondhand goods" in the previous definition.

### Section 3 - Meaning of term "open-market value"

This section amends section 4 of the principal Act which provides the mechanism to determine the open market value of a supply.

Section 4(3) as previously drafted deemed the open-market value of a supply to be the value of a similar supply in New Zealand that was freely offered and made between persons who are not associated persons. The term "value" in the context of the GST Act means a GST exclusive amount.

The other subsections of section 4 which determine the open-market value of a supply in differing circumstances refer to the consideration in money that a similar supply would fetch. The term consideration in money is a GST inclusive concept. Section 4(3) has therefore been amended to ensure consistency with the balance of the section.

Section 3(1) omits the words "value of a similar supply" from section 4(3) and substitutes the following words "consideration in money which a similar supply would generally fetch if supplied in similar circumstances at that date", to ensure that the section is consistent.

### Section 4 - Meaning of term "supply"

Section 4 amends section 5 of the principal Act by introducing a new subsection 3A to reflect the Government's announcement in its 17th of December 1987 Economic Statement. The proposal outlined in the Economic Statement is a temporary measure. It provides some relief for non-profit bodies and voluntarily registered traders that wish to opt out of the GST system as a result of the impending changes to the treatment of non-profit bodies for GST purposes, or because of poor advice received at the time of registration.

The new subsection 3A will allow a non-profit body or a voluntarily registered trader an imputed credit in respect of goods and services retained on cessation of registration where:

1.  The non-profit body or a voluntarily registered trader applies for deregistration between the 1st of April 1988 and the 30th of September 1988 and the registration is subsequently cancelled as a result of that application in terms of section 52 of the GST Act; and
2.  Those goods and services were acquired or produced on or before the 30th of September 1986.

The amount that will be allowed as an imputed credit under this subsection is 1/11th of the lesser of:

*   the cost of the those goods and services to the supplier as at the 30th of September 1986
*   the open market value of those goods and services as at the date of that deemed supply.

A voluntarily registered person for the purposes of this section is a person who:

1.  Voluntarily registered for GST under section 51(3); and
2.  At no time since registering would have been required to register under the provisions of sections 51(1) and 51(2).

A non profit body is one to which the definition in section 2 of the GST Act applies.

The amendment applies to supplies made on or after 1 April 1988 in accordance with the deeming provisions of section 5(3) of the GST Act.

### Section 5 - Meaning of term "taxable activity"

Subsections (1) and (2) of this amendment break the provisions of subsection (3)(a) of section 6 of the GST Act into two parts, paragraphs (a) and (aa), to make the meaning clearer.

A "private recreational pursuit or hobby" can only be carried on by a natural person. The new paragraph (a) simply inserts the words 'being a natural person' at the start to limit its application to those types of 'person'. The new paragraph (aa) clarifies the meaning in relation to persons other than 'natural persons'. It provides that the term "taxable activity" in relation to those persons does not include activities which would be essentially a private recreational pursuit or hobby if they were carried on by a natural person.

Subsection (3) of the amendment amends the list of persons in section 6 of the GST Act whose engagement, occupation or employment is not a taxable activity. It now includes any person whose appointment is made by the Governor-General or the Governor-General in Council and evidenced by a warrant or by an Order in Council or by a notice published in the _**Gazette**_ in accordance with section 2(2) of the Official Appointments and Documents Act 1919.

These amendments apply from the 3rd of December 1985.

### Section 6 - Time of supply

This section amends section 9 of the GST Act to ensure that in cases where the time of supply is dependent upon the issue of an invoice, it is immaterial whether the invoice is issued by the supplier or by the recipient of the supply. The amendment inserts the words "or the recipient" after the words "is issued by the supplier" in subsections (1) and (6) of section 9 with effect to supplies made on or after the 24th of March 1988, the day the legislation received the Governor-General's assent.

### Section 7 - Value of supply of goods and services

This section amends section 10(15) of the GST Act by removing the reference to "gaming machine" in paragraph (a) and deleting paragraph (b) which referred to an "amusement device". These terms were previously defined in subsection (15) for the purposes of interpreting subsection (14) of the Act. They are not referred to in subsection (14) so their inclusion in subsection (15) is not required.

### Section 8 - Zero-rating

This section amends section 11 of the GST Act which provides for the zero-rating of supplies. Subsection (1) of section 11 enables a supplier to claim zero-rating for exports of goods where the Commissioner is satisfied that the goods have been exported to a country or territory outside New Zealand. Subsection (1) of this section amends section 11(1)(a)(ia) to provide that in future, the Commissioner must be satisfied that the goods have been exported to a country or territory outside New Zealand by the exporter. It will no longer be sufficient that the goods be exported by the purchaser or by third party. Only the person who exports the goods will in future be eligible for the zero-rating provision.

Subsections (2), (3) and (4) of the amendment extend the zero-rating provisions to include materials used in the repair of any goods that are temporary imports and goods supplied to certain ships or aircraft for use as stores for consumption outside New Zealand.

Subsection (2) inserts two new paragraphs, (ba) and (bb), into section 11(1) of the GST Act. Paragraph (ba) provides zero-rating for goods supplied in the course of repairing, renovating or treating any goods that are temporary imports to which section 11(2)(c)(ii) applies. To be eligible for zero rating, the goods supplied must be wrought into, affixed to, attached to, or otherwise form part of the temporary import. If the goods supplied are consumable goods, they must become unusable or worthless as a direct result of being used in the repair, renovation, modification or treatment process.

In relation to those consumable goods, it is not sufficient that the goods become partly worn out in repairing, etc., other goods. They must become unusable or worthless as a direct result of the process of repair, etc., of the goods that are temporary imports. It should also be noted that the legislation effectively applies to consumable aids only. Food, drink, etc., consumed by employees engaged in the type of work will not qualify, nor clothes worn by them. Only those consumable goods that become unusable or worthless as a direct result of being used in the repair, renovation, modification or treatment process qualify.

Paragraph (bb) extends zero rating to goods supplied to aircraft leaving New Zealand for an overseas destination, fishing vessels proceeding outside coastal waters and foreign-going ships, provided the goods are supplied for use as stores for consumption outside New Zealand.

Subsection (3) of the amendment is a consequential amendment to the proviso to section 11(1) of the Act.

Subsection (4) inserts a new subsection (1A) into section 11 to provide definitions of the terms "aircraft", "coastal waters", "fishing vessel" and "foreign going ship". Aircraft has the same meaning as in the Civil Aviation Act 1964 while the other terms have the same meaning as in section 2 of the Shipping and Seamen Act 1952.

The amendments contained in subsections (2), (3) and (4) of section 6 apply to supplies made on or after the 24th of March 1988, the day on which the Amendment Act received the Governor General's assent.

Subsection (5) of section 6 replaces paragraph (a) of section 11(2) with four new paragraph relating to the zero-rating of the transport of passengers and goods to or from New Zealand. The purpose of the amendment is to make it perfectly clear that the zero rating provisions apply only to international transportation. It provides that, for supplies made on or after the 24th of March 1988, the following international transportation only will qualify for zero-rating:

*   (a) Services (other than ancillary transport activities such as loading, unloading and handling) comprising the transport of passengers or goods:
    *   from a place outside New Zealand to another place outside New Zealand; or
    *   from a place in New Zealand to another place outside New Zealand; or
    *   from a place outside New Zealand to a place in New Zealand.
*   (aa) Services comprising the transport of passengers within New Zealand to the extent that the transport is by aircraft and constitutes "international carriage" for the purposes of the Carriage by Air Act 1967; or
*   (ab) Services (including any ancillary transport activities such as loading, unloading and handling) comprising the transport of goods within New Zealand to the extent that the services are supplied by the same supplier as part of the service of the transport of passengers or goods from New Zealand to an overseas destination, or from an overseas destination to New Zealand; or
*   (ac) Services comprising the insuring, or the arranging of insurance, of passengers or goods to which any of paragraphs (a) to (ab) apply. The zero-rating also applies to the arranging of the transport of passengers or goods to which any of paragraphs (a) to (ab) applies.

The principal feature of the amendment is that it restricts the zero-rating of internal passenger transport to air travel within New Zealand that constitutes "international carriage" for the purposes of the Carriage by Air Act 1967. This will require the travel within New Zealand to be sold on what the industry defines by international convention as an "international ticket". Generally, air travel within New Zealand can only be included within an international ticket if three conditions are met:

*   the air travel is part of an international journey
*   it is booked at the same time as the international journey
*   it is purchased through the same agent supplier.

Air travel within New Zealand will therefore no longer be eligible for zero-rating unless it meets the requirements of the classification of international air travel as established in the Warsaw Convention of 1929 and enshrined in New Zealand law as "international carriage" under the Carriage by Air Act 1967.

In addition, passenger travel within New Zealand other than by aircraft will not qualify for zero-rating irrespective of whether or not it forms part of an international journey or is included in an international ticket.

The transport of goods within New Zealand (including loading, unloading and handling costs or similar ancillary transport activities) will qualify for zero-rating where, and to the extent that, the transport forms part of the transportation of those goods to or from New Zealand and the same person who supplies the international transportation also supplies the internal transport.

Finally, the insuring of passengers or goods qualifying for zero-rating will also be eligible for zero-rating. In addition, the zero-rating of services comprising the transportation of passengers and goods is not restricted to the person who provides that service. It is also available to the person who arranges the transport of those passengers or goods provided that transport is eligible for zero-rating.

This amendment applies to services provided on or after the 24th of March 1988 the date on which the legislation received the Governor-General's assent.

### Section 9 - Imposition of tax on imports

There are a number of circumstances in which goods are taken out of New Zealand, used overseas for a short period of time in the conduct of a person's taxable activity, and then brought back to New Zealand. Examples would be works of art, tools of trade, scientific specimens, travellers samples and racehorses. The present GST treatment in these cases is to charge GST on reimportation and allow it as an input credit. The difficulty with this treatment is that it can cause severe cash flow problems, particularly where the registered person accounts for GST on a payments basis.

Section 9 of Amendment Act deals with this problem by extending the proviso to section l2(4)(aa) of the GST Act to enable section 164 of the Customs Act 1966 to be used on the reimportation of goods that were not zero-rated when they were exported from New Zealand.

Under the new application of section 12(4)(aa) of the GST Act, section 164 of the Customs Act will be able to be used to enable goods exported from New Zealand and subsequently reimported to be admitted free of GST. This will apply where the goods are reimported by the same person who exported them if, at the time of their export from New Zealand, the goods were not:

*   zero-rated pursuant to section 11 of the GST Act
*   a supply made before the 1st of October 1986 that would have been zero rated pursuant to section 11 if the goods had been supplied in that day.

This amendment applies in respect of supplies made on or after the 24th of March 1988, the day on which the legislation received the Governor General's assent.

### Section 10 - Calculation of tax payable

Section 10 of the Amendment Act amends section 20 as a consequence of the amendment to section 5 achieved by section 4 of this Amendment Act. Under that amendment, non-profit bodies and voluntary registrants who apply for deregistration between 1 April 1988 and 30 September 1988 can claim an input credit on goods acquired on or before 30 September 1986 that are the subject of a deemed supply on deregistration.

Subsection (1) inserts a new paragraph (ea) into section 20(3) of the principal Act. This enables the output tax to be reduced by the amount calculated under section 5(3A) of the Act (i.e., 1/11th of the lesser of the cost of the eligible goods and services at 30 September 1986 or their market value on deregistration).

Subsection (3) repeals the second and third provisos to section 20(3) as these are no longer required.

Subsection (3) inserts a new subsection (3A) into section 20 of the GST Act. The new subsection deals with the situation where an input credit is allowed to any registered person under section 5(3A) (deregistration by a voluntary registrant or non-profit body applied for between 1 April 1988 and 30 September 1988) and the person subsequently re-registers for GST. In these cases, if the goods or services in respect of which that input credit was allowed are used in that new activity within five years of deregistration, no input credit is able to be claimed by that person in respect of that subsequent acquisition.

This provision also deals with the situation where an input credit is allowed under section 5(3A) and the goods or services are subsequently supplied to an associated person, for the purpose of carrying on a taxable activity, within five years of deregistration. In these cases the associated person is unable to claim an input credit in respect of that acquisition.

Subsection (4) is a consequential amendment that inserts a reference to section 20(3A) into section 20(4).

These amendments come into force on the 1st of April 1988 and apply to supplies made on or after that day.

### Section 11 - Goods and services tax incurred relating to determination of liability to tax

There is at present some doubt as to whether the GST component of services supplied to a registered person in establishing, or challenging, that person's income tax or GST liability may be claimed as an input credit.

This amendment removes any doubt for the future by inserting a new section 20A into the GST Act to specifically allow an input credit in these circumstances. The amendment applies in respect of supplies made in or after the 24th of March 1988, the day on which the legislation received the Governor-General's assent.

Subsection (1) of the new section defines the term "assessable income", "income year" and "taxpayer" as having the same meanings as in the Income Tax Act 1976. It also defines "goods and services tax payable" as meaning the amount calculated under sections 19 and 20 of the GST Act, and including:

*   any amount referred to in section 17(2) or section 27(6) of that Act
*   any amount refundable under sections 19 and 20 of that Act.

Subsection (2) of the new section 20A deems certain goods and services to have been acquired by a registered person principally for the purpose of making taxable supplies and requires the Commissioner to allow that person a deduction under section 20(3) of the GST Act for the tax charged thereon. It applies to goods or services acquired by the registered person in connection with:

1.  the calculation or determination of the person's assessable income for income tax purposes for any income year
2.  the calculation or determination of the GST payable by the person for any taxable period
3.  the preparation, institution, or presentation of an objection or an appeal against or in consequence of, any income tax or GST determination or assessment made by the Commissioner in respect of that person
4.  any contribution made by the registered person towards expenses incurred by any other taxpayer or registered person where those expenses are of a type to which section 20A applies and the registered person has objected to an assessment or determination made by the Commissioner on a related matter.

Subsection (3) of the new section 20A provides that the new section does not apply to goods and services acquired by the registered person in connection with:

1.  any matter or assessment arising from an income tax return or a GST return where that return is, in the opinion of the Commissioner, fraudulently or wilfully misleading
2.  any offence under any of the Inland Revenue Acts
3.  any penal tax assessment other than one which is subsequently cancelled
4.  any objection or appeal which the Commissioner considers to be of an inconsequential or frivolous nature.

Subsection (4) provides for the situation where any amount is received by the registered person at any time, whether by way of reimbursement, award of the Court, recovery or otherwise in respect of goods and services deemed under section 20A to be acquired for the purpose of making taxable supplies. It deems these amounts received to be supplied by the registered person in the course of a taxable activity in the taxable period in which it is received.

Subsection (2) of the Amendment Act consequentially amends section 20(3) of the GST Act by inserting a new paragraph (h). The new paragraph enables a deduction to be claimed, in calculating output tax attributable to any taxable period, of the amount allowable under the new section 20A in respect of goods and services supplied during that taxable period.

This amendment applies to goods and services supplied on or after the 24th of March 1988, the day on which the legislation received the Governor-General's assent. It applies in relation to supplies made on or after that date even though the supply may be in respect of the income tax or GST liability of an earlier taxable period.

### Section 12 - Credit and debit notes

Section 25(3)(a) of the GST Act provides that where GST shown on tax invoice exceeds the amount charged, the supplier must supply the recipient with a credit note containing certain information as specified in the subsection. Subparagraph (ii) requires the name and address and registration number of the registered person to be recorded. Section 25(3)(b) requires a debit note to be issued where the GST shown on the tax invoice is less than that charged. In these cases, subparagraph (ii) also requires the name, address and registration number of the registered person to be recorded.

Section 12 of the Amendment Act amends section 25(3)(a)(ii) and (3)(b) (ii) to remove the requirement that the address of the registered person be recorded.

### Section 13 - Assessment of tax

Section 27(6) of the GST Act provides that where a non-registered person supplies goods and services and charges GST, that person is deemed to be a registered person and the tax charged is required to be paid to the Commissioner. It applies where subsection (1)(d) of section 27 applies.

As a result of an amendment to section 27 by section 7(3) of the GST Amendment Act 1987, subsection (6) of section 27 was extended to apply in any case where the new subsections (1A) and (1B) of section 27 applied.

Only one off subsections (1)(d), (1A) and (1B) of section 27 can be applicable to a situation at a given time. However, the present wording of subsection (6) requires all three situations occur before it can apply.

Section 13 of the Amendment Act amends section 27(6) to ensure that section 27(6) of the GST Act applies where subsection (1)(d) or subsection (1A) or subsection (1B) applies.

### Section 14 - Objection to certain decisions

This section amends section 32(1) of the GST Act to remove the right of appeal against the decision of the Commissioner as to the date on which a six monthly return period is to commence. This amendment makes the legislation consistent with that which applies for two monthly return periods, where no right of objection exists at present.

### Section 15 - Persons making supplies in course of taxable activity to be registered

Section 51(4)(b) of the GST Act provides that where a person who is required to register for GST has not done so within 21 days of becoming liable to be registered, that person is deemed to be a registered person with effect from the date which falls 21 days after the person became liable to be registered.

Section 15 of the Amendment Act amends subsection (4)(b) to deem the person to be a registered person with effect from the day on which that person became liable to be registered.

The amendment applies to every person who becomes liable to register for GST on or after the 24th of March 1988, the day on which the legislation was assented to.

### Section 16 - Objections to penal tax

Section 70 of the GST Act enables objections to be made in respect of assessments of penal tax. Subsection (2) of this section provides that the provisions of section 33 (dealing with objections) shall also apply in respect of an objection to an assessment of penal tax. However, section 33 does not contain all the provisions that relate to an objection to a GST assessment.

Section 16 of the Amendment Act amends section 70(2) by removing the reference to section 33. This will enable all the provisions of the GST Act that relate to objections to GST assessments to apply to objections to penal tax, the only exception being that in an assessment of penal tax, the burden of proof lies with the Commissioner.

This amendment applies from the 3rd of December 1985.

Part II - Goods And Services Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1988
==========================================================

Archived legislative commentary on Part II - Goods And Services Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1988 from PIB vol 174 May 1988.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 174, May 1988

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_.](/about/about-our-publications)
 

### Section 1 - Short Title

This section provides for this Act to be referred to as the Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1988 and to be read together with and deemed part of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985.

The Act is deemed to have come into force on the 17th of March 1988.

### Section 2 - Taxable Periods

This section repeals the current section 15 and substitutes a new section 15 and section 15A. Currently, section 15 allows the Commissioner:

1.  To allocate taxable periods upon the registration of a person; and
2.  Change the taxable periods allocated upon the request of a registered person or where the circumstances warrant a change in taxable periods.

Section 15 has been redrafted to introduce the Government's 17th of December Economic Statement announcement that a registered person with a turnover of more than $24 million will be required to submit a monthly GST return with effect from 1 April 1988.

The change will first apply to registered traders whose taxable supplies in the 12 months ending 31 March 1988 exceed million, or whose taxable supplies in the 12 months period commencing on the 1st of April 1988 are likely to exceed that amount. For those companies which have elected to be treated as a group of companies in terms of section 55 of the GST Act, the legislation deems all supplies by companies in the group (other than intra-group supplies) to be supplied by the representative member. Accordingly, if the value of supplies of the group exceeds $24 million then the group is required to furnish monthly returns.

The calculation of the amount of taxable supply deemed to be made by the representative member is made using criteria contained in subsection 55(7).

If a registered person's present two month taxable period ends on the 31st of March 1988, the one month period will commence either on the 1st of April 1988 or the 1st of June 1988.

The commencement date of the one month taxable period is dependent upon when the Department advises the registered person of the change in taxable periods. If the Department is able to advise a registered person of the change to the one monthly period before 31 March 1988, the one month taxable period will commence on the 1st of April 1988.

If, however, the change is advised by the Department after the 1st of April 1988 but before the 31st of May 1988, the one month taxable period commences on the 1st of June 1988.

Where a registered person's present two month taxable period ends on the 30th of April 1988, then the one month taxable period will commence on the 1st of May 1988.

Head Office will be sending a letter to registered persons to whom the new furnishing dates could apply. They will be asked to confirm that they will be subject to the new monthly return requirements. When this has been done we will be in a position to inform traders of the new requirements.

The Legislation giving effect to these changes is now discussed in detail.

### Section 2(1) - Taxable Periods

This section repeals section 15 and substitutes sections 15 and 15A. The following is a commentary on these new sections.

**Section 15(1)** - provides mat every registered person shall be placed by the Commissioner in any one of the following categories to determine that person's taxable period:

Category A being two monthly periods ending with the last day of January, March, May, July, September, and November.

Category B being two monthly periods ending with the last day of February, April, June, August, October, and December.

Category C being six monthly periods ending with the last day of any month as determined by the Commissioner.

Category D being one monthly periods ending with the last day of any month as determined by the Commissioner.

**Section 15(2)** - provides that where a registered person has not been placed in either category C or category D, the Commissioner will place that person in either category A or B to achieve an approximately even number of persons in those two categories.

**Section 15(3)** - sets out the criteria that enables a registered person to adopt a six monthly taxable period. The criteria are:

*   An application has to be made in writing; and
*   The taxable supplies of the registered person have not exceeded $250,000 in a period of 12 months ending on the last day of any month or are likely to exceed that amount in a period of 12 months beginning on the first day of any month.

**Section 15(4)** - provides that the Commissioner must place in category D:

1.  Any registered person who has made written application to be so placed; and
2.  Any registered person whose taxable supplies have in the period of 12 months ending with the last day of any month exceeded $24 million or are likely to exceed that amount in a period of 12 months beginning on the first day of any month.

As these provisions came into force on the 17th of March 1988, a registered person will be required to be placed in category D where the value of taxable supplies for the 12 month period (31 March 1987 to 31 March 1988) have exceeded $24,000,000 or are likely to exceed this amount in the next 12 months beginning on 1 April 1988. The provisions providing for a change of the taxable period allocated are dealt with in section 15A.

**Section 15(5) -** provides that where the Commissioner has not placed a registered person in a taxable period category, that person is to be placed in category A.

**Section 15(6)** - provides that the total value of a registered person's taxable supplies will not exceed the amounts specified in subsection (3) and subsection (4) of this section solely as a result of:

1.  The sale of assets of a taxable activity for the purposes the replacement of those assets; or
2.  The permanent reduction in the size or scale of the taxable activity.

This ensures that a registered person will not cease to satisfy the conditions of category C or satisfy the conditions of category D because of unusual trading circumstances. This provision also applies for the purposes of section 15A in relation to a change of the taxable period allocated.

**Section 15(7)** - allows a registered person to apply in writing to the Commissioner to have the taxable period end on a day other than the last day of a month. This substitute day cannot be earlier or later than seven days from the last day of a month. In addition this substitute day is disregarded for the purposes of section 16(1) of the GST Act which refers to the date on which a return is required to be furnished.

**Section 15A - Change in registered person's taxable period**

**Section 15A(1)** - provides that the Commissioner may direct that a registered person change their taxable period category to any other appropriate category in the following circumstances:

1.  On written application by the registered person, or
2.  Where the registered person has notified the Commissioner of a change of status in terms of section 53 of the GST Act. Section 53 requires the registered person to notify the Commissioner of any change in status such as when a registered person's taxable supplies exceeds the $24,000,000 threshold; or
3.  Where the Commissioner is otherwise satisfied that a registered person satisfies or ceases to satisfy the conditions of section 15(3) or 15(4). This allows the Commissioner to instigate a change in the taxable period where the Commissioner is satisfied that the taxable period should be changed, or
4.  In respect of change between category A and category B where the Commissioner so directs.

**Section 15A(2)** - prevents the Commissioner from directing a registered person to change, unless requested to do so in writing, -

*   To category C from any other category as adoption of the category C taxable period is solely at the registered persons discretion, provided the conditions are met.
*   From category D to any other category as all registered person are entitled to be placed in this category at their request.

**Section 15A(3)** - allows the Commissioner to direct an appropriate change in relation to a registered person's taxable period category where:

1.  That person applies to be changed to category D; or
2.  The Commissioner is satisfied that that registered person should be placed in category D because the taxable supplies exceed $24,000,000; or
3.  The Commissioner is satisfied that that registered person should be removed from category C as their taxable supplies exceed $250,000.

**Section 15A(4)** - determines the date that the new taxable period category will commence from. Generally, the new category will commence from the day following the end of the taxable period in which the Commissioner directs the change in categories. However, there is provision to allow the change to apply from an earlier date where the Commissioner and the registered person agree to an earlier date.

**Section 15A(5)** - was enacted to ensure that those registered persons who did not advise the Commissioner that their taxable supplies at the end of any 12 month period had exceeded $24,000,000 did not gain any benefit over persons who have complied with their obligations.

This subsection deems a registered person to be placed in category D where:

*   That person's taxable supplies have exceeded $24,000,000 in the 12 month period ending with the last day of any taxable period; and
*   That person has not advised the Commissioner of the change in status by the end of the next taxable period.

The effective date of this deemed placement in category D is from the day following the end of the taxable period immediately following the taxable period in which that person exceeded the $24 million threshold. This will allow the Commissioner, in terms of section 27 of the GST Act, to issue assessments on a monthly basis where the Commissioner is not satisfied because the returns have been filed on a two monthly basis. This provision only applies in relation to taxable periods that end on or after the commencement date of this Act.

**Section 15A(6)** - prevents the registered person from including in the first return after a change in categories any period for which a return has been furnished.

### CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS

**Section 2(2)** - amends the definition of the term "taxable period" in section 2 of the principal Act to include the reference to the new section 15A.

**Section 2(3)** - amends section 32 of the principal Act which allows registered persons to object to certain decisions made by the Commissioner. The amendment repeals paragraph (b) of section 32(1) and substitutes new paragraphs (b) and (ba).

The substituted paragraphs allow a registered person to object to the following decisions of the Commissioner:

1.  The non placement of a registered person in category C (section 15(3) refers).
2.  The placement of a registered person in category D (section 15(4) refers).
3.  The determination of a date other than the last day of the month as the last day of a taxable period (section 15(7) refers).
4.  A direction that a registered person change their taxable period (sections 15A(1) and 15A(3) refers).

It is considered that a placement constitutes a decision by the Commissioner for the purposes of section 32.

**Section 2(4)** - amends section 53 of the principal Act which requires a registered person to notify the Commissioner of any change in status. This amendment repeals paragraph (c) of section 53 and substitutes new paragraphs (c), (ca), and (cb).

The substituted paragraphs require a registered person to notify the Commissioner within 21 days of the following changes in status:

*   A change whereby a registered person who has been placed in category C ceases to satisfy the conditions of section 15(3). Section 53(c) refers.
*   A change whereby a registered person is required to be placed in category D as that person now satisfies the conditions of section 15(4). Section 53(ca) refers.
*   A change whereby a registered person, who has been directed to adopt the payments basis of accounting, ceases to satisfy the conditions of section 19(2). Section 53(cb) refers.

**Section 2(5)** - amends the proviso to section 53 to ensure that the above amendments to section 53 do not apply in relation to any change in the ownership of a company.

**Section 2(6)** - amends section 55(7)(b) of the principal Act to ensure the reference to section 15 also includes reference to section 15A.

**Section 2(7)** - amends section 56(6) of the principal Act to ensure the reference to section 15 also includes reference to section 15A. Also the term "determination" in section 56(6) has been replaced with the term "placement" because of the redrafting of sections 15 and 15A.

**Section 2(8)** - amends section 76(3) of the principal Act to ensure that this section is aligned with the new sections 15 and 15A.

**Section 2(9)** - repeals section 13 of the Goods and Services Amendment Act 1986, which inserted the previous section 15, and section 14 in the Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act 1988 which amended it.

**Section 2(10)** - provides that a taxable period category allocated under the previous section 15 continues to apply until there is a change of that taxable period category. Also this subsection introduces a provision to limit section 15A(5) from applying in respect of taxable periods ending before the commencement of this Act.

Part III - Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act 1989
====================================================

Archived legislative commentary on Part III - Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act 1989 from PIB vol 181 Jun 1989.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 181, June 1989

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_.](/about/about-our-publications)
 

### Section 1 - Short Title And Commencement

This section provides for this Act to be referred to as the Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act 1989 which amends the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985.

This Act came into force on the 22nd of March 1989, the date on which it received the Governor-General's assent. The provisions of this Act apply to supplies made on or after that date, except sections 3(1), 3(3), 8, and 9.

### Section 2 - Interpretation

Section 2 amends a number of the definitions contained in section 2 of the GST Act.

Subsection (1) - extends the meaning of the term "associated person" to cover the relationship between a company and a person, where that person is associated with another person who is associated with the company. This caters for the situation where, for example, a trader supplies goods or services to a company that belongs to a relative of the trader i.e., the trader's brother.

The effect of this amendment is that such supplies will now be subject to the special rules that apply to supplies between associated persons.

Subsections (2) and (3) - amend the definition of the term "input tax" in respect of the supply of secondhand goods from a non-registered person to a registered person.

Subsection (2) - ensures that a registered person can only be entitled to claim an imputed tax credit in respect of a supply of secondhand goods where the goods are supplied by way of sale. Where secondhand goods are supplied other than by way of sale (e.g. a lease, a distribution, etc.) the registered person will not be eligible to claim the secondhand goods imputed tax credit. A sale is the exchange of a commodity for money or other consideration (Concise Oxford Dictionary).

Prior to this amendment, the GST Act provided that a registered person was entitled to claim a secondhand goods imputed tax credit in relation to all goods supplied provided the goods were acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. This meant the imputed tax credit could be claimed in respect of the leasing of goods since a leasehold interest in personal or real property is goods for GST purposes.

Subsection (3) - ensures that the consideration for a supply of secondhand goods is limited to the lesser of the purchase price or open market value of those goods where the consideration for that supply also relates to other matters. The effect of this is to ensure that the imputed tax credit is only available to be claimed in respect of the purchase of secondhand goods.

Section 10(18) of the GST Act provides for the consideration of a taxable supply to be properly attributed to the matters to which it relates. This allows the consideration in respect of a supply to be apportioned where the consideration relates to both a taxable supply and an exempt supply. This apportionment does not, however, apply where the supply is not a taxable supply. This means that a secondhand goods imputed tax credit could have been claimed in respect of a supply of services where the consideration for the supply of secondhand goods also includes a supply of services.

Subsection (4) - amends the definition of the term "secondhand goods" to exclude livestock. This means that where a supply of livestock is not taxable, the recipient will not be entitled to claim a secondhand goods imputed credit.

Prior to this amendment there was uncertainty whether livestock constituted secondhand goods within the normal meaning of that term.

In addition, the legislation also makes a distinction in the treatment of progeny and livestock acquired in relation to the secondhand goods imputed tax credit. This amendment removes any doubt by explicitly excluding livestock from the meaning of secondhand goods.

### Section 3 - Value Of Supply Of Goods And Services

Section 3 makes two amendments to section 10 of the principal Act which relates to the valuation provisions.

Subsection (1) - rewrites section 10(3) of the principal Act to ensure that this valuation provision applies to both taxable and non-taxable supplies made between associated persons. This means that the consideration for a supply made between associated persons, whether the supply is taxable or not, will be deemed to be the open market value.

Prior to this amendment, section 10(3) only applied where the supplier was a registered person. It deemed the consideration for a supply made by a registered person to an associated person for little or no consideration to have been at open market value, unless the recipient was entitled to claim an input tax credit in respect of that supply.

In addition, subsection (1) also inserts a new subsection (3A) into section 10 of the principal Act to ensure that the provisions of section 10(3) do not apply where the supplier and the recipient are both registered persons. The new subsection (3A) applies where the recipient is entitled to claim an input tax credit and provides that the consideration for the supply is the actual amount of the consideration payable (if any). This has the same effect that the original section 10(3) had.

A consequence of this amendment is that non-registered persons who make supplies to associated persons will have to value such supplies at open market value. If the open market value of such supplies exceeds the $24,000 registration threshold there will be a requirement to register in terms of section 51 of the principal Act.

Subsection (2) - amends section 10(5) of the principal Act to ensure that the provisions of section 10(5) apply to both taxable and non-taxable supplies. Currently, section 10(5) only applies in respect of a taxable supply.

Section 10(5) provides that the consideration for a supply of goods and services made pursuant to a credit contract is the cash price (as defined in the Credit Contracts Act 1981) in relation to that supply. This amendment will ensure that a secondhand goods imputed tax credit cannot be claimed in respect of the credit element of a credit contract under which the secondhand goods are supplied.

Subsection (3) - makes a consequential amendment. It repeals subsections (2) and (3) of section 8 of the GST Amendment Act 1986 which had previously amended section 10(3) and (5).

Subsection (4) - provides for subsections (1) and (3) of this section to apply in respect of supplies made on or after the 1st day of April 1989.

### Section 4 - Imposition Of Goods And Services Tax On Imports

This section amends section 12 of the GST Act which relates to GST being imposed on goods that are imported into New Zealand for home consumption. This amendment reflects the original intention of the legislation to ensure that only fine metals are not subject to GST on importation.

The previous provision enacted to exempt fine metals from the imposition of GST on importation was drafted too widely. This meant that other goods, the supply of which is exempt in term of section 14 of the Act, were also not subject to GST on importation. The term "fine metal" is defined in section 2 of the principal Act.

Subsection (1) - removes from section 12(1) the words "(not being goods the supply of which is exempt from tax pursuant to section 14 of this Act)" and replaces them with the words "(not being fine metal)". The effect of this is that the exemption is limited to fine metal only.

Subsection (2) - inserts into section 12(6)(a) the words "fine metal" to ensure that for the purposes of section 12 the meaning of the term "fine metal" is as defined in section 2 of the principal Act.

Subsection (3) - repeals section 10(1) of the GST Amendment Act 1986. That section had inserted the exemption now replaced by subsection (1) of this section.

Subsection (4) - provides for this section to apply in respect of all goods imported on or after the day this Act was assented to.

### Section 5 - Accounting Basis

This section makes a drafting amendment to correct a wrong cross-reference contained in section 19 of the GST Act.

### Section 6 - Calculation Of Tax Payable

This section amends section 20(3)(a) of the principal Act to ensure that a registered person cannot claim an imputed tax credit in respect of secondhand goods except to the extent that the goods have been paid for during the relevant taxable period. This is the same treatment that is afforded to a registered person who accounts for GST on the payments basis.

Prior to the amendment, section 20(3)(a) of the principal Act allowed a registered person, who accounted for GST on the invoice basis, to claim a deduction for input tax. A registered person was eligible to claim a full imputed tax credit in respect of any secondhand goods acquired during the taxable period in which that person received an invoice or made a payment.

The effect of this amendment is to prevent a registered person making a claim for an imputed tax credit in relation to the acquisition of secondhand goods until a payment is made in respect of that supply. The imputed tax credit will be limited to 1/11th of the payment made in that taxable period.

Subsection (1) - amends section 20(3)(a)(i) to ensure that the supply of secondhand goods does not qualify for the imputed tax credit even though the goods may have been supplied to that registered person during the taxable period.

Subsection (2) - inserts a further subparagraph into section 20(3)(a) to allow an imputed tax credit for the supply of secondhand goods to the extent that a payment has been made during the taxable period for that supply.

This means that the imputed tax credit will be available in the taxable period in which the goods are paid for even though the supply to the registered person may have been made in another taxable period.

### Section 7 - Allocation Of Taxable Supplies Following Investigation By Commissioner

This section inserts a new section 20B into the principal Act. The purpose of section 20B is to provide for the allocation of taxable supplies where an investigation by the Commissioner has revealed a discrepancy relating to a period containing more than one taxable periods.

Subsection (1) - inserts the new section 20B into the GST Act.

The new section 20B(1) defines three terms for the purposes of section 20B.

"Discrepancy" is defined as any understatement or overstatement of taxable supplies made or received by a registered person as calculated or ascertained in respect of any specified period.

"Specified period" is defined as a period which exceeds a single taxable period and to which the discrepancy relates.

"Tax discrepancy" for the purposes of this section is defined as an amount equal to the tax fraction of the amount of the understated or overstated taxable supplies made or received by a registered person.

Subsection (2) of section 20B - provides how the amount of the discrepancy is to be allocated to the taxable periods contained in the specified period.

Paragraph (a) provides that where the Commissioner has calculated or ascertained that there is a discrepancy in a specified period (i.e. a discrepancy which covers more than one taxable period) then the amount of the discrepancy is deemed to be taxable supplies made or received by the registered person at a uniform daily rate throughout that specified period. Those taxable supplies are then deemed to have been made or received in the taxable periods, or any part of a taxable period, spanned by the specified period.

Paragraph (b) provides that where the Commissioner is satisfied that the registered person did not carry on the taxable activity for any part of the specified period, the discrepancy is deemed to be taxable supplies made or received at a uniform rate throughout that part of the specified period during which the taxable activity was undertaken. The supplies are then deemed to have been made or received during the taxable periods, or any part of a taxable period, in that part of the specified period during which the taxable activity was carried on.

Paragraph (c) provides that where the registered person is able to satisfy the Commissioner that a different method of allocation is more appropriate, the discrepancy shall be allocated on that basis.

Subsection (3) of section 20B - provides that the "tax discrepancy" (the meaning of which is explained above) is deemed to be either output tax or input tax for the purposes of section 20 of the principal Act. (Section 20 provides the mechanism for the calculation of tax payable in respect of a taxable period.)

It should be noted that the taxable supplies allocated in terms of this new section are allocated for all purposes of the principal Act. This means that the penalty, incremental interest, penal, and prosecution provisions will apply in respect of the discrepancy so allocated.

Subsection (2) - provides that the new section 20B applies in respect of assessments issued on or after the date this Amendment Act received the Governor-General's assent.

### Section 8 - Adjustments

This section makes two amendments to section 21 of the principal Act.

Subsections (1), (2), and (3) - amend section 21(3) of the principal Act which deems a supply to occur where a registered person provides or grants fringe benefits to employees in the course of a taxable activity carried on by that registered person. These amendments insert a new subsection (3A) into section 21 of the principal Act to replace the provisos to section 21(3). This new subsection also includes two new provisions which exclude certain fringe benefits from the application of the provisions of section 21(3).

Subsection (1) omits the reference to the provisos in section 21(3) of the principal Act and replaces it with a reference to the new subsection (3A).

Subsection (2) repeals both provisos to section 21(3).

Subsection (3) inserts the new section 22(3A) which makes it clear that fringe benefits that are lump sum bonuses, gratuities, retiring allowances, or redundancy payments will not be treated under section 20(3) of the principal Act as supplies of goods and services made in the course of a taxable activity. This is because such payments are monetary remuneration and therefore should not be subject to GST.

Subsection (4) - inserts a new subsection (6) into section 21, of the principal Act. The new subsection ensures that a registered person is entitled to claim an input tax credit in respect of assets retained on cessation of a taxable activity and which are subsequently reapplied by the registered person to another taxable activity.

When a registered person ceases to be registered for GST purposes and retains any goods and services forming part of the assets of the taxable activity, a supply is deemed to occur in respect of those retained assets. This supply is deemed to occur in terms of section 5(3) of the principal Act and is valued at the lesser of cost or open market value. If that person subsequently commences a taxable activity at a later date and the assets retained on the cessation of the previous activity are applied to make taxable supplies in the new activity, this new subsection will allow an input tax credit to be claimed in respect of those assets.

This new subsection also applies where the assets retained on cessation are reapplied by a partnership for the purposes of making taxable supplies where the assets were previously retained by a partner of that partnership. In addition this new subsection applies to any assets retained on cessation in terms of section 5(3) of the principal Act even though the assets may have been acquired or produced prior to the 1st of October 1986.

The new subsection reflects the original intent of the legislation and therefore applies in respect of such supplies made on or after the 1st day of October 1986 being the introduction date of GST.

Subsection (5) - consequentially repeals section 18(5) of the GST Amendment Act 1986.

Subsections (6) and (7) - provide the application dates for this section. Subsections (1), (2), (3), and (5) apply from 1 October 1988 and apply in respect of any fringe benefit provided or granted on or after that date. This coincides with the application of the new tax regime in respect of retiring and redundancy payments. Subsection (4) applied from 3 December 1985.

Section 9 - Relief From Tax Where New Start Grant Made In Respect Of Drought Relief

Section 9 inserts a new section 48A into the GST Act. The new section provides for tax owing by drought stricken farmers who have received a new start grant to be written off. The write off is limited to the GST which relates to the grant itself and the taxable activity in respect of which the grant was made. The section also provides for relief for registered persons who are associated with the person who received the grant.

Under the current provisions of the GST Act, the grant (when paid to a registered person) is subject to tax. The reason for this is that the grant is paid to refrain from carrying on a taxable activity (i.e. farming) and is therefore consideration for a supply of services in connection with the termination of that activity.

The sale of the farm, livestock, plant, etc., unless supplied as a going concern to another registered person, is subject to tax and will give rise to an output tax liability of 1/11th of the lesser of the cost or open market value of the respective assets. If the farming activity is supplied as a going concern to a registered person the supply is zero rated.

The GST Act deems the retention of any assets forming part of the taxable activity to be a supply. An output tax liability of 1/11th of the lesser of cost or open market value will be incurred if any assets (e.g. personal chattels, motor vehicle, tools of trade) acquired for use in the taxable activity are retained by the registered person.

Section 9(1) inserts the new section 48A into the GST Act.

Subsection (1) of new section 48A defines the term "new start grant" for the purposes of the section. That term means a grant which is paid to a person in respect of drought relief by the Government of New Zealand with the approval of the New Zealand Rural Trust and designated by the Minister of Agriculture as a new start grant.

To qualify for the payment of the grant the criteria set by the New Zealand Rural Trust must be met. Briefly these criteria require that:

1.  The applicant or vendor must be a bona fide farmer with the farm being within a defined drought area.
2.  An arrangement must have been entered into in which all claims to the title of the property and other assets have been relinquished following an unconditional sale and purchase agreement.
3.  The solicitor acting on behalf of the farmer must have confirmed that all criteria have been met.

The farmer will, however, be entitled to keep a motor car, household and personal chattels, and tools of trade.

Subsection (2) provides for the Commissioner to write off the GST relating to the new start grant and to the farming activity.

For the subsection to apply the registered person must:

1.  Have received the new start grant in respect of a taxable activity; and
2.  Have furnished all returns required under the GST Act (that will establish the liability for tax); and
3.  Be liable for GST in respect of the new start grant, or the taxable activity.

In addition to the GST arising from the termination of the taxable activity, any GST (to the extent that it relates to the taxable activity for which the new star grant was made) owing at the date the new start grant was received is also subject to the write off provisions. If the registered person operates more than one taxable activity an apportionment will be necessary to determine the amount of tax to be written off. There is no authority for refunding any tax paid prior to the new start grant being received.

Prior to writing off the tax the Department will need assurance that a new start grant, as defined, has been received. There is no obligation for the registered person to sign a declaration but evidence must be sighted prior to the tax being written off. Such evidence will include the letter from the Ministry of Agriculture enclosing the grant and copies of correspondence that preceded the payment of the grant. A copy of the solicitor's letter to the New Zealand Rural Trust confirming the criteria for the grant is an example of such correspondence.

If the above requirements have been met the Commissioner is required to write off all the tax owing that relates to that taxable activity for which the grant was provided.

Subsection (3) of section 48A provides for tax for registered persons who are associated to the person who received the new start grant to be written off.

The write off for associated persons is discretionary and the Commissioner must take into account several factors prior to determining the amount (if any) of tax shall be written off. The Commissioner will consider writing off the tax if a person (associated with the registered person, as discussed below) has received a new start grant and the registered person is liable for tax in respect of:

1.  The taxable activity (including its termination); or
2.  Land on which the taxable activity was carried on (including the sale or disposition of that land).
3.  The liability may have been incurred through the termination of the activity or the sale or disposition of the land, through the retention of assets, or may have been owing prior to the new start grant being made. If more than one taxable activity is carried on an apportionment will be required to determine the tax applicable to the activity for which the grant was made.

Before the Commissioner may write off any tax all returns must have been furnished. Those returns will establish the liability that exists.

It is at the discretion of the Commissioner as to the amount, if any, of tax that shall be written off. Not only must all the above requirements be met but the Commissioner will also take into consideration the circumstances of the registered person and the relationship with the person who received the new start grant.

### Section 10 - Group Of Companies

This section amends section 55(7) of the principal Act which deals with the consequences of group registration.

Subsection (1) - replaces paragraph (c) of section 55(7). Currently, in terms of section 55(7)(c) of the GST Act, taxable supplies made by a member of a group to another member may be disregarded for GST purposes. However, this does not apply if the recipient of the taxable supply is not entitled to claim an input tax credit in respect of that supply. The result of this is that output tax is required to be accounted for by the representative member of the group where a recipient member of the supply carries on an exempt activity and receives taxable supplies from other members of the group.

This amendment removes this qualification in the treatment of intra-group supplies by allowing all taxable supplies between members of a group to be disregarded.

Subsection (2) - introduces two new paragraphs (db) and (dc) into section 55(7) to ensure that section 21 of the GST Act applies where goods and services are applied for purposes other than for which they were originally acquired. A taxable supply is deemed to occur in terms of section 21(1) or section 21(5) of the principal Act if the representative member of the group applies any goods and services for purposes other than for which they were originally applied by the registered person who acquired them (now being part of the group). This is the same treatment that is afforded to a registered person who makes both taxable and exempt supplies.

### Example:

A Ltd. is a fully owned subsidiary of B Ltd. Both companies are registered for GST purposes. A Ltd. is a property holding company whose taxable activity is the leasing of a building. The building is leased on the following basis:

Forty percent of the area space is leased to B Ltd with the balance to third parties.

B Ltd. is a financial institution who makes principally exempt supplies. Eighty-five percent of the supplies made by B Ltd are exempt and the building leased from A Ltd is used solely for the purpose of making those exempt supplies.

A Ltd and B Ltd are a group in terms of section 55 of the GST Act. B Ltd is nominated to be the representative member of the group. Section 55(7) of the principal Act provides that the representative member (B Ltd) carries on all the activities of the members of the group and makes and receives all the supplies of the group whether taxable or exempt.

B Ltd is now deemed to be carrying on the taxable activity of A Ltd and therefore applying the goods and services of A Ltd, namely the building, for a purpose of making other than taxable supplies. This change in usage arises because A Ltd only applied the building for making taxable supplies whereas B Ltd (the representative member) is now applying the building for making both taxable and exempt supplies. In terms of the new paragraph (db), section 21(1) of the principal Act now applies to deem a supply to occur to the extent that the building is used for making other than taxable supplies. The value of this deemed supply is the lesser of cost or open-market value in terms of section 10(8) of the principal Act and is accounted for as output tax.

If the building had a cost of say $1 million (exclusive of GST) and is constructed of reinforced concrete (that is, the straight line depreciation rate of 1% is used to calculate the adjustment), the adjustment for any 2 monthly taxable period would be as follows in respect of the application of the building:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $1,000,000 \* .01 | \* 40% | \= $666.66 |
| 6   |     |     |
| $666.66 | \* 10% | \= $66.66 |

6% being the number of taxable periods in a year

40% being the application of the building for making exempt supplies

10% being the rate of GST

An adjustment will also be required in respect of revenue expenditure incurred in respect of the building to the extent that the building is used for making other than taxable supplies during any taxable period.

As the building is still being used in a taxable activity any subsequent sale of that building will be a taxable supply.

The new paragraph (dc) works in the manner outlined above, but is the converse of paragraph (db) in that it applies in respect of section 21(5). Paragraph (dc) applies where the goods services acquired or produced by the registered person were for the principal purpose of making other than taxable supplies. The subsequent application by the representative member for purposes of making taxable supplies deems a supply to occur which allows the representative member to claim an input tax credit in respect of that supply. This only applies in respect of goods and services acquired or produced after the 1st day of October 1986.

It should be noted that section 21(1) or section 21(5) may require one-off adjustment to be made. This will occur where the subsequent application of the goods and services of one member of the group by the representative member of that group are solely for purposes other than for which the goods and services were acquired.

For example, a subsidiary may provide computer services to its parent body and these services are used solely in the course of making exempt supplies by the parent body. The subsidiary and the parent body group. As the representative member is now applying the goods and services of the subsidiary for the sole purpose of making other than taxable supplies, a one-off adjustment will be required in relation to capital assets.

This section will affect groups already in existence on the application date of this section and registered persons that group on or after that date.

Subsection (3) - repeals section 29(2) of the GST Amendment Act 1986. That section had previously amended section 55(7)(c).

### Test Of Association

To be considered for the write off the person or entity must be associated to the person who received the new start grant. Section 64FB(3) of the Income Tax Act provides the test as to whether a person is associated to the person who received the grant. To qualify the registered person and the person who received the grant must be associated within the meaning of section 245B of the Income Tax Act. Each case will need to be considered separately and section 245B must be referred to when determining whether the two persons are associated. However, situations in which two persons could be considered to be associated include:

*   a company and a person who holds an income interest of 50 percent or more in that company
*   2 persons who are relatives (as defined in section 2 of the Income Tax Act)
*   a partnership and any person who is a partner in the partnership
*   a trust and a beneficiary or settlor.

In addition, the associated person must also either carry on or have carried on a farming activity in respect of which a new start grant was provided, or is the owner or lessor of the land used to carry on the activity for which the grant was made. The Commissioner must also be satisfied that the registered person has a substantial degree of control over the associated person or that there is a substantial identity of interests between the two persons.

Subsection (2) of section 9 provides that this section is deemed to have come into force on the 4th day of November 1988. That was the day on which the Government announced the details of the South Island drought relief package. Any grants paid on or after that date are to be considered under this section.

Part III - Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act (No. 3) 1988
============================================================

Archived legislative commentary on Part III - Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act (No. 3) 1988 from PIB vol 177 Oct 1988.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 177, October 1988

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_.](/about/about-our-publications)
 

Section 1 - Short Title
-----------------------

This section provides for this Act to be referred to as the Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act (No. 3) 1988 which amends the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985.

This Act came into force on the 28th of July 1988, the date on which the Act received the Governor-General's assent. It applies to supplies made on or after that date.

Only section 2 has a different application date (for details see below).

Section 2 - Interpretation
--------------------------

Section 2 amends the meaning of the definition of the term "consideration" contained in section 2 of the GST Act.

Prior to this amendment, the Act provided that a registered person, in the course of making taxable supplies, was unable to make an unconditional gift (i.e., a donation). Hence any payment made by a registered person which would constitute a donation (if made by any other person) was treated under the GST Act as a payment for the supply of goods and services and therefore subject to GST if the recipient non-profit body was registered. This was based on the premise that a business always expects something in return for a payment.

This amendment removes this distinction. This means that where a registered person makes a donation to a non-profit body in the course of its taxable activity, the payment is not subject to GST in the hands of the non-profit body. However, if the person making the payment, or an associated person, receives any identifiable direct valuable benefit in the form of a supply of goods and services then the payment is subject to GST.

This amendment does not apply in respect of payments made by the Crown or any public authority as such payments are specifically excluded from the meaning of the term "unconditional gift". They therefore remain taxable when made to registered persons.

The amendment applies in respect of any payments made on or after 1 October 1988.

Section 3 - Meaning of term "supply"
------------------------------------

This section amends section 5 of the GST Act by introducing a new subsection (6C) to provide certainty as to the GST treatment of candidates' deposits in local body and parliamentary elections. Prior to this amendment some doubt was expressed as to whether the deposit, when forfeited, was consideration for the supply of goods and services.

The amendment ensures that:

1.  The deposit is consideration (GST inclusive) for the supply of services; and
2.  The supply occurs when the deposit is forfeited. Forfeiture occurs where the candidate polls insufficient votes.

This means that there are no GST implications at the time the deposit is paid by the candidate or when the deposit is refunded by the Local Authority or the Justice Department. However, if the deposit is forfeited the Local Authority or Justice Department is required to account for 1/11th of the amount of the deposit as output tax.

The amendment applies to deposits forfeited on or after the 28th July 1988, i.e., the date on which the Act received the Governor-General's assent. The ruling made by the Department at the time of the introduction of GST stating that such deposits were consideration for a supply when the deposit was forfeited applies in respect of the deposits forfeited prior to the application date of this amendment.

Section 4 - New sections inserted relating to the furnishing of returns following change in rate of tax
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 4 of the Amendment Act (No. 3) 1988 introduces two new sections i.e., sections 78A and 78B to the Goods and Services Tax Act. These sections provide transitional arrangements for implementing a rate change should the Government in the future make a decision to increase or decrease the rate of GST. These new sections relate to:

1.  The return filing requirements on a change in the rate of GST; and
2.  An adjustment to be made by registered persons who account on the payments basis in respect of supplies made or received that have not been accounted for in any taxable period ending prior to the change in the rate of GST.

The reason for introducing these transitional provisions at this early stage is to increase certainty for both taxpayers and the Department.

**(i) New section 78A - Returns to be furnished in 2 parts for taxable period in which change in rate of tax occurs**

All registered persons are allocated a taxable period in terms of section 15 or section 15A of the GST Act and these taxable periods are staggered and of varying duration (1, 2, or 6 months). It is therefore not possible for all registered persons to have a taxable period beginning on the day on which a change in the rate of tax comes into force. This new section therefore applies where the taxable period allocated does not commence on the same date as the change in the rate of tax.

The amendment requires registered persons whose taxable period spans the date on which the change in the rate occurs to file a return in two parts for that taxable period. The first part of this return will cover the period from the beginning of that period to the day before the change in the rate of GST occurs. The second part will cover the balance of the taxable period. This ensures that the first part of the return only includes supplies at the old rate whilst the second part only includes supplies at the new rate. These two parts together form the return for that taxable period and both are required to be furnished on or before that person's normal due date (i.e., one day and one month after the last day of the taxable period).

Where a person has adopted an alternative date for the last day of a taxable period in terms of section 15(7) of the Act (i.e., plus or minus 7 days) that person will also be required to furnish a return in two parts where that alternative day does not coincide with the change in the rate. For example, if a registered person's taxable period ended on the last Saturday of the month and the rate change came into force on the following Wednesday, then that person would be required to furnish a part I return in respect of the period Sunday to Tuesday inclusive and a part II return in respect of the balance of the taxable period.

This amendment applies from the day on which the Act received the Governor-General's assent (i.e., 28th of July 1988) but has no practical application until a change in the rate of GST comes into force.

### Subsection summary

**Section 78A(1)** requires all registered persons whose taxable period does not commence on the same day as the change in the rate comes in to force to furnish a return in two parts for that taxable period. The Part I return covers the period from the beginning of that period to the day before the change in the rate comes into force. The second part covers the balance of the taxable period.

**Section 78A(2)** states that these parts will be in a form prescribed by the Commissioner and be deemed to be a single return.

**Section 78A(3)** provides that if the two parts are furnished separately, section 46 (Interest on refunds) has no application until both of the parts have been received by the Commissioner.

**Section 78A(4)** provides that a return has to be in two parts where a registered person is required to file a return in terms of section 16(2) of the Act because that person has ceased to be registered and the period of that final return spans the change in the rate coming into force.

**(ii) New section 78B - Adjustment to tax payable for persons furnishing returns on payments basis following change in rate of tax**

In general, the application of the new rate in respect of the supply of goods and services will be determined by reference to the time of supply (i.e., this is generally the earlier of the issue of an invoice or any payment being received in respect of the supply). For example, if a service is performed prior to the change in the rate and the invoice is issued after the change in the rate, GST on the supply is imposed at the new rate. Appendix E of this PIB sets out in detail the various time of supply rules in the GST Act and the manner in which the change in the rate will apply.

For registered persons on the invoice basis of accounting, this is consistent with the normal rules of accounting for GST on supplies made or received.

However, in relation to registered persons on the payments basis of accounting this is not the case. Generally, such registered persons account for GST on supplies made or received to the extent that a payment is made or received. This will mean that in any one taxable period a registered person may be accounting for tax in respect of supplies that may have been partly accounted for in previous taxable periods. If there was a change in the rate of GST, such a person would be required to account for tax in relation to different supplies at both the old and new rate on an ongoing basis. In order to simplify accounting for GST and to ensure consistent application of the new rate to supplies made by both types traders on the invoice and payment basis of accounting, an adjustment is provided.

The adjustment is to be made only by persons on the**payments basis** in respect of all taxable supplies made or received (refer Time of Supply rules) that have not been accounted for in calculating the tax payable before the date of the change in the rate of tax. This adjustment is taken into account in either the part I return or the return for the taxable period that ends on the day before the change in the rate of GST. After the adjustment registered persons can apply the new tax rate to ALL amounts received and paid out in subsequent return periods.

### "Qualifying supply"

The adjustment is made in respect of any "qualifying supply". A qualifying supply is:

1.  any taxable supply made to or by a registered person prior to the date of the change in the rate; or
2.  any specified supply within the meaning of section 86 of the GST Act, -

**to the extent** that the consideration for the supply remains unpaid and has not been written off as a bad debt as at date of the change in the rate. The adjustment does not apply to any supply that has been fully taken into account in calculating the tax payable of a registered person in the part I return or any previous taxable period or is zero-rated. Neither does it apply to any supply to the extent to which it has been partly taken into account in calculating the tax payable of a registered person in the part I return or any previous taxable period.

**(i) Taxable supplies made by or to a registered person**

1.  A taxable supply is any supply made in NZ that is charged with GST at 10% in terms of section 8 and includes supplies that are zero-rated. To determine whether supplies are made by or to a registered person prior to the date of the change in the rate, the time of supply rules will apply. Supplies which became taxable on the introduction of GST in terms of section 84 of the Act are also included. Appendix E of this PIB details the time of supply rules. Zero-rated supplies are specifically excluded from being qualifying supplies.

**(ii) Section 86 specified supplies**

On the introduction of GST an adjustment was able to be used by a person on the payments basis of accounting to claim an input credit in respect of debtors outstanding as at 1 October 1986. The registered person then simply accounted for 1/11th of all receipts on or after 1 October 1986. The supplies to which this alternative method applied were termed specified supplies under section 86 of the Act and are covered by the new adjustment to the extent that those supplies have not been previously been \[sic\] accounted for under section 20 of the Act.

**(iii) To the extent that ...**

The purpose of this phrase is to ensure that amount of "qualifying supplies" for the purposes of the adjustment is limited to the amount of the consideration of the supply that remains unpaid and has not been previously accounted for in a prior taxable period or part I return. This means that the total consideration for a supply is included in the adjustment where:

1.  The taxable supply has been made or received prior to the change in the rate;
2.  The total consideration for that supply remains unpaid; and
3.  The total consideration for that supply has not been taken into account in calculating the tax payable by the registered person in the part I return or any previous taxable period.

However, where the consideration for the supply has been paid for in part and accounted for to that extent, only the balance that remains unpaid and unaccounted for is included as "qualifying supply" for the purposes of the adjustment. In addition where any consideration for supply that may constitute a "qualifying supply" has been written off as a bad debt, the consideration for that supply is not to be included in the adjustment.

**(iv) Debit and credit notes**

Where a person on the payments basis of accounting is required to:

1.  make an adjustment, as the supplier, to correct the amount of output tax incorrectly accounted in terms of section 25(2); or
2.  make an adjustment, as the recipient of the supply, to correct the amount of input tax incorrectly accounted in terms of section 25(4) or 25(5)

the adjustment is accounted for in the taxable period in which the person becomes aware of the adjustment to the extent that any payment is received or made. This means in relation to a change in the rate of tax that these supplies will be included as "qualifying supplies" where the registered person has become aware of the adjustment or received a debit or credit note prior to the change in the rate but the consideration for that adjustment still remains unpaid or received as at that date.

**(v) Supplies not included in adjustment**

The legislation specifically excludes supplies that are zero-rated from being a "qualifying supply". This is because the supply will be accounted for at the same rate of tax imposed after the change in the rate.

GST that has been charged by the Customs Department in terms of sections 12 or 13 of the GST Act and remains unpaid as at the date of the change in the rate is**not** included as a "qualifying supply". This is because the GST imposed is not on a taxable supply and the amount paid is separately identified on the GST return form as an input tax adjustment.

It should also be noted that any consideration that remains unpaid and has not been accounted for in the periods mentioned above in respect of secondhand goods acquired by a registered person for which an input tax credit can be claimed is**not** a "qualifying supply". It has been decided that to the extent that the consideration is paid after a change in the rate of tax in respect of such a supply the registered person should claim it at the new rate.

**(vi) Summary**

It is considered that qualifying supplies will generally be supplies that have a time of supply generated in terms of section 9(1), 9(3)(a), 9(3)(aa), or 9(6) of the Act and includes debit and credit notes as discussed above. This is because other supplies are accounted for fully in the taxable period in which the time of supply occurs.

Flow charts are attached to assist in determining whether and to what extent a supply is a "qualifying supply".

### Adjustment

The adjustment will require the registered person to identify the following amounts in respect of "qualifying supplies":

1.  The amount of the consideration payable on "qualifying supplies" made to that person (inputs); and
2.  The amount of the consideration payable on "qualifying supplies" made by that person (outputs).

The amount of consideration payable on "qualifying supplies" made to or by a registered person is limited**to the extent that** the consideration for the supply remains unpaid and has not been previously accounted for in calculating the tax payable in period or part period prior to the day of the change in the rate. If the consideration has been written off as a bad debt then it is not included as consideration for a "qualifying supply" in the adjustment.

The amount in paragraph (ii) is subtracted from the amount in paragraph (i) and the resultant total is then multiplied by the difference between the old tax fraction subtracted from the new tax fraction to give the amount of the adjustment. This adjustment will be on a prescribed form which sets out the calculation.

If the amount of the adjustment calculated is a positive amount then it is deemed to be output tax in the period to the date of the change in the rate.

If the amount of the adjustment calculated is a negative amount then it is a credit (input tax) to the registered person and available to be set off in the following order:

1.  Against any tax payable that is outstanding in respect of any taxable periods ending prior to the change in the rate of GST;
2.  Against any tax payable in respect of the taxable period in which the new rate comes in force;
3.  Against any tax payable in respect of the next taxable period and so on until the amount of the credit is extinguished.

This provision will allow any credit still available to be set off and to be applied to back period reassessment where those assessments have been issued subsequent to the change in the rate.

This credit is in no case refundable by the Commissioner.

### Bad debt adjustment

This adjustment is made where any consideration that has been included as a qualifying supply is subsequently written off as a bad debt. This is to ensure that the adjustment previously made in respect of the consideration for a qualifying supply is reversed. The amount of the adjustment is determined by multiplying the amount of the consideration written off as a bad debt by the difference of the old rate subtracted from the new rate.

If the amount is positive, it is deemed to be output tax in the period in which the bad debt is written off. Conversely, if the amount is negative, it is deemed to be input tax in the period in which it is written off.

### Records

Where any adjustment is made in respect of qualifying supplies the registered person is required to prepare a list of debtors (supplies made by the registered person) and a list of creditors (supplies made to the registered person) showing the amounts due as at the start of the day of the coming into force of the new rate. These lists have to be retained for 10 years in terms of section 75 of the GST Act.

### Application date

The application date of this amendment is the 28th of July 1988 (i.e. the day on which the Act received the Governor-General's assent) but has no practical application until a change in the rate of GST comes into force.

### Subsection summary

**Section 78B(1)** provides that a person on the payments basis is required to make an adjustment in accordance with this section. The adjustment will be on a prescribed form and made in either the part I return required under section 78A or the taxable period ending on the day before the change in the rate.

**Section 78B(2)** sets out what supplies constitute a qualifying supply (and to what extent) for the purposes of this adjustment.

**Section 78B(3)** sets out the manner in which the amount of the adjustment is calculated.

**Section 78B(4)** provides if the amount of the adjustment is a positive amount it is deemed to be output tax attributable to the taxable period referred to in section 78A(1)(c).

**Section 78B(5)** provides that where the amount of the adjustment is a negative amount that the amount shall be a credit and available to be off set against any tax payable by the registered person. The subsection also sets out the order of the set off and provides that the credit shall not be refunded by the Commissioner.

**Section 78B(6)** provides that where the consideration for a qualifying supply has been subsequently written off as a bad debt the registered person is required to make an adjustment to reverse the adjustment made pursuant to section 78B(3). This provision requires the adjustment to be returned as either input or output tax in the taxable period in which the consideration is written off as a bad debt.

**Section 78B(7)** requires the registered person to prepare a list of debtors (in respect of the qualifying supplies made by the registered person) and creditors (in respect of the qualifying supplies made to the registered person) showing the amounts due as at the commencement date of the new rate.

### Consequential amendment

**Section 75(2)** has been consequentially amended by section 4(2).

**Section 4(2)** of the Amendment Act makes a consequential amendment to section 75(2) of the principal Act by inserting in the paragraph (c) the expression section 78B(7). This amendment explicitly ensures the retention of lists of debtors and creditors prepared for the adjustment.

**EXAMPLE**

The following example shows the manner in which the new section 78A and 78B will apply. The example assumes that the rate of GST increases to 12.5% on the 1st day of April 19XX and apply to supplies made on or after this day.

Popular Books Ltd is a registered person carrying on the taxable activity of a stationery and book retailer. The company has been allocated a two monthly category B taxable period and has adopted the payments basis of accounting.

As the company's taxable period spans the new rate coming into force, Popular Books Ltd is required, in terms of section 78A, to furnish a return in two parts for the taxable period 1 March 19XX to 30 April 19XX.

The first part covers the period 1 March 19XX to 31 March 19XX (being the day before the increase in the rate comes into force). The company accounts for supplies in terms of section 20 of the Act as if that part was a taxable period in its own right. This means that the registered person must make any adjustments in terms of section 21 for that part of the taxable period to ensure that it is accounted for at the old rate. The taxable supplies made or received in this part are accounted for at the old rate, i.e. 10%.

The second part covers the period 1 April 19XX to 30 April 19XX. Supplies are accounted for in terms of section 20 of the Act as above and are accounted for at the new rate, in this example 12.5%.

These two parts form a return for the taxable period and the return (i.e., both parts) is due on or before the 1 June 19XX.

As the company is on the payments basis of accounting it is required to make an adjustment in terms of section 78B of the GST Act. The adjustment brings into account all taxable supplies made or received before the date of the rate change, that have not been taken into account for the purposes of calculating the tax payable before that date. This enables that company to account for tax at the new rate on ALL money received or paid out after the rate change.

The company is required to identify, as at 31 March 19XX, its debtors and creditors to establish whether they relate to a qualifying supply for the purposes of the adjustment. This involves ensuring that:

1.  The supplies made or received, for GST purposes, were made prior to the date on which the new rate came into force;
2.  At least some consideration remains unpaid at that date; and
3.  The consideration has not been previously accounted for in any previous taxable period or part I return.

A check of the company's debtors and creditors as at 31 March 19XX shows the following details. These amounts are inclusive of GST and therefore are the consideration unpaid.

| Stationery Ltd | 1450.00 | Bankers Ltd | 1050.00 |
| Builder P/ship | 675.00 | B Black | 120.25 |
| Total | $6,050.00 | J Blue | 75.25 |
|     |     | Total | $2277.50 |

\* The debt owed by K Brown is in respect of a lay-by sale of which $60 has already been paid.

\*\* The creditor Finance Ltd is in respect of the purchase of a cash register in term of a hire purchase agreement.

In relation to the above debtors and creditors the time of supply occurred prior to 31 March 19XX (date of rate change).

The company then has to determine whether the supplies made to and by the company are qualifying supplies. The attached Flow Charts may be of assistance.

The debt of $10 owed by K Brown is not included as a qualifying supply as it is not a supply until the property in the goods is transferred to the recipient (section 9(2)(c)).

The debt of $750 owed to Finance Ltd is not included as a qualifying supply as the supply would have been fully accounted for in the taxable period in which the agreement is executed (section 9(3)(b) and section 20(3)(b)(iii)).

The amount of the qualifying supplies is therefore:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Taxable supplies received $5,300.00 | ($6,050.00 - $750.00) |
| Taxable supplies made $2,267.50 | ($2,277.50 - $ 10.00) |

**Calculation of adjustment:**

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Consideration payable on qualifying supplies made to the registered person (inputs) |     | $5,300.00 |
| less |     |     |
| Consideration payable on qualifying supplies made by the registered person (outputs) |     | $2,267.50 |
|     | (A) | $3,032.50 |

This amount is multiplied by the difference between the old rate tax fraction subtracted from the new rate tax fraction.

Old rate tax fraction: 1/11th

New rate tax fraction: 1/9th

1/9 - 1/11 = 2/99th (B)

The amount of the adjustment = (A) \* (B)

$3,032 50 \* 2/99 = $61.26

As this amount is a positive amount it is treated as output tax in the Part I return in terms of section 78B(1)(c)(i) of the Act.

The adjustment form is attached to the Part I return for the part of the taxable period 1 March 19XX to 31 March 19XX and is due on or before 1 June 19XX (as is the case with Part II of the return).

The company is also required to prepare a list of the debtors and creditors which constitute the "qualifying supplies" showing the amount of consideration due to or by the company as at the commencement of the day that the increased rate comes into force. These lists are not required to be furnished with the return but are required to be retained for 10 years in terms of section 75 of the Act.

When the company makes or receives any payment in respect of these qualifying supplies, GST is accounted for at the NEW RATE i.e., 1/9th of the consideration paid or received.

### Clauses 37 and 38 of Taxation Reform Bill (No. 4)

These clauses which were to introduce new provisions relating to the GST treatment of non-profit bodies were removed from the Bill and were not enacted. These provisions related to: -

1.  GST being imposed on the supply of donated goods and services by non-profit bodies where the value of such supplies exceeded $5,000 per annum;
2.  GST being imposed on the supply of donated goods and services by non-profit bodies that have been significantly altered;
3.  The denial of input tax credits in respect of fund raising activities that do not involve the making of taxable supplies, and also of costs associated with the administering of donation; and
4.  The limitation of input tax credits in respect of taxable activities subsidised by donations.

These clauses were removed to allow the measures to be reviewed by the Brash Committee.

Tax Treatment of Redundancy Payments
------------------------------------

### Calculation of specified sum.

**Example 1 -** Taxpayer has been employed in the same employment for 11 years.

Total remuneration for 3 years prior to the termination of employment was $72,000.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Specified sum is lesser of | (i) | $72,000/3 ($24,000) or |
|     | (ii) | $20,000 |

i.e. Specified sum equals $20,000.

**Example 2 -** Taxpayer has been employed in the same employment for 11 years.

Total remuneration for 3 years prior to the termination of employment was $54,000.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Specified sum is lesser of: | (i) | $54,000/3 ($18,000) or |
|     | (ii) | $20,000 |

i.e. Specified sum equals $18,000.

**Example 3 -** Taxpayer has been employed in the same employment for 4 years and 6 months.

Total remuneration for 3 years prior to the termination of employment was $72,000.

Specified sum is **(4/10) x b**

b is lesser of:

1.  Average Remuneration over last 3 years, or
2.  $20,000

i.e. b is lesser of:

1.  ($72,000/3) x $24,000
2.  $20,000

Therefore b is $20,000 and specified sum is **(4/10) x $20,000 = $8,000**

### Calculation of Tax on Redundancy Payments

**Example 5**

Data as for example 1

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Redundancy payment made: | $50,000 |
| less specified sum | $20,000 |
|     | $30,000 |
| Income Tax (Payable by recipient) on |     |
| 5% of $20,000 at, say, 33c | $330 |
| FBT (Payable by employer) on $30,000 at 24c | $7,200 |
| Example 6 |     |
| Data as for example 1 |     |
| Redundancy payment made: | 18,000 |
| less specified sum: | 20,000 |

**EXAMPLE**

The taxpayer, a company, furnishes 1988 return in August 1988 showing provisional income of $150,000. The 1988 residual income tax is $72,000. 1989 provisional tax is calculated as $46,200 (72,000 x 110% x 28/48). By the third instalment date, the taxpayer decides that provisional income will reduce and uses the estimate option. The taxpayer estimates that residual income tax payable will be $35,000.

Payments are made as follows:

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 7 July 1988 | \-  | $24,000 | \-  | (Old regime payment) |
| 7 November 1988 | \-  | $ 6,800 | \-  | (2/3 of $46,200 less 7/7/88 payment) |
| 25 March 1989 | \-  | $ 3,200 | \-  | (Payment late and short. Should have been estimated residual tax less 1st and 2nd provisional tax instalments) |

When the 1989 return is furnished in August 1989, provisional income is shown as $180,000. 1989 residual income tax is $50,400. The 1989 assessment is issued on 7 November 1989.

**Stage One** - Calculate additional tax for late payment.

Provisional tax paid at the 3rd instalment date was less than provisional tax required to be paid so the taxpayer may be liable for additional tax. The account reads as follows:

| Date | Amount due | Amount paid | Balance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 7 November 1988 | $23,332 | $30,800 | $7,468 CR |
| 7 March 1989 | $11,668 | $0  | $4,200 DR |
| 25 March 1989 | $0  | $3,200 | $1,000 DR |

The account is recast using the taxpayer's estimate of $35,000.

As tax at 7 March was short paid, additional tax of $420 is imposed. The account is not cleared by 7 September 1989 so there is incremental additional tax imposed of $230 as follows:

| Date | Amount due | Amount paid | Balance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 7 March 1989 | $4,200 | $0  | $4,200 DR |
| 8 March 1989 | $420 | $0  | $4,620 DR |
| 25 March 1989 | $0  | $3,200 | $1,420 DR |
| 8 September 1989 | $142 | $0  | $1,562 DR |

Total additional tax for late payment is $562

**Stage two** - Calculate additional tax for underestimation.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1989 provisional tax estimate: | $35,000 |
| 1989 residual income tax: | $50,400 |

The amount estimated by the taxpayer is less than 80% of the residual income tax payable so additional tax must be considered. The taxpayer has voluntarily estimated so the taxpayer has additional tax limited to 10% of the difference between the payments made and the lesser of the 1989 residual income tax and the 1988 residual income tax plus 10%. In this example the 1989 residual income tax is used:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1989 residual income tax: | $50,400 |     |
| Provisional tax payments: | $30,800 | The remaining payment was made after 7.3.88) |
| Balance remaining: | $19,600 |     |
| Additional tax is 10% of balance = | $1,960 |     |

**Stage three** - Calculate interest.

The taxpayer is a not a natural person so automatically qualifies for interest.

Account reads as follows:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1989 residual income tax: | $50,400 |     |
| plus additional tax for: |     |     |
| Late payment: | $420 |     |
| Underestimation: | $ 1,960 |     |
| Total: | $52,780 |     |
|     |     |     |
| Paid to 7 March 1989: | $30,800 |     |
| Balance: | $21,980 |     |
|     |     |     |
| Payment received 25 March 1989: | $ 3,200 |     |
| Balance at 25 March 1989: | $18,780 |     |
|     |     |     |
| Incremental tax 8 September 1989: | $  142 |     |
| Balance at 8 September 1989: | $18,922 |     |

Tax Return assessed 7 November 1989:

Interest is calculated as follows:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 8-3-89 to 25-3-89 (17 days) on $21,980 x 10% x 17/365 | \=  | $102.37 |
| 26-3-89 to 7-9-89 (165 days) on $18,780 x 10% x 165/365 | \=  | $848.95 |
| 7-9-89 to 7-11-89 (60 days ) on $18,922 x 10% x 60/365 | \=  | $311.04 |
| Total interest |     | $1,262.36 |

**Stage four** - the assessment

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| 1989 Residual income tax: | $50,400 |
| Additional tax for: |     |
| Underestimation: | $ 1,960 |
| Late payment: | $ 420 |
| Incremental tax for late payment: | $ 142 |
| Non-penal interest: | $ 1,262.36 |
| Total amount due: | $54,184.36 |
| Payments: | $34,000 |
| Total due as terminal tax: | $20,184.36 |

FLOWCHART OF THE AMENDED PROVISIONAL TAX REGIME

Individual taxpayer with last year's provisional income of greater than $3,000 and current year provisional income less than $1,000,000.

Individual taxpayers with a provisional income last year exceeding $100,000 may use last year's tax with no increment. This is as interim arrangement reflecting the decrease in the marginal tax rates.

FLOWCHART OF THE AMENDED PROVISIONAL TAX REGIME

Non-individual taxpayers with a last year's provisional income of greater than $3,000 and current year provisional income less than $1,000,000.

Non-individual taxpayers may use last year's tax with an increment multiplied by this year's tax rate divided by last year's tax rate. This calculation is an interim arrangement reflecting the changes in tax rates non-individuals have experienced. e.g. Companies multiply the incremented provisional tax figure by 28/48.

Part III - Stamp And Cheque Duties Amendment Act (No 2) 1988
============================================================

Archived legislative commentary on Part III - Stamp And Cheque Duties Amendment Act (No 2) 1988 from PIB vol 174 May 1988.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 174, May 1988.

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_.](/about/about-our-publications)
 

This Amendment Act repeals all stamp duty payable on instruments executed on or after the 17th of March 1988, except for duty payable in respect of commercial land and buildings. Duty will continue to be payable under the old legislation in respect of instruments executed before that date. Where more than one instrument is executed in respect of the same transaction and one of those instruments was executed before the 17th of March 1988 the old legislation will apply to all the instruments involved in that transaction. In particular if an instrument executed before the 17th of March is deliberately destroyed and a replacement instrument is executed on or after that date, the replacement instrument will be liable for duty.

In future only commercial land and buildings will be subject to stamp duty. Duty has been totally abolished in respect of all other property such as shares, mortgages, counterparts and goodwill. All residential property is exempted from duty and the first farm exemption which applies at present will continue to apply in its present form. The change affects conveyance duty, lease duty, deed duty and denoting duty. Cheque duty and credit card transaction duty will continue to be payable as the legislation imposing those duties remains unchanged.

The legislation has been amended, in respect of instruments executed on or after 17 March 1988, to limit conveyance duty and lease duty to conveyances and leases of land, buildings, improvements and appurtenances and to shares in flat or office owning companies which carry the right to occupy a flat or an office. The legislation then provides a total exemption, in the new sections 24 and 35, for conveyances and leases of dwellinghouses and for shares in a flat or office owning company to the extent that they carry the right to occupy a dwellinghouse therein.

A dwellinghouse is defined in the legislation, both for conveyance duty and lease duty purposes, as a house, flat, townhouse, home unit or similar dwelling erected primarily and principally as a residence. The definition includes any land improvements or appurtenances belonging to the residence or usually enjoyed with it. To be eligible for the exemption, the dwellinghouse must be occupied primarily and principally as a residence as soon as practicable after the date of execution of the instrument of conveyance. **There is, however, no requirement that it is occupied by the purchaser or a member of the purchaser's family**. Accordingly, flats will be eligible for the exemption. The exemption will not apply in respect of **hotels, motels** and similar buildings as they are not the types of buildings specified in the dwellinghouse definition.

Land purchased for the purpose of having a dwellinghouse erected on it will qualify for exemption provided a dwellinghouse is erected on the land as soon as is practicable and provided the dwellinghouse is occupied as a residence as soon as practicable after execution of the instrument of conveyance.

Where a dwellinghouse forms a part of a property that is used for other purposes (e.g., a farm or a custodian's flat in an office building), the legislation requires an apportionment to be made so that the exemption can apply in respect of the value of the dwellinghouse. Also, the legislation contains a restriction on the area of land that can be regarded as part of the dwellinghouse. It restricts it to a maximum of 4500 square metres or such larger area as the Commissioner is satisfied is appropriate for residential purposes having regard to the size, of character of the residence and the nature of the property.

Where a building is used wholly for residential purposes, but contains more than one "dwellinghouse" it is fully exempt provided the definition of "dwellinghouse" is fully met. The exemption would apply to a block of flats but not to a hotel as the former contains "dwellinghouses" (i.e., flats) but the latter does not.

The legislation requires instruments to be presented for stamping only where there is, or may be, a liability for stamp duty. Instruments which are clearly exempt need no longer be presented, although instruments relating to first farms or residential properties in excess of 4500 square metres will still need to be presented as these require the Commissioner to exercise a discretion before they can qualify for exemption.

Where an instrument is not liable for duty but either of the parties wish to have it stamped it may be presented to the Department for stamping. If it is not liable for duty it will stamped 'not liable' without charge.

Stamp duty will no longer be payable in respect of the conveyance of shares (other than shares in flat or office owning company) where the relevant instrument is executed on or after 17 March 1987. As a result, the legislation repeals the provisions that enable stockbrokers to stamp share transfers. The repeal, however, applies only in respect of documents executed on or after 17 March 1988, the effect being that if for any reason clients wish those share transfers to be stamped 'not liable' it will be necessary for them to be stamped by the Department. In relation to share transfers which were executed prior to 17 March 1988 the previous arrangement continues to apply notwithstanding the fact that the document will be stamped after 17 March. The arrangement is in terms of the section 51A agreement entered into between the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Stock Exchange Association. The arrangement authorises the payment of stamp duty payable on an instrument of conveyance executed in fulfilment of an authorised transaction. Under the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act a contract note is an instrument of conveyance and for the purposes of the agreement the payment of stamp duty, for the purchase of shares, is made when the contract note is completed by an authorised sharebroker. Accordingly:

*   No stamp duty will be payable on instruments of conveyance, for the purchase of shares, where a contract note has been completed by an authorised sharebroker on or after 17 March 1988. This is so even if the vendor has exercised a selling order prior to 17 March 1988.
*   Contract notes completed prior to 17 March 1988 will be liable for stamp duty, the payment of which should be made in a normal manner.

The exemption in relation to share transfers applies not only to shares in public companies but also to shares in private companies. The exemption applies notwithstanding the fact that the company may own land and buildings which would be subject to stamp duty if the property, rather than the shares, had been transferred. In future, the only shares that will be subject to conveyance duty, at the rate of 40 cents per $100, are shares in a flat or office owning company, the articles of which provide the holder of shares with the right to occupy an office or other commercial premises. These shares will be exempt only where they convey the right to occupy a dwellinghouse.

Finally, deed duty and denoting duty have been totally abolished in respect of instruments executed on or after the 17th of March 1988.

The following is an explanation of the provisions in the legislation which achieve these overall effects.

Section 1
---------

is the Short Title and Application Date provision. It provides that the amendments apply to instruments executed on or after the 17th of March 2988. Where more than one instrument is executed in respect of the same transaction and one of those instruments was executed before the 17th of March, all instruments relating to that transaction will be subject to the law which applied prior to the amendment.

Section 2(1)
------------

inserts a new definition of land into section 2 of the principal Act. The new definition covers land within New Zealand and includes:

1.  Buildings, appurtenances and improvements;
2.  Any mining right relating to land in New Zealand;
3.  Any mining right relating to the foreshore, the seabed, the subsoil beneath the seabed, or the waters above the seabed, within the territorial limits of New Zealand;
4.  Any licence issued under the Petroleum Act 1937 or the Continental Shelf Act 1964 in respect of the continental shelf beyond the territorial limits of New Zealand.

In addition, the legislation makes it clear that the definition includes any estate or interest in land (i.e., in land, buildings, mining rights, etc) whether or not that estate or interest is legal or equitable, corporeal or incorporeal. However, the definition does not include any mortgage, debenture, bond or other security for the payment of money that is charged on land.

The principal reason for this definition is contained in the section of the principal. Act which imposes stamp duty. Under that section "conveyances and leases of land" will be subject to stamp duty where the instrument is executed on or after the 17th of March 1988.

Section 2(2)
------------

of the Amendment Act inserts a new definition of property into section 2 of the principal Act. It is defined as meaning any property, or proprietary right, in land or in shares in a flat or office owning company. It essentially embraces the two types of property which in future come within the provisions of the stamp duty legislation.

Section 2(3)
------------

includes, in section 2 of the principal Act, a new definition of 'shares' and a definition of 'shares in a flat or office owning company'. These definitions are largely self explanatory. The first limits 'shares' to shares in a flat or office owning company. The latter defines these as being shares in a company whose articles provide that the holder is entitled, by virtue of being the holder of the shares, to occupy or use a flat, office, commercial or other premises on land in New Zealand. These shares continue to be liable for stamp duty, subject of course to the exemption for residential premises.

Section 3
---------

inserts a new section 10 into the legislation with application to instruments executed on or after the 17th of March 1988. The new section restricts liability to stamp duty to conveyances and leases of land and conveyances of shares in a flat or office owning company. The provisions of the present section 10 will continue to apply in respect of instruments executed before that date.

Section 4
---------

inserts a new section 24 to provide an exemption from conveyance duty in respect of residential land and buildings. The exemption will apply to property which is:

1.  a dwellinghouse.
2.  Land acquired for the purpose of having a dwellinghouse erected on it.
3.  Shares in a flat or office owning company that carry a right of use or occupation of a dwellinghouse (but only to the extent of the value of the dwellinghouse).

Before the exemption can apply, it must be established that the dwelling will be occupied as soon as possible after the date of execution of the instrument of conveyance, primarily and principally as a residence. Where this test is not met, the exemption cannot apply. There is, however, no requirement that the dwelling be occupied as a principal place of abode nor is it necessary for it to be occupied by the purchaser or by a member of the purchaser's family.

### Subsection (2)

of the new section 24 sets out the rules relating to the apportionment of the value of a conveyance between property that is liable for stamp duty and property which is exempt. It provides for an apportionment where:

1.  The property conveyed in an instrument consists partly of property that is subject to stamp duty and partly of property which is exempted by subsection (1) of section 24.
2.  The property exceeds the greater of 4,500 square metres or such area as is reasonably appropriate for residential purposes having regard to the size and character of the dwellinghouse (either one or more dwellinghouses on the property or one or more to be erected thereon) and to the nature of the property.
3.  Any building (or buildings) on the property, or to be erected thereon, are to be used partly as a dwellinghouse (or dwellinghouses) and partly for other purposes.

In these cases, the legislation provides for the value of the dwellinghouse to be excluded from the value of the property in determining the amount on which stamp duty is payable.

### Subsection (3)

of the new section 24 contains the definition of a dwellinghouse. It means a building or part of a building, that is a house, flat, townhouse, home and or similar dwelling erected primarily and principally as a residence. The definition includes any land, improvements or appurtenances belonging to the dwellinghouse or usually enjoyed with it. It does not include a hotel or motel or similar property but would include a building which consisted solely of a number of dwellinghouses (e.g., a block of flats).

Section 5
---------

of the Amendment Act inserts a new section 35 to provide an exemption from lease duty for dwellinghouses. The exemption is the same as that provided in relation to conveyance duty by the new section 24 (discussed above), with the exception that it does not make reference to shares in flat or office owning companies as this is not required.

Section 6
---------

of the Amendment Act abolishes deed duty and denoting duty by repealing sections 36 and 37 of the principal Act. These duties will not be payable on any instrument executed on or after the 17th of March 1988.

Section 7
---------

of the Amendment Act makes a number of consequential amendments as set out in Part 1 of the First Schedule to the Act. The section also amends a number of enactments and these are set out in Part II of the First Schedule. The amendments are all required as a result of the fact that in future conveyance duty and lease duty are payable on commercial land and buildings only. They are largely self explanatory, but the following points should be noted:

*   the concessional rate for shares and mining rights contained in section 15(3) of the Act has been retained, although in future only shares in flat or office owning companies will be subject to conveyance duty.
*   the exemption for first farms (section 22B) has been retained. The amendments in Part 1 of the Schedule remove references to shares and farming companies as the conveyance of shares in a company is no longer subject to conveyance duty.
*   although sections 51 and 51A nave been repealed, they remain in force in respect of all instruments executed before the 17th of March 1988, even where the document may be stamped after that date. The repeal applies only in respect o instruments executed on or after 17 March 1988, as do all the other repeals contained in Part 1 of the Schedule.

Following the introduction of the legislation, some questions have been raised concerning its application. The most commonly asked questions, and the answers to them, are as follows:

Q:

Are documents which are no longer liable for duty still required to be presented?

A:

Documents which are clearly not liable for duty are not required to be presented. However, if for any reason any person wishes to present a document to the Department for stamping, it will be stamped not liable without charge if no stamp duty is payable.

Q:

If an agreement is executed before 17.3.88 but the relevant transfer takes place on or after 17.3.88, is the transfer liable for duty?

A:

Yes it is liable for duty. Where more than one instrument is executed in respect of the same transaction and one of those instruments was executed before the 17th of March 1988, then all of those documents will be liable for duty.

Q:

Are assignments of hire purchase liable for duty?

A:

Assignments of hire purchase will only be liable for duty if the instrument was executed before the 17th of March 1988.

Q:

Do transfers of residential land over 4,500 square metres still have to be presented?

A:

Yes they have to be presented. The property is only exempt where the Commissioner exercises a discretion under section 24 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971.

Q:

Section 47 of the Land Transfer Act 1952 requires documents that are liable for stamp duty to be stamped by Inland Revenue before they can be registered. Does this mean that documents which convey residential property must continue to be presented for stamping to enable them to be registered by the Land Transfer Office?

A:

Agreement has been reached with the Registrar-General of Land and the New Zealand Law Society in relation to whether instruments of conveyance or lease of residential property must be stamped by the Department. It has been agreed that instruments will be accepted for registration by the Land Transfer Office where they have either been stamped by the Department or are accompanied by a certificate, signed by a solicitor who is a member of the Law Society, that takes the following form:

### INSTRUMENT OF CONVEYANCE

"I hereby certify, for the purposes of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971, that no conveyance duty is payable on this instrument by reason of the application of section 24(1) of the Act, and that the provisions of subsection (2) of that section do not apply"

### LEASE

"I hereby certify, for the purposes of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971, that no lease duty is payable on this instrument by reason of the application of section 35(1) of that Act, and that the provisions of subsection (2) of that section do not apply"

There is no obligation on any solicitor to complete this certificate. Where a solicitor is unwilling to do so, the Department will stamp the instrument in the usual way. In these cases, some evidence will need to be provided to satisfy the Department that the property meets the requirements of section 24, or 35, of the Act.

A new form is being prepared for conveyances and leases of residential property and this will be made available as soon as possible. In the meantime a suitably adapted form IR673 similar certification, signed by the purchaser, will be acceptable.

Q:

What if there is any doubt over liability for duty?

A:

Documents may be presented to the Department for determining whether or not they are liable for stamp duty. If the document is not liable for duty, we will stamp it "not liable" without charge.

Q:

Do instruments in respect of first farms have to be presented? If so, is form IR670 still suitable for use?

A:

Yes a farm is only exempt from duty if the Commissioner is satisfied that the conditions of section 22B of the Act are fulfilled.

The form used for the first farm exemption will continue to be suitable in the immediate future.

Q:

Is goodwill which is involved in an agreement for sale and purchase of a business still liable for duty?

A:

If the agreement for sale and purchase was executed before the 17th March 1988 then the goodwill aspect is liable for stamp duty. Instruments executed on or after the 17th or March 1988 involving goodwill are no longer liable for duty.

Q:

Are sales and leases of fishing ITQ's (individual transferable quotas) still subject to stamp duty?

A:

No. Where the relevant instrument is executed on or after the 17th of March 1988 it will be exempt from stamp duty. Deed duty has been abolished and the definition of 'land' for conveyance duty and lease duty purposes no longer includes "any estate or interest in ...... the foreshore, the seabed, the subsoil beneath the seabed, or the waters above the seabed, within the territorial limits of New Zealand".

Part of claim that did not comply with strict procedural requirements struck out by Taxation Review Authority
=============================================================================================================

2018 case note - part of claim that did not comply with strict procedural requirements struck out by Taxation Review Authority.

Case

TRA 008/17 \[2018\] NZTRA 02

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994, ss 89C(eb), 138B & 138H

### Summary

The Taxation Review Authority (“TRA”) upheld an application by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) to strike out those parts of the disputant’s Notice of Claim that related to the Commissioner’s 2011 reassessment of a GST return filed by the disputant in 2008.

### Impact

This decision confirms that the procedural requirements for commencing challenge proceedings are strictly adhered to. Where a challenge has been filed that does not meet those requirements, it is not possible to “piggy back” the claim onto a challenge which has been correctly brought, as the non-compliant parts of the challenge will be struck out pursuant to s 138H.

### Facts

On 30 May 2011 the Commissioner issued a notice of (re)assessment to the disputant for the GST period ended 31 July 2008 amending the GST refund of $144,706.72 claimed by the disputant to nil (2008 Reassessment). This reassessment was made pursuant to s 89C(eb) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“TAA”).

A Notice of Proposed Adjustment (“NOPA”) was received by the Commissioner on 29 July 2011.

On 3 August 2011 a Notice of Claim was filed by the disputant in the TRA and served on the Commissioner.

The Commissioner sent a letter dated 25 August 2011 to the disputant stating that the Commissioner would be rejecting the NOPA in full. The Commissioner’s Notice of Response (“NOR”) was issued on 26 September 2011.

On 3 November 2011 the Commissioner received a letter from the disputant rejecting the NOR.

On 24 November 2011 the Commissioner asked the disputant to confirm whether he intend to continue the challenge proceeding already commenced in the TRA or to pursue the disputes process with the Commissioner. The disputant replied stating that he intends to pursue the challenge proceedings and request that the disputes process “be put in abeyance in the meantime”.

A Notice of Discontinuance of the TRA proceeding was filed by the disputant on 30 September 2013. On the same date, he wrote requesting that the Commissioner progress the dispute. The Commissioner replied stating that by discontinuing the TRA proceeding, the disputant had accepted the Commissioner’s assessment. Further, she stated that the challenge had been finalised and there was no longer any dispute to progress.

On 3 August 2015 the disputant wrote to the Commissioner noting that it was more than 4 years since the disputant’s NOPA was issued and requesting that the refund be paid. On 19 September 2016 the Commissioner sent a letter to the disputant stating that no GST refund would be paid.

In 2017 the disputant issued challenge proceedings in the TRA in respect of two disputable decisions: (1) the cancellation of the disputant’s GST registration; and (2) the 2008 Reassessment. The Commissioner applied to strike out those parts of the 2017 Notice of Claim that related to the 2008 Reassessment on the basis of lack of jurisdiction or, alternatively, abuse of process.

### Decision

The judgment briefly set out the principles applying to strike out applications – that a cause of action may only be struck out where it is so clearly untenable that it cannot possibly succeed, and that the jurisdiction is to be exercised sparingly and only in clear cases.

The disputant submitted that s 138B(1) was the applicable subsection and the Commissioner submitted that s 138B(3) applied. Section 138B(1)(a) allows the disputant to challenge an assessment by commencing proceedings in a hearing authority if the assessment includes “an adjustment proposed by the Commissioner” which the disputant has rejected within the applicable response period.

The Judge referred to _Allen v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2006\] NZLR 1, where the Court of Appeal considered the term “adjustment proposed” in s 138B(3). The Court stated that the term “adjustment proposed” in s 138B(3) refers to an adjustment proposed in a NOPA. The TRA in the present case noted that the words “adjustment proposed” are also used in s 138B(1) and (2) and it has been accepted that the same meaning applies in each of these subsections.

The Commissioner issued the 2008 Reassessment pursuant to s 89C(eb). Under this subsection, the Commissioner can make an assessment without first issuing a NOPA where she has reasonable grounds to believe that the taxpayer has been involved in fraudulent activity. Judge Sinclair confirmed that where the Commissioner issues an assessment without first issuing a NOPA, and the disputant wishes to contest that assessment, then the disputant is required to issue a NOPA and s 138B(3) applies.

Where pursuant to s 138B(3)(a), the Commissioner issues a NOR within the applicable response period rejecting the adjustment proposed by the disputant and does not subsequently issue an amended assessment, the disputant is entitled under s 138B(3)(b) to challenge that assessment by commencing proceedings in a hearing authority within the “response period of the written disputable decision by the Commissioner that the proposed adjustment will not be adjusted”.

The TRA stated that the claim relating to the 2008 Reassessment included in the Notice of Claim filed in 2017 had not been filed within any applicable response period (which would have commenced in 2011). Furthermore, it is not possible to overcome the difficulties in this situation by endeavouring to “piggy back” the claim on a challenge which has been correctly brought. No application was made for extraordinary circumstances.

The TRA stated that the disputant breached the strict procedure for the commencement of a challenge proceeding and the TRA has no discretion and no jurisdiction to consider the claim. The cause of action relating to the 2008 Reassessment was accordingly struck out.

In light of her decision, the Judge did not consider the alternative argument of abuse of process.

Part VII - Land Tax Amendment Act 1988
======================================

Archived legislative commentary on Part VII - Land Tax Amendment Act 1988 from PIB vol 174 May 1988.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 174, May 1988

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_.](/about/about-our-publications)

This Act amends Part IV of the Land Tax Act 1976, which deals with the recovery of land tax from defaulting taxpayers. In particular the amendments:-

1.  rewrite sections 49 and 50 of the Act, which deal with the recovery of tax from persons other than owners of the land and the registration of the land tax change, to give effect to the recommendations contained in the report of Property Law and Equity Reform Committee on land tax charges; and
2.  include in the Land Tax Act section 400 of the Income Tax Act 1976, which provides for the deduction of tax from payments due to defaulters, by amending section 51 of the Act. Section 51 deals with the application of certain provisions of the Income Tax act 1976 relating to recovery procedures.

Section 1 - Short Title, Commencement and Application
-----------------------------------------------------

**Subsection (1)**

provides that this Act is to be read with, and form part of, the Land Tax Act 1976.

**Subsection (2)**

provides that the Act shall apply with respect to the land tax payable for the year of assessment commencing on 1 April 1988 and for every subsequent year.

Section 2 - Recovery of tax from persons other than the owner of the land
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section repeals section 49 of the principal Act and substitutes a new section. The previous section provided that where any land tax payer was in default in the payment of the tax the Commissioner could demand the unpaid land tax from any of the following persons who then became liable to pay the tax:

1.  Successors in title;
2.  Tenants;
3.  Mortgagees;

in relation to the land in respect of which the land tax was assessed. The amendment, which is discussed in full below, is based upon the recommendations of the Property Law and Equity Reform Committee report on land tax charges. The principal change being that the collection of unpaid land tax has been modified. The provisions in relation to successors-in-title have been removed and the provisions in relation to tenants and mortgagees have been substantially modified.

Section 3 - The registration of a charge on land
------------------------------------------------

This section repeals section 50 of the principal Act and substitutes a new section. The previous section provided that land tax which was due and payable constituted an automatic charge on the land, such charges ranked ahead of all other encumbrances and once a charge was registered no disposition of any estate or interest in the land could be registered.

The amendment, which is discussed in full below, is based upon the recommendations of the Property Law and Equity Reform Committee report on land tax charges. The principal change is that the previous automatic charge has been abolished and land tax charges will only arise upon registration.

Section 4 - Application of certain provisions of Income Tax Act 1976 relating to recovery procedures
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section amends section 51 of the principal Act which includes the application of certain Income Tax provisions for the purposes of Land Tax.

The amendment includes the application of section 400 of the Income Tax Act 1976 into the principal Act.

### Background to sections 2 and 3

Sections 49 and 50, taken together, gave the Commissioner the power to recover land tax from a person other than the person who was assessed for land tax and to secure the payment of any unpaid tax by registering a charge against the land which prevented any dealing in the land.

The Property Law and Equity Reform Committee reviewed the provisions of the Land Tax Act in relation to land tax charges and subsequently reported to the Minister of Justice on certain problems that it identified. In the course of investigating a problem, which could arise for a purchaser of land which was affected by a charge for land tax, the Committee noted that the effect of some provisions of the Act were unfair. In particular the Committee considered that it was wrong that the provisions of the Act should hang over the security of title of an innocent purchaser especially where, in every other respect, the purchaser could rely on a clear land transfer register and due enquiries made by the solicitor acting on behalf of the purchaser. The Committee also considered that it was unfair to collect unpaid land tax from mortgagees, tenants, and successors-in-title. On the basis of this concern the Committee recommended, to the Minister of Justice, that the provisions of section 49 and 50 of the Land Tax Act 1976 be amended so that:

1.  A purchaser who registers his transfer before a land tax charge is presented for registration will have no liability for the land tax of his predecessor(s) in title;
2.  Where land has passed out the hands of a taxpayer, the Department will have no right to collect land tax personally from any successor in title, and until the Department's charge is registered, its rights would be those of an unregistered chargeholder;
3.  The guaranteed search notes provisions (Land Transfer Act 1952, section 172A as inserted by the Land Transfer Amendment Act 1982) would apply to protect a purchaser or mortgagee relying on the Land Transfer Register;
4.  A mortgage registered before a land tax charge is presented for registration will have priority over the land tax charge;
5.  The Department's right to claim land tax from a tenant of the taxpayer should be limited to requiring the tenant to pay a sum to the Department in lieu of rental or other payment which would otherwise be due to be paid by the tenant to the taxpayer.
6.  A mortgagee exercising a power of sale will not be liable to account to the Department for land tax except for such amount as is stated in a land tax charge registered prior to the date of the mortgagee sale, provided that the Department has given not less than one month's prior notice of the intention of the mortgagee to conduct a sale. The presence of the charge on the title should not prevent transfer of the title by a prior ranking mortgagee.

The Minister of Revenue considered the proposals of the Committee and agreed to their recommendations. Sections (2) and (3) of this Act implement the Committee's recommendations.

### THE AMENDMENT

Section 2 - Recovery Of Tax From Persons Other Than The Owner Of The Land
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section repeals section 49 of the principal Act and substitutes the following section which is designed to implement the committee's recommendations (b); (e); and (f).

**Subsection (1) - Recovery of tax from tenant**

Subsection (1) implements recommendation (e) and provides that where assessed land tax has become due and payable and the taxpayer has made default in payment:

*   the Commissioner may demand payment of the tax from any person who, is at the time, a tenant of the land: and
*   the tenant becomes personally liable in respect of the unpaid land tax.

That liability, however, is limited to any rent payable (or to be payable) by the tenant at the time the demand is received. Furthermore any tax paid by the tenant pursuant to the subsection shall be deducted from the rent payable by the tenant.

Before a tenant becomes personally liable for the unpaid land tax, the Commissioner must give notice of the demand for payment to the tenant and that notice must be in writing.

Under the previous provision the tenant may have been held personally liable in the same manner as the taxpayer for any unpaid land tax. This liability is now limited to the extent of the rent payable by the tenant to the taxpayer. This change in emphasis reflects the fact that land tax is in reality a personal tax which happens to be levied in a manner which depends upon the level of property ownership of the taxpayer. This amendment (and the others in this Act) to the principal Act is based on the premise that it is unfair that a person should be held liable for the tax properly payable by another merely because he or she is a successor-in-title, mortgagee or tenant of the real taxpayer.

**Subsection (2) and (3) implement recommendation (f)**

**Subsection (2) - Recovery of tax from mortgagee**

Subsection (2) provides that where assessed land tax has become due and payable and the taxpayer has made default in payment:

*   the Commissioner may demand payment of the tax from any person who at time is a mortgagee who has failed to comply with the requirements of subsection (3) of this section and who after the giving of notice by the Commissioner exercises a power of sale over the land; and
*   the mortgagee shall thereupon become personally liable for any unpaid land tax.

That liability, however, is limited to the extent of the moneys referred to in paragraph (d) of the Land Transfer Act 1952.

Essentially this money is the surplus which would have been left over after all mortgages, costs, etc., have been paid to those entitled to payment.

**Subsection (3) - Mortgagee to give notice**

Subsection (3) places a requirement on a mortgagee of an estate or interest in land (not being land that is exempt from land tax) who intends to exercise a power of sale over that land to inform the Commissioner of that intention.

The subsection requires that the notice be in writing and also that the mortgagee inform the Commissioner, of the intention, at least one month before the date of the sale.

The combined effect of subsections (2) and (3) is that so long as the mortgagee gives the Commissioner at least one month's prior notice of the intention to exercise the mortgagee sale then he will not be held personally liable for any unpaid land tax. However where the mortgagee fails to give that notice a personal liability may result. This liability will occur where, following the demand for payment of the tax by the Commissioner, the mortgagee exercises a power of sale. The extent of the liability is limited to the surplus that would be available to the mortgagor from the proceeds of the sale. Furthermore the liability may exist even if the Commissioner has not registered a charge pursuant to section 50 of the Land Tax Act. Where the Commissioner has registered a charge however, then the provisions of the Land Transfer Act 1952 will ensure the appropriate share of the proceeds for the payment of the tax. The entitlement to proceeds is based on the priority rankings in the provision.

These new subsections also ensure that recommendation (b) of the Committee is implemented as the Land Tax Act no longer places a personal liability on a successor-in-title which was the case previously.

**Subsection (4) - Recovery of amount paid from defaulter**

Subsection (4) ensures that any tenant or mortgagee who pays any land tax pursuant to this section is entitled to recover the amount so paid from the taxpayer as a debt, or to retain or deduct the amount out of or from any money which is payable to the taxpayer by either the tenant or mortgagee. This subsection is self explanatory and the recovery of the amount paid is only tempered where the person has agreed with the taxpayer to pay the land tax. In such a situation this subsection has no application.

**Subsection (5) - Contractural arrangements to pay tax**

Subsection (5) provides that the provisions of this section shall not affect the terms of any contract entered into between relevant parties as to the liability of payment for land tax. However in the situation where the owner has contracted to pay the land tax, then that contract does not effect the provisions of subsection (1) of this section where the owner of the land is in default. The tenant may deduct the amount of tax owed from any rent which is or becomes payable to the owner by the tenant.

**Subsection (6) - Amounts are paid on behalf of taxpayer**

Subsection (6) provides that all payments made under this section by any person on whom demand has been made shall be deemed to be made by the taxpayer. This is a technical amendment which ensures that when an amount of unpaid tax has been paid on behalf of a defaulting taxpayer, credit for the payment is given to the taxpayer.

**Subsection (7) - Apportionment by Commissioner**

Subsection (7) provides that where the land held by a tenant, or subject to a mortgage, is only part of the land for which the land tax was assessed the tax shall be apportioned by the Commissioner in such manner as he thinks fit. Following that determination the liability of the tenant or mortgagee shall be determined accordingly. This provision takes account of the fact that the land upon which the liability of land tax is assessed may be in the hands of several tenants or subject to more than one mortgage.

Section (3) - The Registration Of A Charge On Land
--------------------------------------------------

This section repeals section 50 of the principal Act and substitutes the following section which is designed to implement the Committee's recommendations (a), (c) and (d).

**Subsection 1 - Registration of Charge**

Subsection (1) implements recommendations (a) and (d). This the operative provision in relation to the Commissioner registering a land tax charge. Before the Commissioner can register a land tax charge the taxpayer must be in default in payment of the amount of tax due. The subsection sets out the method the Commissioner undertakes to register the charge. The methods are the same as those that existed in the previous section and for that reason are not presently addressed.

It is important to note the fundamental change that this provision makes for the registration of land tax charges. The previous provision created an automatic charge on any land upon which land tax had been assessed and became due and payable. The automatic charge also had priority over all existing or subsequent mortgages, charges, or encumbrances and the land continued to be subject to the charge irrespective of any disposition of any estate or interest in the land.

This new provision enables the Commissioner to register a land tax charge. However the charge no longer crystallises automatically. This change will ensure that any person who intends to deal with the land will have prior knowledge of any claim that the Commissioner may have on the land due to a default in the payment of the tax by the owner of the land. More importantly any purchaser who registers a transfer before the Commissioner presents a land tax charge for registration will have no liability for land tax of the predecessor(s) in title. This is because subsection (1) only entitles the Commissioner to register a charge on the land of the taxpayer. Previously the automatic charge went on the land irrespective of ownership. Also as the registration of the charge by the Commissioner is now subject to the relevant provisions of the Land Transfer Act instruments registered prior to the charge have priority over the charge (recommendation (d)).

**Subsection (2) - Certificate to be signed**

Subsection (2) follows from the provisions in subsection (1) which relate to the method of registration. This provision provides that the certificate deposited with the District Land Registrar or Registrar of Deeds must be signed by the Commissioner or on behalf of the Commissioner. Those Officers the Department who act on behalf of the Commissioner do so pursuant to the power to delegate vested in the Commissioner.

**Subsection (3) - No disposition to be registered where land subject to charge**

Subsection (3) provides that no disposition of any estate interest in any land shall be registered while a charge this section is registered against the land. This provision has not been amended and is the same as was previously in section 50. This ensures that when the Commissioner registers the charge, the defaulting taxpayer is prevented from evading liability for tax by disposing of the property. Furthermore, the provision will encourage the defaulter to pay the tax in full as potential purchasers will insist that the charge be discharged; otherwise they will not be able to register their interest in the land.

**Subsection (4) - Statutory charges rank equally**

Subsection (4) provides that if any land subject to a land tax charge is also subject to another statutory charge, the charges shall rank equally with each other unless, by virtue of the other Act, that statutory charge would be deferred to the land tax charge.

**Subsection (5) - Guaranteed search notes**

Subsection (5) implements recommendation (c) of the Committee and ensures that the guaranteed search notes provisions of the Land Transfer Act apply to protect any person acquiring any estate or interest in the land so that such persons may rely on the Land Transfer Register.

**Subsection (6) - Enforcement of charges**

Subsection (6) is a procedural provision which provides for the enforcement of any charge. The provision provides that the High Court may make such an order as it thinks fit. Such an order could include the sale of the estate or interest that is subject to the charge, or for the appointment of a Receiver. Furthermore any order for sale shall be carried into effect by the Sheriff in the same manner as a writ for sale.

**Subsection (7) - Charge secures tax payable for year of assessment**

Subsection (7) provides that the registered charge, will operate to secure all the land tax payable for the particular year of assessment and will also include any subsequent year of assessment, unless the charge has been released by the Commissioner before that latter tax has been assessed.

**Subsection (8) - Release of charge**

Subsection (8) provides the conditions that must exist before the Commissioner will release a registered charge. Firstly upon payment of all the tax for the time being secured by the charge. Secondly, where the land is subject to a mortgage, registered prior to the charge, and the mortgagee exercises a power of sale over the land.

**Subsection (9) - Amount payable upon release of charge**

Subsection (9) provides for the amount to be payable, to the Land Transfer Registrar or Registrar of Deeds, on the registration of any release.

**Subsection (10) - Owner of land to pay fees**

Subsection (10) provides that the fees are to be payable by the owner of the land charged or other person by whom the land tax was payable. Such fees are to be paid in the first instance to the Commissioner.

**Subsection (11) - Application for release by Commissioner**

Subsection (11) provides that the application for the registration of the release shall be made by the Commissioner in writing. Furthermore in the application the Commissioner shall certify that the registration fee has been paid or, if the case so requires, recommend that the release be registered without payment of a registration fee.

Section (4) - The Registration Of A Charge On Land
--------------------------------------------------

This section amends section 51 of the principal Act to include the application of section 400 of the Income Tax act 1976 into the Land Tax Act. Section 400 provides for the deduction of tax from payments which are otherwise due to defaulters. This amendment is consistent with the thrust of the Property and Law Reform Committee which concluded that land tax was in reality a personal tax. As a personal tax the recovery focus should be placed on the defaulter. The inclusion of the application of section 400 of the Income Tax Act is consistent with this approach.

Partial strike out of Judicial Review of Commissioner’s decision to issue notices under s 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994
===============================================================================================================================

2016 case note - partial strike out of Judicial Review of CIR's decision to issue notices - section 17 notice, legitimate expectation, relevant considerations, DTA.

Case

Chatfield & Co Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2016\] NZHC 2289

Legislative References

Section 17 Tax Administration Act 1994, Judicature Amendment Act 1972 and Double Taxation Relief (Republic of Korea) Order 1983

### Summary

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) applied to strike out an application by Chatfield Co Ltd and Chatfield & Co’s (together “Chatfield”) seeking judicial review of the decision of the Commissioner to issues notices under s 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“TAA”). The Court struck out the first cause of action and the first two particulars of the second cause of action. The third particular of the second cause of action, alleging that the Commissioner did not take into account the terms of Article 25 of the Double Taxation Relief (Republic of Korea) Order 1983 (“the DTA”), the Court considered to be reasonably arguable and permitted to proceed to trial.

### Impact

Chatfield’s substantive proceeding will continue to trial on the sole cause of action alleging the Commissioner did not take into account the terms of the DTA when issuing the 15 notices under s 17 of the Tax administration Act 1994 requiring Chatfield to produce documents and records held on behalf of various companies (“the Notices”).

This decision highlights the limited scope for an application of legitimate expectation as a cause of action in judicial review in a tax context.

### Facts

Chatfield is the registered tax agent of various companies (“the Companies”) which are currently under investigation by the tax authorities of the Republic of Korea (“Korea”). Korea’s National Tax Service (“the NTS") asked the Commissioner to obtain and provide information relating to the Companies, pursuant to the DTA.

The Commissioner issued the Notices. Chatfield resisted the Notices and in its judicial review application asked the court to set them aside on two grounds.

The Commissioner contended that neither of the causes of action pleaded by Chatfield was reasonably arguable.

### Decision

Lang J struck out the first cause of action and the first two particulars of the second cause of action, ordering costs in the Commissioner’s favour.

On the second cause of action Lang J held that the third particular, whether the terms of the DTA had been taken into account, needed to go to trial.

_The first cause of action: denial of legitimate expectation_

Lang J considered there are significant obstacles to this cause of action, referring to the Court of Appeal decision in _Dandelion Investments Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2003\] 1 NZLR 600 (CA) as an example of the approach courts are likely to take in respect of a claimed legitimate expectation in a tax context. Lang J went on to state that “the Court of Appeal has not yet definitively held that applications for judicial review based on denial of legitimate expectation cannot succeed in a taxation context.

Lang J took the view that nothing in OS 13/02 established an unambiguous commitment or promise by the Commissioner that information would be sought from the taxpayer or other third parties before a notice under s 17 would be issued to a taxpayer’s tax agent. As a result the first cause of action was not reasonably arguable and must be struck out.

_The second cause of action: failure to take into account relevant considerations_

In his decision, Lang J considered that the first two particulars of the second cause of action were not reasonably arguable:

1.  In this case the Commissioner was not required to take OS 13/02 into account. OS 13/02 contains no reference to the manner in which the Commissioner will use s 17 of the TAA to give effect to New Zealand’s obligations under Double Tax Agreements with other countries and was therefore irrelevant.
2.  The Commissioner was not required to have regard to the nature of the relationship between Chatfield and its taxpayer clients, whether limited or otherwise because she would have no way of knowing the nature and scope of those relationships. The fact that an entity such as Chatfield is registered as a taxpayer’s tax agent is sufficient to entitle the Commissioner to consider it may hold information relevant for her purposes.

Lang J considered that third particular to the second cause of action was reasonably arguable. Lang J held that the Commissioner was required to take into account the terms of the DTA when deciding whether to comply with the request from the NTS and subsequently issue the Notices. Chatfield’s claim in this respect was focused on whether any of the exceptions to Article 25 of the DTA applied.

Lang J found that the Court must proceed on the basis Chatfield can prove that the Commissioner did not take the terms of the DTA into account when making her decision to issue the Notices. Despite this, Lang J foreshadowed that there is likely to be an issue at trial as to the extent to which the Court may scrutinise this aspect of the Commissioner’s decision, noting that this issue cannot be determined in the context of a strike out application.

16 Jun 2016

Court

NZHC

Appeal Status

Not appealed

Parties must be represented by a barrister or solicitor of the High Court; open justice principles prevail
==========================================================================================================

2016 case note - company has to be represented by a barrister and solicitor of the High Court - challenge to strike-out, open justice, exceptional circumstances.

Case

Sovereign Books Limited and Creative Productions Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2016\] NZHC 1313

Legislative References

District Courts Act 1947, High Court Rules

### Summary 

The High Court found that a company has to be represented by a barrister and solicitor of the High Court. The Court also confirmed that there is no specific provision in the High Court Rules relating to name suppression and that the principle of open justice works in New Zealand.

### Impact 

This decision upholds the _Mannix_ principles regarding companies being represented in the High Court by a barrister or solicitor. The decision also upholds the threshold required for name suppression in New Zealand; that the circumstances displacing the principle of open justice must be exceptional or extraordinary in nature.

### Facts

The applicants, Sovereign Books Ltd and Creative Productions Ltd, brought proceedings called "Leave to make application of a statutory review of the Taxation Review Authority and to join Crown Law as a third party and to make a statement of claim again IRD Crown Law in High Court", and also leave to appeal the decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority.

The parties essentially sought to challenge Judge P F Barber's decision in striking out the applicants challenge before the Tax Review Authority ("TRA").

In these proceedings, the applicants sought leave for their tax agent, Mr Young, to represent them in the substantive matters and for name suppression of the applicants and tax agent.

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") opposed both applications and sought costs.

The Court considered that in order to effectively seek a challenge to the strike out and appeal applications it was necessary to determine the following preliminary issues:

1.  As Mr Young is the director of the two applicants (Sovereign Books Ltd and Creative Productions Ltd), and not a barrister or solicitor of the High Court of New Zealand, whether he should be granted leave to represent both applicants in the High Court. **(Issue 1)**
2.  Whether the companies and Mr Young should be granted name suppression. **(Issue 2)**

**Mr Young's application for leave to appear**

Mr Young submitted that he should be granted leave to appear in accordance with s 57(2) of the District Court Acts 1947, providing that a corporation may appear by an officer, attorney or agent of the corporation in court. There was no equivalent provision in the Judicature Act 1908 or High Court Rules.

The Court stated, per Cooke J's judgment in _Re G J Mannix Ltd_ \[1984\] 1 NZLR 309 ("_Re G J Mannix Ltd_"), that a company has to be represented by a barrister or solicitor of the High Court. Exceptions to the rule were discussed, however these were only in situations of emergency when counsel is not available or where it would be ‘unduly burdensome to insist on counsel' (_Re G J Mannix Ltd_ \[1984\] 1 NZLR 309 (CA) at 314).

Mr Young stated that _Re G J Mannix_ does not apply in the modern world, in particular to situations involving his companies where they "just want to have their day in court." Mr Young further stated that the Commissioner's reliance on _Re G J Mannix_ was a strategy by the Commissioner to get rid of him as the party representing the applicants.

Asher J contended that the Court is bound by _Re G J Mannix_ and the cases that have followed it. Asher J further stated that a company is not a natural person and there would be concerns if a director acts for a company in court and gives the ‘directors perspective' and not that of the company.

Asher J noted that an individual officer representing a company in court does not hold the objectivity required to represent the company's best interests. He further noted the many meritless applications and failures of the applicants to comply with court orders furthering the need for counsel to appear on its behalf.

Asher J stated that he could not find any exceptional circumstances warranting departure from the rule that non-lawyer shareholders cannot appear for the company, and further that the proceeding was not urgent. Asher J noted, in referring to the TRA's strike out decision, that the ‘procedural tangles' that occurred in the TRA were the fault of the applicants and Mr Young.

**Suppression**

The second issue examined by the Court related to the applicants application seeking name suppression.

Mr Young contended that it would be unfair for there to be publicity. His primary consideration appeared to be unfairness to himself. He claimed that he was an accountant and should not be subjected to the burden of publicity in challenging proceedings that he claimed had proceeded in a grossly unfair manner.

Asher J stated that there is no specific provision in the High Court Rules relating to suppression of name or anonymity of parties in proceedings. He further noted that the principle of open justice works for publication and that the public of New Zealand are entitled to know what matters are proceeding in their courts.

The Court noted, in referring to the decisions of _Clark v Attorney-General (No 1)_ (\[2005\] NZAR 481 (CA)("_Clark_"), and _Brown v Attorney-General_ (\[2006\] NZAR 450 (CA)), that exceptional or extraordinary circumstances are required in order to displace the principle of open justice before suppression orders could be granted. It was stated in _Clark_ that the basis for the exceptional circumstances test was that the principles of open justice and the related freedom of expression creates a presumption of disclosure in all aspects of court proceedings and:

> "the right to freedom of expression is better served by placing as few restrictions as possible on it …". (_Clark v Attorney General (No 1)_ \[2005\] NZAR 481 (CA) at \[43\])

The Court stated that Mr Young did not point to any particular factors alluding to the adverse effects of publicity. Asher J also referred to the Court of Appeal decision in _McIntosh v Fisk_ whereby the principles of ‘open justice' was emphasised, and that a party seeking name suppression must show the interests of justice displace the presumption favouring publication (_McIntosh v Fisk_ \[2015\] NZCA 247, \[2015\] NZAR 1189 at \[1\]).

### Decision

The Court declined Mr Young's application for leave to appear for the applicants.

The Court declined the application for name suppression of the parties involved.

The Commissioner was awarded costs on a 2B basis.

Te utu tāke mō tō moni whiwhi rēti Pay tax on your rental income
================================================================

Generally, you work out your tax on your net income from all sources, including your net rental income. You do this in the tax return you must fill in every year.  
  
When you deduct your allowable rental expenses from your gross rental income you're left with taxable rental income.  
  
The way you work out income and expenses is not the same for all residential property.  
  
Check out tax by rental property type to see what to do for your property.

[Tax by rental property type](/property/renting-out-residential-property/tax-by-rental-property-type)

Work out your gross rental income
---------------------------------

Add up your [gross rental income](/api/glossary/item?id={675F39E7-69B6-4841-BAC7-F43CE3A12248})
 for the year

Work out your allowable rental expenses
---------------------------------------

Add up your allowable rental expenses. This amount depends on your rental property type and how it was used.

[Tax by rental property type](/property/renting-out-residential-property/tax-by-rental-property-type)

Work out your net rental income
-------------------------------

Deduct your allowable rental expenses from your gross rental income. The rental income you have left is what you’ll pay income tax on.

Any allowable rental expenses left after deducting your gross rental income are your excess deductions.

(If you and 1 or more people own the property, work out each owner’s share of the rental income and rental expense deductions.)

[Joint property ownership and tax on rental income](/property/renting-out-residential-property/residential-rental-income-and-paying-tax-on-it/who-pays-tax-on-rental-income/joint-property-ownership-and-tax-on-rental-income)

Manage your excess deductions
-----------------------------

You cannot use your [excess deductions](/api/glossary/item?id={C3E1928C-9525-4DB5-BBD8-8B5FBF8EC353})
 against the other income you have, such as salary or wages or business income.

You have to carry excess deductions forward from year to year and deduct them when your property makes [residential income](/api/glossary/item?id={639854D6-6590-446F-8E92-123587082168})
.

Complete a Rental income - IR3R form
------------------------------------

The IR3R form helps you work out your rental income and deductions. You’ll need one for each of your rental properties.

You can complete and send in myIR:

[Log in to myIR secure online services](https://myir.ird.govt.nz)

Complete your tax return
------------------------

Different types of residential property owners will have their own tax returns to do.

What happens next
-----------------

Make sure you file your tax return and pay your tax within the timeframes.

It's a good idea to update any records, such as copies of forms you’ve sent us or records of excess deductions.

Your excess deduction records should match how you applied the residential property deduction rules to your property.

(IN-CONFIDENCE-EXTERNAL RELEASE) Payday Filing File Upload Specification 2025 01 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 5 2 Electronic Filing Requirements The myIR system enables employers, tax agents, payroll bureaus, payroll intermediaries and others to send electronic versions of the Employment Information (EI) return. The information is sent across the internet to our server and then transferred into our tax system. The following are requirements for using myIR. 2.1 Network connectivity Employers, agents, bureaus and intermediaries can connect to the internet through an ISP as per the current process. It should be noted that employer returns filed through myIR will be able to be viewed and amended as required after the initial filing. 2.2 Operating systems The myIR system is operating system independent. However, a supported browser is required. 2.3 Supported web browsers At the date of publication of this document, the following web browsers are supported for use with myIR: • Apple Safari • Google Chrome • Microsoft Edge • Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 or Newer • Mozilla Firefox A recent version of these browsers should be used. If any issues are experienced using the service, an update and restart of the browser should be undertaken in the first instance. If an unsupported browser is detected accessing the site, a message will display advising that some website functionality may not be available, and that IR recommends switching to a supported browser. 2.4 Messages and validations in myIR Transferred files are validated by myIR and the customer informed of any errors. This validation is designed to provide instant turnaround, ensuring customers are provided with an immediate response of any errors. File validation rules include • file format • mandatory (required) data fields • data fields formats e.g. numeric, alpha numeric • data fields maximum lengths Note this is not the definitive list of all validations – these are in noted in each file specification and in Appendix 5.1 Error messages will be displayed using the current myIR format. 2.4.1 Error messages There are a number of error messages that can be received when transferring files to us. The messages will display clear details of the error or issue that has been found. (IN-CONFIDENCE- EXTERNAL RELEASE) Payday Filing File Upload Specification 2025 01 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 6 Note: Some of the most common issues encountered when uploading a file are the ‘line too long’ and ‘incorrect number of fields’ errors. These errors are usually caused by creating, editing and/or saving a csv file using Excel. Excel will add extra comma(s) to the end of each line when it is saved as a csv file, as it tries to make all lines the same length. This, in effect, adds another column, resulting in the errors. This is not specific to IR files; it’s a feature of Excel in general. To avoid this issue, IR does not recommend opening the file with Excel prior to uploading. If a file needs to be viewed or changed, IR recommends using a programme like Notepad or Notepad++ when opening or changing the file prior to uploading. (IN-CONFIDENCE-EXTERNAL RELEASE) Payday Filing File Upload Specification 2025 01 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 7 3 Payday Filing Payday filing through myIR enables software providers to output compliant employment information files in payroll software and then file transfer on each pay cycle instead of monthly, and to file transfer new and departing employee details. Employment information Employment information includes employee's income for each pay cycle. If businesses are enrolled for payroll returns in myIR they must output the file through their software and upload and submit this to us in myIR within two working days of the payday. Employee details Employers will also need to submit through myIR the details for new and departing employees including Kiwisaver information. This information is expected to be supplied to IR no later than the next filing of Employment Information but can be supplied earlier as per the Tax Administration Act – Section 23L. To support payroll services filing please refer to the payroll calculations & business rules in the Payroll calculations and business rules specification (1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025) Note: As of 1 April 2020, all files submitted by intermediaries require a link to the client listed in the file for the file to be accepted and processed. This validation will require all intermediaries to manage their myIR workspace and link to the appropriate clients. 3.1 Employee Details Filing Providing new and departing employee details is required for payday filing. This information is expected to be supplied to IR no later than the next filing of employment information but can be supplied earlier as per the Tax Administration Act – Section 23L. Employee details • includes information such as the employee’s name, employment start and finish dates, tax codes, KiwiSaver eligibility and status, Employee exempt income, KiwiSaver opt-out information and contact details (email, phone or mailing address). • can be added using a bulk file transfer services design for larger numbers of new and departing employees as required for payday filing, and updates for existing employees, using a file output from payroll software in csv format. This format allows o third parties such as payroll intermediaries and bureaus to file on behalf of the employer and provides the employers IRD number, o allows for multiple tax codes for one employee • can be added using a specifically formatted excel template available for download, and then populated for upload into myIR or • can be input in myIR for each individual employee 3.2 Employee Details CSV File specifications The employee details (ED) csv file enables intermediaries and employers to • File an employee details for new employees by providing o A single header record o One or more new employee detail records o One or more tax code detail records per employee (IN-CONFIDENCE- EXTERNAL RELEASE) Payday Filing File Upload Specification 2025 01 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 8 • File an employee details for existing employees by providing o A single header record o One or more employee detail records with updates • File an employee details for departing employees by providing o A single header record o One or more departing employee detail records o One or more tax code detail records per employee Refer to section 3.3.3 for examples of the Employee Details csv file.

This version must have the header record indicator of HED2. Note: As this version of the Employee Details now includes fields for KiwiSaver eligibility, employee exempt income and the KiwiSaver opt-out fields, the separate KiwiSaver Employment Details (KED) form is no longer available for use. The header record – HED- holds the summary details and precedes the employee details line records.

The sections below detail the record structures for doing this. Employee income and deduction information for payday filing is to be provided to IR on an Employment Information (EI) return. Amendments to the EI will also be done by payday. Payday filing must start from the beginning of the month, and each payday in the month must be payday reported. Payday filing involves terms such as “pay cycle”, “pay period” and “paydate”. Appendix 5.2 of this document provides an example of how these terms apply. The Employment Information (EI) return: • Replaces the employer monthly schedule (IR 348/EMS), • Holds employment income information from employers and PAYE intermediaries filing on a payday basis. i.e. it must incorporate all payments made to employees (and/or contractors), and ESCT deducted per employee line • Includes new information, such as dates of employers payday Amendments can also be made to previously filed EI returns.

This version must have the header record indicator of HEI2. The EI header holds the “paydate” details. Multiple EIs can be filed for the same paydate. Multiple EIs for a single paydate can also be consolidated into a single paydate EI. Various pay cycles may be reported on one EI as long as the cycle paydates are the same. The Header allows for new reporting such as advising IR that this is a “final” return as the employer has ceased employing. The ‘Total Student Loans’ field will be an aggregate total of all SL deductions for all employees. The header record precedes the detail records. It will contain data about the employer including summary totals in the following format and layout (please also refer to Appendix 5.1): Note for Prior period adjustment fields: If you already have a functioning amendment process there is no compulsion to utilise the prior period adjustment fields. You may continue to amend the erroneous returns. The Adjustment fields may only be used for adjustments that do not impact Kiwisaver, Student Loan, Child support or other social policy payments. Adjustments that match this criteria may still be made by amending the erroneous return OR using the prior period adjustment fields.

This amount should also be included in the ‘Earnings and/or scheduler payments not liable for ACC earners levy’ field. 3.4.2 Business rules for specific EI data fields 3.4.2.1 Employee IRD Number The Employee tax code should be provided as ND (no notification) and the PAYE should also be made at the ND rate until an IRD number is supplied for the employee (except in the case of non-resident entertainers or sportspeople who do not need to provide an IRD number – refer to the Payroll Calculations & Business Rules Specification for more information). 3.4.2.2 Tax on Schedular Payments The gross amount of schedular payment and tax deducted must be identified separately from normal gross pay and PAYE deducted. If you have an employee who received both salary or wages and schedular payments you will need to be able to identify the amount of schedular payment and the normal salary and PAYE when you create the EI. For example, if an employee gets a normal salary under the M tax code as well as schedular payments, you will need to have two lines for the employee on the EI. One line would contain the salary and PAYE with the tax code showing as M and the second line would have the gross schedular payment, Earnings not liable for ACC Earners’ Levy (which should be equal to gross schedular payment), and tax with a tax code of WT. For more information on Schedular Payments, refer to the Payroll Calculations & Business Rules Specification. 3.4.2.3 Employee Share Scheme (ESS) Refer to the Payroll Calculations & Business Rules Specification for details. Any ESS amounts should be recorded in the Employee Share Scheme field. 3.4.2.4 Tax codes on payday returns If an employee’s tax code changes during the “month”, each EI should be completed with the tax code that was used to calculate the employees payday deductions. The employee may have different tax codes during the filing month (e.g. change from M to M SL). 3.4.2.5 Final Employer returns The EI will allow employers to advise if they are no longer employing, and that this is their final EI return. The “final return for employer” indicator on the header details (HEI2) of the EI can either be Y or N. If “Y” - this means that this is the final return for that employer that IR expects to receive. The employer is longer employing. 3.4.2.6 Nil EI returns If a “nil” EI return needs to be filed, there is an indicator on the header details (HEI2) of the EI. (IN-CONFIDENCE- EXTERNAL RELEASE) Payday Filing File Upload Specification 2025 01 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 32 In the “nil return indicator” field, employers can indicate either Y (yes – nil return) or N (not a nil return). If Y, no other detail lines are required on the EI 3.4.2.7 Hours Paid Data Inland Revenue will be requesting Employee’s Hours paid data as part of Employer’s Payday Filing submission. The collection of this information will support IR in better understanding employee’s time spent in paid employment which in turn will assist in determining access to certain entitlements. Hours paid data will not be the only source of information used to make any such determination, it may be used in conjunction with other information as an indicator that further enquiries are required. The provision of Hours paid information by employers is not compulsory, it is requested under the same terms as employee Date of birth, in that if the employer holds the information in their payroll system it is required to be sent to Inland Revenue. There is no compulsion for employers to begin to capture this data if they do not already hold it. However, it will be of benefit to Inland Revenue and potentially their own employees if they are able to capture and transmit the data. For further clarity, in the event that some or all components of an employee’s salary and wages are held in, or associated to, units other than hours (or have no time unit associated with them at all), there is no compulsion to translate the data held in to hours or to calculate or otherwise create an hour value in order to transmit data to Inland Revenue. In such a scenario Inland Revenue does not expect to receive Hours paid data pertaining to that employee, for that pay period. 3.4.3 Student Loans For details regarding Student Loan rates and processes, please refer to the Payroll Calculations & Business Rules Specification. The business rules below refer to SLCIR and SLBOR processes for EI reporting. 3.4.3.1 Required data for SLCIR and SLBOR deductions SLCIR and SLBOR student loan deductions should be entered into the SLCIR deductions and SLBOR deductions fields respectively. 3.4.3.2 SLCIR and SLBOR deductions with no standard deductions If a borrower has no standard student loan deduction for the pay period because gross income is below the pay period threshold (when using a main tax code with “SL”) or a special deduction rate of 0% applies for the pay period then: • A SLBOR deduction is still able to be made. The thresholds and zero special deduction rates will not affect the calculation of SLBOR deductions. • A SLCIR deduction is not required to be made. 3.4.4 Example Employment Information file The following is an example of the EI file in the CSV format (as text for readability, please refer to the Sample files folder on the IR GitHub for more file examples).

Depending on the file size, it can either be placed in a local or a LAN drive. 5.1.3 File naming suggestions There is no standard file naming required. However, for easier identification we suggest the following: • A unique, period-based name. • Inclusion of the type of return to differentiate it from other returns, which may be required to be filed electronically in the future. • A CSV extension for Employment Information • An CSV extension for Employee Details or alternatively an xls or xlsx extension for Employee Details that accepts new and departing employee details. 5.1.4 Compression File compression using the zip compression algorithm is acceptable, provided that the following rules are adhered to: Filing as an intermediary through then Intermediary Centre: • Must be a PAYE Intermediary, Payroll bureau, tax agent, Bookkeeper or Other representative who has the Intermediary Centre link. • The content of any zip file must consist only of uncompressed files, i.e. a compressed file cannot be included within any other zip file. A ‘nested’ zip file cannot be processed and will cause the whole file to be rejected. • Only zip files of the same type. All files within that zip must represent the same file service type. E.g. Zip file cannot contain both Employee details csv file and Employment information csv file. • A zip file must be a single file only. In other words, a multi-part zip file (usually created to span removable media) will be rejected, as the decompression application will fail when trying to process a part file as a whole file. Filing through the employer’s Payroll account > File transfer service (I want to) • A zip file can contain different file types as long as the files are for that same Payroll account. E.g. A zip file can contain both an Employee details csv file and an Employment information csv file where the employer is the same as the Payroll account the file is submitted from. • All zipped files must be complete files. I.e. a zip file must not contain any files where the contents are split across two separate files. • A zip file must be a single file only. In other words, a multi-part zip file (usually created to span removable media) will be rejected, as the decompression application will fail when trying to process a part file as a whole file.

Payday filing made simple – talk with your software provider
============================================================

**12 December 2018**

An Auckland small business owner is crediting his software provider for making payday filing simpler.

From April 2019, all employers will be required to send their payroll information to Inland Revenue whenever they pay their staff.

Robert Watt, the owner-operator of three The Source Bulk Foods stores, has been filing his staff’s employment information to Inland Revenue since April after his payroll software provider made it possible through his existing package.

“Our payroll software made it very easy to get started. Once I got set up, it was just like doing a normal pay run.”

Inland Revenue Customer Segment Leader Richard Owen says Robert’s experience is typical of what we have been hearing from other customers who have payroll filing- compatible software.

“We are busy working with the all payroll software providers to help them link directly with our systems and create the best possible experience for their customers.”

\[embed width="480" height="270" class="leftAlone" thumbnail="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aEXA6lcb0uw/hqdefault.jpg?r"\]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEXA6lcb0uw\[/embed\]

Robert Watt at The Source Bulk Foods says the tax part of the process now seems more integrated.

“Previously, I would have to manually pull all the information out of my software and file it to Inland Revenue on the 20th of every month.

“But now my software does the job of compiling the data and sending it on to IRD at the end of each pay run so the job is out of the way and I don’t have to worry about it again.”

Mr Owen says there are some impressive software solutions available out in the market, some of which take care of the payday filing steps in just a few extra clicks.

“If they haven’t already, employers should check with their software provider about their plans for payday filing and try to get started as soon as possible.

“Robert’s payroll data is going to give Inland Revenue more timely access to his staff members’ income information so we can make sure they’re paying the right amount of tax at the right time.”  
  
Robert Watt has some advice for his fellow small business owners:

“If you haven’t switched to payday filing, I’d do it as soon as you can.

“It saves you a lot of time and effort and that’s good for business.”

Express file transfer service
-----------------------------

The express file transfer service in myIR provides a place to drop all payday related files. This includes all versions of EI and ED.  The service allows zip files to be uploaded as long as all the files in the zip are employer related that meet our specifications.

The following employer files are supported:

*   File transfer Payday schedules: Upload multiple payday employment information schedules.
*   File transfer Payday amendments: Upload amendments to multiple payday employment information schedules.
*   File transfer employee details: Upload new and departing employee details.
*   Upload KiwiSaver file: Upload a KiwiSaver file to enrol multiple employees in KiwiSaver at the same time.
*   Upload compressed zip file: For this account upload one or more Non-payday or KiwiSaver files.
*   File transfer employer schedules: File transfer employer monthly schedules for multiple filing periods (IR348).
*   File transfer EMS amendments: Upload amendments to multiple employer monthly schedules (IR348).
*   File transfer employer deductions: Upload multiple employer deductions forms (IR345).

There is no test a file service for express file transfer. Individual files can be tested using the appropriate individual test a file service. The express file transfer service evaluates the files in the zip using the same validation as the individual test a file services, which can be found in the file specifications.

The purpose of this Casebook document is to provide Payday Employment Information filing (EI) examples to improve the understanding of the components described in the Payday Filing File Upload Spec and supporting documentation outlined in Section 1.3. The Casebook’s aim is to improve the quality of data received by Inland Revenue which will reduce exception processing and the number of queries received by Inland Revenue and Software Developers, over time reducing compliance costs and assisting in the integrity of the New Zealand tax system. 1.1 Caveats The examples and scenarios have been developed to assist in the generation of payday reporting data. These are not intended to be exhaustive and do not cover every possible factual situation that may occur. This document is intended as an accompaniment to the Payday Filing File Upload Spec and the Payroll Calculations & Business Rules Spec only. The Payday Filing File Upload Spec and the Payroll Calculations & Business Rules Spec documents are still the ‘documents of truth’ for defining the specifications for development of payroll software packages and the myIR technical interface. Any developer queries regarding this document can be directed to: PaydayReporting@ird.govt.nz An electronic version of the final version of this document can be found at the following link: https://www.ird.govt.nz/digital-service-providers/services-catalogue/returns-and-information/payday-filing/payday-filing-through-file-upload-services IRD numbers and names used have been created for testing purposes only and do not represent real persons or organisations.

PAYE convictions upheld by the Court of Appeal – trial Judge found not to have acted with apparent bias
=======================================================================================================

2016 case note – Dismissal of appeal - PAYE convictions – apparent bias – adverse rulings during course of trial.

Case

David Ian Henderson v The Queen \[2016\] NZCA 431

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal against conviction on seven counts of aiding and abetting a company to knowingly apply deemed PAYE deductions for purposes other than payment to the Inland Revenue Department (“IRD”). The sole appeal ground was whether the District Court Judge acted with apparent bias at trial, giving rise to an unfair trial. The Court found that a reasonable lay observer, watching the whole trial and reading the Judge’s minutes would not reasonably apprehend the Judge had become partial or predetermined the overall question of guilt.

### Impact

This Judgment provides further authority for the test for apparent judicial bias as laid down by the Supreme Court in _Saxmere Co Ltd v Wool Board Disestablishment Ltd_ \[2009\] NZSC 72 (“_Saxmere_”). It highlights the importance of viewing Judges’ comments in context of the proceeding as a whole when considering whether there is a risk of apparent bias.

### Facts

The Appellant was the sole director of a company which did not pay PAYE on its employees’ wages to the IRD for the months of April-October 2010. After a Judge-alone trial before Judge MacAskill in the Christchurch District Court, the Appellant was convicted on seven counts of aiding and abetting the Company to knowingly apply deemed PAYE deductions for purposes other than payment to the IRD.

The Appellant appealed the conviction (but not sentence) to the Court of Appeal, initially listing a series of grounds which were abandoned once counsel was engaged. The sole ground ultimately pursued on appeal was that Judge MacAskill acted with apparent bias.

### Decision

The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal (judgment given by Kós P) finding that a reasonable observer, taken as having been present throughout the entire trial and having read the Judge’s minutes would not reasonably apprehend the Judge had become partial or had predetermined the overall question of guilt. The Court of Appeal acknowledged that some of the language the judge used was unfortunate and not to be encouraged, but that in the circumstances the comments were understandable and did not indicate that guilt had been predetermined.

### The appeal and relevant law

The trial had been conducted in three main phases over the course of 10 months. Judge MacAskill adjourned the trial twice to enable the appellant to refocus on the merits of the prosecution case as it was clear that the appellant did not really engage with the substance of the prosecution case. The appellant was self-represented in the first and third phases, but represented by counsel in the second phase. Their Honours found that it had been a difficult trial and the Judge’s comments must be considered in this context.

The Court of Appeal applied the test as laid down by the Supreme Court in _Saxmere_ whether a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the Judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question the Judge is required to decide. Following _Saxmere_, the Court of Appeal in the present case found that the observer is not to be taken as legally trained but a person who is aware of the judicial oath and understands the Court process. The Court of Appeal further emphasised that an important trait attributed to the hypothetical lay observer is their ability to view matters in context.

With reference to _Johnson v Johnson_ (2000) 201 CLR 488 and _Muir v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2007\] 3 NZLR 495 (CA), the Court of Appeal noted that Judges may give forthright and robust indications of their tentative views. Such views are helpful to enable the parties to address the Judge with a view to persuading the Judge to a different view. Their Honours also observed that a trial Judge has a responsibility to ensure lay litigants do not spend time on irrelevant matters in a manner which is wasteful of the Court’s resources.

### Pre-trial matters and trial phase one (November 2014)

The appellant had made a pre-trial application for a discharge under s 347 of the Crimes Act 1961. While not directly relevant to the appeal, their Honours observed that this was the start of a pattern of technical arguments raised in the appellant’s defence.

During the first phase of the trial, the defendant had chosen not to call any witnesses or cross-examine the witnesses called by the Crown. After the Crown had closed, the appellant applied for a s 347 discharge based on a technical argument based on the dates on the indictment. The Court of Appeal observed that _“\[the appellant\] held a single egg in his hand and proceeded to place it in the Court’s basket.”_

Judge MacAskill declined the s 347 application and adjourned the trial to provide the appellant another chance at cross-examining the witnesses. In his written reasons, Judge MacAskill commented that _“the defendant had presumably concluded that there was no other reasonably arguable defence available to him, a conclusion which was not obviously wrong.”_ The appellant submitted that this remark, together with other comments by the Judge, gave rise to a perception of prejudgment.

The Court of Appeal found that the exchange did not show apparent bias but was a comment on the apparent lack of a defence at that point in the trial. The Judge’s adjournment for the sake of fairness to the appellant (which he was under no obligation to grant) would rather suggest that the Judge was open to consider other defences.

### Trial phase two (May 2015)

The appellant complained that the Judge’s interactions with the prosecutor were inappropriate as an observer could, in the appellant’s submission, infer from the exchanges that the Judge was unduly helping the prosecutor to improve the Crown’s case and that the prosecutor and the Judge were collaborating to amend the indictment so as to find the appellant guilty.

The Court of Appeal found that a reasonable observer would have understood the Judge to be ascertaining the prosecution’s position on a particular point, which was not inappropriate. Even though one particular exchange, if viewed in isolation, might suggest to someone hearing only that legal discussion that the Judge had rather teamed up with the prosecutor, their Honours found that a reasonable, informed lay observer would not reach that view, given the whole context.

While many comments were expressed in robust language, especially during the Judge’s engagement with defence counsel (for example expressions such as _“I am astonished”_ and _“Don’t muck me around”)_ the Court of Appeal found that a reasonable observer would understand that the expressions were an understandable reflection of the Judge’s frustration in the face of a difficult and lengthy trial and that the Judge was taking a robust approach to managing the trial, rather than predetermining guilt. Other comments were found to be appropriate expressions of tentative views.

The Court of Appeal found that certain language was unfortunate, such as the Judge’s reference to events _“proved”_ by the evidence, and the use of expressions _“defence spin”_ and _“tactic that crossed the line into illegitimacy”_. Even though such language was not to be encouraged, in the Court of Appeal’s view the comments were understandable in the circumstances and did not indicate that guilt had been predetermined. Furthermore, the Judge’s willingness to adjourn for a second time for the sake of fairness to the appellant indicated his continued open-mindedness.

### Further adjournment (June 2015) and trial phase three (September 2015)

When the trial did not resume as planned in June 2015 due to on-going issues, the Judge issued a minute in which he noted his provisional view of the Crown case. The appellant submitted that this was a further indication of predetermination. The Court of Appeal found that the comments in the minute were expressly tentative and in any event only responded to one technical aspect of the defence case. In their Honours’ view, the observer would have understood the ultimate question of guilt to still be open in the Judge’s mind. No issue was taken with any comments made in the third trial phase.

PAYE subsidy for small businesses
=================================

2006 legislative changes enable Inland Revenue to subsidise the use of payroll agents to meet the PAYE obligations of small businesses.

#### Sections NBB 1 to NBB 7, OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and sections 3(a)(xiii) and 3(o), 185(1)(f) and (g), 185C, and 185D of the Tax Administration Act 1994

Changes have been made to the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 to enable Inland Revenue to subsidise the use of payroll agents to meet the PAYE obligations of small businesses.

Under the new rules, the government will subsidise or partly subsidise the cost of an employer engaging a payroll intermediary. The subsidy will be available for up to five employees of a particular employer per month. To obtain the subsidy an employer must engage a listed PAYE intermediary. The listed PAYE intermediary will be eligible to receive a subsidy from the government.

### Background

Consultation conducted by the government showed that many small businesses consider the time spent keeping up to date with PAYE and calculating deductions could be better spent running their business.

The PAYE subsidy proposal was a simplification initiative outlined in 2003 in the discussion document, Making tax easier for small businesses. It provides a subsidy to payroll intermediaries for meeting PAYE obligations on behalf of small employers.

"PAYE intermediaries" are Inland Revenue accredited incorporated or unincorporated entities acting as intermediaries between employers and Inland Revenue. Under the current rules, employers provide the intermediary with payroll information about their employees and the gross wages to the intermediary. The intermediary is then responsible for calculating the PAYE deductions, meeting all return filing requirements and paying both the employees and Inland Revenue.

It is expected that the subsidy will encourage small employers to use PAYE intermediaries for meeting their PAYE obligations. The foreseeable benefits of this include:

*   the reduction of compliance costs for small businesses;
*   improvement of the PAYE system in general  
    – payroll intermediaries would provide services to a large number of employers, using their skills and technology to increase the accuracy and timeliness of returns. The improved quality of the PAYE compliance will benefit employers whose exposure to penalties for non-compliance will be reduced;
*   the outsourcing of compliance obligations faced by small businesses will allow small employers to focus their efforts on their business, rather than compliance activities;
*   an improvement in the timeliness of payments and quality of information supplied to Inland Revenue and the reduction in penalties imposed on small business.

To establish a subsidy regime, legislative changes have been made.

The decision on the final amount and structure of the subsidy will be set by regulation.

### Key features

#### Listed PAYE intermediaries

New section NBB 2 of the Income Tax Act specifies the conditions that must be fulfilled for PAYE intermediaries to be registered as a listed PAYE intermediary. The significance of the registration lies in the fact that only "listed" PAYE intermediaries are eligible to receive a subsidy. The conditions for becoming a listed PAYE intermediary include the following requirements:

*   The applicant is an accredited PAYE intermediary under subpart NBA of the Income Tax Act. This requirement suggests that a prospective listed PAYE intermediary must be able to comply with the requirements imposed on "accredited" PAYE intermediaries in addition to the requirements imposed by the new legislation.
*   The applicant who has already acted as an accredited PAYE intermediary for an employer has done so in a correct manner.
*   The applicant has available the administrative and IT systems necessary to perform the obligations of a listed PAYE intermediary.

Inland Revenue may specify a period for which a person is accredited as a listed PAYE intermediary.

New section NBB 3 of the Income Tax Act describes the ongoing obligations of listed PAYE intermediaries. The obligations include:

*   continuing to maintain the status of, and perform the obligations imposed on, an accredited PAYE intermediary;
*   continuing to perform the obligations imposed on a listed PAYE intermediary in section NBB 2(1)(c) to (g), as described above in relation to section NBB 2;
*   maintaining the required administrative and IT systems;
*   correctly returning the subsidy claim form;
*   keeping the records necessary to verify the information contained in each subsidy claim form.

New section NBB 4 of the Income Tax Act describes circumstances when the listing of a listed PAYE intermediary can be revoked and the process that must be followed to achieve the revocation. Generally, the listing may be revoked if the intermediary fails to comply with the requirements imposed on listed PAYE intermediaries or ceases to comply with the requirements that are necessary for being given accreditation as a listed PAYE intermediary.

In addition, section NBB 4 states that the Commissioner may give notice to a listed PAYE intermediary of his intention to revoke the listing and the reasons for the intended revocation. If the listed PAYE intermediary does not resolve the matters listed in the notice of intended revocation to the satisfaction of the Commissioner within 30 days, the Commissioner may give 14 days' notice of revocation. At the expiration of the notice of revocation, the listing of the listed PAYE intermediary is revoked.

#### The subsidy claim

New section NBB 5 of the Income Tax Act specifies that a listed PAYE intermediary subsidy claim form must be filed within one month of the date of filing of the employer monthly schedule to which it relates.

The Commissioner is allowed, within two years of receipt of the claim form, to make changes to the particulars of the form to correct any errors that the Commissioner may have found. The Commissioner would then give the listed intermediary 14 days' notice of the proposed amendments. An overpayment or underpayment that results from the amendment must be paid by the listed PAYE intermediary or the Commissioner within 30 days of the giving of the Commissioner's notice of the amendments. Alternatively, the Commissioner may elect to offset an overpayment against a claim for payment of the subsidy made after expiry of the 14-day notice period.

New section NBB 6 of the Income Tax Act specifies the conditions and the process that Inland Revenue will follow when paying a subsidy to a listed PAYE intermediary. A subsidy will be paid to a listed PAYE intermediary, working for a small employer, if the intermediary:

*   has contracted with the employer for the provision of those services; and
*   has met the obligations of the listed PAYE intermediary under subpart NBA of the Income Tax Act 2004, such as making the necessary tax deductions to the Commissioner and delivering an employer monthly schedule in relation to the employer; and
*   files a correct subsidy claim form.

If it is satisfied that the subsidy should be paid, Inland Revenue will then pay the subsidy within 30 days of receipt of the following:

*   the employer monthly schedule to which the listed PAYE intermediary claim form relates;
*   payment of the PAYE deductions to which the listed PAYE intermediary claim form relates;
*   the listed PAYE intermediary claim form.

The subsidy will be paid by Inland Revenue by electronic means. Within 14 days of the subsidy payment, Inland Revenue will provide the intermediary with particulars of the subsidy payment in electronic form.

Section NBB 6 also authorises the Governor-General to make regulations to prescribe the amount of the subsidy.

New section NBB 7 of the Income Tax Act governs the termination of an employer's arrangements with a listed PAYE intermediary. The section prescribes that either the employer or the listed PAYE intermediary may give notice of termination. The section also provides that if a listed PAYE intermediary ceases to act for an employer while still being in possession of the employer's funds, it must continue to act as a listed PAYE intermediary for the employer in relation to those funds.

Section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act defines a "listed PAYE intermediary claim form" as being in an electronic format and showing:

*   the tax file number of the listed PAYE intermediary;
*   the tax file number and name of each employer for which a subsidy is being claimed;
*   the tax file number and name of each employee of each employer for which a subsidy is being claimed;
*   the pay period to which the claim form relates;
*   the pay frequency of each employee in that pay period;
*   the number of source deduction payments made by the listed PAYE intermediary for each employee in the period to which the form relates; and[Larger version of image](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/3/2/3254dc804ba37620afdabf9ef8e4b077/paye-subsidy-large.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200316214532&hash=CB1E3AC2F8835BA28D5138968AAA8926)
    
*   the amount of subsidy that the listed PAYE intermediary is claiming for the period the form relates to.

This information will assist Inland Revenue to calculate the correct amount of the subsidy that can be paid to the listed PAYE intermediary.

QB (Dec 2004) considers PAYE consequences where any amount has been received fraudulently or in error and PAYE has been deducted.

### Introduction

Inland Revenue has been asked to clarify the tax effects of amounts received fraudulently or in error, in the context of source deduction payments.

This item considers PAYE consequences where any amount has been received fraudulently or in error and PAYE has been deducted. The income may be employment income, an income-tested benefit, or self-employment income under the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979.

### Legislation

All references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless stated otherwise.

Where a person receives amounts without "claim of right" they are included as gross income pursuant to section CD 6. Section OB 1 defines "claim of right" as follows:

> **"Claim of right"**, in relation to any act, means a belief that the act is lawful, although that belief may be based on ignorance or mistake of fact of any matter of law other than the enactment against which the offence is alleged to have been committed.

The essence of "claim of right" is that the person must have a genuine belief that the act is lawful. The above definition was inserted with effect from 1 October 2003.

Previously, section CD 6 referred to the term "colour of right". Section 2 of the Crimes Act 1961 used to define "colour of right" as follows:

> **"Colour of right"**, in relation to any act, means an honest belief that the act is justifiable, although that belief may be based on ignorance or mistake of fact or of any matter of law other than the enactment against which the offence is alleged to have been committed

If the person repays that income they are entitled to a deduction for the amount repaid in the year it is repaid, pursuant to section DJ 18.

Whether a recipient of an incorrect payment has received it without "claim of right" essentially requires some evidence of fraud or criminal dishonesty, rather than merely passively receiving a payment in error. If the taxpayer knows an error has occurred, they may not be able to establish a claim of right, but Inland Revenue is often unable to establish whether or not the taxpayer genuinely believed (rightly or wrongly) that he or she was entitled to the payment.

Inland Revenue will generally be unable to apply section CD 6 without material evidence of wrongdoing, and as a matter of practice will usually apply section CD 6 only where a prosecution has been commenced (usually by the police, but also in civil recovery action) against the taxpayer. Section EN 5(2) explains that income under section CD 6 is deemed to be derived in the income year that possession or control of the property is obtained.

The PAYE rules apply to source deduction payments. Section OB 2 defines "source deduction payment" as:

> 1.  In this Act, except as provided in subsection (2), "source deduction payment" means a payment by way of salary or wages, an extra emolument, or a withholding payment, but does not include an amount attributed in accordance with section GC 14D.

Generally, in determining the nature of the obligation, PAYE will not be deductible against income that has been received by a recipient either fraudulently or in error.

### Practice

_Employment or benefit income received fraudulently by a person_

Where a person receives income fraudulently it is gross income for the purpose of tax, under section CD 6. However, as the recipient is not entitled to the income it is not a payment subject to PAYE. If PAYE has been deducted, the Commissioner will repay that amount to the person who made the payment on request in writing.

The amount assessed to the recipient is the net amount of the fraudulent payment; that is, the amount actually received by them. The recipient is then responsible for meeting their tax liability on that income. Usually this will require completion of an _Income tax return for individual taxpayers (IR3_

If the recipient repays any of the income, they can claim a deduction in the year of repayment under section DJ 18.

_Example_

An employee responsible for salary and wages at a small company makes fraudulent payments to himself on a fortnightly basis of $200. The employer discovers this as part of an audit after 24 weeks. In total the company paid an additional $2,400.

The employee received $1,944 net in this way and $456 was paid as PAYE in the employee's name.

The employee should be assessed income of $1,944. The $456 paid as PAYE should be returned to the employer.

_Income received in error from an employer_

Where an employer has paid an employee in error an amount to which the employee is not entitled (and where section CD 6 does not apply), it is not income the employee is entitled to. Therefore, it is not a payment subject to PAYE and Inland Revenue will return the PAYE to the employer on request in writing. Income that is received in error and repaid will not be assessable to the employee, and employees cannot claim a deduction in the year of repayment. An agreement to repay amounts between employers and employees is a private arrangement.

If an employer supplies a letter with amended salary or wages for a prior year (where section CD 6 does not apply), the employee's Personal Tax Summary or Return of Income will be amended to show the new figures.

Sometimes overpayments of salary and wages occur through simple oversight and are immediately identified, and repaid perhaps in the next pay period. Assuming that sections CD 6 and DJ 18 do not usually apply, if the situation is corrected within the same period, Inland Revenue will permit the employer to correct the matter in the Employer Monthly Schedule filed.  
 

However, for various reasons the employer and employee may come to a different arrangement regarding the amount paid in error. For example, they may decide to treat it as income in advance or a bonus. In these situations the income may be accepted as having the characteristics of a source deduction payment and be subject to PAYE. The employer or company would not seek a refund of the PAYE, and Inland Revenue would retain the PAYE as a credit against the employee's tax liability.

The character of a payment made in error is a question of fact. This will need to be considered in each case.

_Example_

A bonus payment of $500 is mistakenly paid to the wrong employee. The employee receives $405 and $95 is paid to Inland Revenue as PAYE. The employee, believing it to be an undeclared bonus, spends it. When the error is identified the employee is told of the mistake, but at that time is unable to repay the money.

The employer as a matter of goodwill agrees to treat the payment as a bonus. The employee will be taxed on the gross amount, $500. Inland Revenue will retain the PAYE as a credit against the employee's tax liability.

_Income received in error by way of a benefit_

Where income is received in error by way of a benefit (in circumstances where section CD 6 does not apply), the person is not entitled to the receipt of it. The rules are the same as for salary and wages. The overpayment is not a source deduction payment and PAYE does not apply. The recipient has an obligation to repay the amount received.

If deducted, the PAYE would be returned by Inland Revenue to the payer, usually Work and Income, on request in writing.

If the recipient repays the benefit received in error they get no deduction for the repayments.

If Work and Income supply written confirmation of the amended benefit for a prior year (where section CD 6 does not apply), the beneficiary's Personal Tax Summary or Return of Income will be amended to show the new figures.

### Requests

In any of the above situations, the employer must provide a written request, with the full factual situation, before Inland Revenue will investigate the refund of any PAYE received.

[All Income tax dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[Income tax])

Paying tax
----------

If you're paying royalties to non-residents, you need to withhold [non-resident withholding tax (NRWT)](/api/glossary/item?id={578794B4-48A0-426D-9A98-A7580953B8D5})
.

If you’ve withheld tax from a royalty payment you’ve made to a non-resident, then you must pass this tax on to us. It must be paid by the 20th of the month following the month in which  you pay the non-resident.

Information requirements
------------------------

For reporting information, NRWT on royalty payments has a different timeframe from other types of non-resident withholding tax payments. The information below is due to us annually by 31 May each year.

If you pay royalties to non-residents, you need to send us the following information at the end of the year:

*   your name, IRD number and contact address
*   the total amount of royalties paid
*   the total amount of tax (NRWT) withheld.

The following information is required for each of the income recipients who received royalties: 

*   their name
*   their contact details - email, street address or mobile phone number
*   the tax rate they have provided
*   the amount and type of income paid to them
*   the tax (NRWT) withheld from it.

If it is available, you need to provide the following information for each of the income recipients who received royalties:

*   their IRD number
*   their date of birth.

You must provide the name of any joint owners. If held, you also need to provide the following information for any joint owners:

*   IRD number
*   date of birth
*   contact details - email, street address or mobile phone number.

You will need to report this electronically unless you have an exemption.

The information is due by 31 May each year.

Options for reporting information
---------------------------------

Although payment of NRWT withheld from royalty payments is still monthly, you have 2 options for reporting the information to us. You can either include the required information for NRWT on royalty payments in a:

*   monthly return (making sure to include along with other NRWT information)
*   end-of-year return (filing a separate return by 31 May for the whole year).

### Monthly return

Other types of NRWT payments must also report the required information to us by the 20th of the next month after withholding the tax. If there is no tax withheld, then no return is needed for that month.

You can include all the required information for NRWT on royalty payments in the monthly return where you're reporting the other NRWT payments. This will make sure that the total amount of NRWT in the return matches the total amount of NRWT paid to us for the month.

You'll be filing more frequently than required by legislation, but it may be a simpler option from a business-process perspective.

### End-of-year return

Since the other types of NRWT payments require a monthly return, you'll need to make sure you do the following steps if you're filing NRWT on royalties only at the end of the year. This is required to ensure the payment amount for the month matches the amount in the monthly return for the other types of NRWT payments.

1.  File an NRWT return for the total amount from the other non-resident withholding tax payments that require monthly reporting.
2.  Make the NRWT payments (those requiring monthly reporting) for the period that matches the return you filed.
3.  Make a separate payment for the NRWT on royalties. This payment must be made against the 'March' period of the tax year. You'll also need to include the IRD number and tax type. This makes sure that we hold this amount pending the March return. You do not file a return for this payment at this point.
4.  By 31 May, file the annual return for the total NRWT withheld on royalty payments made during the tax year. Make sure 'March' is selected as the period. We will match this return with the payments made during the year for the 'March' period. If NRWT on any other payments has been withheld in March, then it can be combined in the same return. However, the return will need to be filed by 20 April to meet the reporting requirements for those non-resident withholding tax payments.
5.  If you file the NRWT withheld on royalty payments made during the tax year separately to the other non-resident withholding tax payments, you will need to contact us to be set up as a multi-filer for the March period. This lets you file a return for the royalty payments due 31 May and a separate return for the other non-resident withholding tax payments due 20 April.

Te utu tangohanga ki Te Tari Taake Paying deductions to Inland Revenue
======================================================================

How often you pay deductions
----------------------------

You pay deductions to us once or twice a month.

It depends on your gross annual PAYE and employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT). It's not tied to how often you file your employment information.

### Gross annual PAYE and ESCT less than $500,000 - small to medium employers

If your gross annual PAYE and ESCT is less than $500,000 you:

*   need to pay deductions monthly, by the 20th of the following month
*   can choose to pay more often.

For example, if your paydays were on 2, 9, 16, 23 and 30 July, you would need to pay the deductions for all paydays by 20 August.

### Gross annual PAYE and ESCT more than $500,000 - large employers

If your gross annual PAYE and ESCT is more than $500,000 you:

*   need to pay deductions twice a month
*   can choose to pay more often.

| Payday date | Deductions due to us |
| --- | --- |
| For wages and salaries paid between the 1st and 15th of the month | By the 20th of the same month. |
| For wages and salaries paid between the 16th and end of the month | By the 5th of the following month.  <br>Note: For period 16-31 December pay by 15 January not 5 January of each year. |

For example, if your paydays were on 2, 9, 16, 23 and 30 July you do the following:

| Payday date | Deductions due to us |
| --- | --- |
| 2 and 9 July | By 20 July |
| 16, 23 and 30 July | By 5 August |

Working out your deductions
---------------------------

If you file your employment information by paper, you need to add up your total deductions (boxes 3-8 on the Employment information form - IR348).

If you file your employment information in myIR, you can check in 'Returns and transactions' for each period. This shows the deductions you need to pay for the period. The figures are updated every time you file employment information for the period.

Paying your deductions
----------------------

You can pay by:

*   internet banking
*   credit or debit card
*   direct debit.

When you make a payment to us, you'll need to use your IRD number as a reference. This allows us to link the payment to you. You'll also need a payee code showing which type of tax the payment is for.

For the EMP (employment activities) account type, you can make a single payment for:

*   pay as you earn
*   child support deductions
*   KiwiSaver deductions
*   KiwiSaver contributions
*   student loan deductions
*   Employer Superannuation Contribution.

[Choosing the right account type](/managing-my-tax/make-a-payment/choosing-the-right-account-type)

How to pay if you change Employment Information deductions 
-----------------------------------------------------------

When you change your Employment Information after you have paid and accounted for it, there may be a debit balance. You can pay this using the EMP payment code and the affected period.

[Make a payment](/managing-my-tax/make-a-payment)

Checking your payments
----------------------

You can check your payments and balance for each period in myIR.

Go to 'Returns and transactions' in your payroll account, and select the period. A credit balance will show in green (with a minus sign next to it). A debit balance will show in red.

It can take up to 15 working days to process payments. We will reimburse any penalties or interest we charged you, as long as your payment was on time. Contact us if your payment is not showing after 15 working days.

Direct debit payments
---------------------

If you're using myIR, you can:

*   save direct debit details with us
*   make one-off direct debit payments
*   authorise multiple direct debit payments and setup an instalment arrangement as well if paying off debt.

To get set up, you'll first need to create a direct debit agreement with Inland Revenue. You only need to do this once. This tells us which bank account you'll be using for direct debit payments.

[Set up a direct debit agreement with us](/managing-my-tax/make-a-payment/ways-of-paying/paying-electronically/set-up-direct-debit)

  

Next, you'll be able to make direct debit payments for your accounts with us. You specify and approve each payment that you set up. You can choose between making a single, one-off payment or multiple, ongoing payments.

[Make a one-off direct debit payment](/managing-my-tax/make-a-payment/ways-of-paying/paying-electronically/one-off-direct-debit)

[Make ongoing direct debit payments](/managing-my-tax/make-a-payment/ways-of-paying/paying-electronically/ongoing-direct-debit)

  

If you do not have an amount to pay, you will not get the direct debit payment option. If there is an amount to pay, you'll be able to pay the full or partial amount by direct debit.

Automatic payments
------------------

You can pay off outstanding tax by making payments for a regular amount for a fixed frequency.

You can set this up using:

*   your bank’s online services
*   an automatic payment authority form to give to your bank.

[All Income tax dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[Income tax])

If you use the standard, estimation or ratio options, you will not need to pay provisional tax during your first year of business. If you use the accounting income method (AIM), you’ll only pay provisional tax when you make a profit, even during your first year.

However, your first year in business is not tax free. Any income tax from your first year in business is usually due by 7 February the following year. If you have an agent it will be due by 7 April.

This may mean you must pay income tax for your first year in business at the same time as paying provisional tax for your second year in business.

You can choose to make voluntary payments of tax during your first year of business to help spread the cost. If you make voluntary payments you may be able to get an early payment discount.

Early payment discount 
-----------------------

You may be able to get an early payment discount if you meet the following criteria.

*   You are self-employed or a partner in a partnership or an owner of a look-through company and get most of your income from the business.
*   You make a voluntary income tax payment before the end of the income year or you use tax pooling funds to make payments for the income year.
*   You apply for the discount on or before the date your tax return has to be filed.
*   You do not have an obligation to pay provisional tax in the income year you make voluntary payments or for any of the 4 years before.

### Early payment discount rate

From the 2025 income year the early payment discount rate is calculated using the use of money interest credit rate as at 31 March of the previous tax year plus 2%.

The early payment discount rate for the 2026 income year is 6.30%. 

|     |     |
| --- | --- |Past early payment discount rates
| Year | Discount rates |
| --- | --- |
| 2025 | 6.67% |
| 2024 | 6.67% |
| 2023 | 4.31% |

Self-employed people with student loans
---------------------------------------

If you're self-employed and have a student loan, you may have to make repayments in your first year of business.

Example

Andrew makes voluntary payments for the year ended 31 March 2025 of $5,000. His residual income tax for 2025 is $8,000.

The early payment discount is calculated on $5,000, being the lesser of the voluntary payments made or 105% of his residual income tax amount ($8,400).

The value of the early payment discount is $333.50 being 6.67% of $5,000.

Total voluntary payments made from 1 April 2024 - 31 March 2025: $5,000.00.

2025 residual income tax: $8,000.00.

Voluntary payments of $5,000 x 6.67% = $333.50.

105% of residual income tax = $8,400.

$8,400 x 6.67% = $560.28.

[Child Support Amendment Act 2013](/new-legislation/act-articles/child-support-amendment-act-2013 "Child Support Amendment Act 2013")

Payment of child support to receiving carers
============================================

The legislation sets out how child support payments in respect of a qualifying child are distributed to receiving carers.

The legislation sets out how child support payments in respect of a qualifying child are distributed to receiving carers.

_Where child support payment is to a sole receiving carer who is a parent_

The child support liability and the amount payable to the receiving carers is usually determined by the standard formula or under the multi-group cap. Where, in respect of a qualifying child, there is only one receiving carer and that carer is a parent of the child, then the annual amount of child support payment can be calculated by reference to the receiving parent's care cost and income percentages. This only applies if the amount will be less than the amount calculated under the standard formula or under the multi-group cap.

If the criteria are met, the amount of child support payable in respect of this receiving parent is a proportion of the cost of raising the child; determined by how much their care cost percentage exceeds their income percentage. In the legislation this is expressed as an amount that the receiving parent would pay if the difference between their income percentage and the care cost percentage were a positive percentage.

**Example**

Alisa has 46% of the combined child support income and her care cost percentage is 100%. She is a receiving carer as the percentage of income less care cost percentage is -54%. As the sole receiving carer for the child, the amount she could receive would be 54% of the relevant annual cost of raising the qualifying child (if this is less than the amount under the standard formula or the multi-group cap).

_Where child support payment is to a sole receiving carer who is not a parent_

The amount payable where there is only one non-parent receiving carer is the amount of child support determined by the formula assessment.

_Where there are two receiving carers and neither are parents of the child_

If there are two receiving carers of a qualifying child and neither are parents of the child, the child support payment will be distributed to them based on the relative care cost percentage of each receiving carer.

**Example**

Patrick is assessed as having to pay child support of $5,000. His child is being cared for by Jo and Lyn. Jo provides 40% of the care cost and receives $2,000 and Lyn provides 60% of the care cost and receives $3,000.

_Where one receiving carer is a parent and the other is a non-parent receiving carer_

In this situation, the legislation determines how much is payable to the receiving parent, and any remaining amount of the child support payment in respect of the child goes to the non-parent receiving carer.

The amount that goes to the receiving parent is the amount that the receiving parent would pay if the difference between their income percentage and the care cost percentage were a positive percentage. If the multi-group cap applies, the amount is determined by multiplying the difference between the receiving parent's income percentage and care cost percentage (expressed as a positive percentage) by the amount payable under the liable parent's multi-group cap.

**Example**

William is assessed as having to pay child support of $3,000. Care of his child is being shared between the child's mother, Lisa and grandmother Kiri. Both provide more than 35% of ongoing daily care. Lisa is assessed based on the difference between her income percentage and the care cost percentage as receiving $1,900. Kiri receives the remaining $1,100.

_Where the minimum annual rate is payable_

Where a minimum annual rate is set as a parent's child support liability, the proportion payable in respect of each receiving carer is to be on the basis of the number of qualifying children of the liable parent that each carer provides care for.

**Example**

Harry is assessed as having to pay the minimum annual rate of child support of $871. He has three qualifying children. The eldest is being cared for by Belinda and the other two are cared for by Alison. Belinda will receive 1/3 of the minimum annual rate and Alison will receive 2/3 of the minimum annual rate.

Family tax credit
-----------------

This payment depends on how much you earn, the number of dependent children you have and any shared care arrangements.

If you receive a [main benefit](/api/glossary/item?id={018EFC0D-DBEC-47C0-A36A-0C913B633656})
 and earn more than $3,558 a month (including the benefit) please contact us to make sure you are not being overpaid.

You cannot get the payment if you get a parent's allowance or a children's pension under the Veterans' Support Act 2014.

In-work tax credit
------------------

This is a payment available for families who have some income from paid work each week. If you're getting a [main benefit](/api/glossary/item?id={018EFC0D-DBEC-47C0-A36A-0C913B633656})
, a student allowance, a parent's allowance or a children's pension from Veterans' Affairs, New Zealand you are not eligible for this payment.

You may be able to get the in-work tax credit if your income is from accident compensation - including survivor payments or paid parental leave.

As long as you are working, you can get the in-work tax credit if you receive other types of income, including:

*   NZ Superannuation
*   a Foster Care Allowance
*   an Orphan's Benefit
*   an Unsupported Child Benefit
*   a Veteran's Pension
*   weekly compensation from Veterans' Affairs New Zealand.

### Unpaid break of 2 weeks or less

Since 1 April 2021, you can keep receiving the in-work tax credit for up to 2 weeks when taking an unpaid break from work. This could be either as you transition between jobs, are unpaid for a period, or leave employment. If you're taking an unpaid break from work, you'll need to notify IR to ensure your IWTC payments continue. The best way to do this is in myIR.

Best Start
----------

Best Start is a payment of $73 a week for families supporting a newborn baby. Families who qualify for Best Start can receive the payment until their baby turns 1, no matter how much they earn. If families are receiving paid parental leave payments, they cannot get the Best Start payment for the period of time they get paid parental leave in.

After the first year, families can receive Best Start payments until their child turns 3. The amount a family receives will depend on the family income and any changes to the family circumstances throughout the tax year. To continue getting the payments after a child turns 1, families will need to provide us with an estimate of their family income.

If you're receiving a benefit, you need to let Work and Income know about your child's birth. They'll set up your payments and let you know about any changes to your benefit.

Refer to the Working for Families chart for more information about how much your payments could be.

Minimum family tax credit
-------------------------

This is a payment if your annual family income after tax is:

*   less than $35,316 from 31 July 2024
*   less than $35,204 from 1 April 2024
*   less than $34,216 from 1 April 2023
*   less than $32,864 from 1 April 2022
*   less than $31,096 from 1 July 2021

It tops up your family's after-tax weekly income to at least $677 from 1 April 2024 to 30 July 2024. From 31 July 2024 the amount is at least $679.

### Estimating your income

The payments you receive each week or fortnight are based on how much you estimate you'll earn for the year. If you earn more than you've estimated:

*   you could get a bill at the end of the year
*   we may reduce your weekly or fortnight payments to reduce the risk of you being overpaid.

This means that you need to estimate your income very carefully and let us know when your hours of work change to make sure you get the right amount.

### Minimum hours of work

To get the minimum family tax credit you must work a minimum number of hours for salary or wages each week.

*   A single parent must work at least 20 hours a week.
*   In a 2-parent family, 1 or both parents between them must work at least 30 hours a week.

In any week that you work less than the minimum required hours, you are not eligible.

The minimum number of hours cannot come from self-employed work. A self-employed person must still work the minimum number of hours in salary or wage work to qualify for the minimum family tax credit.

### When you cannot receive the minimum family tax credit

The minimum family tax credit is not available to families receiving the following:

*   a main benefit
*   a parent's allowance
*   a children's pension from Veterans' Affairs New Zealand.

### Shared care

If you share the care of your children, this may affect the amount of minimum family tax credit you are eligible for. If you think you may not be receiving the correct amount, please contact us.
