It set out a range of possible business tax initiatives that could help transform the New Zealand economy by enhancing productivity and improving our international competitiveness, particularly with Australia. Feedback was sought on the relative priority of the initiatives, given limited resources. 1.2 No decision has been taken on what initiatives will be introduced. In the meantime, officials are seeking further feedback on the definition of R&D, eligibility criteria and eligible expenditure. The challenge is to develop a tax credit that is sufficiently broad to capture expenditure that generates wider benefits, but is sufficiently precise to be clear and workable. 1.3 It is also important that the R&D tax credit is broadly consistent with that adopted in other jurisdictions. There is, in particular, an advantage to designing a tax credit that has similar eligibility criteria to those in Australia because of the number of companies that operate in both jurisdictions and the objective of the Business Tax Review to increase competitiveness with Australia. 1.4 This issues paper has been prepared by officials from the Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department and from the Treasury, as part of the continuing consultation process. If the government decides to proceed with the tax credit initiative, submissions on the ideas explored in this issues paper will be taken into account in the design of the credit. 1.5 Submissions should be made by 1 December 2006 and be addressed to: Business Tax Review, R&D Tax Credits C/- Deputy Commissioner Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON Or email: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “Business Tax Review, R&D Tax Credits” in the subject line. 1.6 There is a very tight reporting timeframe and extensions to the deadline are not feasible. Late submissions cannot be considered. 1.7 Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for officials to contact those making submissions and to discuss their submission, if required. 5 1.8 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their publication. The withholding of particular submissions on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. Those who consider there is any part of their submission that should be properly withheld under the Act should indicate this clearly. SUMMARY OF A POSSIBLE APPROACH TO AN R&D TAX CREDIT The definition of “R&D” would be: (1) systematic, investigative and experimental activities that either seek to resolve scientific or technological uncertainty or involve an appreciable element of novelty and are carried on for the purposes of: – acquiring new knowledge or – creating new or improved materials, products, devices, processes or services; (2) other activities that are required for, and integral to, the carrying on of the activities in (1). “Systematic investigative and experiment activities” would not include: • prospecting, exploring or drilling for, or producing, minerals, petroleum, natural gas or geothermal reserves; • research in social sciences (including economics, business management and behavioural sciences), arts or humanities; • routine collection of information; • activities associated with complying with statutory requirements or standards, such as the maintenance of national standards, the calibration of secondary standards and routine testing and analysis of materials, components, products, processes, soils, atmospheres and other things; • any activity related to the reproduction of a commercial product or process by a physical examination of an existing system or from plans, blueprints, detailed specifications or publicly available information; • quality control or routine testing of materials, devices, products or processes; • pre-production activities, such as demonstration of commercial viability, tooling- up and trial runs; • the making of cosmetic modifications or stylistic changes to products, services, processes or production methods; • market research, market testing or market development, or sales promotion (including consumer surveys); 6 • management studies or efficiency surveys; • commercial, legal and administrative aspects of patenting, licensing or other activities. Eligible claimants: • would not need to have a particular structure (meaning claimants do not need to be incorporated); • should be in business (except if they are an industry-based research co-operative); and • would have to spend more than $20,000 on eligible expenditure in each year a claim is made (except if R&D work is subcontracted to an approved research provider). The tax credit would apply to R&D carried out overseas for up to 10 percent of the total cost of the project. Foreign-owned firms doing R&D in New Zealand would be eligible. If R&D is subcontracted, the party commissioning the R&D would be eligible for the credit, rather than the party providing the R&D services. The following expenditure would be eligible: • salaries and wages of R&D staff; • depreciation of tangible assets \* used in conducting R&D; • other listed expenditure incurred directly in carrying on R&D activities including overheads and consumables; and • payments to entities conducting R&D on behalf of the taxpayer. The following expenditure would be ineligible: • royalties; \* • interest expenditure; • feedstock expenditure (other than net feedstock expenditure); • expenditure in relation to which a grant is provided and the required co-funding; • the making of donations; • accounting and legal fees in calculating what is R&D. \* The cost of intangible assets (whether by way of depreciation or royalties) is to be excluded initially to allow officials to consider their inclusion in more detail. 7 CHAPTER 2 Definition of “research and development” 2.1 In developing a possible definition of R&D, we have drawn on best practice from the definitions in the tax incentive provisions in Australia, Canada, Ireland and the United Kingdom. The definitions in the first three jurisdictions and the key elements of the United Kingdom’s definition are set out in Appendix 1. The definition 2.2 R&D would be defined as: (1) systematic, investigative and experimental activities that either seek to resolve scientific or technological uncertainty or involve an appreciable element of novelty and that are carried on for the purposes of: − acquiring new knowledge or − creating new or improved materials, products, devices, processes or services; (2) other activities that are required for, and integral to, the carrying on of the activities in (1). 2.3 This definition is, in substance, similar to the Australian definition. This is a relatively broad definition of R&D performed in a business setting. It recognises that most firms do not do basic research, so includes the development work involved in creating new or improved materials, products, processes or services. Nor does it require that the firm be in a high-tech industry, since qualifying activities can occur in any industry. Clarification of terms 2.4 The meaning of some of the terms, either in primary or secondary legislation (or guidelines where the point is just explanatory) would need to be clarified. Some of the matters that would have to be clarified are set out below. For simplicity, we refer below only to development of products, but this includes development of processes, devices, services and materials. 2.5 There may also be a need for industry-specific guidelines (for example, for software, oil and gas exploration and pharmaceuticals). There would be extensive consultation with these industries in developing guidelines. 8 R&D need not be successful to qualify 2.6 It would not be necessary for the R&D activity to be successful – in other words, scientific or technological uncertainty need not be resolved or a new product created. To be R&D, it would be sufficient that the activities involved sought the resolution of scientific or technological uncertainty, or involved an appreciable element of novelty, and were carried on for the purpose of acquiring new knowledge or creating new or improved products. Scientific or technological uncertainty 2.7 “Scientific or technological uncertainty” would exist when knowledge of whether something is scientifically or technologically possible, or how to achieve it in practice, is not publicly available or deducible by a competent professional working in the field. Appreciable element of novelty 2.8 As set out in the Australian R&D guidelines, the element of novelty would have to be meaningful or significant in the context of the activities undertaken, and there would have to be some development of the technology or a new use of existing technology for activities to be novel. Firms should be able to identify what element of novelty in the form of new thinking or original ideas or inventive steps was introduced in the activities. 2.9 Novelty in this context would mean different from things known or seen before, not already known in terms of the existing state of knowledge in the technology, new knowledge or new features or attributes different from anything else on the market. To establish whether something is new or different, it should be compared with what is already available in the public arena on a reasonably accessible world-wide basis at the time in that technology. 2.10 Creation of a product that is the first of its type built by the company or even the first of its type in New Zealand would not in itself mean the activities involve an appreciable element of novelty. Simultaneous R&D 2.11 Under either of the preceding tests, R&D could be done: • by two firms simultaneously and independently doing the same innovative work; and • when work has already been done but this is not public knowledge because it is a trade secret, and another firm repeats the work. Improvements to existing products 2.12 To qualify as R&D, the improvement that is sought to an existing product would have to be one that involved an appreciable element of novelty or resolution of scientific or technological uncertainty. It therefore should be more than a stylistic or cosmetic change or routine upgrading. 9 Other definitions 2.13 The following terms would also be defined: • “Science” is the systematic study of the nature and behaviour of the physical and material universe. • “Technology” is the practical application of scientific principles and knowledge. • “Systematic, investigative and experimental” activities are planned activities directed towards a particular purpose and following a logical progression of work involving hypothesis, experiment, observation and evaluation. Exclusions from “systematic, investigative and experimental activities” 2.14 Certain activities are routinely excluded from R&D definitions for tax concession purposes. Activities may be excluded because governments do not wish to incentivise particular activity through an R&D concession (such as research in the arts, humanities or social sciences that may be considered less likely to lead to economic growth). Other exclusions remove uncertainty over whether a particular activity could be considered R&D (for example, oil exploration), or clarify the boundary between development and post- development activity, or innovative and routine work. 2.15 The definition put forward here broadly follows the Australian approach in relation to excluded activities, although with some minor modifications. 2.16 As in Australia, activities would be excluded only from the part of the definition relating to “systematic, investigative and experimental activities”. This means that the excluded activities could come within the supporting limb of the definition of R&D, which is discussed later. So, for example, while routine data collection would not be a core R&D activity, it might be eligible as an activity that is required for and integral to a core R&D activity. 2.17 The following activities would be excluded: • prospecting, exploring or drilling for, or producing, minerals, petroleum, natural gas or geothermal reserves; • research in social sciences (including economics, business management and behavioural sciences), arts or humanities; • routine collection of information; • activities associated with complying with statutory requirements or standards, such as the maintenance of national standards, the calibration of secondary standards and routine testing and analysis of materials, components, products, processes, soils, atmospheres and other things; 10 • any activity related to the reproduction of a commercial product or process by a physical examination of an existing system or from plans, blueprints, detailed specifications or publicly available information; • quality control or routine testing of materials, devices, products or processes; • pre-production activities, such as demonstration of commercial viability, tooling-up and trial runs; • the making of cosmetic modifications or stylistic changes to products, services, processes or production methods;  market research, market testing or market development, or sales promotion (including consumer surveys);  management studies or efficiency surveys; and  commercial, legal and administrative aspects of patenting, licensing or other activities. 2.18 Some of these exclusions (such as routine data collection and cosmetic or stylistic changes), are self-explanatory and are commonly excluded from the definition of R&D in other jurisdictions but we comment on two exclusions below. Oil and gas exploration 2.19 It is possible to have R&D in these industries – for example, R&D to develop new exploration techniques – but the exploration in itself is not R&D. Management studies or efficiency surveys 2.20 This exclusion covers, for example, studies relating to inventory control, work practices and industrial relations, and time and motion studies. Further Australian exclusions 2.21 The Australian R&D definition specifically excludes preparation for teaching, specialised routine medical care, and the making of donations. In our view, these activities could not be “systematic, investigative and experimental activities” and we do not propose specifically excluding them. The making of donations seems to fit better into excluded expenditure, rather than being excluded from the definition of R&D. Software 2.22 In Australia, for computer software activities to be eligible as systematic, investigative and experimental activities, they must also be carried out for the purpose, or for purposes that include the purpose, of sale, rent, licence, hire or lease to two or more non-associates of the company. 11 2.23 In our view, New Zealand should not have a similar restriction. However, we consider guidelines as to what constitutes R&D in the software industry would be desirable. Should the government proceed with a tax credit for R&D, there would be extensive consultation on such guidelines. Supporting activities – limb (2) of definition 2.24 Supporting activities that are required for, and integral to, the primary R&D activities but which in themselves are not systematic, investigative and experimental would be considered to be R&D. Such activities are part of an R&D project (as opposed to indirect supporting activities such as cleaning and administration, which are dealt with as expenditure on overheads). The following activities are examples of support activities: • scientific or technological planning activities; • mathematical analysis/modelling used to analyse the results of experiments; • data collection when the data are used in experiments; • literature searches or other investigatory work undertaken in the early stages of a project to establish the knowledge and experience in the public arena; and • development of specialist computer software to assist in the design of experiments. 2.25 For activities to qualify under the second limb, there would need to be a primary R&D activity. 12 CHAPTER 3 Who should qualify for the tax credit? 3.1 The eligibility criteria should be as inclusive as possible, taking into account the variety of businesses that carry out R&D in New Zealand. The criteria should be easily understood, and when applied, they should not impose unnecessary compliance and administrative costs. Entity structure 3.2 The tax concession would be available to all businesses regardless of the legal form of the business. 3.3 The options in considering eligible entities are to limit the scheme to companies, or not to impose any restrictions on the legal form of entities eligible to claim the credit. 3.4 The main advantage of limiting the scheme to companies is that it would match the requirements found in similar schemes overseas. Disadvantages of requiring incorporation are that non-company entities would have to restructure to claim the credit. Although entities that carry out significant amounts of R&D are almost invariably incorporated, around one in twelve is not. Examples of such entities include trusts, consortia and self-employed individuals. 3.5 Not requiring incorporation is favoured because it is the most inclusive option, and it would avoid creating distortions to the way entities structure themselves. In business 3.6 The concession would apply to entities in business in New Zealand, including those deriving exempt income. 3.7 The concession targets R&D carried out by businesses, and we therefore propose that the tax test for “business” be applied. That test involves two aspects. The first is about the nature of the activities, which must amount to a profession, trade, manufacture or undertaking. The second is that there is an intention to make a pecuniary profit. 3.8 Entities that earn exempt income could meet the business test. The arguments for allowing them to have access to the concession include: • There are a significant number of business entities undertaking R&D activities that derive exempt income, and the concession should create the same incentives for these entities towards doing more R&D as it does for other business entities. 13 • It would be inefficient to require entities to restructure in order to gain access to the credits, and it would create unnecessary compliance costs. Minimum threshold 3.9 A minimum amount of R&D would have to be undertaken in order to qualify for the concession. An exception to the threshold would be payments made to an approved research provider for the provision of R&D services. 3.10 The rationale for a minimum threshold is an administrative one. Setting a threshold helps avoid disproportionate compliance and administrative costs being incurred on small claims, and it would act as a filter against projects that are not R&D (without having to be evaluated for meeting the eligibility and definitional requirements). It would also dissuade small firms from reclassifying expenditure as R&D costs. 3.11 Most comparable overseas schemes impose minimum thresholds of R&D spending to gain access to the concession. A minimum of $20,000 per year of eligible expenditure (as outlined in chapter 4) is suggested. This amount is equivalent to a part-time salary and some related overhead costs. 3.12 Some assistance is required for small firms to have access to expert R&D services. Therefore an exception to the threshold for payments made to approved research providers would be desirable. That should allow small firms to have access to the concession and benefit from R&D programs without having to invest in R&D equipment and expertise themselves. 3.13 For an organisation to become an approved research provider, it would need to be capable of performing contracted R&D, have research facilities, charge fees on normal commercial terms and be available to undertake work on behalf of multiple non-related organisations. R&D carried out overseas 3.14 R&D costs incurred overseas would be eligible for the concession for up to 10 percent of the total cost of the project. 3.15 The concession would aim to encourage R&D activities to be carried out within New Zealand. Evidence suggests that spill-over benefits tend to be localised, so the location of the R&D is important. Similar schemes overseas also tend to subsidise R&D carried out within their territory. 3.16 While firms have indicated a strong preference to do their R&D in New Zealand (for reasons of cost and control), reality dictates that some of the work has to be carried out overseas. This could be because: • The capability to do that work is not available locally. • Foreign regulators require the R&D to be carried out in their jurisdiction in order for the final product to be marketed in that jurisdiction. 14 • R&D to customise a product to a particular market may need to be carried out in that market. 3.17 Therefore certain R&D activities conducted overseas should be eligible for the concession. The eligibility should be limited to 10 percent of the expenditure of the larger R&D project undertaken in New Zealand, of which the overseas activities must be a part. Further expenditure over the 10 percent limit might be incurred on overseas R&D activities in connection with the project, but would not be eligible for the concession. The Australian R&D tax concession has a similar requirement. Foreign ownership 3.18 Foreign ownership should not limit access to the concession as long as the R&D is carried out in New Zealand. 1 The location by foreign firms of R&D facilities in New Zealand is a potentially valuable source of knowledge, technology and human capital spill-overs. 3.19 Since the aim of the credit is to improve productivity in New Zealand, it is important to design the scheme so that resulting benefits are not largely captured overseas. 3.20 Foreign ownership does not appear to be a limitation to eligibility in similar R&D tax concession schemes overseas. However, those schemes impose other restrictions that are aimed at limiting the risks associated with providing concessions to foreign owned entities. Examples of such limitations are that the key researcher must not be a foreigner; there must be a national benefit from the R&D; the intellectual property resulting from the R&D must be held in the country providing the concession; and the R&D must be carried out in the country providing the concession. 3.21 Including the requirement that the R&D be carried out in New Zealand should ensure that significant benefits can be captured locally. Subcontracted R&D 3.22 The nature of R&D projects is such that collaborations and subcontracting are commonplace. R&D collaboration is also an important source of R&D spill- overs, as collaboration often involves the transfer from one organisation to another of tacit knowledge, skills and experience. Rules would therefore be needed to determine which party should be eligible for the credit and how to treat expenditure incurred by a joint venture, and how to deal with contributions to industry research organisations. 1 Although the 10 percent exception for R&D carried out overseas would apply. 15 Should the firm commissioning the R&D or the firm carrying out the R&D be eligible for the concession? 3.23 The concession should vest with the firm commissioning the R&D. 3.24 It is important to prevent double access to concessions in respect of the same R&D activities. Therefore the concession should not be available to both the firm commissioning the R&D and the firm carrying out the R&D. 3.25 The concession should vest with the commissioning firm because: • It is the party deciding how much R&D should be undertaken. • It bears both the financial and technical risk associated with the R&D activity. • It controls the project and owns the project results. 3.26 There are some benefits of vesting the concession with the firm carrying out the R&D activity, such as less complexity in the scheme and a more consistent application of the eligible expenditure provisions. Those benefits appear to be outweighed by the benefits of vesting the concession with the party who makes the decision about how much R&D to undertake. Joint ventures and partnerships 3.27 Joint ventures and partnerships are important collaborative vehicles for R&D in New Zealand. The joint venture vehicle would be eligible for the concession in relation to expenditure it incurs. However, owners of the joint venture might also incur expenditure in relation to the R&D activity. In that case the owner would have to demonstrate sufficient risk, control and ownership of the project to be able to access the concession. Voluntary contributions and levy payments 3.28 Organisations receiving voluntary contributions or levy payments which are then applied to R&D activities should be eligible for the tax concession. 3.29 It would be difficult for those who make the contributions or pay the levies to come within the eligibility provisions. They are unlikely to have sufficient control over how the levies are applied to R&D activities or ownership of the results. They are also unlikely to meet the minimum threshold for R&D spending. 3.30 The organisations that apply the levy funding to R&D activities may have sufficient control over the R&D activity, and it is arguable that “their funds” are at risk if the project fails. However it is not clear that these organisations would meet the tax business test. Examples of such organisations are commodity levy organisations. 16 3.31 Entities that fund R&D activities for industry purposes with money collected from businesses should be eligible for the credit. They would need to be listed with Inland Revenue as a research co-operative and, like other claimants, show that they met all of the requirements to claim the credit, except the requirement that they are a business in New Zealand. The amount of eligible expenditure subject to the concession each year would be capped at the amount contributed by private businesses to the co-operative that year. Crown-owned businesses 3.32 Crown-owned businesses that are not funded to do R&D, such as state-owned enterprises, should be eligible for the credit. In principle, crown-owned businesses that are funded to undertake R&D should not be eligible for the credit if receiving it would constitute double funding of R&D. There are options for avoiding double funding, and officials will do further work on this in consultation with crown agencies. Submission points • Should entities that earn exempt income be eligible for the concession? • Is a minimum threshold of $20,000 set at the right level? • What should the requirements be to be an approved research provider? 17 CHAPTER 4 Eligible expenditure 4.1 This chapter specifies the expenditure that, in our view, should attract the credit. Expenditure eligible for the 125 percent concession in Australia is set out in Appendix II. General principles 4.2 The credit would apply only to expenditure that is deductible, or amortisable, under the Income Tax Act (or, in relation in those with tax-exempt income, that would be deductible, or amortisable, if the income were not exempt). This requirement would exclude, for example, non-business and pre-business expenditure, depreciation on intangibles not listed in Schedule 17, and expenditure on land. Timing 4.3 The credit would be available only in the year in which the deduction for expenditure is allowed (taking account of any add-back of expenditure under, for example, the accrual expenditure rules). In other words, the timing rules in the Act should apply to the concession. For those with tax-exempt income, the concession would apply in the year in which a deduction would have been allowed had the income of the entity not been exempt. Salary and wages 4.4 Salary and wages of employees and independent contractors directly and actively engaged in core R&D activity (scientists, engineers) and R&D support activity would be eligible. 4.5 This would include all remuneration paid to the employee or contractor (allowances, bonuses, commissions, extra salary, overtime, holiday pay and long service pay), and the value of fringe benefits, accommodation benefits and superannuation contributions. It would not include the value of share options. The value of these is not currently deductible, and their tax treatment is under review. 4.6 When the employee or independent contractor is engaged on R&D and other activities, the credit would apply only to the portion of expenditure that relates to time directly and actively engaged in R&D. 18 Depreciation 4.7 Eligible expenditure would include depreciation on tangible depreciable assets used in conducting R&D. Intangible depreciable assets 4.8 Initially, the credit would not apply to the cost of intangible depreciable assets. The extent to which they could be included requires careful consideration because such assets tend to be the focus of tax avoidance schemes. This work would have to be done after the concession was enacted. Pilot plant and prototypes 4.9 The concession would also apply to depreciation on depreciable assets that are the object of the R&D and used in the R&D process (pilot plant and prototypes) to the extent expenditure incurred in their design and construction has been capitalised. (Some of the cost may have been deducted as revenue account expenditure, with the concession applying at the time of deduction.) Link with R&D 4.10 Under general rules, depreciation is allowed to the extent an asset is used or available for use in deriving income. If this were the test for R&D, so that the concession applied to the extent an asset was used or available for use in conducting R&D, a small percentage of actual R&D use would allow all the downtime to be eligible for the concession. 4.11 For example, if an asset was used 10 percent of the time for R&D, and 10 percent for non-R&D, with 80 percent downtime, the concession would apply to 90 percent of depreciation on the asset in that year. 4.12 Instead, one option would be to pro-rate depreciation on the basis of actual use so that in the preceding example, the concession would apply to 50 percent of depreciation in that year. 4.13 A more rough and ready alternative would be to provide that when an asset is used primarily in conducting R&D, the concession would apply to the extent the asset is used or available for use in conducting R&D. Only actual use for another purpose would not qualify for the concession. When the asset is not primarily used in conducting R&D, no concession would be available. Pooled assets 4.14 The concession would not apply to pooled assets 2 unless the pool consisted solely of R&D assets used exclusively in conducting R&D. Because the pool is depreciated, and individual assets in the pool are not tracked, it is not possible to apply the concession only to those assets in a pool that are used in conducting R&D. 2 Tax depreciation pools of low-cost assets (under $2000). 19 Loss on sale/clawback of depreciation on disposal of asset used in R&D 4.15 Theoretically, when an asset that has been used in conducting R&D is sold or no longer used in the business, the credit should apply to any loss on sale. The credit should also be clawed back to the extent depreciation deductions are clawed back. 4.16 If an incremental credit is adopted, this treatment would be too complex to apply. Ordering rules would be needed that specify what type of eligible expenditure attracts the concession in any year. For example, if $100 of $1000 expenditure is eligible because that is incremental spend, what type of expenditure is that $100 – salary, depreciation or consumables? 4.17 If a volume-based concession is adopted, it would be possible to apply the concession to depreciation adjustments on sale (and the Australian 125 percent concession does so). Example 4.18 An asset is acquired for $1000 and is used only in conducting R&D. Annual depreciation is $100, and the tax credit is 10 percent. In year two, the asset has a tax book value of $900, and the firm has received a $10 tax credit. 4.19 If the asset is sold for $700, the tax credit would apply to the $200 loss on sale ($20 tax credit). If it is sold for $1000, the $10 credit previously allowed should be clawed back. So, to the extent that a firm had no credits in that year from which to deduct the credit clawed back, it is possible to have a negative credit. Partial use for R&D 4.20 When the asset is only partly used for R&D, the calculation on disposal of the asset becomes more complex. This should be made as simple as possible because apportionment of the loss on sale/clawback would need to apply on disposal of all assets in use at the time the concession is implemented. The apportionment calculation would be: depreciation recovered or loss on sale x the proportion of total use that is R&D use. Asset no longer used for R&D 4.21 Theoretically, the adjustment should also apply when an asset is no longer used for R&D but continues to be used in the business. There should be a deemed sale at market value at the time of conversion to other use (in much the same way as depreciable assets that are converted to private use are treated). However, this would add to the complexity of the provisions. 20 Other expenditure incurred directly in carrying on R&D activities 4.22 Apart from salaries and depreciation, only expenditure specifically listed below would be eligible for the concession. General 4.23 Certain types of general expenditure would be eligible: • expenditure on low cost depreciable assets to be used exclusively or primarily in carrying on R&D; • costs associated with travel by employees and independent contractors in carrying on R&D; • costs of training required to support an R&D project; and • the cost of materials incorporated into prototypes and pilot plant (to the extent these are revenue costs under normal deductibility rules). Overheads 4.24 Expenditure on the following overheads would be eligible, to the extent they are incurred directly in respect of R&D activities: • salaries and other costs of administration, personnel, repairs and maintenance, cleaning and security staff; • rates, utilities (include telecommunications) and insurance; and • costs of leasing buildings, plant and equipment. Consumables 4.25 Consumables are items consumed or transformed in the R&D process. These would not be listed but examples could be provided in guidelines. Expenditure on items consumed would include, for example, materials for laboratories, stationery, printing, postage and reference materials. 4.26 In relation to items transformed in the R&D process, only the net expenditure would be eligible – that is, the excess of the cost of the materials which are the subject of processing or transformation in the R&D process over the value of the output. This replicates the Australian treatment of “feedstock” expenditure. 4.27 An example is the costs associated with acquiring or extracting ore for transformation into metal in an experimental smelter. The amount eligible for the concession is the cost of the ore (which is an input into R&D) less the value of the output metal. 21 Payments by taxpayer to entities conducting R&D on behalf of the taxpayer 4.28 The key concern about allowing these payments to be eligible is to ensure that firms outsourcing R&D cannot claim the concession for expenditure that would be ineligible if done in-house. Possible rules for ensuring that are set out below. 4.29 When the performer of the R&D and the commissioner of the R&D are associated, eligible expenditure would be the lesser of: • the amount paid under the contract; and • the eligible expenditure of the performer. 3 4.30 When the performer of the R&D and commissioner of the R&D are not associated, eligible expenditure would be the amount paid under the contract to the extent it does not include expenditure of the performer for interest, feedstock (other than net feedstock expenditure), depreciation on intangible assets and royalties. Exclusions from “eligible expenditure” 4.31 The following would be excluded: • royalties; 4 • interest expenditure; • feedstock expenditure (other than net feedstock expenditure); • the total of: expenditure in relation to which a government grant is provided, and the required co-funding by the claimant specified by government investment and funding agents. For example, in a simple case of a grant for 50 percent of expenditure, twice the amount of the grant would be ineligible. This would avoid double subsidising of a project; • the making of donations; and • accounting and legal fees in calculating what is R&D. 3 This is similar to the rules in the United Kingdom for subcontracted R&D. 4 As with depreciation on intangible assets, this is excluded initially so that officials can more carefully consider the concession applying to the cost of acquiring intangible assets. 22 Submission points • What is the appropriate link between the credit and the use of depreciable assets in conducting R&D? • Do the compliance costs of applying the credit to adjustments on disposal outweigh the more accurate calculation of the credit for depreciable property used in R&D? 23 APPENDIX I Definitions of R&D in other jurisdictions Australia Section 73B Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 “Research and development activities” means: (a) systematic, investigative and experimental activities that involve innovation or high levels of technical risk and are carried on for the purposes of: (i) acquiring new knowledge (whether or not that knowledge will have specific practical application); or (ii) creating new or improved materials, products, devices, processes or services; or (b) other activities that are carried on for a purpose directly related to the carrying on of activities of the kind referred to in paragraph (a).” The terms “innovation” and “high levels of technical risk” are further defined in section 73B (2B). “(2B) For the purposes of the definition of research and development activities in subsection (1): (a) activities are not taken to involve innovation unless they involve an appreciable element of novelty; and (b) activities are not taken to involve high levels of technical risk unless: (i) the probability of obtaining the technical or scientific outcome of the activities cannot be known or determined in advance on the basis of current knowledge or experience; and (ii) the uncertainty of obtaining the outcome can be removed only through a program of systematic, investigative and experimental activities in which scientific method has been applied, in a systematic progression of work (based on principles of physical, biological, chemical, medical, engineering or computer sciences) from hypothesis to experiment, observation and evaluation, followed by logical conclusions.” 24 “Systematic, investigative and experimental activities” do not include: • market research, market testing or market development, or sales promotion (including consumer surveys); • quality control; • prospecting, exploring or drilling for minerals, petroleum or natural gas for the purpose of discovering deposits, determining more precisely the location of deposits or determining the size or quality of deposits; • the making of cosmetic modifications or stylistic changes to products, processes or production methods; • management studies or efficiency surveys; • research in social sciences, arts or humanities; • pre-production activities, such as demonstration of commercial viability, tooling-up and trial runs; • routine collection of information except as part of the research and development process; • commercial, legal and administrative aspects of patenting, licensing or other activities; • activities associated with complying with statutory requirements or standards, such as the maintenance of national standards, the calibration of secondary standards and routine testing and analysis of materials, components, products, processes, soils, atmospheres and other things; • the making of donations; • preparation for teaching; • specialised routine medical care; • any activity related to the reproduction of a commercial product or process by a physical examination of an existing system or from plans, blueprints, detailed specifications or publicly available information. 25 Canada Section 248(1) Income Tax Act ... “scientific research and experimental development” means systematic investigation or research that is carried out in a field of science or technology by means of experiment or analysis and that is (a) basic research, namely, work undertaken for the advancement of scientific knowledge without a special practical application in view, (b) applied research, namely, work undertaken for the advancement of scientific knowledge with a specific practical application in view, or (c) experimental development, namely, work undertaken for the purpose of achieving technological advancement for the purpose of creating new, or improving existing, materials, devices, products or processes, including incremental improvements thereto, and, in applying this definition in respect of a taxpayer, includes (d) work undertaken by or on behalf of the taxpayer with respect to engineering, design, operations research, mathematical analysis, computer programming, data collection, testing or psychological research, where the work is commensurate with the needs, and directly in support, of work described in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) that is undertaken in Canada by or on behalf of the taxpayer, but does not include work with respect to (e) market research or sales promotion (f) quality control or routine testing of materials, devices, products or processes (g) research in the social sciences or the humanities (h) prospecting, exploring or drilling for, or producing, minerals, petroleum or natural gas (i) the commercial production of a new or improved material, device or product or the commercial use of a new or improved process (j) style changes or (k) routine data collection. 26 United Kingdom The definition of R&D for tax purposes follows generally accepted accounting practice as modified for tax purposes by guidelines which are given legal force by Parliamentary Regulations. R&D for tax purposes takes place when a project seeks to achieve an advance in science or technology. The activities which directly contribute to achieving this advance in science or technology through the resolution of scientific or technological uncertainty are R&D. Certain qualifying indirect activities related to the project are also R&D. Activities other than qualifying indirect activities which do not directly contribute to the resolution of the project’s scientific or technological uncertainty are not R&D. Ireland Section 766 Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 ... ‘research and development activities’ means systematic, investigative or experimental activities in a field of science or technology, being one or more of the following – 1) Basic research, namely, experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new scientific or technical knowledge without a specific practical application in view 2) Applied research, namely, work undertaken in order to gain scientific or technical knowledge and directed towards a specific practical application, or 3) Experimental development, namely work undertaken which draws on scientific or technical knowledge or practical experience for the purpose of achieving technological advancement and which is directed at producing new, or improving existing, materials, products, devices, processes, systems or services including incremental improvements thereto: but activities will not be research and development activities unless they – (a) Seek to achieve scientific or technological advancement, and – (b) Involve the resolution of scientific or technological uncertainty. 27 Extract from Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (Prescribed Research and Development Activities) Regulations 2004 4. Without prejudice to the generality of clauses (I) and (II) of the definition of “research and development” activities in section 766 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, an activity falling within any of the following categories shall not be a research and development activity for the purposes of that section: (a) research in the social sciences (including economics, business management and behavioural sciences), arts or humanities, (b) routine testing and analysis for the purposes of quality or quantity control, (c) alterations of a cosmetic or stylistic nature to existing products, services or processes whether or not these alterations represent some improvement, (d) operational research such as management studies or efficiency surveys which are not wholly and exclusively undertaken for the purposes of a specific research and development activity, (e) corrective action in connection with break-downs during commercial production of a product, (f) legal and administrative work in connection with patent applications, records and litigation and the sale or licensing of patents, (g) activity, including design and construction engineering, relating to the construction, relocation, rearrangement or start-up of facilities or equipment other than facilities or equipment which is or are to be used wholly and exclusively for the purposes of carrying on by the company concerned of research and development activities, (h) market research, market testing, market development, sales promotion or consumer surveys, (i) prospecting, exploring or drilling for, or producing, minerals, petroleum or natural gas, (j) the commercial and financial steps necessary for the marketing or the commercial production or distribution of a new or improved material, product, device, process, system or service, (k) administration and general support services (including transportation, storage, cleaning, repair, maintenance and security) which are not wholly and exclusively undertaken in connection with a research and development activity 28 APPENDIX II Eligible expenditure – Australia Eligible expenditure is: • salary expenditure (including allowances, bonuses, leave, payroll tax, super contributions etc) of employees engaged directly in carrying out R&D. • other expenditure incurred directly in respect of R&D activities (overheads, administrative costs, travel, motor vehicle expenses, rent, rates and land taxes, security, training, consumables). 5 This also includes payments to contractors for R&D services (apart from those to registered research agencies below). • contracted expenditure paid to registered research agencies for performing R&D on behalf of a company. • depreciation on plant and equipment used to facilitate the conduct of R&D activities, and experimental items which are developed as the object of R&D activities and which are used for testing, analysis, and data recording activities, in the R&D activities. (The concession does not apply to pooled assets.) • net feedstock expenditure. Exclusions • core technology expenditure (expenditure on acquiring, or acquiring the right to use, technology which forms the basis for undertaking further R&D). There is no enhanced deduction for this. Such expenditure was once immediately written off but now the cost of core technology is deductible only to the extent of one-third of the amount of R&D in the year of acquisition. Any amount not deducted in that year is carried forward and is deductible annually to the extent it does not exceed one-third of the amount of R&D expenditure in that year. • interest expenditure incurred in financing R&D activities. • feedstock expenditure (other than net feedstock expenditure). Feedstock expenditure is expenditure on materials or good to be the subject of processing or transformation by the company in R&D activities. Buildings A decline in value of buildings used for R&D is not eligible for the concession. 5 Taxation Ruling IT 2552.

It set out a range of possible business tax initiatives that will help transform the New Zealand economy by enhancing our productivity and improving our international competitiveness. Feedback was sought on the relative priority of the initiatives given limited resources. 1.2 The government has made no decisions on what initiatives will be introduced. In the meantime, however, we are seeking further feedback on certain measures put forward in the discussion document, including the design of a skills training tax credit. 1.3 This issues paper has been prepared by officials from the Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department and from the Treasury, as part of the continuing consultation process. If the government decides to proceed with the tax credit initiative, submissions on the ideas explored in this issues paper will be taken into account in the design of the credit. 1.4 The specific design issues on which we seek feedback are set out in the following chapters. They include a possible definition of “eligible training” and what eligibility criteria and eligible expenditure should be. 1.5 Submissions on the possible approach outlined in this paper are welcomed. Submissions should be made by 1 December 2006 and be addressed to: Business Tax Review, Skills Training Tax Credits C/- Deputy Commissioner Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington New Zealand Or email: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “Business Tax Review: Skills Training Tax Credits” in the subject line. 1.6 There is a very tight reporting timeframe, and extensions to the deadline are not feasible. Late submissions cannot be considered. 1.7 Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for officials and other government agencies to contact those making submissions to discuss their submission, if required. 5 1.8 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their publication. The withholding of particular submissions on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. Those making a submission who feel there is any part of it that should be properly withheld under the Act should indicate this clearly. SUMMARY OF A POSSIBLE APPROACH TO A SKILLS TRAINING TAX CREDIT Definition The tax credit should focus on training that leads towards nationally recognised qualifications that demonstrate transferable skills. The definition of “eligible training” would be: “Training linked to qualifications on the National Qualifications Framework”. Eligibility could also be extended to cover qualifications that are not on the National Qualifications Framework (NQF), but which meet some defined criteria and are recognised international or industry standards. The tax credit should be targeted to training at or below level 4 on the NQF. The tax credit would not be restricted to particular types of training providers, particular sizes or types of organisations, particular industries or occupational groups or particular skill/subject areas. Eligibility criteria The tax credit would be available to all employers who invest in the training of their employees. Eligible expenditure The following expenditure would be eligible: • tuition and course fees; • payments for instructors, training advisers and assessment specialists; • purchase price of training materials, including supplies, textbooks and manuals; and • rental fee for training facility, equipment or other assets required for training. 6 The following expenditure would be ineligible: • travel and accommodation for training purposes; and • the cost of wages and salaries paid to employees while they participate in training, including the cost of wages and salaries paid to backfill their positions while they are training. 7 CHAPTER 2 Definition of “eligible training” Objective of the skills training tax credit 2.1 The government’s objective for the skills training tax credit is to strengthen incentives for employers to invest in the skills and productivity of their employees, through formal training that leads to recognised qualifications. A highly skilled and adaptable workforce is essential to New Zealand’s economic future in an increasingly competitive international economy that has seen rapid growth in the supply of skilled workers across the globe. 2.2 New Zealand has an increasingly mobile workforce where people change jobs frequently during their working lives. New Zealand employers increasingly understand the importance of investing in the skills and productivity of their employees. But without government support and incentives, employers may tend to under-invest in generic and transferable skills because they cannot expect to capture the full future benefits of the resulting increases in productivity. Employers also have inadequate incentives to ensure that their employees’ training levels lead toward substantial, recognised qualifications that are relevant to their longer-term career interest and that will be recognised and valued by other employers. 2.3 The government already supports the development of a skilled workforce through its funding of both pre-employment and employment-related education and training. The National Qualifications Framework (NQF) and quality assurance and accreditation systems provide an infrastructure that ensures the quality of training toward consistent, recognised qualifications that both employers and employees can have confidence in. 2.4 A skills training tax credit would work alongside the government’s other funding and regulatory activity by providing direct financial benefits to employers who invest in developing the skills of their employees. 2.5 The tax credit should focus on training that leads towards nationally recognised qualifications that demonstrate transferable skills (rather than firm-specific skills). 2.6 We have considered a range of options for a workable definition of eligible training that meets the government’s objectives for the tax credit. The definition of “eligible training” would need to: • be inclusive in its coverage of training that is both industry-recognised and transferable and of the greatest public benefit; and • ensure the tax credit is simple for employers to understand and administer; 8 • minimise tax planning opportunities; and • manage the potential fiscal risks. A definition of “eligible training” 2.7 Our preferred approach is to use the NQF as the core for the definition of eligible training. Under that definition, “eligible training” means: “Training linked to qualifications on the National Qualifications Framework”. 2.8 The main advantages of limiting the scheme to qualifications on the NQF include: • It provides certainty for employers as it offers a clear and objective test for eligibility using an existing information source. • It focuses on training activities that are based on industry standards and lead to transferable skills. • It allows a smaller unit of training to be recognised – unit standards rather than whole qualifications. 2.9 There are some disadvantages in limiting the tax credit to training linked to qualifications on the NQF. The main disadvantage is that the NQF is not complete in its coverage. Some sectors of the economy have limited coverage by Industry Training Organisations and by NQF qualifications. Many quality-assured and government-funded courses are not included on the NQF (including all university courses and local qualifications developed by polytechnics, private training establishments and Wananga). Much in- house training that is currently undertaken by employers is also not linked into the NQF, although it is often possible to do so). 2.10 Eligibility could therefore be extended to cover qualifications that are not on the NQF, but that are recognised international or industry standards that meet some defined criteria (such as a requirement that the training involves structured assessment and supervision by qualified trainers). This would require a trade-off between the breath of coverage and administrative complexity. We consider this trade-off worthwhile because of the broader coverage of the tax credit and it is our preferred approach. 2.11 If eligibility were extended beyond the NQF, examples of eligible training should include training towards certification by international standard-setting bodies or certification in proprietary technologies that have widespread application (such as licensed software). 9 2.12 Training towards non-NQF qualifications would need to be approved, as eligible for the tax credit by a nominated authority, so that taxpayers would have the required level of certainty. Both employers and training organisations would be able to apply for the non-NQF training to be approved and it would only need to be approved once. Targeting the tax credit to particular levels of qualifications 2.13 The NQF has 10 levels – 1 being the least complex and 10 the most. Levels depend on the complexity of learning. Levels 1 to 3 are of approximately the same standard as senior secondary education and basic trades training. Levels 4 to 6 approximate advanced trades, technical and business qualifications. Levels 7 and above approximate advanced qualifications of graduate and postgraduate standard. 2.14 Eligibility for the tax credit could be limited to particular levels on the NQF, enabling the tax credit to offer stronger incentives for training less-skilled workers. The options are to offer the tax credit for training at any level of the NQF, to target training at NQF levels 1 to 4 (encompassing most national certificates) or target training at NQF levels 1 and 2. 2.15 Training in advanced skills and for higher-level qualifications is also essential for the economic development of New Zealand. This training includes building management capability in firms and ensuring that New Zealand workers have the high level skills required in advanced technology industry. Evidence suggests that employers’ current investment in training tends to be focused on their more skilled employees and management staff. Targeting the tax credit by qualifications levels is less likely to result in inequities between taxpayers. A tax credit targeted toward recognised transferable qualification and lower-level skills is more likely to encourage investment in areas where firms are currently under-investing. 2.16 Therefore targeting training at or below level 4 on the NQF is our preferred approach because it would allow a more substantial credit to be offered to the employers who invest more in the training of their less skilled employees. Submission points Submissions are sought on the following matters in particular: • Do you agree with the proposed definition of eligible training as “training linked to qualifications on the National Qualifications Framework”? • Would the benefits of a wider definition of eligible training outweigh the disadvantages of the added complexity and likely compliance and administrative costs? • Do you agree with the idea of targeting the tax credit at or below level 4 on the NQF (encompassing most national certificate qualifications)? 10 CHAPTER 3 Who should qualify for the tax credit? 3.1 The eligibility criteria should, in our view, be as inclusive as possible, taking into account the variety of businesses and sectors that invest in the training of their employees. The criteria should be easily understood, and when applied, they should not impose unnecessary compliance and administration costs. 3.2 Training tax credits exist in Ontario, Quebec, several US states, Austria, Italy, Luxembourg, Brazil, Chile and Japan. They are generally targeted more narrowly than the tax credit outlined in this paper – focussing to some degree on certain types of employees (such as youth, retraining displaced workers, low-skilled workers and the unemployed), on or certain sectors (such as manufacturing or construction). Employer 3.3 The tax credit should apply to all employers 1 who invest in the training of their employees so that it is equitable across all regions, sectors, occupations and entities. This means that employers who are not in business – such as government departments, universities, schools and charities – would also qualify for the tax credit. 3.4 Given the policy objective of the tax credit to strengthen incentives for employers to invest in the training of their employees, we do not consider it desirable to limit the tax credit to employers of a certain size or particular industry. Even so, tax planning opportunities might arise as a result of a wide definition of “employer” – for example, as in the case of family members employed by a closely held company. On this basis, specific rules could be introduced to ensure that the credit was not abused in this situation and others involving partnerships, trusts, associated persons, shareholder/employees and independent contractors. A consequence of these rules is that the self-employed would also be excluded from the tax credit. Employee 3.5 The options are to limit the definition of an “eligible employee” 2 by hours of work, length of employment, residence and citizenship or not impose any limits. The preferred option is for the tax credit to apply to all employees. While this means that specific groups with greater training needs are not targeted (with what could be a higher rate of tax credit), targeting problems can be addressed through the government’s funding of tertiary education and training, enabling a more inclusive approach to the tax credit that reduces compliance costs. 1 An employer is defined in the Income Tax Act as a person who pays or is liable to pay a source deduction payment. A source deduction payment in defined in section OB 2(1) and includes a payment by way of salary or wages, an extra pay or a withholding payment. 2 An employee is defined in the Income Tax Act as a person who receives or is entitled to receive a source deduction payment. 11 Submission points Submissions are sought on the following matters in particular: • Do you support a definition of “eligible employer” that covers all employers or should it be limited to only those employers in business? • Do you support the definition of “employee” outlined here, including the exclusion of the self-employed? • Do you think that the credit should apply to eligible training undertaken by government departments, universities, schools and charities? 12 CHAPTER 4 Eligible expenditure 4.1 This chapter specifies the expenditure that, in our view, would attract the tax credit. General principles 4.2 The tax credit should apply only to direct training expenditure that is deductible under the Income Tax Act or would be deductible if the employer was in business. This requirement would exclude expenditure of a private and domestic nature. Timing 4.3 The tax credit should be available only in the year in which the deduction for direct training expenditure is allowed. In other words, the timing rules in the Act should apply to the credit. Definition of “eligible expenditure” 4.4 Only the direct training expenditure incurred by an employer would be eligible for the credit. Direct training expenditure would be limited to: • tuition and course fees; • payments for external instructors, industry training organisations, assessment specialists and in-house trainers; • purchase price of training materials, including supplies, textbooks and manuals; and • attributable costs of training facilities, equipment or other assets required for training. Exclusions from “eligible expenditure” 4.5 There are a lot of risks associated with having a wide definition of eligible expenditure. They include subsidising expenditure that may have a private and domestic component and fiscal cost. To reduce these risks, we propose the following exclusions: • travel and accommodation for training purposes; and • the cost of wages and salaries paid to employees while they participate in training, including the cost of wages and salaries paid to backfill their positions while they are training. 13 4.6 We recognise that by excluding the cost of wages and salaries paid to employees while they participate in training, including the cost of wages/salaries paid to backfill their positions while they are training, we are excluding the major cost faced by smaller employers who try to invest in the training of their employees. For these employers it is often hard or impossible to find temporary people who are able to cover their employees’ positions while they are being trained. Standard costs 4.7 A wider definition of eligible training costs could be used when standard costs are used for travel, accommodation and wages and salaries paid to employees while they participate in training and those paid to backfill their positions while training. Capping the amount of tax credit that could be claimed 4.8 A wider definition of eligible training costs could also be used, including travel, accommodation and wages and salaries paid to employees while they participate in training and those paid to backfill their position while training, when the tax credit is capped at the employee level. Caps are a common feature of training tax credits in other jurisdictions, to limit fiscal risk. Apportionment of expenditure 4.9 Employers could be required to apportion expenditure when the total amount of eligible expenditure could not be determined from an invoice – for example, where an invoice for eligible training includes tuition, accommodation and travel and these costs are not separated out. To reduce the risk of abuse, when an invoice was separated out, there would be an obligation on the training provider to ensure that the invoice was reasonable. For example, at the extreme end, it would not be considered reasonable for an invoice for a $1,000 that includes tuition, out of town accommodation and travel to have $995 allocated to tuition and $5 allocated to accommodation and travel. 4.10 Employers could not claim a tax credit for any eligible training expenditure that employees are required to reimburse or pay for, either directly or indirectly or through use of forfeiture of salary, annual leave or other compensable time. This would prevent situations where an employer may have claimed a tax credit but, in reality, the employee has actually incurred the cost of the eligible training for a private purpose and to prevent salary sacrifice. 14 Submission points Submissions are sought on the following matters in particular: • Do you agree with the definition of “eligible expenditure” outlined here and the exclusions? • Would you prefer a tax credit that is not subject to a per-employee cap, but has a narrow definition of “eligible expenditure”, or would you prefer a capped tax credit that covers a broader range of training-related expenditure? • Would you prefer a wider definition of “eligible training” that includes standard costs used for travel, accommodation and wages?

The adoption of IFRS has been allowed from 1 January 2005, and is mandatory for financial reports for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007. 1.2 The adoption of IFRS will introduce significant changes into New Zealand’s financial reporting practices. Because current taxation policies are linked to some accounting practices, changes to the accounting practices brought about by IFRS need to be reviewed to ensure that tax law continues to meet the needs of modern business practice and to maintain the principles and integrity of the tax system. Scope 1.3 This issues paper considers the tax policy issues that could arise from the adoption of IFRS within the context of existing policy on alignment between tax and accounting. As such, it does not propose to consider a comprehensive alignment of tax legislation with accounting standards at this time. 1.4 The paper examines areas where tax legislation is currently aligned with specific accounting standards or generally accepted accounting practice (or GAAP), with a view to ensuring that taxpayers can continue to use the accounting standards under IFRS for taxation purposes. Other possibilities for alignment are also considered because significant changes have been introduced in these areas under IFRS that seem relevant for taxation purposes. 1.5 The technical discussions in this paper relate to the trading stock rules, research and development expenditure, financial arrangements, revenue recognition, GAAP and implementation issues that could arise from possible legislative changes. 1.6 The paper suggests a number of changes to the relevant tax rules. After analysis of submissions on the suggested changes, we will make formal recommendations to the government on what we think the resulting legislative changes should be. 1.7 We expect to recommend that the changes be included in a bill to be introduced in mid-2007, with legislation likely to be enacted in late 2007. The changes would generally apply from the 2008-09 income year. 2 Summary of suggested changes Trading stock • Trading stock valuation rules should continue to be aligned with the valuation methods adopted for accounting purposes, but references to FRS-4 and FRS-1 should be amended to refer to NZ IAS 2 and NZ IAS 8, respectively. • Primary sector taxpayers who are using NZ IAS 41 should be allowed to use the simplified cost method and market value method, designed for low turnover traders, to value their trading stock. Research and development • The core standards governing the accounting treatment of R&D expenditure under NZ IAS 38 are substantially the same as those under FRS-13 and should continue to be appropriate for taxation purposes. • Minor legislative amendments will be necessary to adjust the references to FRS- 13 and to remove references to paragraphs 5.4 and 2.3 of FRS-13 because those standards are no longer applicable under IFRS. However, it may be necessary to ensure that immaterial R&D expenditure that has been written off for financial reporting purposes is subjected to the appropriate standards in NZ IAS 38 before they are allowed as a deduction for taxation purposes. Financial arrangements • The financial arrangement rules should continue to define and govern the taxation of financial arrangements, including derivatives, for taxation purposes. Taxpayers should be able to continue to use the methods prescribed under the financial arrangement rules to calculate the income and expenditure of financial arrangements. • Taxpayers will be allowed to use the financial reporting methods under NZ IAS 39 for taxation purposes, subject to adjustment for credit impairments unless the impairments are deductible under section DB 23. • The tax treatment of bad debts should not be aligned with the treatment of credit impairments under NZ IAS 39. A deduction for credit impairment should be allowed for taxation purposes only if the bad debt deductibility rules in section DB 23 of the Income Tax Act 2004 are satisfied. • The IFRS accounting treatment of fees that are an integral part of a financial arrangement is similar to that of the current taxation rules in substance. Therefore the tax treatment should be explicitly aligned in legislation with financial reporting treatment. • Derivative instruments that are part of a cash flow hedge or a hedge of net investments in a foreign operation should continue to be taxed under the financial arrangement rules, as they are presently. • The underlying items in a fair value hedge should continue to be taxed as if they were not part of a hedge. 3 Revenue recognition • Revenue recognition for taxation purposes should continue to follow the accounting practice, which has been formalised in NZ IAS 18, although Inland Revenue should monitor the interpretation and application of the standards for taxation purposes. • The recognition of warranty income as a separate revenue stream and the spreading of warranty income over the term of the warranty under NZ IAS 18 is an appropriate revenue recognition approach for taxation purposes. • Legislative amendment may be required to ensure that provisions for warranty costs, which could arguably still be deductible in accordance with the principles established in CIR v Mitsubishi Motors NZ Ltd, 1 are not deductible at the time of sale if the revenue from warranty contract is deferred under NZ IAS 18. • Legislative amendment will be necessary to recognise as income the amount of previously unrecognised income that has been recorded directly to the shareholders’ funds during the transition year. Generally accepted accounting practice – GAAP • The use of “generally accepted accounting practice” in tax legislation is ambulatory in that as GAAP changes with the adoption of IFRS for financial reporting purposes, these changes will be accepted for taxation purposes. Legislative changes to deal with unexpected tax consequences arising from these provisions after the adoption of IFRS should be considered where appropriate. Implementation dates • The suggested legislative changes should generally apply from the 2008-09 income year, and Determination G30 should be withdrawn at the same time. Taxpayers would be able to make any adjustments required as a result of suggestions in this issues paper in the 2008-09 income year. 1.8 Submissions are sought on these suggestions and on other IFRS-related issues.

This approach follows largely from the recommendation of the Consultative Committee on the Taxation of Income from Capital 2 in that: “...(c) the Act should provide greater statutory detail on problem areas of tax accounting without attempting to provide a complete code for the calculation of income. Essentially, the extent of statutory detail is a matter of degree, however, the Committee believes that the quantum of taxable income should be determined by Parliament as far as is practically possible; (d) the tax system should not rely on undefined principles of commercial accountancy practice as a primary basis for the calculation of income, however such practice should be a reference point for the Commissioner and the Courts in the interpretation and application of the Act.” 2.2 The possible alignment of tax legislation and accounting practices was considered when detailed rules were developed for taxation purposes. To date, this alignment has occurred in a number of circumstances. Accounting standards have been explicitly incorporated into the tax legislation for trading stock and research and development expenditure. Tax legislation also relies on GAAP for revenue recognition and refers in many instances to “generally accepted accounting practice”, commercial practice or acceptable commercial practice. 2.3 Although New Zealand reporting practices have generally been harmonised with international accounting standards, the adoption of IFRS may be a significant change for some New Zealand businesses. In particular, the emphasis on fair value accounting for financial assets is a significant shift from the historical cost approach adopted by financial institutions for their loans. IFRS also introduces hedge accounting rules into New Zealand financial reporting practices. 2 Consultation Committee on the Taxation of Income from Capital, Tax Accounting Issues, (Wellington, February 1991), para 1.4. 6 2.4 We think it is inappropriate to consider a comprehensive alignment of tax legislation with accounting standards at this time. Nevertheless, the paper later examines areas where tax legislation is currently aligned with specific accounting standards or generally accepted accounting practice, and considers other possibilities for alignment such as the use of fair values and hedge accounting rules. Unintended consequences arising from IFRS 2.5 The adoption of IFRS may result in significant changes to the financial statement positions of the reporting firms. These changes may have flow-on consequences for taxation purposes. The areas where tax legislation and accounting practice are directly or indirectly aligned will need to be monitored to ensure that the alignment envisaged in the tax legislation continues to be appropriate under IFRS. Further legislative changes may be necessary to deal with any consequences arising from the adoption of IFRS that were not intended by the legislation. Compliance issues 2.6 The adoption of IFRS means significant changes to the accounting practices of some taxpayers and may have some tax compliance implications. When taxpayers rely on accounting profits as a starting point for their tax calculation, for example, the adjustments that they will have to make to arrive at the appropriate tax calculation may be significantly different under IFRS. 2.7 The tax compliance implications of the adoption of IFRS are still being worked through by New Zealand businesses and tax practitioners. Appropriate administrative responses to the compliance issues in some areas will be considered by the Inland Revenue as these implications become better understood. 7 Chapter 3 TRADING STOCK VALUATION 3.1 The trading stock valuation rules for taxation purposes are aligned with the accounting treatment in FRS-4 in a number of ways. Trading stock is valued at “lower of cost or market selling value” for taxation purposes under sections EB 6 and EB 11 of the Income Tax Act 2004, in accordance with FRS-4. Under section EB 7, cost is determined on the basis of the first-in first-out cost method or the weighted average cost method, which is consistent with the methods required under FRS-4. Furthermore, when the cost method is used for taxation purposes, the taxpayer must include and allocate costs under GAAP so that the value of the trading stock is not materially different from the value obtained by applying FRS-4. 3.2 Discounted selling price and replacement value (see sections EB 9 and EB 10) are the other two methods of valuation allowed under the trading stock rules if these methods are also used by the taxpayer for financial reporting purposes. When a taxpayer uses the market selling value for tax purposes, some expected costs of selling can be deducted from the market selling value provided that the taxpayer also did the same when calculating net realisable value for financial reporting purposes. 3.3 Under the new standards, NZ IAS 2 will replace FRS-4. The two are substantially the same with regards to the basic valuation methods, so the adoption of IFRS should not affect the ability of taxpayers to use the existing valuation methods under the current taxation rules. Potential problems with the valuation of agricultural produce are considered below. 3.4 We suggest that trading stock valuation rules continue to be aligned with the valuation methods adopted for accounting purposes, and that references to FRS-4 be amended to refer to NZ IAS 2. Consistency and disclosure requirement 3.5 Sections EB 12 and EB 22 of the Act require trading stock to be valued consistently from one period to another and to all items of a similar nature for taxation purposes. Any change in trading stock valuation method should also be disclosed. This consistency and disclosure requirement is linked to the standards that normally apply for financial reporting purposes under FRS-1. 3 3 The same consistency and disclosure requirement applies to the use of cost-flow methods for excepted financial arrangements under section ED 1 for a person who complies with generally accepted accounting practice. 8 3.6 With the adoption of IFRS, reporting entities must comply with the consistency requirements in NZ IAS 8 for financial reporting purposes. It requires an entity to apply its accounting policies consistently for similar transactions, other events and conditions. However, the entity can change its accounting policy if the change is required by a “Standard” or an “Interpretation” or results in the financial statements providing reliable and more relevant information. When changes have been made, the entity is required to disclose the impact and nature of these changes. 3.7 The consistency and disclosure requirements under NZ IAS 8 are substantially the same as those under FRS-1. We believe that these requirements should continue to apply to trading stock valuation for taxation purposes. 4 Legislative change will be required to replace references to NZ IAS 8 with references to FRS-1. 3.8 Low turnover traders who do not comply with GAAP have to meet a different consistency requirement defined in sections EB 22(2) to EB 22(4). The Act also specifies a consistency requirement for taxpayers who do not comply with GAAP, to ensure that they use a consistent cost-flow method to value their excepted financial arrangements. These requirements are not affected by the adoption of IFRS. Agricultural produce 3.9 Under IFRS, taxpayers in the primary sector may be required to use the fair value method under NZ IAS 41, instead of NZ IAS 2, to value their harvested trading stock. Primary sector producers who are required to use the fair value method under NZ IAS 41 may be unable to comply with some of the existing requirements under the trading stock rules for taxation purposes. Primary sector producers 3.10 For taxation purposes, the trading stock valuation rules may apply to harvested crops (that is, once the crops have been severed from land). Primary sector producers (who are not low turnover traders) can, in theory, use cost (sections EB 6 to EB 8), discounted selling price (section EB 9), replacement price (section EB 10) or market selling value (section EB 11) to value their trading stock. However, they may not be able to meet the legislative criteria in sections EB 6 to EB 11 in practice if they are required to adopt NZ IAS 41, since the standards require harvested crops to be valued at fair value for accounting purposes, while the tax rules assume that the accounting methods are primarily cost-based. 4 The same standard should also continue to apply to the use of cost-flow methods for excepted financial arrangements. 9 Primary sector producers who are low turnover traders 3.11 The problem is alleviated if the primary sector producers are low turnover traders. Low turnover traders have more flexibility in the methods they can use to value their trading stock for taxation purposes. In addition to the methods available in sections EB 6 to EB 11, they may, in theory, use any of the low turnover valuation methods prescribed in sections EB 15 to EB 21 or the special method for low value trading stock in section EB 23. 3.12 However, if low turnover traders have to comply with IFRS and use a fair value method to value their trading stock for accounting purposes, the valuation methods available under the taxation rules are cost under sections EB 16 and EB 17 or market value method in section EB 21. 3.13 We suggest that when primary sector taxpayers are using NZ IAS 41 for financial reporting purposes they be allowed to use sections EB 16 and EB 17 or EB 21 to value their harvested trading stock for taxation purposes. 3.14 The taxation treatment of livestock and unharvested crops should not change. Summary of suggested changes • Trading stock valuation rules should continue to be aligned with the valuation methods adopted for accounting purposes, but references to FRS-4 and FRS-1 should be amended to refer to NZ IAS 2 and NZ IAS 8, respectively. • Primary sector taxpayers who are using NZ IAS 41 should be allowed to use the simplified cost method and market value method, designed for low turnover traders, to value their trading stock. 10 Chapter 4 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURE 4.1 The tax rules for research and development (R&D) expenditure under section DB 26 determine when it is deductible for taxation purposes with reference to the accounting standards in FRS-13. Tax deductions for R&D expenditure are allowed for taxation purposes if they are recognised expenses under paragraphs 5.1 or 5.2 of FRS-13, and under paragraph 5.4 of FRS-13 for capital development costs that exceed the recoverable amount. The same standards of deductibility apply, for taxation purposes, to R&D expenditure that has been written off as immaterial under FRS-13. 4.2 Small R&D expenditure ($10,000 or less) is also deductible if the amount is not material for financial reporting purposes, and the taxpayer has recognised the amount as an expense for financial reporting purposes. Implications of IFRS 4.3 With the adoption of IFRS, FRS-13 is superseded by NZ IAS 38, an accounting standard on intangibles which also governs the accounting treatment for R&D expenditure. NZ IAS 38 provides that expenditure on R&D is recognised as an expense when it is incurred unless the criteria for recognition of development expenditure as an intangible asset are satisfied. Although these criteria, which are listed in paragraph 57 of NZ IAS 38, are worded differently from those in paragraph 5.3 of FRS-13, the new standards are largely consistent with the old standards. 4.4 As the core standards governing the accounting treatment of R&D expenditure under NZ IAS 38 are substantially the same as those under FRS- 13, we suggest amending the relevant legislation to clarify that the relevant standards in NZ IAS 38 will determine the tax treatment of R&D expenditure for taxation purposes. Cost in excess of recoverable amount and immaterial amount 4.5 When an intangible asset arising from the development phase qualifies for recognition under NZ IAS 38 it is measured initially at cost. As such, capital development costs in excess of recoverable amounts that could be written off under paragraph 5.4 of FRS-13 are no longer available under NZ IAS 38. References to paragraph 5.4 of FRS-13 should therefore be removed from section DB 26 of the Act. 11 4.6 References to the materiality standards in paragraph 2.3 of FRS-13 also need to be removed because it is no longer applicable under NZ IAS 38. Under IFRS, the materiality standards, which are in NZ IAS 1, apply only to disclosures and presentation of items in the financial reports. However, it may be necessary to retain the existing provision in the Act without a specific reference to accounting standards, to ensure that R&D expenditure that has been written off for financial reporting purposes as immaterial is still subjected to the appropriate standards in NZ IAS 38 before it will be allowed as a deduction for taxation purposes. Summary of suggested changes • The core standards governing the accounting treatment of R&D expenditure under NZ IAS 38 are substantially the same as those under FRS-13 and should continue to be appropriate for taxation purposes. • Minor legislative amendments will be necessary to adjust the references to FRS- 13 and to remove references to paragraphs 5.4 and 2.3 of FRS-13 because those standards are no longer applicable under IFRS. However, it may be necessary to ensure that immaterial R&D expenditure that has been written off for financial reporting purposes is subjected to the appropriate standards in NZ IAS 38 before they are allowed as a deduction for taxation purposes. 12 Chapter 5 FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS 5.1 Under IFRS, the accounting treatment for financial assets and financial liabilities is governed by NZ IFRS 7, NZ IAS 32 and NZ IAS 39. These standards introduced a number of significant changes to the accounting practice in this area. Impact of IFRS on the financial arrangement rules 5.2 The financial arrangement rules in Subpart EW of the Income Tax Act 2004 set out a number of spreading methods to ensure that all income and expenditure of a financial arrangement are spread over the term of the arrangement. These spreading methods are set out in section EW 14. The principles governing the operation of these spreading methods are set out in the 1997 government discussion document The Taxation of Financial Arrangements: “ 1.9 When the financial arrangement is entered into, the expected cashflows (and other consideration) are used in determining what amounts of income or expenditure will be spread. Thus expected income or expenditure is spread over the term of the financial arrangement, but all income or expenditure, expected or unexpected, is taken into account on maturity or disposal. The exception to this is where a market valuation method of spreading is used, because this brings unexpected income or expenditure to account at each balance date. 1.10 The rules provide the methods by which the income and expenditure are spread over the term of the arrangement. The primary method is the yield to maturity method. Other methods are acceptable if they produce a result which is not materially different from yield to maturity, are commercially acceptable, and are used by the taxpayer in its financial reporting. Other spreading methods, including an annual market valuation, are permissible provided certain criteria are met.” 5.3 The primary method of spreading income and expenditure under the financial arrangement rules is the yield to maturity method. Some taxpayers are also allowed to choose the straight line method or the market valuation method. 5.4 Taxpayers who cannot use one of the primary methods can use a method prescribed in a determination or its alternative (section EW 20) provided the specified criteria are met. For example, accrual determinations set out an expected value approach for calculating income and expenditure of financial arrangements denominated in foreign currency and forward contracts. If a determination is not available, taxpayers can use the method they have adopted for financial reporting purposes (section EW 21). If the financial reporting method is not an option because a taxpayer does not prepare 13 financial accounts, the taxpayer may use a method that conforms to commercially acceptable practice (section EW 22) provided the method allocates a reasonable amount of income and expenditure to each income year over the term of the financial arrangement. 5.5 The financial arrangement rules should continue to govern the taxation of financial arrangements, including derivatives, for taxation purposes. Taxpayers can continue to use the methods prescribed under the financial arrangement rules to calculate income and expenditure of financial arrangements. These methods include the expected value approach prescribed in the accrual determinations for financial arrangements denominated in a foreign currency and forward contracts. Financial reporting methods 5.6 With the adoption of IFRS, the financial reporting treatment of financial assets and financial liabilities is now governed entirely by NZ IAS 39. Most financial assets and financial liabilities that are within the scope of NZ IAS 39 are brought to tax under the financial arrangement rules. Although changes in the accounting practice brought about by NZ IAS 39 should not affect the tax treatment of these financial assets and liabilities in principle, compliance costs could be reduced if the methods used for accounting purposes could also be used for taxation purposes. 5.7 NZ IAS 39 requires gains and losses of financial assets and financial liabilities that are within the scope of the financial arrangement rules for taxation purposes to be reported using either the fair value method or the effective interest method. A derivative instrument, for example, must be measured initially and subsequently at fair value. The gains or losses resulting from fair value movements are recognised in the income statement every year. 5 Even so, many financial assets such as loans and receivables and held-to-maturity investments and financial liabilities that are not held for trading purposes can continue to be accounted for on the basis of the effective interest method. Consistency with the financial arrangement rules 5.8 The accounting methods prescribed in NZ IAS 39 are generally consistent with the principles of financial arrangement rules for taxation purposes. The effective interest method adopted under NZ IAS 39 is similar to the yield to maturity method prescribed under the financial arrangement rules. 6 In addition, the fair value method under NZ IAS 39 is substantially the same as the market valuation method when there is an active market for the financial instrument or when there is a reliable market price. 5 The exceptions are available for sale financial assets and instruments in a cash flow hedge relationship when their gains and losses are recorded directly in shareholders’ equity. 6 The effective interest method calculates and allocates the interest income and expense of a financial asset or a financial liability over the relevant period based on the effective interest rate, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts over the life of the asset or liability to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. 14 5.9 We suggest that when the financial reporting methods under NZ IAS 39 require taxpayers to report gains and losses of financial assets and financial liabilities in the income statement using either the fair value method or the effective interest method, they should be able to use the same method for taxation purposes. However, as discussed earlier, credit impairment adjustments required under NZ IAS 39 will be allowed for taxation purposes only if the bad debt deduction rules in section DB 23 are satisfied. 5.10 This suggestion should result in considerable simplification for taxpayers in the way they account for their financial assets and financial liabilities that are within the scope of both NZ IAS 39 and the financial arrangement rules in the Act. Impairment of financial assets and bad debts 5.11 The accounting treatment for credit impairments of financial assets is governed by NZ IAS 39. 7 5.12 Allowance must be made for credit impairments for all financial assets under NZ IAS 39 if there is objective evidence that impairment losses have been incurred. Impairments can arise from an event or a combination of events that impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial assets. These events include significant financial difficulty on the part of the issuer or obligor, a breach of contract and other subjective assessments about when it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation. Impairments can also be claimed when there is observable information indicating a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows from a group of financial assets even if the decrease can not yet be identified with the individual financial assets in the group. 5.13 The reporting entity is required to recognise impairment losses, which can include both specific and general provisions for doubtful debts, in its income statement for financial reporting purposes. Any subsequent reversal is recognised as income in the income statement. Tax treatment of credit impairments 5.14 The deductibility of bad debts for taxation purposes is entirely governed by section DB 23. General provisions for doubtful debts that have been recorded for financial reporting purposes are currently not deductible for taxation purposes. Specific provisions for bad debts are allowed as deductions for taxation purposes only if they have been written off as bad and the relevant requirements of section DB 23(2) through (5) are satisfied. 7 Interest revenue (including interest accrued on impaired debts) is recognised in accordance with NZ IAS 18 if it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the entity. When uncertainty arises with respect to an amount already included in revenue, the uncollectible amount is recognised as an expense, rather than as an adjustment of the amount of revenue originally recognised. 15 5.15 Bad debts associated with financial arrangements are allowed if the taxpayer satisfies the provisions in section DB 23(2) or DB 23(3). Section DB 23(2) allows bad debts as deductions if they have been written off and the amount is attributable to the income of the financial arrangement. Section DB 23(3) allows bad debt deductions for amounts owing under a financial arrangement when the taxpayer is in the business of dealing in or holding the financial arrangements. These restrictions are consistent with bad debt deductibility rules in Australia. 8 Aligning tax and accounting treatment of credit impairments 5.16 The process of recognising credit impairments under NZ IAS 39 is triggered by the objective evidence that credit impairments have occurred. Nevertheless, the process of determining the nature and quantum of credit impairments involves subjective judgement. Officials believe that allowing deductions for provisioning of credit impairments creates inconsistency in the tax legislation because tax legislation does not normally allow deductions for items that are in the nature of provisions. 5.17 A complete alignment of the tax treatment of bad debts and the accounting treatment of credit impairments under NZ IAS 39 would mean that all provisions for doubtful debts would become deductible for taxation purposes. Although NZ IAS 39 provides a more stringent approach to the provisions of bad and doubtful debts than current accounting practice does, this new approach will still carry significant revenue costs that are unacceptable to the government. We estimate that the revenue costs to the government of a complete alignment between accounting and tax treatment of credit impairments would be over $250 million in the transition year if the complete alignment applied only to the major banks in New Zealand. The full revenue costs would be higher if the complete alignment applied more generally to all taxpayers. 5.18 While these revenue costs could be limited by specifying an upper limit for provisions for doubtful debt allowed as deductions for taxation purposes, we do not consider this to be a good policy design. Specifying an upper limit for allowable bad debts for taxation purposes would encourage taxpayers to take the full amount as deductions regardless of the commercial reality. The upper limit would also unduly penalise taxpayers who have actual bad debts that exceed the limit for commercial reasons. 5.19 We do not suggest any changes to the existing tax treatment for bad debts. An impairment of a financial asset that has been written off under NZ IAS 39 should be allowed as a deduction for taxation purposes only if the bad debt deduction rules in section DB 23 are satisfied. 8 Australia allows a bad debt deduction if there is a physical write-off of the debt and either the debt has been brought into account by the taxpayer as assessable income or the taxpayer is in the business of lending money. 16 Tax treatment of fees 5.20 For taxation purposes, all contingent fees paid in relation to a financial arrangement are subject to the financial arrangement rules and spread over the term of the financial arrangement. Non-contingent fees that are payable whether or not the financial arrangement proceeds are excluded from the financial arrangement rules and are brought to tax as these fees are “derived” or “incurred”. 5.21 For financial reporting purposes, fees that are an integral part of the effective interest rate of a financial instrument are generally treated as an adjustment to the effective interest rate. Even so, fees that are integral to a financial instrument that is measured at fair value are recognised for accounting purposes when the instrument is initially recognised. 5.22 Our view is that the accounting treatment of fees that are an integral part of a financial arrangement is similar in substance to the current taxation rules for contingent fees. We suggest replacing the distinction between “contingent” and “non-contingent” fees for taxation purposes with the distinction between “integral” and “non-integral”. Legislative amendment is likely to be necessary to align the tax treatment explicitly with the financial reporting treatment. 5.23 Other fees that are not an integral part of a financial arrangement will continue to be subject to tax in accordance with the general taxation principles of “derivation” and “incurred”. As discussed in the next chapter, fee income will almost always be brought to tax as revenue based on the accounting treatment. Hedge accounting rules 5.24 A derivative instrument that has been designated as a hedge and is an effective part of a hedging relationship is subject to special hedge accounting rules under NZ IAS 39. Special accounting treatment also applies to the underlying items being hedged. 5.25 Under the hedge accounting rules, income and expenditure on both the hedge instrument and the hedged risks of the underlying items in a fair value hedge are recognised on an unrealised basis. For example, when a firm commitment to purchase raw materials in US dollars is the underlying hedged item of a fair value hedge, the fair value movements in the US dollar commitment are recognised as profits or losses on a fair value basis, together with the derivative instrument even though the costs of the raw material can not be recognised yet. 17 5.26 On the other hand, hedge accounting rules also allow the deferral of income or expenditure on hedge instruments that are part of the cash flow hedges and hedges of net investments until the underlying hedged risks are realised. For example, if a forward rate agreement is used to hedge a cash flow interest rate risk on a floating rate loan, the gains or losses on the forward rate agreement can be deferred until the underlying cash flow risk impacts the income statement. 5.27 The hedge accounting rules are intended to create a matching effect for the accounting treatment of the hedge instrument and the underlying hedged item. This is achieved for accounting purposes by accelerating the recognition of gains or losses on the hedged items in a fair value hedge and deferring the recognition of gains or losses on the “effective” component of a cash flow hedge or a hedge of net investments in a foreign operation. Current taxation rules for items in a hedge relationship 5.28 Current taxation rules do not incorporate hedge accounting rules. Gains or losses on the derivative hedge instruments are reported in accordance with the financial arrangement rules in the Act. Gains or losses on the hedged items are reported in accordance with general taxation principles on income and expenditure, unless these items are within the scope of the financial arrangement rules. This means that there is no explicit matching of gains and losses arising from items in a hedge relationship. Nevertheless, a degree of matching is already possible for taxation purposes, since many items in a hedge relationship are within the scope of the financial arrangement rules. 5.29 Table 1 summarises the accounting and tax treatment of different types of hedge relationships. Matching will result from the application of the financial arrangement rules for examples 3, 4, 5 and 7, when the hedge instruments and the underlying hedged items are all financial arrangements under the financial arrangement rules. Matching is also possible in example 2 when a forward currency contract is used to hedge a forecast purchase of raw materials if the taxpayer elects to use Determination G 14B. Determination G 14B effectively allows the gains and losses on the forward currency contract to be deferred until the contract matures. As the financial arrangement rules already provide for methods of calculating income and expenditure that could create a matching effect for items in a hedge relationship, specific hedge accounting rules are unnecessary in these circumstances. 18 Table 1: Accounting and taxation treatments of different hedge relationships Examples Hedge Instrument 9 Hedged Items 10 Accounting Treatment under NZ IAS 39 Taxation Treatment 1 Derivative Instrument – forward currency contract Firm commitment to purchase capital asset in USD 11 Fair value hedge – FX risk No matching 2 Forward currency contract Forecast raw material needs (e.g. oil) in USD Cash flow hedge – FX risk Matching possible under Determination G14B 3 Currency swaps Fixed rate FX Loans Fair value hedge – FX risk Matching possible within the financial arrangement rules 4 Interest rate swaps Fixed rate domestic loans Fair value hedge – interest rate risk Matching possible within the financial arrangement rules 5 Interest rate swaps Floating rate domestic loans Cash flow hedge – interest rate risk Matching possible within the financial arrangement rules 6 Currency futures (USD) Investments in USD shares Fair value hedge – FX risk No matching 7 Currency futures (EURO) Investments in fixed rate, held to maturity debt securities in EURO 12 Fair value hedge – FX risk Matching possible within the financial arrangement rules 5.30 For taxation purposes, no matching is possible in examples 1 and 6 when a derivative instrument is used to hedge a firm commitment to make a purchase of capital asset or a portfolio of share investment. The lack of matching in these scenarios for taxation purposes exists because although the hedge instrument is within the financial arrangement rules, the taxation of the hedged item depends on whether the underlying item is on revenue or capital account. Hedge accounting rules cannot be introduced for taxation purposes unless we are also prepared to review these fundamental tax principles that govern New Zealand taxation laws. 9 A derivative instrument (except for written options) can be a hedge instrument if it has been designated as a hedge and is an effective part of a hedging relationship. Internal hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment in the consolidated financial reports – an instrument needs to involve an external third party to be a hedge instrument. A hedge instrument can be designated partly as a hedge instrument – for example, 50% of the notional amount may be designated as a part of hedge relationship. Two or more instruments can be viewed in combination and jointly designated as the hedging instrument. In addition, a single hedge instrument can be designated as a hedge of more than one type of risk subject to designation and effectiveness requirements. 10 Hedged items can be a single (or a group of) asset(s), liability, firm commitment, highly probable forecast transaction or net investment in a foreign operation. Groups of assets and liabilities are to be aggregated only if the individual assets or liabilities in the group share the risk exposure that is designated as being hedged. A financial asset or financial liability may be a hedged item with respect to the risks associated with only a portion of its cash flows or fair value provided that effectiveness can be measured. 11 A non-financial asset or non-financial liability can be designated as a hedged item for foreign currency risks. If the asset is hedged for all other risks, it has to be designated in its entirety. 12 A held to maturity investment cannot be a hedged item with respect to interest rate risk or prepayment risk. However, a held to maturity investment can be a hedged item with respect to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk. 19 Complexity of hedge accounting rules 5.31 International experience suggests that if hedge accounting rules are adopted for taxation purposes, the guidelines governing the designation and effectiveness of hedges in NZ IAS 39 will have to be modified and incorporated into the tax legislation. 13 These guidelines are necessary to limit the opportunities for taxpayers to abuse the hedging rules for taxation purposes. However, the rules are very complex and could increase compliance and administrative costs significantly. Is legislative change needed? 5.32 Hedge accounting rules modify the character and timing of items in a hedge relationship. Gains and losses on derivative instruments that are part of a cash flow hedge or a hedge of net investments in a foreign operation can be deferred under the hedging rules. This treatment is inconsistent with the purpose of the existing financial arrangement taxation rules, which require expected income and expenditure on a derivative instrument to be spread over the term of the arrangement. 5.33 We consider that all derivative instruments, including those that are part of a cash flow hedge or a hedge of net investments in a foreign operation, should be brought to tax under the financial arrangement rules. 5.34 Hedge accounting rules will also allow a taxpayer to accelerate income and expenditure on the underlying hedged items that have been designated as part of a fair value hedge. Established tax principles, such as the non-taxation of capital gains and taxation timing based on realisation, will be modified to the extent that the gains and losses are arising from an item that has been designated as an underlying hedged instrument in a fair value hedge. 5.35 Our view is that it is inappropriate to modify the general taxation principles for items in a hedge relationship. The hedged items in a fair value hedge should continue to be taxed as if they are not part of a hedge. Views sought 5.36 The hedge accounting rules are not considered to be appropriate for taxation purposes because they will change the taxation treatment for financial instruments and any items being designated as a hedged item. If hedge accounting rules were incorporated into the tax legislation, they would also likely be accompanied by a set of tax guidelines on the designation and effectiveness of hedges, which are very complex and have significant compliance and administration costs. Furthermore, there are already comprehensive financial arrangement rules that allow many items that could be in a hedge relationship to be brought to tax consistently. 13 To qualify for hedge accounting rules under NZ IAS 39, the hedge instrument has to be designated at the inception of the hedge, the hedge has to be assessed and determined to be actually “highly effective” on an ongoing basis, and the hedge effectiveness can be reliably measured. Furthermore, the reporting entity needs to determine the proportion and period in which to assign the derivative as a hedge instrument. For details of the guidelines, see paragraphs 71 to 84 and paragraph 88 of IAS 39. 20 5.37 Submissions are sought on specific instances where the application of general tax principles and the financial arrangement rules to a hedge relationship lacks clarity and thus adversely affect the effectiveness of a taxpayer’s hedging strategy. Special rules may be considered for these special circumstances, when appropriate, to ensure that hedged relationships are not unduly distorted by the tax rules. Summary of suggested changes • The financial arrangement rules should continue to define and govern the taxation of financial arrangements, including derivatives, for taxation purposes. Taxpayers should be able to continue to use the methods prescribed under the financial arrangement rules to calculate the income and expenditure of financial arrangements. • Taxpayers will be allowed to use the financial reporting methods under NZ IAS 39 for taxation purposes, subject to adjustment for credit impairments unless the impairments are deductible under section DB 23. • The tax treatment of bad debts should not be aligned with the treatment of credit impairments under NZ IAS 39. A deduction for credit impairment should be allowed for taxation purposes only if the bad debt deductibility rules in section DB 23 of the Income Tax Act 2004 are satisfied. • The IFRS accounting treatment of fees that are an integral part of a financial arrangement is similar to that of the current taxation rules in substance. Therefore the tax treatment should be explicitly aligned in legislation with financial reporting treatment. • Derivative instruments that are part of a cash flow hedge or a hedge of net investments in a foreign operation should continue to be taxed under the financial arrangement rules, as they are presently. • The underlying items in a fair value hedge should continue to be taxed as if they were not part of a hedge. 21 Chapter 6 REVENUE RECOGNITION 6.1 Current taxation rules governing the derivation of income are complex, although a number of guidelines on how and when income is derived have been established by case law. The income derivation rules in taxation are based primarily on normal accounting principles and commercial practice. 6.2 With the adoption of IFRS, the accounting principles on revenue recognition are formalised in NZ IAS 18. The standards provide that revenue is recognised when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity and these benefits can be measured reliably. These revenue recognition criteria are substantially similar to the principles in the New Zealand Statement of Concepts, which preceded IFRS. As such, the new standards should continue to be appropriate for taxation purposes. 6.3 We do not suggest introducing any legislative change to the revenue recognition principles for taxation purposes at this stage. Inland Revenue is monitoring the application and interpretation of NZ IAS 18 for taxation purposes, and further legislative changes may be considered at a later stage. 6.4 In general, the recognition of expenditure for taxation purposes is governed mostly by statutory provisions in the Act. As such, the adoption of IFRS is not expected to have a similar impact on the treatment of expenditure for taxation purposes. Treatment of warranties 6.5 In CIR v Mitsubishi Motors NZ Ltd, 14 the Privy Council held that “\[a\]s the term “profits or gains” is not defined, these words must therefore bear their ordinary meaning as understood by a businessman or accountant”, but an expenditure may be deducted only if it has been incurred. Further, estimated warranty costs were held to be deductible at the time of sale because the defects that manifested themselves within the warranty period were presumed to be present at the time of sale and are not a contingency. 6.6 Under NZ IAS 18, any identifiable service fees included in the price of a product must be deferred and recognised as revenue over the period during which the service is performed. The amount of revenue deferred will include the expected costs of the services and a reasonable profit on those services. 6.7 As such, any fees and profits associated with a warranty contract provided together with a sale must be recognised over the term of the warranty. This new method of recognising warranty income is broadly consistent with the approach taken by the Court of Appeal in Mitsubishi Motors New Zealand Limited (1994) 16 NZTC 11,099. 14 CIR v Mitsubishi Motors NZ Ltd \[1995\] 3 NZLR 513. 22 6.8 We see the recognition of warranty income as a separate revenue stream and the spreading of warranty income over the term of the warranty contract under NZ IAS 18 to be an appropriate approach for taxation purposes. 6.9 The adoption of NZ IAS 18 appears to have modified the principles of revenue recognition that underpin CIR v Mitsubishi Motors NZ Ltd. In CIR v Mitsubishi Motors NZ Ltd, the Court held that provisions for warranty costs should be deductible for taxation purposes at the time of sale on the presumption that warranty revenue had been recognised. As NZ IAS 18 requires the deferral of warranty income, and if this approach is accepted for taxation purposes, then provisions for warranty costs should not be deductible at the time of sale. 6.10 Legislative amendment may be required to ensure that provisions for warranty costs, which could arguably still be deductible in accordance with the principles established in CIR v Mitsubishi Motors NZ Ltd, are not deductible at the time of sale if the recognition of revenue from warranty contract is deferred under NZ IAS 18. Revenue recognition during transition to IFRS 6.11 Financial reporting entities are required to restate their financial statements in the year of transition from the old accounting standards to IFRS. For example, a company that moves to IFRS for its 2008 year will have to prepare the 2008 financial statements using IFRS and restate the 2007 financial statements. The “change” from old to new accounting standards is dealt with by way of adjustments directly to shareholders’ funds. 6.12 If a stream of income had been recognised under the old accounting practice in 2007 but IFRS requires that income to be recognised in 2008, the income which would have been reported in 2007 and subjected to tax then could be reported again in 2008 as an adjustment in the year of transition. This income should not be subject to tax again in 2008, and section BD 3(6) of the core provisions of the Income Tax Act 2004 ensures that does not occur. 6.13 The opposite problem could also happen during the transition year. If an income stream that would have been recognised in 2008 under the old accounting practice is now recognised in 2007 under IFRS, the income stream is simply not recognised as income by the company in either 2007 or 2008. This amount will be recorded directly in the shareholders’ funds as part of the transitional adjustment. This income should be taxable in the year of the transition. 6.14 Even though the revenue recognition for taxation purposes continues to follow the accounting approach generally, legislative amendments will be necessary to recognise as income the amount of previously unrecognised income recorded directly in the shareholders’ funds as part of the transition year. 23 Summary of suggested changes • Revenue recognition for taxation purposes should continue to follow the accounting practice, which has been formalised in NZ IAS 18, although Inland Revenue should monitor the interpretation and application of the standards for taxation purposes. • The recognition of warranty income as a separate revenue stream and the spreading of warranty income over the term of the warranty under NZ IAS 18 is an appropriate revenue recognition approach for taxation purposes. • Legislative amendment may be required to ensure that provisions for warranty costs, which could arguably still be deductible in accordance with the principles established in CIR v Mitsubishi Motors NZ Ltd, 15 are not deductible at the time of sale if the revenue from warranty contract is deferred under NZ IAS 18. • Legislative amendment will be necessary to recognise as income the amount of previously unrecognised income that has been recorded directly to the shareholders’ funds as part of the transition year. 15 CIR v Mitsubishi Motors NZ Ltd \[1995\] 3 NZLR 513. 24 Chapter 7 GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRACTICE – GAAP 7.1 The Income Tax Act 2004 uses “generally accepted accounting practice” (GAAP) repeatedly. It is defined in section OB 1 as the definition in section 3 of the Financial Reporting Act 1993. 16 This definition has not changed as a result of IFRS, so it does not need to be amended. 7.2 What constitutes GAAP, however, will change as a result of the adoption of IFRS. For example, internally generated goodwill will no longer be recognised, thereby reducing reported total assets. On the other hand, IFRS requires the recognition of derivative assets and liabilities at their fair values and deferred tax assets/liabilities that were previously not recognised. It is therefore likely that IFRS will have a mixed impact on the balance sheet items. 7.3 In our view, the changes brought about by IFRS should automatically be incorporated into the tax legislation where the concept of GAAP is relied upon. In these circumstances, the use of GAAP in the tax legislation is ambulatory – meaning that its definition in tax law will change in accordance with changes in GAAP’s constituent parts. Therefore no changes to tax legislation are suggested. The use of GAAP in tax legislation and IFRS 7.4 A number of tax consequences may arise as a result of IFRS because financial items reported for financial reporting purposes under GAAP are used in tax legislation. 7.5 An example of tax consequences that could arise from the adoption of IFRS is in the application of thin capitalisation rules. 17 Thin capitalisation rules limit interest deductions that some taxpayers can claim for taxation purposes if their debt level exceeds a certain level. The maximum amount of allowable debt under these thin capitalisation rules is determined with reference to an asset base calculated under GAAP. As such, the adoption of IFRS is likely to affect the maximum amount of interest that will be allowed for these entities. 16 Financial statements and group financial statements comply with GAAP only if they comply with applicable financial reporting standards, and in relation to matters for which no provision is made in applicable financial reporting standards and that are not subject to any applicable rule of law, accounting policies that (i) are appropriate to the circumstances of the reporting entity; and (ii) have authoritative support within the accounting profession in New Zealand. 17 Different thin capitalisation rules apply to foreign controlled entities in general, New Zealand banking groups and conduit relief companies. The concept of “generally accepted accounting practice” is used in these rules in various ways to determine the maximum allowable debt or minimum capital requirement (for New Zealand banking groups). 25 7.6 Other areas where GAAP has been used in the tax legislation include the following: • The calculation of deemed underlying foreign tax credits and underlying foreign tax credits rely on a tracking account balance and after-income tax earnings that are calculated on the basis of GAAP. • Section CB 27 recognises an excess amount paid when assuming employment income obligations under a sale of business in line with GAAP. • The deferred deduction rule in section GC 29 requires the total deductions, assessable income and cost of property of a group of persons that may be involved in arrangements where money is not at risk to be calculated on a consolidated basis by eliminating intra-group balances in accordance with GAAP. • Taxpayers may use the accounting profits method to calculate their foreign investment fund income under section EX 40 if the net after-tax accounting profits or losses of the fund are calculated under GAAP. • When private insurers maintain reserves for claims relating to events covered by the Accident Insurance Act 1998, section EZ 27 recognises the difference between the closing value and opening value of the reserve as income or deduction, provided that the reserve is calculated having regard to GAAP, generally accepted actuarial practice and the present value of expected future payments. • Section CD 41 requires the un-repatriated income balance, calculated using total shareholders’ funds in accordance with GAAP, of a controlled foreign company to be non-negative. • “Controlled petroleum mining company”, “controlled petroleum mining holding company”, “controlled petroleum mining trust” and “controlled petroleum mining holding trust” are all defined in section OB 1 using net assets as specified in the entities’ account prepared under GAAP. • Sections DP 10 and DB 22 allow certain costs of timber and specified minerals to be deducted when the amount is treated as a cost by the taxpayer under GAAP for financial reporting purposes. 7.7 No legislative changes to these areas appear to be necessary because of the ambulatory nature of the use of GAAP in tax legislation. Even so, submissions are invited from taxpayers on specific areas where the adoption of IFRS may create unexpected tax consequences. Legislative changes to deal with these consequences may then be considered. 26 Chapter 8 EFFECTS OF SUGGESTED IMPLEMENTATION DATE 8.1 We have suggested that possible legislative changes discussed in this paper should generally apply from the 2008-09 income year, given that amending legislation is unlikely to be introduced until the middle of 2007, and unlikely to be enacted until late 2007. Determination G30, which was issued as a transitional measure to deal with the tax consequences of IFRS, will be withdrawn at the same time. 8.2 This general application date may not be suitable for some changes because taxpayers who are early adopters of IFRS (whose earliest IFRS balance date could be 31 December 2005) may have filed their tax returns by then. In that case, they could make any required adjustments – such as recognising previously unrecognised income recorded directly in the shareholders’ funds during the transition year – in the 2008-09 income year. 8.3 Taxpayers may also have adopted a specific interpretation of the existing tax legislation that may not be consistent with officials’ interpretation or the suggestions contained in this issues paper. Transitional arrangements will be considered for taxpayers in this position. 8.4 Submissions are sought on areas where earlier application of the changes suggested in this issues paper may be helpful or where transitional arrangements may be required. Summary of suggested changes The suggested legislative changes should generally apply from the 2008-09 income year, and Determination G30 should be withdrawn at the same time. Taxpayers would be able to make any adjustments required as a result of suggestions in this issues paper in the 2008-09 income year.

The business of life insurance is the assumption or transfer of risk from the policyholder to the life office. It is also financial intermediation, which is the management of someone else’s money with the goal of increasing its value. Both of these activities have significant implications for the New Zealand economy and, as with any business, the tax rules under which the life insurance industry operates is a key determinant in its efficient operation – both for the taxpayer concerned and for the wider economy. 2. The ideal life tax system: • is transparent; • integrates as much as possible with actuarial and accounting principles; • is robust while being flexible enough to incorporate new ways of doing business; • minimises costs of compliance; • simplifies administration and collection of tax; • imposes tax in the same way as comparable activities – the “neutrality principle”; • is equitable between shareholders in life offices, policyholders, and the government; and • reflects commercial reality. 3. The commercial, regulatory, accounting and savings environments have changed markedly since the current life tax rules were enacted in 1990. New products and ways of doing business have emerged and a number of apparent anomalies and inequities in the rules have been identified. The current rules are considered complex and expensive to comply with and administer. Furthermore, the proposed Portfolio Investment Entity (PIE) rules currently exclude life insurance and so, without some legislative action, those taxpayers who save via life insurance will be taxed in a way that is disadvantageous relative to other savings vehicles. 4. For these reasons, it is timely to review the principles governing life insurance taxation, with a view to designing tax rules that are closer to the “ideal” than the present rules are. Accordingly, on 17 August 2006, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue announced that such a review was to take place. 2 5. The review will focus on amending the “life insurance rules” contained in Subparts CR and EY of the Income Tax Act 2004 and the related provisions dealing with imputation credit accounts and policyholder credit accounts. This paper outlines the various issues involved in designing rules for the taxation of shareholders and policyholders in life offices and then sets out design alternatives as bases for discussion. 6. While there are a number of corporate compliance issues that relate to the taxation of life insurance companies – such as thin capitalisation, the conduit tax rules and applicability of the consolidation rules, given the tight time frames involved, these matters will not be dealt with in the current review. The ultimate life tax rules that result from the review may have flow-on effects on other tax provisions, but they will be considered as they arise. Timing 7. Ensuring that life insurance is included in the PIE rules at the time of their proposed implementation date (1 October 2007) will require the relevant draft legislation to be included in the taxation bill planned for introduction in the first half of 2007. However, even if appropriate rules are included in that bill and have an effective date of 1 October 2007, because the legislation is unlikely to be enacted before 1 October 2007, life offices would have to take the commercial risk of changing products, IT and accounting systems and pricing on the basis of draft legislation. 8. Inclusion of changes in the early 2007 taxation bill is a “best endeavours” target, the achievement of which will largely rest on officials and the life industry agreeing with the policy and content of the rules by January 2007. Consequences of not meeting this deadline include delays in integrating life insurance with the PIE rules. Purpose of this paper 9. This paper presents a high-level discussion, written by policy officials, of the underlying issues facing life insurance tax and suggests some broad design options. It is designed to facilitate the consultation process, which is expected to be a dynamic and continuing one. Accordingly, officials welcome feedback on the paper, though formal written submissions are not required. It is expected that as discussion between officials and industry stakeholders develops, there will be further papers on specific issues. 10. Life insurance is a complex and arcane business in which, life insurers excepted, relatively few professionals and commentators specialise. As there are very tight time frames to meet legislative deadlines, the paper is focussed towards those with a specific interest in life insurance. Readers without a reasonably sound knowledge of life insurance tax and accounting may find some parts of this paper challenging. 3 OPERATION OF A LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY Introduction 11. The taxation of life insurance covers a number of activities by (and also among) a variety of stakeholders. The modern life industry differs significantly from that existing in 1990, when the current tax rules were enacted. By way of background, therefore, it is useful to outline the various entities whose activities and relationships should be considered in the life tax review: 1 Life offices 12. Life insurance companies are companies that carry on a life insurance business and are registered under the Life Insurance Act 1908 to write life insurance policies. As at 1 July 2006, 44 entities had lodged deposits with the Public Trustee to be life insurers, though not all of them write life insurance policies for the public, while a small number are re-insurance companies. 1 The diagram is adapted from “Taxation of Life Insurance Companies” Module 1; ATO PDP(2003). • Financial arrangements • Equities (and deemed equities) • Real property Premiums Life office Share capital Shareholders Policyholders Investable funds Bonuses and claims to policyholders and dividends to shareholders Fees taken out at any stage in the process 4 13. A life insurance policy is a policy on the life of a person. A classic definition is: The contract of life \[insurance\] may be further defined to be that in which one party agrees to pay a given sum upon the happening of a particular event contingent upon the duration of human life in consideration of a smaller sum or certain equivalent periodical payment by another. 2 14. A life insurer is distinguishable from a general insurer in that: • A general insurer will write a policy for a limited term, often one year. • At the end of the term the policy becomes due for renewal. • The insurer is not bound to renew, and if the risk is found to be unacceptable, the insurer can decline to renew. • On renewal, the insurer can alter the premium and terms of cover. Life insurance tax rules have developed differently from those applying to general insurance. However, as discussed later, there is a degree of cross-over with general insurance in terms of products offered by life insurers. 15. A life office applies the money it receives from premiums: • to ensure it has sufficient amounts invested to meet future life policy liabilities (including income and disability claims); • to pay administrative expenses, including commissions to agents; • to pay bonuses to policyholders (though life offices often retain reserves from earnings in positive years in order to cover periods of negative earnings); and • to make a profit. 16. Fees and charges in a life office can take many forms and structures. They can be implicit (meaning they cannot be separately identified) or explicit. Premium- based fees such as entry fees are deducted on payment. Shareholders 17. When the current life insurance rules were enacted, most of the large insurers in New Zealand were mutual entities – meaning they were owned by their policyholders, and premium contributions as well as retained investment income built up over the years contributed to the capital base of the life insurer. All of the large insurers are now limited liability companies (though some operate in New Zealand as branches of foreign companies), predominantly ultimately owned by foreign companies. Equity in the life insurer comprises shareholder equity, though IFRS 4 (at paragraph 4.1.2) notes that a life insurer will have policyholder equity if it has life insurance operations in a jurisdiction which permits retained profits to be unallocated between policyholders and 2 Bunyon C J (1914), Law of Life Assurance (5 th Edition). 5 shareholders, and the policyholder’s portion is yet to be determined. Many of the large life offices operate within financial services groups of companies that generally provide a wide range of savings products and, in some cases, general insurance. Some subsidiaries of banks are now involved in writing life policies. New Zealand and overseas trends indicate further consolidation of financial services providers. Policyholders 18. The policyholder (insured) accepts a proposal by the life office by purchasing a policy. Depending on the terms of the policy, a policyholder may have the right to: • terminate the policy (or simply stop paying the premiums); • transfer the ownership of the policy to another party; and • receive benefits within the scope of the policy terms and conditions 19. The net assets of a life insurer are owned by the insurer, not the policyholder. The rights of the policyholder are by way of contract with the life insurer and do not extend to specific assets. The economic policyholder “ownership” rights in a non-mutual are generally reflected in “unvested policyholder liabilities”. Nevertheless, many unbundled products give their policyholders rights to a group of assets which are very close to the right of beneficial ownership, and therefore pull back all investment profits 20. There are no accurate statistics for the number of policyholders in New Zealand. 3 Products sold by life insurance companies 21. Life policies can be single premium contracts or regular premium contracts. Single premium contracts require one lump sum payment which is made at the beginning of the contract, whereas the regular premium contract requires consistent payment throughout the life of the policy. The regularity of the payment may vary from fortnightly to yearly premium payments. 3 For completeness, the other stakeholders in the life insurance relationship are as follows and, at this stage, are unlikely to be affected by the review: • Insurance agents: Arrange policies between customer and the life insurance companies and receive a payment on commission for their services from the life insurance company. Common overseas are brokers who advise on and arrange insurance cover for clients and are paid commission by their clients. • Regulatory bodies: These are a number of bodies used to regulate life insurers including: – Insurers carrying on insurance in New Zealand are required to lodge a monetary deposit with the Public Trustee. – The primary supervisory role is the Government Actuary, who is part of the Insurance and Superannuation Unit of the Ministry of Economic Development. The industry is represented by the Investment Savings and insurance Association of New Zealand (ISI). 6 22. In discussing the common types of products sold by life insurance companies it is important to keep in mind that: • Not every life insurance company will offer every product described here. • With competition, the industry is continually evolving with regards to the development of products. • While the following descriptions seem to distinguish clearly between different product types, in reality, the boundary lines are often blurred. Hybrids of two or more products are common. 23. The following is a list of some of the different types of products sold by life insurers. They can be broken down into pure risk products and those that include a savings element: Risk with savings element • Whole of life insurance – The policy guarantees payment of the sum insured, while also providing a share in the life office’s profits. The policy can be cashed in or surrendered before maturity, although the time when the policy is cashed in will determine what amounts are received (which are generally at the discretion of the insurer). Premiums are level throughout the life of the insured. When the policy is a participating policy (see paragraph 24), the holder is entitled to bonuses that add to the amount of the benefit and are also received on death or maturity of the policy. • Endowment insurance – These have features similar to those of a whole of life policy but the sum insured is payable upon the survival of the insured life to a certain age or date, or upon prior death. As with whole of life policies, there is considerable actuarial involvement as a result of the interplay between the insured’s mortality and investment return. • Investment bonds – These provide a savings vehicle in an accumulation- style product, either with capital guarantees for both the accrued balance and the declared interest, or backed by equity assets. • Unit-linked policies – These generally provide a savings vehicle in which the policyholder shares directly in returns of the asset pool, with no guarantee of performance. As such, the investment risk is borne by the policyholder rather than the life insurance company. The appeal to the policyholder is that he or she can benefit in a transparent way from the investment returns while having life cover. The appeal to the insurer is that it ties up less equity and resources than traditional policies do. In some countries whole of life policies are unit-linked. • Annuities – These allow policyholders to draw down on their retirement savings by paying a large sum to the life office upfront and then receiving regular payments until they die. In many ways, they are the opposite of a policy offering life cover. 7 Risk (generally no savings element) • Term-life insurance – The sum insured is payable only if death occurs during a specified period of time. Premiums rise with age. • Trauma insurance policies – This is a product that provides cover in the event of a certain trauma (such as a severe accident or a specified medical condition). • Disability insurance – This is an income or lump sum benefit based on insured’s normal income in the event of a defined permanent or temporary disability 24. A common way of describing life products is whether they are participating or non-participating policies. A participating policy (also known as a “with profits policy”) is a policy entitled to participate in distributions of profit – as most whole of life and endowment policies are. Conversely, a non-participating policy (also known as a “without-profits policy”) does not participate in distributions of profit, examples being term life insurance and most unit-linked policies. 25. Until the 1980s, the most common products offered by life insurance companies were the traditional whole of life and endowment products,. Since the current life rules have been in operation, term insurance business has increased from being less than 10 percent of total industry premiums to now over 50 percent. 26. This relative decrease of traditional policies and increase in risk insurance arises for several reasons. Traditional policies are in “sunset mode” with little (and for some companies, no) new business being written. Generally, New Zealanders’ debt levels have increased, and term insurance covers this increase (though, it has to be said, not to the levels of other countries). Product development driven by consumer demand for greater clarity in life insurance products and a desire to unbundle, or split out, the various risk, savings and expenses components of a contract have resulted in several new types of products – for example, combining life protection with income or disability insurance. 27. Financial services companies also “cross-sell” products to achieve similar or (because of a more competitive commission structure) more efficient savings packages. For example, a customer could purchase term insurance and also contribute to a unit trust or superannuation scheme as an alternative to saving via a traditional life policy. Implications for life tax review 28. If life insurance was to be taxed in the same way as other New Zealand businesses, premiums would be taxable income, net investment earnings taxable income and claims deductible expenses. Under such rules a deduction is not usually allowed for reserves and provisions unless they meet strict conditions that have been set out in case law. Tax would be applied at the corporate rate against the net result. 8 29. This simple relationship cannot be applied to life insurance, however. The long- term nature of most policies makes it difficult to match income and expenses appropriately. In addition, tax needs to be paid not only on income generated by the life office on behalf of shareholders, but also in respect of income attributable to policyholders. There are difficulties in determining the relevant mix of savings return, savings and risk intermediation, and risk pooling (all of which can give rise to income) that is inherent in a life policy. And when taxing policyholders, consideration has to be given as to the appropriate rate. For example, traditional product policyholders tend to be overly represented in the age group of those retired or approaching retirement, and hence are typically at the 21% effective marginal tax rate. 30. How New Zealand currently deals with the tax issues is discussed in the next section. CURRENT TAX RULES Introduction 31. The current life insurance tax rules are based on the company tax model and aim to tax the shareholder income and policyholder income in a life office on a consistent basis. The “life office base” (LOB) is directed at the income of the life insurer (and also a re-insurer) as a whole (that is, both shareholder and policyholder). It consists of gross income (including realised gains on equities and other property but not premiums from policyholders or life reinsurance claims) less expenses (with the exception of reinsurance premiums and claims credited to policyholders) plus underwriting income. Underwriting income arises from three sources: • profit on mortality; • profit on termination risks; and • premium loading (to reflect underwriting expenses and profit) deemed to be 20 percent of the net cost of pure risk insurance and 1 percent of reserves released on death in the case of life annuities. 32. Formulas for these three items are laid down in legislation, and although there is scope for actuarial judgement, Inland Revenue and members of the life industry agreed to a common reserving basis in 2002, in respect of the elements of the formulas related to the reserve. 33. Income accruing to policyholders is taxed to the life insurer on a proxy basis under the policyholder base (PHB) and is calculated by a formula equal to the increase in Reserves plus Benefits paid plus Underwriting income less Premiums. The tax base is grossed-up by (1- the LOB tax rate) to arrive at the before-tax amount necessary to provide the after-tax benefit implicit in the policy. Tax paid on the LOB generates imputation credits which can then be used to meet the PHB liability (thus avoiding double taxation) or as tax credits on dividends paid to shareholders. 9 34. The current rules have some theoretical appeal as they tax underwriting income and savings income on an accruals basis and are arguably more efficient, for example, than taxing on a payments (claims) basis, as occurs in the United States. However, the system is actuarially complex and involves high compliance and administrative costs. There is not a full transparency with the insurer’s financial accounts, and a number of technical weaknesses with the rules have been identified over the years. The life insurer as proxy for the taxation of investment income on behalf of policyholders is also not wholly consistent with current policy settings. Technical problems with current rules Definition of “life insurance” 35. “Life insurance” is defined in section EY 8 of the Income Tax Act 2004. The general inclusion provisions that benefits provided be contingent upon the death or survival of one or more human beings are derived from case law on the meaning of “life insurance”. Excluded are some forms of sickness or accident insurance relating to death from specific causes. 36. The trend in life insurance products is to combine many features, such as income protection, accident insurance and disability insurance; it is therefore difficult to determine whether the products are life insurance or general insurance or a financial arrangement, or a combination of all three. It is not sound policy to have different tax treatments for similar products based on artificial and arbitrary legislative distinctions. The life insurance rules should provide the appropriate tax environment for current and potential “mixed” products. Underwriting income 37. This problem arises as a result of the premium loading content of underwriting income. Premium loading is intended to bring to tax the profit (net of expenses), being the amount of the premium not expected to be paid out as a claim. Because of the difficultly in identifying the “risk” premium, the premium loading was calculated on a proxy basis of 20 percent (other than for life annuities) of the expected claims, regardless of the risk and savings components of the particular policy. The 20 percent rate represents a “loss ratio” (claims ÷ premiums) of 83.3 percent, and so 16.7 percent of the premium is accrued to cover expenses and life office profit. This was generally appropriate at the time when the rules were enacted but may not reflect current reality when for a pure risk product (term insurance) the average industry loss ratio is possibly much lower. 38. The current premium loading has resulted in tax losses bring generated in both the LOB and PHB for profitable business. In fact, under the relevant formula, greater profitability (through lower than the expected level of claims implicit in the premium loading formula) results in greater tax losses. 10 Annuities 39. The annuity market, while well developed overseas, is very small in New Zealand. A major impediment is that the majority of potential annuitants are on a 21% effective tax rate rather than 33%. Therefore the product is not perceived to offer value for clients. Home equity release 40. Home equity release products (also known as reverse annuity mortgages) are annuities for life, with the premium being due at the end of the term. The PHB tax calculation effectively treats annuity payments as taxable income on derivation, and the full premium payment, when made, is a tax deductible expense. The wait for the premium following the eventual sale of the house is likely to be 10 to 20 or more years, and the deduction is therefore likely to create a taxable loss that cannot be carried back. 41. Some commentators have argued for a diverse home equity release market to provide financial choices that are readily available in comparable countries. Removing the tax disadvantages of such products may encourage the private sector to offer them. Imputation credits 42. The policyholder credit account (PCA) does not have any shareholder continuity requirements, whereas the imputation credit account (ICA) does. A life insurer who is about to undergo loss of credits because of a continuity breach, such as purchase of the shares in the company, can survive the breach by transferring credits from the ICA to the PCA. This also applies to any consolidated or group ICA credits transferred to a consolidated PCA. 43. There does not appear to be a policy problem to the extent the credits represent tax paid on policyholder funds, as the tax paid is effectively a proxy for tax paid by the policyholders, who themselves are not associated with each other or the company (provided it is not a mutual). However, there are arguments going either way whether life insurers should be able to shelter credits arising from tax on shareholders income from continuity breaches. TAXATION OF SAVINGS Introduction 44. The PHB taxes unrealised gains on the basis that because all investments are held on revenue account, the LOB and PHB should, over time, equate when gains are eventually realised (after allowing for the timing effects of bonuses, and allocation of profit to shareholders). However, direct investors are not taxed on unrealised gains on directly held non-foreign investment fund equity investments, and are taxed at their marginal tax rate, not at a proxy rate of tax. 11 45. The proposed PIE rules, which seek tax neutrality for investors between direct investments and intermediated savings vehicles, currently exclude life insurance. The life industry is concerned that if life insurance products are not put on the same taxation footing as other savings vehicles, policyholders will surrender life insurance savings-type policies and not necessarily invest the proceeds in other savings products. Investment return 46. The investment return credited to policyholders that results from the payment of premiums in excess of claims and other costs can be referred to as “inside build- up”. 4 The life insurer invests cash from premiums to match the nature and duration of the liability – for example, long-term liabilities are matched with long-term assets. 47. The savings component in participating policies earns an “implicit” return. Inside build-up is substantial in whole of life policies and endowment plans, and some term life insurance can also have inside build-up as a result of pre-funding of benefits. Inside build-up is less of an issue for policyholders who receive an “explicit” return, such as returns from certain non-participating policies. 48. The current rules levy tax on investment income in the hands of the insurer for predominantly practical reasons. However, taxing the policyholder on income as it accrues is the theoretically correct approach. 49. The issue is how to integrate life office investment income into the PIE rules when the income arises from unit-linked and non-unit-linked policies. From a tax policy perspective, these types of products should not have different tax outcomes in the hands of the investor, even though from a practical perspective, there are many difficulties. Unit-linked policies 50. About 20 percent of total policyholder assets in New Zealand life offices are held in unit-linked policies. Although there are many variations, in practice, unit-linked policies are generally pooled in a manner similar to that of unit trusts. The premium purchases units in an unfixed fund, the unit price of which is recalculated each business day to reflect the investment performance of the assets in the fund. Accordingly, the value of the units can rise and fall, and the investment performance is not guaranteed. The life company is remunerated by a fee which is commonly included in the unit price calculation or, in some cases, by cancelling units. 4 An algebraic formulation of inside build-up is described in Taxing Insurance Companies OECD Tax Policies Studies No.3 at page 83. 12 51. In previous meetings with officials, industry representatives have argued that there is effectively a transparency between the actual performance in the unitised fund and tax paid, and that the investment income can be traced to individual policyholders. The ISI and some life offices have suggested to officials that unit-linked funds can therefore be relatively easily integrated into the PIE rules. Non-unit-linked policies 52. Traditional life policies have no direct mechanical relationship between the benefits paid to any policyholder and the income and gains accruing to the life office over the duration of the policy. While it is possible eventually to identify the total investment return attributed to a particular policyholder, it is not possible to know how it is made up, or in which particular years it accrued. A life insurer may distribute retained profits to policyholders by means of a reversionary bonus. This bonus is a guaranteed addition to the policyholder sum insured. In addition, terminal bonuses may be received on death or maturity of the policy. In practice, though, earnings on an investment fluctuate widely. Accordingly, if all earnings were to be distributed as a bonus in the year they were earned, the life insurer would find itself losing heavily in times of negative returns. As a result, life insurers “smooth” returns to policyholders by retaining revenue from earnings in positive years in order to cover periods of negative earnings. 53. Also, in the early years of the policy, the premium in excess of the cost of pure insurance can cover only a part of the expenses, mainly commissions, of the policy. Accordingly, the insurer must use some of its surplus to pay the agent. The insurer borrows funds from the policyholder and its shareholders/ participating policyholders so that it can pay for the commission. It expects to recover that surplus with interest through future premium receipts and then to begin to build up capital with respect to the policy. 54. These timing issues create difficulties for the computation of the life insurer’s policy reserve. This is a measure of the life insurer’s future liability with respect to its life insurance policies, determined at the end of the current accounting year and requiring a comparison of the present valuation of future liabilities with the present value of future premium receipts. In terms of the benefit and premium components, the life insurer must use mortality rates to estimate the probability of death each year under the policy. It is more difficult to estimate the future income to pay future benefits. 55. Annual quantification of a policyholder’s investment income therefore effectively requires knowledge of the benefit held on behalf of the policyholder, and the invested portion of premiums received for each policy, whether unbundled or not. This may prove to be a difficult and expensive task. 13 DESIGN OPTIONS Introduction 56. In making a case for tax reform of life insurance, this paper has highlighted the following: • Life insurance products are becoming more, rather than less complex. • The current rules overtax some aspects of life insurance business and undertax others. • The taxation treatment of the savings component of life insurance is inconsistent with the policy underlying the taxation treatment of other entities that carry on similar business. 57. The major reforms therefore have to: • ensure that risk business is taxed on a basis that is not inconsistent with similar businesses – for example, general insurers; and • integrate savings income into the PIE rules. 58. The key to achieving the policy intent is to effectively segregate various types of insurance business within the life company, to ensure taxation of those different businesses at the appropriate (or most practically appropriate) rate and to the account of the appropriate person. Note that this is a function for tax purposes only. It does not and should not impinge on the commercial operation of the life business, and hence on its non-tax regulation. 59. If we consider the life tax rules of other OECD countries, while there are obviously many permutations, there are two broad design options that we can draw on. 5 The first taxes a life office on its full underwriting income and as a proxy for policyholders on their investment income. The current New Zealand LOB/PHB methodology is an example and is therefore the starting point for discussion. The other option leverages off the new life insurance financial accounting standards. Both options assume that the current tax treatment of recipients of life insurance benefits (including exclusion from gross income where applicable) will continue to apply. 60. The options discussed here are high-level approaches to possible ways of taxing life insurance business and are provided to form the basis for discussion and debate. The options should not be considered as viable tax legislation at this stage, and they require considerable refinement before they can be subject to the ordinary tax policy review process. Neither option at this stage is preferred or endorsed by Inland Revenue and the Treasury. Other options that may emerge from the discussion will also be considered. 5 A third broad option, which involves concessionary treatment of particular aspects of life office and/or policyholder taxation, is outside current policy settings and so is not considered. 14 Option 1 Proxy basis 61. Under this option, the current LOB/PHB rules will be maintained but amended to deal with the issues discussed earlier, including: • Determining if the definition of “life insurance” is still appropriate. One alternative is to make the definition of “life insurance business”, “insurance contract” and “life insurance contract” (with related definitions) consistent with the accounting definitions under IFRS. 6 • Establishing premium loading at a realistic level. • Possibly to resolve the home equity release problem, the actuarial reserves in respect of any policy at any time will never be less than any surrender or discontinuance value. • Integrate unit-linked savings products and investment bonds into the PIE rules (although this will be on an elective basis), whereby realised Australasian equities gains, together with any relevant adjustments to other investment income, will be excluded from tax under the LOB. Adjustments to the PHB will ensure no claw-back of the tax benefits. The shareholder portion of investment income is excluded from these adjustments. Tax on the attributed income will be paid by the life office on behalf of individuals at their marginal rate (as with PIEs, to a maximum of 33%). • Non-unit-linked products need to be integrated into the PIE rules. The way to achieve this however, appears problematic. 6 A “life insurance business” is defined in IFRS 4 as “all life insurance contract and life investment contract business conducted by a life insurer” A “life insurance contract” means as an insurance contract or a financial instrument with a “discretionary participation feature” issued by a life insurer. A “discretionary participation feature” is a contractual right to receive, as a supplement to guaranteed benefits (benefits to an investor or policyholder that are not at the discretion of the life insurer), additional benefits: – that are likely to be a significant portion of the total contractual benefits; – whose amount or timing is at the discretion of the issuer; – that are based on either performance of a pool or type of contract; or realised/unrealised investment returns; or the financial performance of the life office, fund, or other entity that issues the contract. An insurance contract is defined as “a contract under which one party (the insurer) accepts a significant insurance risk from another party (the policyholder) by agreeing to compensate the policyholder if a specified uncertain future event (the insured event) adversely affects the policyholder”. The insurance risk has to pre-exist the contract and not be financial in nature. In IFRS 4, financial risk is defined as “the risk of a possible future change in one or more of a specified interest rate, financial instrument price, commodity price, foreign exchange rate, index of prices or rates, credit rating or credit index or other variable, provided in the case of a non-financial variable that the variable is not specific to a party to the contract.” A contract must involve significant risk transfer in order to be classified as an insurance contract. Therefore, for instance, there is an insurance risk when the benefits payable on death (insured event) are significantly higher than the benefit payable on surrender or maturity in a life insurance contract. A “life investment contract” means any contract issued by a life insurer that is not an insurance contract and with a few other exemptions (contained in paragraph 4 of IFRS 4). 15 62. The advantage of maintaining the LOB/PHB methodology is that it is reasonably well understood by life companies and practitioners. Furthermore, maintaining its framework should minimise transitional requirements relative to other more radical reforms. The actuarial reserving calculations (supported by a uniform methodology such as the 2002 Agreement), with the proposed adjustments, may result in a more accurate reflex of taxable income than, arguably does reliance on pure accounting standards. 63. Disadvantages are that it entrenches a tax system which is not directly related to the actuarial and accounting output of the life company and so lacks transparency. The actuarial complexity may be increased by the PIE inclusion (including the income allocation between shareholders and policyholders). A method has to be determined to attribute non-unit-linked investment income equitably to individual policyholders. Also, the taxation of risk products can be seen as ad hoc “band-aid” solutions and may leave the door open for anomalies to arise in the future. 64. Without in any way wanting to limit discussion, we are interested in receiving feedback on the following questions: 1. What features of unit-linked policies might complicate inclusion in the PIE rules and how can these complications be dealt with? For example, how would switching and early termination fees be accommodated in calculating a policyholder’s attributed income? 2. For non-unit-linked savings policies, is it feasible – both technically and practically – under current actuarial and accounting principles to attribute income to an individual policyholder? Consider factors such as: – allocation between shareholders and policyholders; and – how to allocate “smoothed” income to individual policyholders. If the answer is “No”, then are there any pragmatic alternatives, which, although not fully attributing income, give policyholders similar tax benefits to what they would receive under the PIE rules (or different tax consequences to that which they would receive under the current rules)? 3. What are the implications for the industry if non-unit-linked policies cannot integrate with the PIE rules? 16 Option 2 Integrate with financial accounting rules 65. This option replaces the LOB/PHB dichotomy and uses as a starting point the new financial accounting rules for life insurance, IFRS 4, 7 which applies from 2007, (though owing to their international connections, many New Zealand life insurers would probably be “early adopters”). It adopts IFRS 4’s definition of life insurance business 8 (see paragraph 61) and uses the accounting information to ensure that underwriting profits and management fees are taxed appropriately to the life insurer. 66. Premiums paid, claims, underwriting profits and changes in the value of liabilities which relate to risk business would be taken into account in determining taxable income of the life insurer. In general, this means that for risk business the life insurer would be taxed in a manner similar to that of a general insurer. 67. Realised Australasian equity gains and other taxable investment income relating to policyholders would be taxed under the PIE rules to individual policyholders in the same fashion as discussed in paragraph 61, provided solutions regarding the same problems raised earlier with respect to unit-linked and non-unit-linked products can be resolved. 68. The advantages of the financial accounting based approach are: • IFRS 4’s definition of life insurance is a functional one that will clarify the tax treatment of hybrid products. It will also treat products that have no significant life insurance risk, such as some investment-linked products, correctly as deposits in savings vehicles. 7 IFRS 4 reflects “Phase One” of the project by the International Accounting Standards Board to develop the life insurance accounting standard. Phase two is in progress. 8 Adopting IFRS’s definition would result in the financial accounting treatment of the following selected products: Insurance Contract Significant insurance risk Investment Contract Insignificant insurance risk Term life, disability and critical illness X Pure endowment X Whole of life X Life contingent annuities and pensions X Guaranteed investment contract X Unit-linked without significant mortality risk X Savings contract with lapse or expense risk only X Disability and medical X Traditional life and non-life reinsurance X Reinsurance catastrophe bonds with triggers related to the issuer’s losses X Arrangements that do not meet the definition of an insurance contract in IFRS 4 must be accounted for as financial instruments. Embedded derivatives must be accounted for at fair value, with changes in fair value being recorded in the income statement. IFRS 4 exempts derivatives from measurement at fair value if the derivative itself is regarded as an insurance contract. Some insurance contracts contain both insurance and deposit components which, in certain cases, life insurers will be required or permitted to unbundled. However, few products are expected to be affected by the unbundling requirement. The treatment of financial assets is addressed by IAS 39. The recently released officials’ Issues paper “The Tax Consequences of Adopting International Financial Reporting Standards” (September 2006) discusses the taxation policy implications of the changes of accounting for financial arrangements. 17 • Disclosure requirements may lead to consistency of financial accounting and actuarial assumptions within the industry. • Policyholders are taxed at the correct rate on savings products. • Life offices are taxed appropriately. 69. The major disadvantages are that: • Adopting a financial accounting approach requires detailed analysis as to whether the financial accounting rules provide sufficient information to provide a taxation result that meets the policy objectives set out at the beginning of this paper. There is also uncertainty about the full accounting implication of the rules, given their novelty and the unknown impact of Phase Two of their development. • Complex transitional rules will be required. 70. As with the first option, without wanting to limit debate, feedback would be useful on the following issues: 1. The description of the financial accounting based system has been left as general as possible so as not to restrict areas for discussion. Clearly, there are theoretical and practical issues involved in making the information produced by life insurance companies under IFRS consistent with tax policy objectives. For example, to what extent should the accounting treatment take precedence over ordinary tax principles? What are the practical implications, for example, of splitting out the risk component of premiums? Does the accounting standard provide sufficient information? Can we find useful assistance from other jurisdictions (for example, Australia)? 2. In terms of potential transitional issues, how should non-shareholder income related imputation credit balances arising as a result of the LOB being in excess of the PHB be treated? What should happen to LOB and PHB losses carried forward? What other transitional matters need to be considered? 3. The same questions regarding unit-linked and non-unit-linked products and the PIE rules asked under Option 1 are also relevant here. Next steps 71. The desired outcome of discussion on the design options is to arrive at a broad schematic (or schematics) for the new life tax rules. Officials intend a robust discussion of the options, using this paper as the basis for thrashing out issues and arising at workable solutions. It is hoped that from discussions with stakeholders on a regular and intensive basis over a month to six weeks of the release of this paper, broad policy will be developed. From there, a more detailed blue-print of the possible reform will be released for comment.
Countering extreme salary sacrifice Ensuring that employer superannuation contributions are taxed fairly An officials’ issues paper February 2006 Prepared by the Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department and by the New Zealand Treasury First published in February 2006 by the Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department, P O Box 2198, Wellington. Countering extreme salary sacrifice – an officials’ issues paper. ISBN 0-478-27133-6 CONTENTS 1. Improving the SSCWT rules Summary of suggested changes How to make a submission 2. Taxing employer superannuation contributions 3. Salary sacrifice under the progressive scale Suggested amendment to the progressive scale 4. Reducing complexity 1 1. Improving the SSCWT rules 1.1 Employees can arrange their remuneration so that it is taxed at lower rates by “sacrificing salary” in return for increased employer superannuation contributions. Employer superannuation contributions are taxed through Specified Superannuation Contribution Withholding Tax (SSCWT). 1.2 In some circumstances, the SSCWT rules can allow the use of tax rates that are lower than the rates used in the calculation of an employee’s income tax. By arranging to receive much less remuneration as salary or wages, but much more remuneration as employer superannuation contributions, employees can gain access to these lower rates, thereby decreasing their overall tax liability. In some cases, people earning comparatively high levels of income can reduce their tax so that they are paying significantly less than other taxpayers who earn the same or less income. 1.3 Some degree of salary sacrifice can be part of usual employment arrangements, but sometimes it is used for the reason of reducing tax rather than for the purpose of saving. There are a number of tax schemes that use extreme salary sacrifice to minimise the amount of tax that participants pay, behaviour that can undermine the fairness of the tax system. Moreover, there are costs to the economy when taxation rules encourage people to rearrange their affairs for no benefit besides reducing tax. The rules for calculating SSCWT could be changed so that opportunities to engage in extreme salary sacrifice for no reason other than reducing tax liabilities are reduced. 1.4 In addition, the rules for calculating SSCWT have become more complex over time. New rules have been introduced to meet specific needs, which has resulted in four options for calculating tax on employer superannuation contributions, not all of which are being used. The SSCWT rules could be simplified by removing those unused options. 1.5 This issues paper, which has been prepared by officials from the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue and from the Treasury, describes the operation of the SSCWT rules, and suggests ways of countering extreme salary sacrifice. It also suggests reducing the complexity of the rules by reducing the number of ways that SSCWT can be calculated. 1.6 The paper seeks views on the suggested changes before we make recommendations to the government, which has indicated that it would like to see legislative changes included in a taxation bill to be introduced in the first half of 2006. 2 Summary of suggested changes 1.7 The changes suggested in this paper would improve fairness by reducing the opportunity to minimise tax through salary sacrifice, and make the rules simpler by reducing the number of methods for calculating tax on employer superannuation contributions. • Changing the progressive scale. We suggest amending the progressive scale used for calculating SSCWT so that the applicable rate is based on the sum of salary or wages and employer superannuation contributions, and at the same time increase the thresholds for the rates by 15% (over the corresponding effective income tax thresholds), in order to improve fairness. • Reducing complexity. We suggest repealing methods of calculating SSCWT that are not being used, in order to reduce complexity. 1.8 The suggested changes would apply from 1 April 2007. How to make a submission 1.9 We would appreciate receiving any comments on the suggested changes by 15 March 2006. 1.10 Submissions should be sent to: SSCWT and salary sacrifice project C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 Wellington New Zealand 1.11 Alternatively, submissions can be made in electronic from, in which case “SSCWT and salary sacrifice project” should appear in the subject line.

Taxing employer superannuation contributions 2.1 Four methods can be used for calculating tax on employer superannuation contributions. • Flat 33%. SSCWT can be calculated at a flat rate of 33%, applied to all contributions made on behalf of a particular employee. • Progressive scale. SSCWT can be calculated at rates of either 15%, 21% or 33%, applied to all contributions made on behalf of a particular employee, with the applicable rate determined by that employee’s salary or wages in the previous year. When the employee is new, an estimate of current year salary or wages may be used to determine the applicable SSCWT rate. (This method requires the employer to elect that to use it.) Effective rates and thresholds Salary or wages: Effective income tax rate SSCWT rate Up to $9,500 15% 15% on all contributions From $9,501 to $38,000 15% to $9,500, 21% thereafter (average rate = 19.5%). 21% on all contributions From $38,001 to $60,000 19.5% to $38,000, 33% thereafter 33% on all contributions From $60,001 19.5% to $38,000, 33% from $38,001 to $60,000, 39% thereafter 33% on all contributions • Flat 39%. SSCWT can be calculated at a flat rate of 39%. (Using this method requires agreement between the employer and the employee.) • PAYE. Contributions can be added to salary or wages, and taxed through the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system. (This method requires agreement between the employer and employee.) 2.2 The progressive scale was introduced on 1 April 2004 owing to concerns that some employees could be overtaxed on their employer superannuation contributions. Until then, employees earning less than $38,000 salary could be taxed at 33% on their employer superannuation contributions. Using the progressive scale enables those earning less than $38,000 salary or wages to pay SSCWT at a rate that is aligned with the tax rate on their salary or wages. 4 2.3 On 1 April 2000, the top personal income tax rate was increased to 39% while the top SSCWT rate remained unchanged (at 33% under the flat 33% rate method). In the same year, a fund withdrawal tax (FWT) was introduced to counter avoidance. The same top rate of 33% was used for the progressive scale method when it was introduced, in 2004. 2.4 FWT applies if employer contributions are withdrawn early and has the effect of increasing the effective tax rate on withdrawals by 5%. There are a number of exemptions from FWT, which means that not all early withdrawals of employer superannuation contributions are subject to it. 5 3. Reducing tax through salary sacrifice 3.1 By using the progressive scale, employees who sacrifice salary in return for increased employer superannuation contributions can reduce their overall tax. Some reduction in tax by using salary sacrifice has been possible since 1 April 2000, when a new top personal tax rate of 39% was introduced, but the top rate of SSCWT remained at 33%. However, since 1 April 2004, when the progressive scale was introduced, some employees have been able to achieve significant reductions in their tax by using the progressive scale to calculate SSCWT. This has led to some employees rearranging their affairs in order to minimise their tax rather than using employer superannuation contributions as a mechanism for retirement savings. This creates pressure on the integrity, fairness and efficiency of the tax system. Example 1: Extreme salary sacrifice under the progressive scale John earns $100,000 a year in salary. Income tax on his salary is $30,270. John makes an arrangement with his employer so that his salary is cut to $9,500, and the balance of $90,500 is paid as employer superannuation contributions. In the first year of this arrangement, John will pay $1,425 income tax on his salary. His SSCWT rate will be 33%, based on his previous year’s salary, so he will pay $29,865 SSCWT ($90,500 \* .33). His total tax liability will be $31,290. In the second year, John will again pay $1,425 income tax on his salary. However, his SSCWT rate will drop to 15%, so he will pay $13,575 SSCWT ($90,500 \* .15). His total tax liability will be $15,000. Over the first two years of the arrangement, John’s tax liability will be $14,250 less that it would have been if he had received all his remuneration as salary. 3.2 Although some degree of salary sacrifice can form part of usual employment arrangements, it is sometimes used merely to reduce tax, which can create unfairness between taxpayers. Use of extreme salary sacrifice schemes can result in some employees paying less tax than others who earn the same or less income. 3.3 Some salary sacrifice schemes entail employees reducing their salaries to very low levels, which means they will need another means of support. Therefore reducing tax through salary sacrifice is likely to be available only to employees who have large assets or income from other sources or who are supported by someone else. 6 3.4 If enough people engage in salary sacrifice, there could be significant erosion of the Crown’s tax revenue base, which could lead to upward pressure on other taxes, thereby increasing the tax burden on other taxpayers. Suggested amendment to the progressive scale 3.5 Extreme salary sacrifice could be minimised by determining SSCWT rates under the progressive scale by the total of salary or wages and employer superannuation contributions, instead of basing rates on salary or wages alone. At the same time, the SSCWT thresholds could be increased by 15% over the corresponding effective income tax thresholds, to minimise the possibility of over taxation. Available data suggest that most employer superannuation contributions are equivalent to 15% or less of salary or wages. 3.6 Under the suggested changes, the new thresholds would be: Threshold: SSCWT rate: Salary or wages plus superannuation contributions up to $10,925: 15% on all contributions Salary or wages plus superannuation contributions from $10,926 to $43,700: 21% on all contributions Salary or wages plus employer superannuation contributions over $43,700: 33% on all contributions Example 2: SSCWT based on salary or wages and superannuation contributions, and thresholds 15% higher than the corresponding effective income tax thresholds Kylie earns $36,000 salary, and also receives $3,600 employer superannuation contributions. Under the suggested changes to the SSCWT thresholds and rates, her SSCWT rate will be 21%, and she will pay $756 SSCWT. 3.7 If the thresholds were not adjusted upwards, some employees could be overtaxed on their employer superannuation contributions if those contributions took them over a SSCWT threshold. 7 Example 3: Overtaxation when SSCWT is based on salary or wages and superannuation contributions, and thresholds are the same as the effective income tax thresholds Hemi earns $36,000 salary, and also receives $3,600 employer superannuation contributions. If SSCWT rates are determined by the total of salary or wages and employer superannuation contributions, and thresholds are equivalent to income tax thresholds, his SSCWT rate would be 33%, and he would pay $1,188 SSCWT. Had he received those superannuation contributions as salary or wages, $2,000 of them would have been taxed at the lower effective rate of 21%. He is overtaxed by $240 on his employer superannuation contributions. 3.8 Basing SSCWT rates on the total of salary or wages and employer superannuation contributions, and setting the thresholds 15% higher than the corresponding income tax thresholds would resolve the problem of extreme salary sacrifice. At the same time it would ensure that employer superannuation contributions are not overtaxed in comparison to salary or wages. Example 4: Extreme salary sacrifice under the amended progressive scale John, from example 1, earns $100,000 a year in salary. Income tax on his salary is $30,270. John makes an arrangement with his employer, so that his salary is cut to $9,500, and the balance of $90,500 is paid as employer superannuation contributions. In each year of this arrangement, John will pay $1,425 income tax on his salary. His SSCWT rate will be 33%, based on his combined salary and superannuation contributions of $100,000, so he will pay $29,865 SSCWT ($90,500 \* .33). His total tax liability will be $31,290. Every year, John’s tax liability will be $1,020 higher than it would have been had he received all his remuneration as salary. Instead of using extreme salary sacrifice, John can continue to save for his retirement through making contributions himself from his tax-paid salary. These personal contributions are not subject to any further tax. Any employer superannuation contributions will be taxed at 33%, and provided that they do not exceed a certain proportion of his salary, John’s overall tax liability will not exceed the amount of tax he would have paid if all his remuneration was received as salary. 8 3.9 Instead of amending the progressive scale, employer superannuation contributions could be taxed as part of wages and salary. However, this approach would have implications for the social assistance received by some taxpayers. Our preferred approach is to ensure that employer superannuation contributions are taxed at more or less the right rate, and employees’ entitlements to social assistance are not affected. 3.10 We invite feedback on our suggested changes to the progressive scale. We are particularly interested in whether the proposed uplift of the SSCWT thresholds would be sufficient to ensure that most employees are not overtaxed on their employer superannuation contributions. 9 4. Reducing complexity 4.1 As described earlier, there are now four methods that can be used for calculating tax on employer superannuation contributions. These methods have been introduced over time, in response to particular needs and issues. Increasing the number of methods available for calculating SSCWT has added to the complexity to the SSCWT rules. 4.2 Of the four methods of calculating tax on employer superannuation contributions, we understand that two are not being used. Available evidence suggests that neither the flat rate of 39% nor the PAYE method is used. 4.3 The flat rate of 39% and the PAYE methods of calculating tax on employer superannuation contributions could be removed, in order to make the SSCWT rules less complex. It should be noted that the 39% method was introduced to provide a mechanism for employees to avoid the fund withdrawal tax. 4.4 We invite feedback on this proposal. In particular, we would like feedback on whether these methods should be retained, and if so, why.
International treaty examination of the Agreement between New Zealand and the Republic of Austria with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Report of the Finance and Expenditure Committee The Finance and Expenditure Committee has conducted an international treaty examination of the Agreement between New Zealand and the Republic of Austria with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital and has no matters to bring to the attention of the House. The national interest analysis for the agreement is appended to this report. Shane Jones Chairperson NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS 2 Appendix National interest analysis—Agreement between New Zealand and the Republic of Austria with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital Date of proposed binding treaty action 1 The Agreement between New Zealand and the Republic of Austria with Respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital, with Protocol (the Austrian DTA)—attached as Annex 1 was signed at Vienna on 21 September 2006. Subsequent to the successful completion of the parliamentary treaty examination process, it is proposed that the Austrian DTA would be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council, and would enter into force by way of an exchange of instruments of ratification. Reasons for New Zealand to become party to the Austrian DTA 2 New Zealand currently has 32 double tax agreements (DTAs) in force. They are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax evasion. 3 DTAs give residents of both countries who are considering entering into cross- border trade and investment greater certainty of tax treatment. DTAs also contain a mutual agreement procedure for resolving disputes or issues that might arise in relation to the DTA. DTAs assist tax administrations in the prevention of fiscal evasion by providing for the exchange of information on tax matters between two countries. 4 Negotiations were entered into with Austria, after the Austrian Federal Minister approached New Zealand requesting a DTA in light of Austrian oil company OMV AG’s acquisition of significant shares in New Zealand oil and gas fields through its affiliated company OMV New Zealand Ltd. 5 The level of trade is also a major factor in deciding with which countries to negotiate a DTA. There is a growing trading relationship between Austria and New Zealand, even though current levels are modest. In the year ending December 2005 New Zealand exports to Austria totalled NZ$18.4 million while imports from Austria totalled NZ$161.6 million. This Austrian DTA discussed represents a positive outcome for New Zealand. Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the Austrian DTA entering into force 6 The advantages to New Zealand of the Austrian DTA entering into force are: NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS 3 it will remove tax impediments to cross-border transactions between New Zealand and Austria—in particular, it shares the cost of relieving the double taxation of income. The Austrian DTA will regulate how transactions should be taxed between the two countries so the income is effectively taxed only once: ∑ it will generally reduce withholding taxes on dividends, interest and royalties to 15 percent; 10 percent; and 10 percent; respectively, and will exempt many short-term activities of individuals and businesses in the host country ∑ when both countries are permitted to impose tax, it will ensure that the country of residence allows a credit or exemption for the tax paid in the country of source ∑ the Austrian DTA will provide taxpayers with greater certainty of tax treatment, along with a mutual agreement procedure for resolving disputed issues that may arise in relation to the DTA ∑ the Austrian DTA will also assist the tax administrations of both countries by facilitating the exchange of information relating to taxes for the prevention of avoidance and evasion. 7 One disadvantage of the Austrian DTA is that New Zealand may forgo some revenue because of the reduction in levels of New Zealand tax and the allocation of some taxing rights to Austria. Although, as explained in the discussion under “Costs” (below), the reciprocal nature of the Austrian DTA means that these revenue costs will be offset by increases in revenue where taxing rights are allocated to New Zealand and where Austrian tax is correspondingly reduced under the Austrian DTA. 8 The requirement for New Zealand to provide Austria with information on tax matters under the Austrian DTA’s exchange of information provisions may be seen as a disadvantage. However, again, the ability to request information is reciprocal, and New Zealand’s experience with exchange of information in relation to its approximately 30 other DTAs is predominantly positive; the benefit gained from being able to request information from the other country more than offsets the administrative burden of having to provide information pursuant to its requests. 9 It is important to note that the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has adopted a new wider formulation for exchange of information, which New Zealand supports. Austria has a strong preference for bank secrecy rules. Therefore, Austria does not support the new OECD formulation. However, a provision has been included in the Protocol to the Austrian DTA that states that if Austria ever agrees to the new formulation they must, without undue delay, enter into negotiations with New Zealand with a view to providing the same treatment. 10 On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interest to conclude a DTA with Austria. It is expected to enhance cross-border trade and investment and will assist the New Zealand Government in the prevention of fiscal evasion. NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS 4 Obligations 11 The Austrian DTA does not impose requirements on taxpayers. The obligations it imposes are on the Contracting States, restricting their taxing rights under domestic law on a reciprocal basis. A DTA can only reduce tax already imposed under domestic law; it cannot impose tax. 12 New Zealand taxes its residents based on their New Zealand and worldwide income. Non-residents are taxed only on their New Zealand-sourced income. Austria has a similar system. This gives rise to the possibility that cross-border flows of income will be subject to double taxation. The Austrian DTA provides a way of allocating taxing rights as between New Zealand and Austria. Under this Austrian DTA, New Zealand and Austria will be required to comply with the following rules when imposing tax on residents of either country: ∑ income from immovable property will generally be taxed in the country where the property is situated (Article 6 refers) ∑ business profits will generally be taxable only in the country where the business is resident. However, the profit attributable to a permanent establishment situated in the other country may be taxed in that country. A permanent establishment generally exists in the country in question when there is a fixed place of business where the business of an enterprise is carried on (Article 7 refers) ∑ profits of an enterprise of a country from the operation of ships or aircraft shall be taxable only in that country, subject to various rules applicable in specific situations (Article 8 refers) ∑ dividends paid by a company of one country to a resident of the other country may be taxed in that other country. The source country may also tax the dividend up to a maximum of 15 percent on the gross amount of the dividends (Article 10 refers) ∑ interest may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the interest arises must not impose tax in excess of 10 percent if the interest is paid to a resident of the other country (Article 11 refers) ∑ royalties may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the royalties arise must not impose tax in excess of 10 percent of the royalties if they are paid to a resident of the other country (Article 12 refers) ∑ specific rules apply to the taxation of income, profits or gains derived from the sale of property. In the case of immovable property the profits are taxable where the property is situated (Article 13 refers) ∑ income from employment will be taxable only in the country where the employee is resident, unless the employment is performed in the other country. In this case, the country where the employment is performed may also tax the NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS 5 income, if the employee is present for at least 183 days and various conditions are met (Article 14 refers) ∑ directors’ fees may be taxed in the country where the relevant company is resident (Article 15 refers) ∑ entertainers and sportspersons may be taxed in the country in which the activities of the sportsperson or entertainer take place (Article 16 refers) ∑ pensions and annuities are only taxable in the country where the recipient is resident. Alimony or maintenance payments are only taxable in the country where the payment was made (Article 17 refers) ∑ salaries and wages for services to a Government of one country are generally exempt from tax in the other country (Article 18 refers) ∑ students are generally not taxed on payments received from outside the country when those payments are for the maintenance and education of the student (Article 19 refers) ∑ capital can generally be taxed in the country where the property is situated (Article 21 refers) ∑ New Zealand has to comply with the various administrative requirements of the Austrian DTA that make its operation possible. These include, in particular, the elimination of double taxation by exempting or giving credits for overseas tax paid in certain situations; not enacting tax laws that discriminate against residents of Austria (vis-à-vis residents of any other state); complying with the mutual agreement procedures set out in the Austrian DTA; and complying with the exchange of information procedures (Articles 22, 23, 24 and 25 refer). Economic, social, cultural and environmental effects 13 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs 14 New Zealand may forgo some revenue from the limitation of our taxing rights in relation to income flows between New Zealand and Austria and which we are currently able to tax under our domestic laws. This revenue cost could include, for instance, tax forgone in relation to short-term activities of Austrian residents in New Zealand, which the Austrian DTA will exempt. It could also include tax forgone on dividends, interest and royalties paid by New Zealand residents to the residents of Austria in respect of which the Austrian DTA will lower withholding rates. 15 Austria will also be similarly constrained from taxing certain income flows between Austria and New Zealand, and this reduced Austrian tax will often flow through to the New Zealand tax base through a reduction in credits for foreign tax paid. It is NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS 6 likely that these factors will offset each other to some extent over time. But, to the extent that the cost to the New Zealand revenue is not fully offset by the reduction in creditable Austrian tax, we would expect that the economic benefits of the Austria DTA will outweigh these costs. Future protocols and amendments 16 No future protocols are anticipated. However, if the need arose to amend the DTA, this would be done by way of a Protocol. Implementation 17 Subject to the successful completion of the parliamentary treaty examination process, this Austrian DTA will be implemented domestically by Order in Council in accordance with section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 2004. 18 The Austrian DTA will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 enables DTAs to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that the DTA will override the Income Tax Act 2004, the Tax Administration Act 1994, any other Inland Revenue Act, the Official Information Act 1982, the Privacy Act 1993 in relation to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the DTA. Consultation The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Treasury have been consulted and concur with the terms of the Austrian DTA. No private sector consultation was entered into. Withdrawal or denunciation Article 28 of the Austrian DTA provides that either Contracting State may terminate the DTA by giving notice, through diplomatic channels, of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar year beginning after the expiration of five years from the date of its entry into force.

(7) An enterprise shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State merely because it carries on business in that State through a broker, general commission agent or any other agent of an independent status, provided that such persons are acting in the ordinary course of their business. (8) The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other. NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS 12 Article 6 INCOME FROM IMMOVABLE PROPERTY (1) Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from immovable property (including income from agriculture, forestry or fishing) situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.

(4) The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 shall also apply to the income from immovable property of an enterprise. Article 7 BUSINESS PROFITS (1) The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment. (2) Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment. (3) In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere. (4) No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise. NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS 13 (5) For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary. (6) Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Agreement, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article. (7) Income or profits from any kind of insurance shall be taxed in accordance with the laws of either Contracting State. However, if an enterprise of one of the Contracting States derives premiums paid for the insurance of risks situated in the other State, otherwise than through a permanent establishment situated in that other State, the taxable income or profits derived by the enterprise from the insurance of those risks shall in that other State not exceed 10 percent of the gross premiums paid for the insurance of those risks. Article 8 SHIP AND AIRCRAFT OPERATIONS (1) Profits from ship or aircraft operations derived by a resident of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State.

(4) For the purposes of this Article, profits derived from the carriage by ships or aircraft of passengers, livestock, mail, goods or merchandise which are shipped in a Contracting State for discharge at a place in that State shall be treated as profits from ship or aircraft operations confined solely to places in that State. Article 9 ASSOCIATED ENTERPRISES (1) Where a) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State, NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS 14 and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly. (2) Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State – and taxes accordingly—profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Agreement and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other. Article 10 DIVIDENDS (1) Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. (2) However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends. This paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid. (3) The term “dividends” as used in this Article means income from shares, “jouissance” shares or “jouissance” rights, mining shares, founders’ shares or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as well as income which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the laws of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident. (4) The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident through a permanent establishment situated therein and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply. (5) Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS 15 a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment situated in that other State, nor subject the company's undistributed profits to a tax on the company's undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State. Article 11 INTEREST (1) Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. (2) However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest. (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, interest shall be taxable only in the Contracting State of which the recipient is a resident, if such recipient is the beneficial owner of the interest and if such interest is paid: a) to the Government of the Republic of Austria or to the Government of New Zealand; b) in respect of a loan made, guaranteed or insured, or any other debt-claim or credit guaranteed or insured, by (i) in the case of Austria: the Oesterreichische Kontrollbank Aktiengesellschaft; (ii) in the case of New Zealand: an entity of a similar nature. (4) The term “interest” as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in debtor’s profits, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures, as well as all other income treated as income from money lent by the laws of the Contracting State in which the income arises, but does not include any income which is treated as a dividend under Article 10. Penalty charges for late payment shall not be regarded as interest for the purpose of this Article. (5) The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply. NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS 16 (6) Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that State itself, a political subdivision, a local authority or a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether the person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is deductible in determining the income, profits or gains attributable to that permanent establishment, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated. (7) Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement. Article 12 ROYALTIES (1) Royalties arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. (2) However, such royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise, and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the royalties is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties. (3) The term “royalties” as used in this Article means payments of any kind, whether periodical or not, and however described or computed, to the extent to which they are made as consideration for: a) the use of, or the right to use, any copyright (including the use of or the right to use any literary, dramatic, musical, or artistic works, sound recordings, films, broadcasts, cable programmes, or typographical arrangements of published editions), patent, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, trade-mark, or other like property or right; or b) the use of, or the right to use, any industrial, scientific or commercial equipment; or c) knowledge or information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience. (4) The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise through a permanent establishment situated therein and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS 17 is effectively connected with such permanent establishment. In such case the provisions of Article 7 shall apply. (5) Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a person who is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether the person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and the royalties are deductible in determining the income, profits or gains attributable to that permanent establishment, then the royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated. (6) Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties, having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement. Article 13 ALIENATION OF PROPERTY (1) Gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of immovable property referred to in Article 6 and situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. (2) Gains from the alienation of movable property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State, including such gains from the alienation of such a permanent establishment (alone or with the whole enterprise), may be taxed in that other State. (3) Gains from the alienation of ships or aircraft operated in international traffic, or movable property pertaining to the operation of such ships or aircraft, shall be taxable only in the Contracting State in which the enterprise alienating such ships, aircraft or other property is a resident. (4) Gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of shares deriving more than 50 per cent of their value directly or indirectly from immovable property situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. (5) Gains from the alienation of any property, other than that referred to in paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4, shall be taxable only in the Contracting State of which the alienator is a resident. Article 14 INCOME FROM EMPLOYMENT NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS 18 (1) Subject to the provisions of Articles 15, 17 and 18, salaries, wages and other similar remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment shall be taxable only in that State unless the employment is exercised in the other Contracting State. If the employment is so exercised, such remuneration as is derived therefrom may be taxed in that other State. (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment exercised in the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in the first-mentioned State if: a) the recipient is present in the other State for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any twelve month period commencing or ending in the year of income concerned, and b) the remuneration is paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is not a resident of the other State, and c) the remuneration is not deductible in determining the taxable profits of a permanent establishment which the employer has in the other State. (3) Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, remuneration derived in respect of an employment exercised aboard a ship or aircraft operated in international traffic by a resident of a Contracting State may be taxed in that State. Article 15 DIRECTORS’ FEES Directors’ fees and other similar payments derived by a resident of a Contracting State in that person’s capacity as a member of the board of directors of a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. Article 16 ENTERTAINERS AND SPORTSPERSONS (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7 and 14, income derived by a resident of a Contracting State as an entertainer, such as a theatre, motion picture, radio or television artiste, or a musician, or as a sportsperson, from that person’s personal activities as such exercised in the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other State. (2) Where income in respect of personal activities exercised by an entertainer or a sportsperson in that person's capacity as such accrues not to the entertainer or sportsperson but to another person, that income may, notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 7 and 14, be taxed in the Contracting State in which the activities of the entertainer or sportsperson are exercised. (3) The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to income derived by legal entities which carry on orchestras, theatres, ballet groups as well as to members of NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS 19 such cultural entities if such legal entities substantially are non-profit entities in the long term and if this is certified by the competent authority of the State of residence. Article 17 PENSIONS (1) Pensions (including government service pensions) and other similar remuneration paid to a resident of a Contracting State in consideration of past employment shall be taxable only in that State.

Article 18 GOVERNMENT SERVICE (1) a) Salaries, wages and other similar remuneration, other than a pension, paid by a Contracting State or a political subdivision or a local authority thereof to an individual in respect of services rendered to that State or subdivision or authority shall be taxable only in that State. b) However, such salaries, wages and other similar remuneration shall be taxable only in the other Contracting State if the services are rendered in that State and the individual is a resident of that State who: (i) is a national of that State; or (ii) did not become a resident of that State solely for the purpose of rendering the services. (2) The provisions of Articles 14, 15, and 16 shall apply to salaries, wages and other similar remuneration in respect of services rendered in connection with a business carried on by a Contracting State or a political subdivision or a local authority thereof. Article 19 STUDENTS Payments which a student who is or was immediately before visiting a Contracting State a resident of the other Contracting State and who is present in the first-mentioned State solely for the purpose of the student's education receives for the purpose of the student's maintenance or education shall not be taxed in that State, provided that such payments arise from sources outside that State. Article 20 NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS 20 OTHER INCOME (1) Items of income of a resident of a Contracting State, wherever arising, not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of this Agreement may be taxed in that State and if such income is derived from sources within the other Contracting State, that income may also be taxed in that other State. (2) Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the other Contracting State under a legal claim to maintenance may not be taxed in the first-mentioned State if such income would be exempt from tax according to the laws of the other Contracting State. Article 21 CAPITAL (1) Capital represented by immovable property referred to in Article 6, owned by a resident of a Contracting State and situated in the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other State. (2) Capital represented by movable property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. (3) Capital represented by ships and aircraft operated in international traffic, and by movable property pertaining to the operation of such ships and aircraft, shall be taxable only in the Contracting State of which the enterprise is a resident. (4) All other elements of capital of a resident of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State. Article 22 ELIMINATION OF DOUBLE TAXATION Double taxation shall be eliminated as follows: (1) In Austria: a) Where a resident of Austria derives income or owns capital which, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, may be taxed in New Zealand, Austria shall, subject to the provisions of subparagraphs b) and c), exempt such income or capital from tax. b) Where a resident of Austria derives items of income which, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 10, 11, 12 and 20, may be taxed in New Zealand, Austria shall allow as a deduction from the tax on the income of that resident an amount equal to the tax paid in New Zealand. Such deduction shall not, however, exceed that part of the tax, as computed NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS 21 before the deduction is given, which is attributable to such items of income derived from New Zealand. c) Where in accordance with any provision of the Agreement income derived or capital owned by a resident of Austria is exempt from tax in Austria, Austria may nevertheless, in calculating the amount of tax on the remaining income or capital of such resident, take into account the exempted income or capital. d) The provisions of subparagraph a) shall not apply to income derived or capital owned by a resident of Austria where New Zealand applies the provisions of this Agreement to exempt such income or capital from tax or applies the provisions of paragraph 2 of Article 10, 11, or 12 to such income. (2) In New Zealand: Subject to the provisions of the laws of New Zealand which relate to the allowance of a credit against New Zealand income tax of tax paid in a country outside New Zealand (which shall not affect the general principle of this Article), Austrian tax paid under the laws of Austria and consistent with this Agreement, in respect of income derived by a resident of New Zealand from sources in Austria (excluding, in the case of a dividend, tax paid in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid) shall be allowed as a credit against New Zealand tax payable in respect of that income. Article 23 NON-DISCRIMINATION (1) Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances are or may be subjected. (2) The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a third State has in that other State. (3) Enterprises of one of the Contracting States, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of a third State, are or may be subjected. (4) This Article shall not apply to any provisions of the taxation laws of a Contracting State which: NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS 22 a) are reasonably designed to prevent or defeat the avoidance or evasion of taxes; or b) are in force on the date of signature of this Agreement, or are substantially similar in general purpose or intent to any such provision but are enacted after the date of signature of this Agreement, provided that any such provision does not allow for different treatment of residents of the other Contracting State as compared with the treatment of residents of any third State. (5) The provisions of this Article shall apply only to the taxes which are the subject of this Agreement. (6) If one of the Contracting States considers that taxation measures of the other Contracting State infringe the principles set forth in this Article, the competent authorities shall use the mutual agreement procedure to endeavour to resolve the matter. Article 24 MUTUAL AGREEMENT PROCEDURE (1) Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for that person in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, that person may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present a case to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which the person is a resident or, if the person's case comes under paragraph 1 of Article 23, to that of the Contracting State of which the person is a national. The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement. (2) The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the Agreement. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting States. (3) The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Agreement. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Agreement. (4) The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly, including through a joint commission consisting of themselves or their representatives, for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of the preceding paragraphs. Article 25 NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS 23 EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION (1) The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is forseeably relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Agreement or to the administration or enforcement of the domestic laws concerning taxes of every kind and description imposed on behalf of the Contracting States, or of their political subdivisions or local authorities, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Agreement. The exchange of information is not restricted by Articles 1 and 2. (2) Any information received under paragraph 1 by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, the determination of appeals in relation to the taxes referred to in paragraph 1, or the oversight of the above. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. (3) In no case shall the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation: a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State; b) to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State; c) to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public). (4) If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this Article, the other Contracting State shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the requested information, even though that other State may not need such information for its own tax purposes. The obligation contained in the preceding sentence is subject to the limitations of paragraph 3 but in no case shall such limitations be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because it has no domestic interest in such information. Article 26 MEMBERS OF DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS AND CONSULAR POSTS Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the fiscal privileges of members of diplomatic missions or consular posts under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements. Article 27 NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS 24 ENTRY INTO FORCE (1) This Agreement shall be ratified and the instruments of ratification shall be exchanged as soon as possible.

Article 28 TERMINATION This Agreement shall remain in force until terminated by a Contracting State. Either Contracting State may terminate the Agreement, through diplomatic channels, by giving notice of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar year beginning after the expiration of 5 years from the date of its entry into force. In such event, the Agreement shall cease to have effect: a) in Austria: (i) in respect of withholding tax on income, profits or gains derived by a non- resident, for amounts paid or credited on or after the first day of the third month next following that in which the notice of termination is given; (ii) in respect of other Austrian tax, for any assessment year beginning on or after 1 January in the calendar year next following that in which the notice of termination is given; NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS 25 b) in New Zealand: (i) in respect of withholding tax on income, profits or gains derived by a non- resident, for amounts paid or credited on or after the first day of the third month next following that in which the notice of termination is given; (ii) in respect of other New Zealand tax, for any income year beginning on or after 1 April in the calendar year next following that in which the notice of termination is given.

DONE in duplicate at \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ on \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, 2006 in the German and English languages, each text being equally authentic. In case of divergence of interpretation the English text shall prevail. NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS 26 PROTOCOL At the moment of signing the Agreement with respect to Taxes on Income and on Capital, this day concluded between the Republic of Austria and New Zealand, the undersigned have agreed that the following provisions shall form an integral part of the Agreement. 1. With reference to Article 2: It is understood that the taxes covered by the Agreement do not include any amount which represents a penalty or interest imposed under the laws of either Contracting State. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the competent authorities of both Contracting States agree to adjust a transfer price pursuant to a mutual agreement procedure under Article 24, interest and penalties associated with that transaction can form part of the mutual agreement procedure. 2. With reference to Article 5: For the purposes of determining the duration of activities under paragraphs 3 and 4, the period during which activities are carried on in a Contracting State by an enterprise associated with another enterprise shall be aggregated with the period during which activities are carried on by the enterprise with which it is associated if the first-mentioned activities are connected with the activities carried on in that State by the last-mentioned enterprise, provided that any period during which two or more associated enterprises are carrying on concurrent activities is counted only once. An enterprise shall be deemed to be associated with another enterprise if one is controlled directly or indirectly by the other, or if both are controlled directly or indirectly by a third person or persons. 3. With reference to Article 6: The term "immovable property" includes rights to explore for or exploit natural resources or standing timber, and rights to variable or fixed payments either as consideration for, or in respect of, the exploitation of or the right to explore for or exploit natural resources or standing timber. 4. With reference to Article 7: Where: a) a resident of a Contracting State beneficially owns, whether directly or through one or more interposed trusts, a share of the business profits of an enterprise carried on in the other Contracting State by the trustee of a trust other than a trust which is treated as a company for tax purposes; and b) in relation to that enterprise, that trustee would, in accordance with the principles of Article 5, have a permanent establishment in that other State, the enterprise carried on by the trustee shall be deemed to be a business carried on in the other State by that resident through a permanent establishment situated in that other State and that share of business profits shall be attributed to that permanent establishment. NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS 27 5. With reference to Articles 10, 11 and 12: If, in an agreement for the avoidance of double taxation that is made, after the date of signature of this Agreement, between New Zealand and a third State, being a State that is a member of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, New Zealand agrees to limit the rate of tax: (a) on dividends paid by a company which is a resident of New Zealand for the purposes of New Zealand tax to which a company that is a resident of the third State is entitled, to a rate less than that provided in paragraph (2) of Article 10; or (b) on interest arising in New Zealand to which a resident of the third State is entitled, to a rate less than that provided in paragraph (2) of Article 11; or (c) on royalties arising in New Zealand to which a resident of the third State is entitled, to a rate less than that provided in paragraph (2) of Article 12, the Government of New Zealand shall immediately inform the Government of Austria in writing through the diplomatic channel and shall enter into negotiations with the Government of Austria to review the relevant provisions in order to provide the same treatment for Austria as that provided for the third State. 6. With reference to Article 11: It is understood that, under New Zealand's Approved Issuer Levy legislation in force at the time of signing this agreement, an approved New Zealand resident borrower is, in relation to a registered security, able to pay interest to a non-resident that is not associated with the borrower and deduct zero percent non-resident withholding tax. Under these rules, approved borrowers are required to pay a duty of 2% for every $1 of interest paid to the non-resident which is not in the nature of an income tax. 7. With reference to paragraph 3 of Article 12: The term “royalties” as used in this Article shall also mean payments of any kind, whether periodical or not, and however described or computed, to the extent to which they are made as consideration for (i) any assistance that is ancillary and subsidiary to, and is furnished as a means of enabling the application or enjoyment of, any such property or right as is mentioned in subparagraph (a), any such equipment as is mentioned in subparagraph (b) or any such knowledge or information as is mentioned in subparagraph (c); or (ii) total or partial forbearance in respect of the use or supply of any property or right referred to in this paragraph. 8. With reference to Article 18: In the case of Austria, Article 18 shall also apply to other corporations of public law. NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS 28 9. With reference to paragraph 2 of Article 20: a) For the purposes of paragraph 2 such remuneration shall also include remuneration for damage resulting from crimes, vaccinations or similar reasons. b) The income mentioned in this paragraph shall not be taken into consideration when applying the exemption with progression method. 10. With reference to Article 20: It is understood that if at any time after the date of signature of this Protocol, New Zealand agrees to an Other Income Article in line with the OECD model, in any of its future double tax agreements, New Zealand shall without undue delay enter into negotiations with the Republic of Austria with a view to providing the same treatment. 11. With reference to Article 25: For the purpose of clarification it is understood that Article 25 of the Agreement imposes the obligation on the Contracting State which has received a request for information to collect the requested information for the purposes of the requesting State in the same manner as such information would have been collected for its own purposes. If the requested State can obtain specific information only after the formal commencement of administrative or criminal proceedings concerning tax fraud, the aforementioned principle implies that such information also has to be collected upon the request of the other Contracting State if a comparable proceeding has been formally opened in the other State. 12. With reference to Article 25: It is understood that if at any time after the date of signature of this Protocol, the Republic of Austria shall include provisions allowing the exchange of information that is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee, or person acting in an agency or a fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a person in any of its double tax agreements, the Republic of Austria shall without undue delay enter into negotiations with New Zealand with a view to including such provisions in the Agreement signed today. 13. Interpretation of the Agreement: It is understood that provisions of the Agreement which are drafted according to the corresponding provisions of the OECD-Model Convention on Income and on Capital shall generally be expected to have the same meaning as expressed in the OECD Commentary thereon. The understanding in the preceding sentence will not apply with respect to the following: a) any reservations or observations to the OECD Model or its Commentary by either Contracting State; b) any contrary interpretations in this Protocol; NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS 29 c) any contrary interpretation in a published explanation by one of the Contracting States that has been provided to the competent authority of the other Contracting State prior to the entry into force of the Agreement; d) any contrary interpretation agreed to by the competent authorities after the entry into force of the Agreement. The OECD Commentary—as it may be revised from time to time - constitutes a means of interpretation in the sense of the Vienna Convention of 23 May 1969 on the Law of Treaties. IN WITNESS WHEREOF the Plenipotentiaries of the two Contracting States, duly authorised thereto, have signed this Protocol.
International treaty examination of the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Mexican States for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income Report of the Finance and Expenditure Committee The Finance and Expenditure Committee has conducted an international treaty examination of the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Mexican States for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and has no matters to bring to the attention of the House. The national interest analysis for the agreement is appended to this report. Shane Jones Chairperson NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS 2 Appendix A National interest analysis—Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Mexican States for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income Date of proposed binding treaty action 1 The Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United Mexican States for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, with Protocol (“the DTA”) was signed in Vietnam on 16 November 2006. Subsequent to satisfactory completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, it is proposed that the DTA be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council, and enter into force by way of an exchange of diplomatic notes. Reasons for New Zealand to become a party to the treaty 2 New Zealand currently has 32 double tax agreements (DTAs) in force. They are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax evasion. 3 DTAs give residents of both countries who are considering entering into cross- border trade and investment greater certainty of tax treatment. DTAs also contain a mutual agreement procedure for resolving disputes or issues that might arise in relation to the DTA. DTAs assist tax administrations in the prevention of fiscal evasion by providing for the exchange of information on tax matters between two countries. 4 Negotiations were entered into with Mexico as part of the Government’s Latin American strategy. They arose specifically out of personal agreement in 2001 between New Zealand’s Prime Minister and President Fox of Mexico that a DTA should be pursued. 5 The level of trade is also a major factor in deciding with which countries to negotiate a DTA. Since the early 1970s Mexico has consistently been New Zealand’s top Latin American trading partner and currently accounts for nearly half of New Zealand exports to the region. It is among our most important milk powder markets anywhere in the world. New Zealand exports to Mexico in the year to June 2006 were worth $NZ429 million, consisting primarily of dairy products and meat. Mexican exports to New Zealand, mostly computers, transmission apparatus, motor vehicles, and beer were worth NZ$122 million. NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS 3 Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the treaty entering into force 6 The advantages to New Zealand of this DTA entering into force are: ∑ it will remove tax impediments to cross-border transactions between New Zealand and Mexico – in particular, it shares the cost of relieving the double taxation of income. The DTA will regulate how transactions should be taxed between the two countries so the income is effectively taxed only once ∑ it will generally reduce withholding taxes on dividends, interest and royalties to 15 percent, 10 percent and 10 percent respectively, and will exempt many short-term activities of individuals and businesses in the host country ∑ when both countries are permitted to impose tax, it will ensure that the country of residence allows a credit or exemption for the tax paid in the country of source ∑ the DTA will provide taxpayers with greater certainty of tax treatment, along with a mutual agreement procedure for resolving disputed issues that may arise in relation to the DTA ∑ the DTA will also assist the tax administrations of both countries by facilitating the exchange of information relating to taxes for the prevention of avoidance and evasion. 7 One disadvantage of the DTA is that New Zealand may forgo some revenue because of the reduction in levels of New Zealand tax and the allocation of some taxing rights to Mexico. Although, as explained in the discussion under “Costs” (below), the reciprocal nature of the DTA means that these revenue costs will be offset by increases in revenue where taxing rights are allocated to New Zealand and where Mexican tax is correspondingly reduced under the DTA. 8 The requirement for New Zealand to provide Mexico with information on tax matters under the DTA’s exchange of information provisions may be seen as a disadvantage. However, again, the ability to request information is reciprocal, and New Zealand’s experience with exchange of information in relation to its 32 other DTAs is predominantly positive; the benefit gained from being able to request information from the other country more than offsets the administrative burden of having to provide information pursuant to its requests. 9 On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interest to conclude a DTA with Mexico. It is expected to enhance cross-border trade and investment and will assist the New Zealand Government in the prevention of fiscal evasion. Obligations 10 The DTA does not impose requirements on taxpayers. The obligations it imposes are on the Contracting States, restricting their taxing rights under domestic law on a reciprocal basis. A DTA can only reduce tax already imposed under domestic law; it cannot impose tax. NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS 4 11 New Zealand taxes its residents based on their New Zealand and worldwide income. Non-residents are taxed only on their New Zealand-sourced income. Mexico has a similar system. This gives rise to the possibility that cross-border flows of income will be subject to double taxation. The DTA provides a way of allocating taxing rights as between New Zealand and Mexico. Under this DTA, New Zealand and Mexico will be required to comply with the following rules when imposing tax on residents of either country: ∑ income from immovable property will generally be taxed in the country where the property is situated (Article 6 refers) ∑ business profits will generally be taxable only in the country where the business is resident. However, the profit attributable to a permanent establishment situated in the other country may be taxed in that country. A permanent establishment generally exists in the country in question when there is a fixed place of business where the business of an enterprise is carried on (Article 7 refers) ∑ profits of an enterprise of a country from the operation of ships or aircraft shall be taxable only in that country, subject to various rules applicable in specific situations (Article 8 refers) ∑ dividends paid by a company of one country to a resident of the other country may be taxed in that other country. The source country may also tax the dividend up to a maximum of 15 percent on the gross amount of the dividends (Article 10 refers) ∑ interest may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the interest arises must not impose tax in excess of 10 percent if the interest is paid to a resident of the other country (Article 11 refers) ∑ royalties may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the royalties arise must not impose tax in excess of 10 percent of the royalties if they are paid to a resident of the other country (Article 12 refers) ∑ specific rules apply to the taxation of income, profits or gains derived from the sale of property. In the case of immovable property the profits are taxable where the property is situated (Article 13 refers) ∑ income from employment will be taxable only in the country where the employee is resident, unless the employment is performed in the other country. In this case, the country where the employment is performed may also tax the income, if the employee is present for at least 183 days and various conditions are met (Article 14 refers) ∑ directors’ fees may be taxed in the country where the relevant company is resident (Article 15 refers) ∑ entertainers and sportspersons may be taxed in the country in which the activities of the sportsperson or entertainer take place (Article 16 refers) NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS 5 ∑ pensions and annuities are only taxable in the country where the recipient is resident. Alimony or maintenance payments are only taxable in the country where the payment was made (Article 17 refers) ∑ salaries and wages for services to a Government of one country are generally exempt from tax in the other country (Article 18 refers) ∑ students are generally not taxed on payments received from outside the country when those payments are for the maintenance and education of the student (Article 19 refers) ∑ New Zealand has to comply with the various administrative requirements of the DTA that make its operation possible. These include, in particular, the elimination of double taxation by exempting or giving credits for overseas tax paid in certain situations; not enacting tax laws that discriminate against residents of Mexico (vis-à-vis residents of any other state); complying with the mutual agreement procedures set out in the DTA; and complying with the exchange of information procedures (Articles 21, 22, 23 and 24 refer). Economic, social, cultural and environmental effects 12 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs 13 New Zealand may forgo some revenue from the limitation of our taxing rights in relation to income flows between New Zealand and Mexico and which we are currently able to tax under our domestic laws. This revenue cost could include, for instance, tax forgone in relation to short-term activities of Mexican residents in New Zealand, which the DTA will exempt. It could also include tax forgone on dividends, interest and royalties paid by New Zealand residents to the residents of Mexico in respect of which the DTA will lower withholding rates. 14 Mexico will also be similarly constrained from taxing certain income flows between Mexico and New Zealand, and this reduced Mexican tax will often flow through to the New Zealand tax base through a reduction in credits for foreign tax paid. It is likely that these factors will offset each other to some extent over time. But, to the extent that the cost to the New Zealand revenue is not fully offset by the reduction in creditable Mexican tax, we would expect that the economic benefits of the DTA will outweigh these costs. Future protocols and amendments 15 No future amendments are anticipated. However, if the need arose to amend the DTA, this would be done by way of a Protocol. Implementation 16 Subject to the successful completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, this DTA will be implemented domestically by Order in Council in accordance with section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 2004. NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS 6 17 The DTA will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 enables DTAs to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that the DTA will override the Income Tax Act 2004, the Tax Administration Act 1994, any other Inland Revenue Act, the Official Information Act 1982, the Privacy Act 1993 in relation to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the DTA. Consultation 18 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Treasury have been consulted and concur with the terms of the DTA. No private sector consultation was entered into. Withdrawal or denunciation 19 Article 27 of the DTA provides that either Contracting State may terminate the DTA by giving notice, through diplomatic channels, of termination on or before 30 June in any calendar year beginning after the expiration of five years from the date of its entry into force.

International treaty examination of the Agreement between the Kingdom of Spain and the Government of New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income Report of the Finance and Expenditure Committee The Finance and Expenditure Committee has conducted an international treaty examination of the Agreement between the Kingdom of Spain and the Government of New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and has no matters to bring to the attention of the House. The national interest analysis for the Agreement is appended to this report. Shane Jones Chairperson NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS—DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT WITH SPAIN 2 Appendix—National interest analysis International treaty examination of the Double Tax Agreement with Spain Date of proposed binding treaty action 1 An Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Kingdom of Spain for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and the Protocol (together referred to as “the DTA” in this document) was signed in July 2005. Subsequent to signing and subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, the DTA will be incorporated into domestic legislation through an Order in Council. The DTA will enter into force by way of an exchange of notes between New Zealand and Spain, in which each party will notify the other of the completion of their constitutional requirements for giving effect to the DTA in their respective domestic laws. Reasons for New Zealand to become a party to the treaty 2 New Zealand currently has 29 double tax agreements (DTAs) in force. They are primarily aimed at reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment, but also help tax administrations to detect and prevent tax evasion. 3 The negotiations with Spain were entered into in accordance with the Government’s Latin American strategy. The conclusion of a DTA with Spain is viewed as consistent with this strategy because Spain represents a key entry point to the region. Consultation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the business community highlighted Spain as a high priority. 4 The DTA with Spain will facilitate increased trade and investment between our two countries by reducing the double taxation of cross-border transactions. Such double taxation arises because both countries will generally tax the same income. The DTA allocates taxing rights between the two countries. This will result in one or both countries having the right to tax the income. When both countries enjoy this right, the DTA provides that the country of residence will give a credit for tax paid in the country of source. The DTA gives residents of both countries who are considering entering into cross-border trade ad investment greater certainty of tax treatment. The DTA also contains a mutual agreement procedure for resolving disputes or issues that might arise in relation to the DTA. 5 In relation to trade, the level of imports from and exports to Spain amounted to $169.7 million and $157 million respectively for the year ended June 2003. This makes Spain our twenty-fifth largest export market. The extent of trade with Spain is at a level where the conclusion of a DTA is likely to have beneficial results for both countries. 6 The DTA also assists tax administrations in the prevention of fiscal evasion by providing for the exchange of information on tax matters between two countries. NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS—DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT WITH SPAIN 3 Advantages and disadvantages to New Zealand of the treaty entering into force 7 The DTA will be advantageous to New Zealand because it will remove tax impediments to cross-border transactions between New Zealand and Spain—in particular, the double taxation of income. The DTA will regulate how transactions should be taxed between the two countries so the income is effectively taxed only once. It will generally reduce withholding taxes on dividends, interest and royalties to 15 percent, 10 percent, and 10 percent respectively, and will exempt many short-term activities of individuals and businesses in the host country. When both countries are permitted to impose tax, it will ensure that the country of residence allows a credit for the tax paid in the country of source. The DTA will provide taxpayers with greater certainty of tax treatment, along with a mutual agreement procedure for resolving dispute issues that may arise in relation to the DTA. The DTA will also assist the tax administrations of both countries by facilitating the exchange of information relating to taxes. 8 A disadvantage of the DTA is that New Zealand may forgo some revenue because of the reduction in New Zealand tax and the allocation of taxing rights to Spain under the DTA. Although, as explained in the discussion under “Costs”, the reciprocal nature of the DTA means that these revenue costs will be offset by increases in revenue where taxing rights are allocated to New Zealand and where Spanish tax is correspondingly reduced under the DTA. 9 The requirement for New Zealand to provide information on tax matters to Spain under the DTA’s exchange of information provisions may be seen as a disadvantage. However, again, the ability to request information is reciprocal, and New Zealand’s experience with exchange of information in relation to its 29 other DTAs is predominantly positive (the benefit gained from being able to request information from the other county more than offsetting the administrative burden of having to provide information pursuant to their requests). 10 On balance, it is in New Zealand’s interest to conclude a DTA with Spain. It is expected to enhance cross-border trade and investment and will assist the New Zealand Government in the prevention of fiscal evasion. It will also advance New Zealand’s interest in the Latin American region, because of the strong economic and cultural ties between Spain and this region. Obligations 11 The DTA does not impose requirements on taxpayers. The obligations it does impose are on the countries to the DTA and restricts their taxing rights under domestic law generally on a reciprocal basis. (A DTA can only reduce tax already imposed under domestic law; it cannot impose tax.) 12 Under domestic law, New Zealand taxes its residents based on their New Zealand and worldwide income. Non-residents are taxed only on their New Zealand-sourced income. Spain has a similar income tax system. This gives rise to the possibility that cross- border flows of income will be subject to double taxation. The DTA provides a way of allocating taxing rights as between New Zealand and Spain. Under this DTA, New Zealand NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS—DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT WITH SPAIN 4 and Spain will be required to comply with the following rules when imposing tax on residents of either country. • Income from immovable property will generally be taxed in the country where the property is situated. \[Article 6 of the DTA refers.\] • Business profits of an enterprise will be taxable only in the country where the enterprise is resident unless profits are derived through a permanent establishment situated in the other country. In that case, the profits may be taxed in that country. A permanent establishment generally exists when there is a fixed base in the country in question where the business of an enterprise is carried on. \[Article 7 of the DTA refers.\] • Profits of an enterprise of a country from the operation of ships or aircraft will be taxable only in that country. Such profits may also be taxable in the other country where the profit relates to operations confined solely to places in that other state. \[Article 8 of the DTA refers.\] • Dividends paid by a company of one country to a resident of the other country may be taxed in that other country. The source country may also tax the dividend up to a maximum of 15 percent on the gross amount of the dividends. \[Article 10 of the DTA refers.\] • Interest may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the interest arises may not impose tax in excess of 10 percent on interest. \[Article 11 of the DTA refers.\] • Royalties may generally be taxed in both countries. However, the country in which the royalties arise may not impose tax in excess of 10 percent of the royalties. \[Article 12 of the DTA refers.\] • Specific rules apply to the taxation of gains derived from the alienation of property. In the case of immovable property the gains are taxable where the property is situated. In the case of moveable property, the gain is generally taxable in the country where the alienator is resident. \[Article 13 of the DTA refers.\] • Income from employment will be taxable only in the country where the employee is resident, unless the employment is performed in the other country. In this case, the country where the employment is performed may also tax the incomes, if the employee is present for 183 days and other conditions are met. \[Article 14 of the DTA refers.\] • Directors’ fees are taxable in the country where the company paying the fees is resident. \[Article 15 of the DTA refers.\] • Artistes (entertainers) and sportspersons may be taxed in the country in which the activities of the artistes or sportspersons take place. \[Article 16 of the DTA refers.\] • Pensions are taxable only in the country where the recipient is resident. \[Article 17 of the DTA refers.\] NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS—DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT WITH SPAIN 5 • Salaries and wages for services to a Government of one country are generally exempt from tax in the other country. \[Article 18 of the DTA refers.\] • Students are generally not taxed on payments received from outside the country when those payments are for the maintenance and education of the student. \[Article 19 of the DTA refers.\] • New Zealand has to comply with the various administrative requirements of the DTA that make its operation possible. These include, in particular, the elimination of double taxation by giving credits for overseas tax paid in certain situations; not enacting tax laws that discriminate against residents of Spain (vis-à-vis residents of any other state); complying with the mutual agreement procedures set out in the DTA; and complying with the exchange of information procedures. \[Articles 21, 22, 23 and 24 of the DTA refer.\] Economic, social, cultural and environmental effects 13 No social, cultural or environmental effects are anticipated. Any economic effects are expected to be favourable, as noted above. Costs 14 New Zealand may forgo some revenue from the limitation of our taxing rights in relation to some income flows between New Zealand and Spain which we are currently able to tax under our domestic laws. This revenue cost could include, for instance, tax forgone in relation to short-term activities of Spanish residents in New Zealand, which the DTA will exempt. It could also include tax forgone on dividends, interest and royalties paid by New Zealand residents to residents of Spain, in respect of which the DTA will lower withholding taxes. However, Spain will also be similarly constrained from taxing certain income flows between Spain and New Zealand, and this reduced Spanish tax will often flow through to the New Zealand tax base through a reduction in credits for foreign tax paid. It is likely that these factors will offset each other to some extent over time. But, to the extent that the cost to the New Zealand revenue is not fully offset by the reduction in creditable Spanish tax, we would expect that the economic benefits of the DTA will outweigh these costs. Future protocols 15 No future protocols are anticipated. Implementation 16 Subject to the successful completion of the international treaty examination process, this DTA will be implemented by Order in Council in accordance with section BH 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 2004. 17 This agreement will be implemented by way of an overriding treaty regulation. Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 enables DTAs to be given effect by Order in Council. It also provides that the DTA will override the Income Tax Act 2004 and any other enactment relating to income tax, unpaid tax and the exchange of information relating to a tax. This override is necessary to give effect to the terms of the DTA and will NATIONAL INTEREST ANALYSIS—DOUBLE TAXATION AGREEMENT WITH SPAIN 6 effectively override the Income Tax Act 2004, the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Consultation 18 The Treasury agrees with the terms of the DTA. Some consultation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade aand some with private sector firms was undertaken before the negotiations. Withdrawal or denunciation 19 Article 27 provides that either contracting country may terminate the DTA by giving notice of termination, through diplomatic channels, after the expiration of five years from the date of its entry into force.

23, 24, 33, 37, 38, 39, 40, 42, 126(8) and (19), 157, 159, and 162(3) The changes in the bill address concerns that certain expenditure on failed geothermal wells is not recognised for tax purposes. The purpose of the change is to recognise and allow a deduction for the costs of unsuccessful geothermal wells from the 2003-04 income year. Consequential changes include clawing back this deduction if the unsuccessful well is subsequently used or sold and allowing all geothermal wells to be depreciated from the date of completion or acquisition. Economic theory suggests that the tax system should allow deductions for the decline in value of capital assets. When this occurs, the tax rules have no impact on an asset’s market value. In the case of failed geothermal wells, the tax system currently does not recognise this expenditure, unless the asset had been previously been in use or available for use. This result may lead to an under-investment in geothermal wells relative to other assets. Six submissions were received on the proposed changes. All submissions supported the proposed change, although a couple of submissions raised concerns with some of the detail. 4 GEOTHERMAL WELLS DRILLED OR ACQUIRED BETWEEN 1 APRIL 2003 AND 16 MAY 2006 Issue: All the proposed rules for geothermal wells should apply retrospectively Submission (578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 678 – Mighty River Power) The prospective rules for geothermal wells should all apply retrospectively so that wells drilled or acquired between 1 April 2003 and 16 May 2006 are depreciable from the date of completion or acquisition. Comment The retrospective application date was to provide comfort on the legality of deductions claimed for expenditure incurred on unsuccessful geothermal wells when there was some ambiguity about whether the law allowed such deductions. However, we can see merit in allowing wells drilled or acquired between 1 April 2003 and 16 May 2006 to be depreciable without having to satisfy the normal in-use or available-for-use requirement. Firstly, from a compliance perspective, it would be simpler to have consistent treatment for geothermal wells. Secondly, it is relatively simple for businesses to enter into arrangements that result in these wells being subject to the new rules. Rather than going through the compliance and administrative costs of re-open prior year returns, however, we recommend that taxpayers be allowed to depreciate geothermal wells completed, or acquired, between 1 April 2003 and 16 May 2006 but not yet in service from the beginning of the 2006 income year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted and that taxpayers be allowed to depreciate geothermal wells drilled or acquired between 1 April 2003 and 16 May 2006 that are not yet in service from the beginning of the 2006 income year. 5 Issue: The changes do not apply to revenue account expenditure Submission (597 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 601 – The Petroleum Exploration and Production Association of New Zealand) The changes should be amended so that they clearly apply only to expenditure that is not deductible because of the capital limitation. Comment Our view is that there is no problem because of the way that the Income Tax Act 2004 is structured and because of the way section EE 7(j) operates. The concern appears to be that any expenditure on geothermal wells will be treated as though it is capital expenditure if amendments are not made to the relevant clauses in the bill. We consider that such changes are unnecessary. Whether expenditure is an item of capital or revenue is determined by the facts. For one taxpayer the facts might point toward the expense being capital. For another they may point to the expenditure being revenue. Where expenditure on geothermal wells is under ordinary concepts a revenue expense, the taxpayer is entitled to a deduction under section DA 1, unless a limitation applies, and unless Part E modifies the allocation of deductions. If the expenditure relates to an item that is of a capital nature, then the general limitation on expenditure that is of a capital nature applies. In this circumstance, taxpayers must look to sub-part EE to quantify an amount of depreciation loss that they can claim as a deduction. The proposal is to insert the substantive provisions in Section EE of the Act. This suggests that the expenditure must apply to an item that is of a capital nature. Moreover, section EE 7 defines what is not depreciable property. Sub clause (j) basically says that an item is not depreciable property where the cost of the property is allowed as a deduction under another provision of the Act. So if the cost of a geothermal well is on revenue account, a deduction will be allowed under section DA 1, and no deduction will be allowed under sub part EE. That said, should Parliament pass the proposed changes to the tax treatment of geothermal wells unamended, Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin would make it clear that the changes in no way affect whether expenditure on a geothermal well is capital or revenue. Such a decision should remain based on the relevant facts. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 6 “BLACK HOLE” EXPENDITURE Submission (589 – KPMG, 597 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The change is a model worthy of wider application to address issues of the non- recognition of expenditure for income tax purposes. Comment The problem of not recognising expenditure for income tax is often called “black hole” expenditure. Officials will be working through submissions and providing advice to the government on black hole expenditure as part of the Business Tax Review. We would have concerns about a broader application of this model to deal with other forms of black hole expenditure. This model was designed for a particular set of circumstances and in consultation with large geothermal users. In other circumstances, the model may confer significant timing advantages and associated costs that are not justified by the facts. For example, the model is quite concessionary in it allows deductions to be taken from the date of completion, rather than when the asset is in use or is available for use. It also allows expenditure to be written off and then be subsequently brought back into service. Recommendation That the submission be noted and that work on addressing black hole expenditure is being considered as part of the Business Tax Review. 7 DRY AND DEPLETED OIL AND GAS WELLS Submission (601 – Petroleum Exploration and Production Association of New Zealand) The tax rules should be amended to allow a deduction for the costs of dry oil and gas production wells and a write-off for the remaining tax value of depleted oil and gas wells. Comment This submission is outside the scope of the bill. However, policy officials plan to release a technical issues paper later in the year that considers these issues. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 8 REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS Submission (Matters raised by officials) Clause 157 of the bill introduces new section DZ 7 (which relates to Geothermal wells between 31 March 2003 and 16 May 2006) to the Income Tax Act 1994. Clause 159 of the bill introduces new section DZ 15 (which also relates to Geothermal wells between 31 March 2003 and 17 May 2006) to the Income Tax Act 1994. In both clauses, taxpayers are incorrectly referred to as “persons”. Clause 23 of the bill introduces new section DZ 15 (which relates to Geothermal wells between 31 march 2003 and 17 May 2006) to the Income Tax Act 2004. The defined term geothermal energy proving period is incorrectly referred to as ‘geothermal proving period. In addition, Ministers have agreed to extend the scope of the application of the depreciation rules relating to geothermal wells contained in clause 24. Comment Amendments are necessary to correct these matters. Recommendation That the committee accept the proposed amendments. 9 Australian superannuation fund exemption 11 OVERVIEW Clause 52 Seven submissions were received on the new exemption. Most of them strongly supported the exemption relief and considered that it should help to resolve tax compliance problems arising under New Zealand’s foreign investment fund (FIF) rules for certain taxpayers and remove barriers to attracting skilled migrants from Australia. However, they also considered that the exemption should be extended to other foreign superannuation schemes (and not limited to certain schemes constituted in Australia) and that it should be retrospective in its application. 12 EXTEND EXEMPTION RELIEF TO ALL FOREIGN SUPERANNUATION SCHEMES Submission (556 – AMP, 578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 589 – KPMG, 597 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The exemption should be extended to all foreign superannuation schemes that are subject to similar rules of preservation and restrictions on early release of benefits that apply to Australian superannuation schemes. This submission is supported because: • It will improve neutrality and be fair to all who have preserved foreign superannuation interests. (AMP) • It is inappropriate to discriminate against migrants who hold retirement savings in superannuation schemes not located in Australia. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) • It will simplify the tax rules. (KPMG) • It will remove the disincentive to migrate to New Zealand for all migrants with foreign superannuation interests. To allow for minor variations in different countries, preservation criteria could be drafted in terms of key principles and those foreign schemes that meet the criteria would qualify for the exemption. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment The New Zealand tax treatment of Australian superannuation interests was raised as a significant concern by both countries at the first New Zealand/Australia Business Leadership Forum in 2004 and again at the Forum in 2005. In particular, it was considered that the tax treatment of such interests is often regarded as a significant barrier to trans-Tasman labour migration, especially at the senior executive level. The New Zealand Forum representatives requested that the government resolve this specific matter. The exemption is a specific response aimed solely at removing the potential tax disincentive for certain people with interests in particular Australian superannuation schemes to take up long-term or permanent employment in New Zealand. While the same rules should apply to interests in foreign superannuation schemes in all countries to reduce distortions, the exemption is aimed solely at addressing the concern above. Officials do not consider that further work is warranted at present to consider extending the new exemption to other countries unless it can first be established that it is creating a significant tax barrier to persons from other countries taking-up long-term or permanent employment in New Zealand. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 13 Submission (578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 597 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) If the preceding submission is not accepted, the FIF exemptions in sections EX 36 and EX 37 of the Income Tax Act 2004 should be amended to clarify that they apply to both preserved and non-preserved entitlements in a single superannuation scheme. Should achieving consistency between the existing exemptions and the new exemption from the FIF rules not be possible in this respect, sections EX 36(8) and EX 37(3) should be amended to specifically contemplate apportionment of the interests for the purposes of the FIF rules where those sections are only partially satisfied because of preserved and non-preserved interests in a foreign superannuation scheme existing concurrently. Comment This submission seeks to align the treatment of non-preserved entitlements under the existing exemptions (in sections EX 36 and EX 37) with the treatment of such entitlements under the new exemption. The proposed exemption recognises that a person’s interest in an Australian superannuation scheme could contain both preserved and non-preserved entitlements. This is largely a result of the gradual tightening of the rules relating to accessing Australian superannuation benefits and the “grand-parenting” of any interests that a person has at the time of each change. As noted in the Commentary to the bill, excluding unpreserved interests from the exemption relief would have led to both compliance costs for taxpayers and administrative costs for Inland Revenue, thereby negating any benefit to be gained from the proposed exemption. Extending this same treatment in the new exemption to the existing exemptions in sections EX 36 and EX 37 is not supported. As noted in the comment in the preceding submission, the proposal to exempt Australian superannuation interests from the FIF rules was to deal with a specific concern. In addition, it also will minimise the compliance costs associated with the FIF rules for returning New Zealanders who have worked in Australia and as a result have interests in Australian superannuation schemes that may have unrestricted portions. Officials do not consider that the policy rationale for the new exemption warrants the changes sought in the submission to provide a different tax treatment based on whether access to the interest is restricted or not. Officials also consider that the alternative submission to amend sections EX 36(8) and EX 37(3) should not be supported. One submission noted that an unpreserved amount in a foreign superannuation scheme may taint the preserved amount and cause the entire entitlement to fail the relevant exemption. Officials are aware that there is an alternative interpretation that section EX 36 already contemplates apportionment between preserved and non-preserved entitlements. It is the view of officials that the alternative submission should be clarified in the Tax Information Bulletin dealing with the new legislation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 14 RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION OF THE PROPOSED EXEMPTION Submission (556 – AMP, 568 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 589 – KPMG) The new exemption should apply retrospectively. If the exemption is not retrospective there would be too many situations where individuals, especially those who had arrived in New Zealand in the last few years, would be inequitably affected depending on when they arrived. (AMP) The exemption should apply retrospectively from the 2000 income year. This suggestion is based on the view that some taxpayers simply do not understand these rules, the numbers of taxpayers involved are extremely small, the fiscal implications are not significant and the compliance costs would otherwise be considerable. (Corporate Taxpayer Group) The proposed application date of 1 April 2006 would mean that those people who are not complying now would continue not to comply. The on-going concern is how this non-compliance is to be approached and how the FIF rules are to be enforced in the future for those superannuation schemes remaining subject to tax. The exemption should apply equally to those interests in superannuation funds that exist as at 1 April 2006. To the extent that taxpayers have accounted for their interest as a FIF in prior income years, they would now be placed on an equal footing with taxpayers with interests in Australian superannuation funds acquired from 1 April 2006. This will also reduce the level of non-compliance in this area. (KPMG) Comment It is the view of officials that the suggested change should be accepted as that will simplify the application of the new exemption and improve the overall equity of the FIF rules as they apply to those individuals who acquire their Australian superannuation interests from 1 April 2006 and those that had acquired similar interests before that date. Although the suggested change is likely to give rise to a fiscal cost, it is expected to be small because some existing FIF exemptions relating to superannuation scheme interests have been interpreted by taxpayers as applying to them, while others have already left New Zealand. Officials also note that there are likely to be administrative costs associated with reassessments for those taxpayers who have previously been subject to the FIF rules. However, the number of reassessments should be low owing to the current level of non-compliance with the FIF rules and the application of the existing exemptions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 15 ROLL-OVER RELIEF FOR TRANSFERS BETWEEN PRESERVED SCHEMES Submission (578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 597 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The FIF rules should contain provisions for rollover relief (being the continuation of an exemption from the FIF rules for the foreign superannuation scheme interest) for transfers between schemes that are subject to strict preservation rules and restrictions on early release of benefits. Comment In the absence of a roll-over provision, a transfer between schemes may be deemed a withdrawal, which could result in the new contribution falling outside the exemption provisions. We agree with the general thrust of this submission but believe that any roll-over relief should be adopted only in relation to the proposed exemption. In other words, the roll-over relief should be limited to transfers between Australian superannuation schemes that are subject to strict preservation and restrictions on the early release of those benefits. Recommendation That roll-over relief be provided for transfers between those Australian superannuation schemes specified in the new exemption. 16 TAX TREATMENT OF WITHDRAWALS Submission (578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 589 – KPMG, 597 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 1409W – Rex Ward) The current rules relating to withdrawals of superannuation benefits where those benefits have been subject to an exemption from the FIF rules should be clarified. The rules relating to lump sum withdrawals where the taxpayer’s foreign superannuation interest is exempt under the FIF rules is unclear. Technically, any distribution from these superannuation schemes could be taxed under either the dividend or trust rules. Amounts taxed under the dividend rules could potentially include distributions of capital amounts relating to a person’s contributions. These uncertainties should be clarified, particularly when the government’s intention is to provide migrants with certainty of their tax obligations. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) There is a present risk that the exemption will disadvantage people with superannuation entitlements. If a person retires in New Zealand, the proposed exemption may actually mean the investor will pay more tax on withdrawal than would have been payable under the FIF rules. Accordingly, the integration of the rules should be considered, to ensure that exemption from the FIF rules is not counteracted by taxation on withdrawal under the trust rules. (KPMG) A provision should be inserted to clarify the tax treatment for lump sum withdrawals from foreign superannuation schemes, regardless of whether the interest is exempt from or subject to the FIF rules. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Withdrawals from eligible Australian superannuation schemes should also be tax-free in New Zealand as this would be consistent with the proposed Australian tax treatment of withdrawals from those schemes. (Rex Ward) Comment We agree with the views expressed in the submissions. Officials acknowledge that the current FIF rules do not adequately deal with the tax implications that arise on an individual’s withdrawal (especially lump sum withdrawals) of an interest from a foreign superannuation scheme where that interest meets an existing exemption from the FIF rules or the new exemption. Officials recommend that further work be undertaken on the tax implications of withdrawals from foreign superannuation schemes that have previously been subject to the FIF rules. This further work should be included in the government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be noted and that the matter be included in the government’s tax policy work programme. 17 TECHNICAL AMENDMENT Submission (594 – New Zealand Law Society) The definition of “retirement savings accounts” should refer to the Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997 (Aus). Comment Officials agree. The correct reference to the Retirement Savings Accounts Act 1997 should be cited. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 19 “Salary sacrifice”: ensuring that employer superannuation contributions are taxed fairly 21 OVERVIEW The amendments in the bill will ensure that specified superannuation contribution withholding tax (SSCWT) rates under the progressive scale will be based on the total of an employee’s salary or wages and employer superannuation contributions. The possibility of overtaxing some employees on superannuation contributions will be minimised by increasing the SSCWT thresholds in relation to the equivalent income tax thresholds. This will minimise the opportunity for taxpayers to significantly decrease their tax liabilities through the practice of excessive salary sacrifice. The bill also removes some methods of assessing tax on employer superannuation contributions that are not being used. The amendments will apply from 1 April 2007. Six submissions were received. Some supported the amendments and some opposed them. Most noted concerns with the paucity of evidence for the practice of salary sacrifice, and suggested that the amendments were contrary to the overall policy goal of increasing savings. Some submissions suggested technical amendments and amendments that would avoid potential problems. 22 LACK OF EVIDENCE FOR EXCESSIVE SALARY SACRIFICE Submission (578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 589 – KPMG, 615 – Business New Zealand) There is not enough evidence of excessive salary sacrifice to justify changing the law. SSCWT rates should continue to be based on employees’ marginal tax rates. Comment It is difficult to estimate the extent of salary sacrifice, but there is anecdotal evidence of some individuals making salary sacrifice arrangements. There is also some evidence of systematic approaches to developing and implementing salary sacrifice schemes. If salary sacrifice schemes become more common, the loss to government revenue could be significant. The proposed rules limit the possibility of extreme salary sacrifice becoming a significant threat to government revenue. The existing SSCWT rates are based on employee’s marginal tax rates, which has created the possibility of excessive salary sacrifice in the first place. When these rules were introduced it was noted that this risk existed. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 23 WIDER ISSUE OF INCENTIVES FOR SAVING Submission (578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 589 – KPMG) The proposed new rules will be a relatively efficient way of countering extreme salary sacrifice, but the issue is part of the wider issue of savings in general. The policy behind the proposed amendment is a disincentive to genuine superannuation savings. Comment The wider issue of savings in general has been considered through the portfolio investment entity proposals and the new KiwiSaver legislation. People making genuine superannuation savings will be subject to SSCWT rates no higher than, and in some cases lower than, their existing marginal tax rates, so there is no disincentive to save. Positive incentives to save via the KiwiSaver scheme, such as the initial government contribution, the fee subsidy and the exemption from SSCWT for employer contributions to KiwiSaver accounts, were added to the KiwiSaver Bill in its final stages in Parliament. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 24 ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF MINIMISING SALARY SACRIFICE Submission (578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 589 – KPMG, 1176 – Baucher Consulting Limited) Alternative methods of minimising extreme salary sacrifice could be investigated, including a monetary cap of, say, $30,000 on the amount that could be sacrificed; reviewing superannuation policy to strengthen the lock-in of savings; increasing fund withdrawal tax; strengthening the fund withdrawal rules; and using a flat rate of 21%. Comment Officials investigated other options for minimising excessive salary sacrifice, including monetary caps, caps based on a percentage of salary, subjecting all employer superannuation contributions to PAYE instead of SSCWT, allowing adjustments to the extent that employer superannuation contributions shift an employee over a threshold, using progressive bands for SSCWT, and allowing lower rates to be used for a certain proportion of employer superannuation contributions. A flat rate could result in some employees being overtaxed and, if the rate is set at a low level, would still allow excessive salary sacrifice for some higher paid employees. Officials concluded that, on balance, the better approach was that proposed in the new rule, which is less complex for employers than the other possible approaches and does not result in overtaxation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 25 6% DIFFERENTIAL SHOULD BE EXTENDED TO ALL INCOME BRACKETS Submission (578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) There is a 6% differential between the top rate of SSCWT (33%) and the top rate of income tax (39%). This differential exists only for the top rate of income tax, but it should be extended to all marginal tax rate classes. Alternatively, the 6% differential should be removed. If the differential is not removed, Inland Revenue should explicitly acknowledge that the differential can be used as a method of tax planning, to allow certainty. Comment Extending the 6% concession would have a high fiscal cost of $100 million per annum, although a substantial proportion of that cost (about $60 million) would arise from contributions to the state sector retirement scheme. The net fiscal cost would be about $40 million. It is not clear that the 6% differential is inequitable. Those benefiting from the existing 6% concession only do so because they are paying tax at a higher rate in the first place. Many taxpayers on lower rates already obtain significant relief from their effective marginal tax rates in respect of employer superannuation contributions because these contributions are not taken into account in determining entitlements to family assistance and accommodation supplements. There is no barrier to using the differential between the top rate of SSCWT and the top rate of income tax for tax planning. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 26 INCREASE THE THRESHOLD UPLIFT Submission (578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 589 – KPMG) The difference between the SSCWT thresholds and the equivalent personal income tax thresholds should be higher, not 15%, because some schemes have employer contribution rates greater than 15 percent of salary and wages (although the only examples found were schemes for high-income earners), and to encourage superannuation savings. Comment Available data suggest that 90% of employer superannuation contributions are equal to or less than 15 percent of salary and wages. High-income earners would fall into the 33% SSCWT bracket anyway, although some larger schemes which officials do not consider involve excessive salary sacrifice have higher employer contribution rates. For example, the New Zealand Defence Force scheme, which is compulsory for enlisted personnel, has an employer contribution rate of 17.9 percent, and the New Zealand Police Force scheme has an employer contribution rate of 15.2 percent for sworn personnel. Many members of these schemes fall into lower income brackets. The SSCWT thresholds could be set, say, 20 percent higher than the equivalent income tax thresholds, which should be sufficient to ensure that lower income earners are not overtaxed on employer superannuation contributions. Setting SSCWT thresholds 20 percent higher than the equivalent income tax thresholds generates the following thresholds. Proposed salary and wages and employer superannuation contribution thresholds Revised proposed salary and wages and employer superannuation contribution thresholds SSCWT rate 0 – $10,925 0 – $11,400 15% $10,926 – $43,700 $11,401 – $45,600 21% $43,701 upwards $45,601 upwards 33% Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part by setting the SSCWT rate thresholds at $11400 and $45,600. 27 REMOVING METHODS OF ASSESSING SSCWT THAT ARE NOT BEING USED Submission (578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 589 – KPMG, 1176 – Baucher Consulting Limited) Of the three submissions, one supported removing the methods of assessing SSCWT that are not being used. However, the other two argued that methods of assessing SSCWT that are not being used should be retained because they provide flexibility, and because the PAYE method is used by some overseas employers. Further, the PAYE method allows complete alignment of SSCWT and personal income tax rates. Comment If the methods are not being used, then they are not needed and so should be removed. Although having different options allows flexibility, it also increases the complexity of the system, especially if those options do not add any value by not being utilised. However, if the PAYE method is being used, as the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants suggests, it should be retained. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part by retaining the PAYE method of assessing tax on employer superannuation contributions. 28 SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTION CONTRIBUTIONS FOR NON- RESIDENTS Submission (578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) SSCWT should not be levied on superannuation fund contributions made by New Zealand employers with staff working and resident outside New Zealand. Comment This issue has been noted previously and is on the tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 29 IRD RESPONSIBILITY FOR ASSESSING AND DEDUCTING SSCWT Submission (567– Mercer Human Resource Consulting) The assessment and deduction of SSCWT should be the responsibility of the IRD, in order to minimise the complexity of the new rules for employers. Comment Cabinet has directed officials to report on this suggestion, in the cases where both employer and employee contributions to KiwiSaver are being paid via Inland Revenue. Officials are still to report to Ministers on the matter. In addition, Inland Revenue does not have the capacity in the short term to implement such a proposal. Complexity will be minimised for employers who choose to make matched employer contributions to KiwiSaver schemes, because they will be eligible for the KiwiSaver SSCWT exemption. Recommendation Note that officials will be reporting to Ministers on this proposal in the near future. 30 POSSIBLE OVER TAXATION OF SOME EMPLOYEES Submission (567 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting) The proposed changes to the SSCWT rules could result in lower income employees being overtaxed if employers opt to use the easier 33% flat rate rather than the more progressive scale. The existing rules could be maintained if certain conditions are met, with the new rules applying otherwise, to prevent abuse. Suggested conditions are: total remuneration not exceeding $100,000 and/or annual employer contributions not exceeding 15 percent of an employee’s taxable income, or annual employer contributions not exceeding, say, $50,000. Comment A two-tier system is more complex than the proposed new rules. Officials investigated various other options and concluded that the simplest approach was that proposed in the new rules. Forcing employers to use the more complex method forces an increase in compliance costs. Recommendation That the recommendation be declined. 31 ALIGNMENT OF SSCWT AND PIE THRESHOLDS Submission (567 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting) The SSCWT thresholds should be the same as the thresholds for portfolio investment entities (PIE) income. Comment PIE thresholds are based on all of a taxpayer’s income, whereas SSCWT thresholds are based on salary and wages and employer superannuation contributions alone. Employer superannuation contributions are part of an employee’s remuneration, so it is more appropriate to use a threshold based on the equivalent income tax thresholds. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 32 CLARIFICATION OF WORDING Submission (977 – Bell Gully) The use of the word “relates” in Clause 126 (33) of the bill, which defines the SSCWT rate threshold amount, and in Schedule 1 Part C of the Income Tax Act 2004 should be clarified. It is possible that payments made in one year “relate” to a previous income year. However, the policy intent is that the word “relates” is intended to be a reference to the time that the superannuation contribution is paid by the employer. The word “relates” could create confusion over which base should be used for assessing SSCWT. “... in the tax year to which the specified superannuation contributions relates” should be replaced by “... in the tax year in which the specified superannuation contribution is to be made on behalf of the employee.” Comment Like the treatment of salary and wages, the tax liability on employer superannuation contributions should be assessed at the time that those contributions are actually paid. The use of the word “relates” could cause confusion. The suggested wording could still create confusion, but it could be eliminated by referring to the year in which contributions are paid. This is consistent with taxing employment remuneration in the year in which the employee is paid, not when the income is accrued. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part by amending the bill and Schedule 1 Part C of the Income Tax Act 2004 so that they refer to the year in which employer superannuation contributions are paid. 33 Allowing documents to be removed for inspection 35 OVERVIEW The amendment will give the Commissioner the power to remove documents for inspection. This power will assist Inland Revenue in its investigation of tax evasion and avoidance schemes (such as cases involving abusive GST refund claims) and in particular facilitate the forensic examination of documents. Currently, sections 16, 16B and 17 of the Act, relating to access to premises and requisitions for information, constitute the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s main information gathering powers. These sections do not give the Commissioner any power to retain and inspect the documents without taxpayers’ express permission. It may not, however, be feasible to ask a taxpayer for permission to retain and inspect documents as the person may refuse to provide the requested document or may even destroy it. Although it is an offence to fail to provide information to the Commissioner when required to do so by a tax law, a person may prefer to face a monetary penalty for not complying with such laws rather than be prosecuted for a more serious offence such as fraud or tax evasion based on the documents requested. There are a number of other reasons for giving the Commissioner the power to remove, retain and inspect documents. Having original documents satisfies the “best evidence” rule by which Courts may view an original document more favourably than a copy. This provides the best evidential basis for prosecution. Additionally, it may be necessary to forensically examine an original document. This may happen, for example, when there is a dispute as to who has created the document or whether the information contained in the document has been altered. The importance of information to the discharge of the Commissioner’s duty to collect taxes is well established. The Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance (1998) stated that: “Information is the lifeblood of the Inland Revenue Department’s taxpayer audit activity”. The Privy Council in New Zealand Stock Exchange and the National Bank of New Zealand v CIR (1991) 13, NZTC 8,147 discussed the public policy justification for Inland Revenue’s information-gathering powers in the following terms: “The whole rationale of taxation would break down and the whole burden of taxation would fall only on diligent and honest taxpayers if the Commissioner had no power to obtain confidential information about taxpayers who may be negligent or dishonest”. There were nine submissions on the proposal to allow documents to be removed for inspection. Most of the submissions express concern with the administration and operation of the proposal. To improve the system of checks and balances on the use of the proposed power, officials have recommended that a new provision be added to the amendment to require the Commissioner to seek a warrant from a judicial officer before the exercise of the power. 36 GENERAL OPPOSITION Submission (1176W – Baucher Consulting Limited) Existing sections 16 and 16B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 are extensive enough. Furthermore, the Commissioner has not offered any direct evidence of the abuses such as the deliberate destruction of documents. Stiffer penalties for the deliberate destruction of documents are recommended. Comment The amendment fills a clear gap in the Commissioner’s information gathering powers, and does not represent a significant extension of these powers. Secrecy obligations prevent officials from publicly disclosing specific cases, but difficulties faced by Inland Revenue in the field are the reason why the resources have been committed to promote this amendment. Although penalty provisions could apply if documents are destroyed, the application of a penalty does not result in the relevant information being obtained by the Commissioner. Therefore, the proposed amendment allowing Inland Revenue to remove and retain documents is directed at obtaining the information. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 37 OBTAINING COPY OF AN ORIGINAL DOCUMENT AND THE COST OF THE COPY Submission (578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 594 – New Zealand Law Society, 589 – KPMG, 568 – Corporate Taxpayer Group, 615W – Business New Zealand, 668 – Saint, 970W – Crocker) Submissions seek to ensure that the Commissioner considers the right of taxpayers to obtain copies of original documents. The documents taken should be immediately copied, with the copied version handed to the business as soon as possible. (Business New Zealand) There must be a duty on the part of the Commissioner to provide the taxpayer with a copy of the material that is removed. (New Zealand Law Society) A new section should be introduced to require the Commissioner to provide a certified copy, at the Commissioner’s expense, of the documentation that is removed. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Who bears the cost of any copies required and the timely delivery or availability for collection of the copies. It also indicates that there is a cost to the taxpayer of having to re-sort and re-file the documents removed. (KPMG) The taxpayer must first have an opportunity to copy the documents that are to be removed. (Saint and Crocker) Comment In relation to the issues of the availability of copies of removed documents for taxpayers and the cost of making copies, officials consider that the current procedures are satisfactory to both taxpayers and the Commissioner. Under the current legislation, the owner of a document that is removed is entitled to inspect and obtain a copy of the document. When the taxpayer requests copies of documents, the Commissioner will make copies of the documents for the taxpayer at the Commissioner’s expense. An objective of the rules is to disrupt taxpayers’ affairs as little as possible. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 38 SAFEGUARDS AGAINST ABUSE OF POWER Submission (589 – KPMG, 568 – Corporate Taxpayer Group, 1176W – Baucher Consulting Limited) A comprehensive framework should be established to ensure that the Commissioner strictly adheres to the spirit of the legislation and does not seek to make the exercise of the power a day-to-day occurrence. The power should only be delegated to a sufficiently high level, such as the level equivalent of “Manager Investigations” or above. (KPMG) There is concern about the administration of checks and balances that will apply in relation to the power and with the delegation of the power to the level of a “Team Leader” in investigations. (Corporate Taxpayer Group) There is concern about the extension of the Commissioner’s powers without detailing checks and balances to apply to Inland Revenue officers. (Baucher Consulting Limited) Comment Officials note that there are already many constraints on the exercise of Commissioner’s information-gathering powers. Inland Revenue officers are subject to the normal administrative law requirements. These require any public powers to be used for their proper purpose and to be exercised in good faith. Additionally, the internal Inland Revenue rules will preclude official powers from being used for any improper purpose. Disciplinary procedures are in place and will apply in any such case. The proposed new power will not be delegated to an individual investigator but would only be delegated down to a managerial level. Officials consider that setting the level of delegation too high would unduly reduce the efficiency of the powers. Officials believe that the level of a Team Leader, Investigations, is an appropriate level for delegation as it preserves a right balance between safeguarding against the unconstrained use of the power and administrative efficiency. It is intended that the Commissioner’s proposed power to remove documents for inspection will be applied to taxpayers mainly at the top of the Inland Revenue’s “compliance model”, typically in fraud/evasion and/or avoidance type cases. This would be similar to the way the Commissioner applies the current power to remove documents for copying. In addition, under the heading “Legislative controls”, it is proposed that to amend the bill to ensure that documents cannot be removed for inspection unless a warrant has been issued. The warrant will be issued by a judicial officer, normally a District Court Judge, who will need to be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for requiring documents to be removed for inspection. Recommendation That the submissions be declined but see the recommendation under the heading “Legislative controls”. 39 DOCUMENTS UNDER LEGAL PRIVILEGE Submission (568 – Corporate Taxpayer Group, 594 – New Zealand Law Society) It should be made clear that the Commissioner is not entitled remove and retain documents that are subject to legal professional privilege and advice privilege. (New Zealand Law Society) Regard should be had to allowing the taxpayer to review documents for legal privilege rights and non-disclosure rights before the Commissioner may remove and retain documents. (Corporate Taxpayer Group) Comment The proposed amendment does not prevent a taxpayer from claiming legal professional privilege or the non-disclosure right, with respect to relevant books and documents, under sections 20 and 20B to 20G of the Tax Administration Act 1994. With respect to legal professional privilege, where the Commissioner does not challenge such a claim the Commissioner cannot and will not remove and retain the relevant documents. When it is necessary to determine a legal professional privilege claim, an appropriate process will be followed pending the necessary proceedings. Section 20(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 authorises both the Commissioner, and the affected person to apply to a District Court Judge for an order to determine whether the legal professional privilege claim is valid. With respect to the non-disclosure right, where the Commissioner does not challenge such a claim the Commissioner cannot and will not remove and retain the relevant documents, although the Commissioner may request that the taxpayer provide the relevant tax contextual information. When it is necessary to determine a non- disclosure right claim, an appropriate process will be followed pending the necessary proceedings. Section 20G(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 authorises both the Commissioner and the affected person to apply to a District Court Judge for an order to determine whether the non-disclosure right claim is valid. Where the Commissioner removes and retains documents before a taxpayer has been able to review the relevant documents for legal professional privilege and the non-disclosure right. Examples of these situations are where a taxpayer is not at the relevant premises, where the taxpayer has given permission to the Commissioner to clone a hard drive at the Commissioner’s premises, or the taxpayer has given permission to the Commissioner to remove and retain documents but wishes to maintain his or her legal privilege and/or non- disclosure rights – Inland Revenue intends that the taxpayer will still have those rights. We note that these issues will be able to be further considered as part of the normal post- implementation review of the non-disclosure rights. Officials note that the proposed amendment is subject to sections 20 and 20B to 20G of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 40 LEGISLATING CONTROLS Submission (578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 594 – New Zealand Law Society) If the amendments are to be enacted, a new section should be included to specify the controls on the Commissioner in operating these provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The Commissioner’s power to remove or retain any books or documents should, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, specifically be limited in section 16B to circumstances where a taxpayer has failed to produce those books and documents under a section 17 notice. It is submitted that section 16B should not take the place of section 17. (New Zealand Law Society) The exceptional circumstances where section 16B can be used to remove or retain original documents in the absence of a section 17 notice need to be articulated in section 16B and adjudged by the warrant of a District Court Judge. The Society’s submission is that these circumstances are: • where the Judge is satisfied that the Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe the taxpayer is going to leave New Zealand; and/or • where the Judge is satisfied that the Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe that the taxpayer has acted fraudulently, taking into account the criminal tests of fraud. (New Zealand Law Society) Where a taxpayer has not complied with a section 17 notice and section 16B is used to remove books and documents, the Commissioner’s ability to retain original books or documents for use as evidence in Court should be subject to a warrant from a District Court Judge. Furthermore, the taxpayer should be notified of the application to the Court, except that the application can be ex parte in the two exceptional circumstances as mentioned in the previous paragraph. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment To closely circumscribe the Commissioner’s proposed power in the legislation could invite numerous challenges to the scope of the power by those at the top of the “compliance model” at whom the power is directed, and it could therefore render the power ineffective. A better system of checks and balances is provided by Inland Revenue’s internal procedures, delegation of the power down to Team Leader level only, and normal administrative law requirements, which require any public powers to be used for their proper purpose and to be exercised in good faith. Inland Revenue has extensive training programmes in place to educate investigators about their powers and the safeguards on those powers. In the event that powers are used inappropriately, disciplinary procedures are in place and will apply. 41 Moreover, to impose detailed legislative restrictions on the Commissioner’s power to remove and retain documents would be inconsistent with the other information- gathering powers of the Commissioner (for example, section 17) which are broadly drafted. It is not desirable to have a requirement for a section 17 notice before the proposed removal power is exercised in cases at which the amendment is directed, that is, evasion and avoidance cases. In these circumstances, if a section 17 request has to been made first, the person may refuse to provide the requested document and destroy it. This would defeat the whole purpose of the Commissioner’s power to remove documents, which is to assist the Commissioner to obtain information in evasion and avoidance cases. The exceptions to the requirement to apply section 17 first, suggested by the Law Society, are too narrow to allow the effective application of the proposed power. However, to improve the system of checks and balances on the use of the proposed power, officials recommend that an amendment be made to the bill to ensure that documents cannot be removed for inspection unless a warrant has been issued. The warrant will be issued by a judicial officer, normally a District Court Judge, who will need to be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for requiring documents to be removed for inspection. Recommendation That an amendment be made to ensure that documents cannot be removed for inspection unless a warrant has been issued. 42 TIME LIMIT ON RETAINING DOCUMENTS Submission (594 – New Zealand Law Society) The Commissioner’s ability to retain original books and documents should be limited in section 16B to a maximum four month period. This timeframe should be sufficient for the Commissioner to test those books and documents and is to ensure that the taxpayer also has the ability to obtain evidence from testing those books and documents. Comment Officials note there will be a statutory requirement to return documents when the inspection is completed. In many cases the inspection could be completed within the four month period suggested by the Law Society. However, the actual time required for testing depends on the facts and circumstances of the particular case. There may be exceptional cases where longer than four months is required for testing. A one- size-fits-all approach is not desirable. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 43 RETURNING THE DOCUMENTS TO DEFEND AN ACTION Submission (668 – Saint, 970W – Crocker) Taxpayers have no means or certainty of return of a document should the taxpayer decide to defend a later action. Comment One of the reasons for the proposed amendment is to provide certainty that original documents will be available to the Court if necessary. A taxpayer will also be able to obtain a copy of any document removed and retained. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 44 REMOVAL OF ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT Submission (578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The items fundamental to the operation of the business such as personal computers and laptops, hard drives and printers, and fax machines should not be removed. Comment The new power will allow the Commissioner to remove and retain “books and documents”. The term “book and document” is defined in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to include “all books, accounts, rolls, records, registers, papers and other documents and all photographic plates, microfilms, photostatic negatives, prints, tapes, discs, computer reels, perforated rolls, or any other type of record whatsoever”. Although the definition is a broad one, it is not interpreted by the Department to include the electronic equipment of the type mentioned in the submission. The Commissioner’s practice is to clone computer hard-drives on taxpayers’ premises. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 45 LOSS OF DOCUMENTS BY THE COMMISSIONER Submission (594 – New Zealand Law Society) If the Commissioner loses or is unable to locate the taxpayer’s original books or documents and does not provide the taxpayer with a copy of those original books or documents, then the taxpayer’s burden of proving matters that can only be proved by those books or documents should be deemed to be satisfied, and/or it should be specifically provided under section 138G(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 that the hearing authority will allow the taxpayer to admit other evidence, despite the evidence exclusion rule. Comment Officials do not consider that the proposal is feasible. It would be inappropriate to shift the burden of proof or disapply the evidence exclusion rule if the lost document was not significant. This raises the question of how the significance of a document could be determined. Other potential issues raised include the extent to which the burden of proof should be shifted and how this could be determined in a particular case. Also, if Inland Revenue has mislaid a document, it may not be able to meet the necessary evidential threshold for raising a valid assessment. This may provide a measure of protection to taxpayers in this circumstance. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 46 DRAFTING OF AMENDMENT Submission (597 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The Commissioner’s powers should be worded more precisely to ensure that its meaning is clear and that the circumstances in which it may be used are defined more precisely. It should be made explicit that “full and complete inspection” includes forensic testing. The words allowing the Commissioner to use documents as evidence in court proceedings should be moved from the definition section to the substantive section. Comment Officials consider that it is unnecessary to make it explicit that the Commissioner’s power to inspect includes forensic testing. The phrase “full and complete inspection” inevitably implies that the Commissioner may perform all necessary tests, including forensic tests. Officials also consider it unnecessary to relocate the legislative power to use removed documents as evidence in Court from the definition section to section 16B. The term “full and complete inspection” is also used in section 17 of the Tax Administration Act and making such a drafting change would have implications for the meaning of the term in that section. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 47 Other policy matters 49 EXEMPTION FOR MILITARY SERVICE IN OPERATIONAL AREAS Clause 10 Issue: Support for the exemption Submission (616W – National Council of Women of New Zealand (Inc.)) While this exemption may not apply to a significant proportion of the income of the men and women of the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) on designated operation duties, the intent is seen as worthy. Comment The submission should be noted. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Remove the exemption Submission (578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 615W – Business New Zealand) The exemption should be removed on the basis that it undermines the principle of horizontal equity – that is, two people on the same level of income should pay the same amount of tax. Operational allowances paid to military personnel in operational areas should be subject to tax but correspondingly increased to ensure the net (after tax) allowance is the same as it would have been had the allowance not been taxed. If the government wishes to increase the rewards to members of the NZDF who serve in operational areas, it should increase Vote: Defence Force for the purposes of allowing the Ministry of Defence to increase its taxable remuneration to military personnel in operational areas. 50 Comment Officials do not agree with this submission because it would lead to higher compliance costs for the NZDF and higher administrative costs for Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Social Development (MSD). These costs would arise as a result of efforts to negate any flow-on effects for a person’s entitlement to family assistance, student loan obligations, child support assessments (unless a custodian makes a successful application for administrative review on the basis that the liable parent has increased capacity to pay) or entitlements under the Social Security Act. Operational allowances are not intended to have any effect on a person’s social policy entitlements or obligations. If operational allowances were grossed up by the amount of the tax, and then subject to tax, these allowances would need to be included in a person’s taxable income and PAYE deducted at source by the NZDF. The NZDF would also need to exclude these allowances from the calculation of a person’s student loan repayment obligation. In addition, these allowances would need to be included in a person’s personal tax summary but excluded from any end-of-the-year calculations undertaken by Inland Revenue in relation to that person’s family assistance entitlements and or child support liabilities. The exemption approach means that operational allowances to which the exemption applies would not be treated as income for the purpose of calculating student loan repayments, family assistance entitlements or child support assessments for liable parents (unless a custodian makes a successful application for administrative review on the basis that the liable parent has increased capacity to pay). The government intends to make Regulations under the Social Security Act to provide that allowances subject to the exemption are not counted as income when assessing a person’s entitlement to social security benefits and allowances. This is consistent with the government’s view that operational allowances should not affect eligibility to social assistance entitlements. An exemption simplifies the overall payment process for NZDF staff, removes administrative difficulties with the current payment process that involves the MSD and the NZDF, and minimises the administrative implications for Inland Revenue. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 51 Submission (578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) If the preceding submission is not accepted, sections CW 19(2)(b) and CW 19(3), which enable the Ministerial Committee to exempt from income tax an amount of income paid to NZDF staff in operational areas, should be removed from the bill. These provisions breach the established principle that the power to tax (or not to tax) vests in Parliament, and not in Ministers of the Crown. Comment Officials agree that the power to tax (or not to tax) indeed resides with Parliament in New Zealand. The relevant authority for this proposition is found in the Bill of Rights Act 1688. However, officials are concerned about the Institute’s analysis of the legality of the Ministerial Committee being given the power to exempt from income tax an amount of income paid to NZDF staff in operational areas. Officials believe that the Institute’s submission is misplaced as it does not distinguish between delegating a decision-making right as to whether or not tax is imposed and the case where a decision-maker without Parliament’s express authority decides whether or not tax is imposed. If the exemption remains in the bill as drafted and the bill passes, the Ministerial Committee deciding on the exemption would be “with consent of Parliament” and would be lawful. Therefore, there would be no problem with the Bill of Rights Act 1688 as an Act of Parliament would give the Ministerial Committee its power “not to tax”. It is the view of officials that the power of the Ministerial Committee to decide that certain amounts of income are exempt from income tax would be lawful if Parliament were explicit that such was its intention and the Ministerial Committee kept within its delegated authority. This would be achieved if clause 10 of the bill was enacted. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Extend exemption to apply to New Zealand Police personnel Submission (562 – New Zealand Police Association) The proposed exemption should apply to allowances paid to New Zealand Police personnel serving in “operational areas”. 52 Comment Officials agree with this submission. New Zealand Police personnel are involved in a number of overseas deployments and carry out a variety of operational and peacekeeping duties, often working alongside the New Zealand Defence Force. If New Zealand Police personnel are serving in operational areas any allowances paid to them directly and solely for serving in those areas should automatically be exempt from income tax. Officials also consider that the Ministerial Committee should have the ability to exempt from income tax the pay and other allowances paid to New Zealand Police personnel who are serving in operational areas in the same way as pay and other allowances paid to NZDF personnel. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Include the Minister of Police in the definition of “Ministerial Committee” Submission (562 – New Zealand Police Association) The Minister of Police should be included in the definition of “Ministerial Committee”. Comment Under the exemption, a Ministerial Committee will continue to have the ability to exempt from income tax the pay and other allowances paid to members of the New Zealand Defence Force (and the New Zealand Police, if the above recommendation is accepted) who are serving in operational areas. If the exemption is extended to apply to operational allowances paid to New Zealand Police personnel serving in operational areas, it is appropriate that the Minister of Police be included in the Ministerial Committee that has responsibility for determining whether the standard pay and other allowances paid to persons serving in operational areas are exempt from income tax. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 53 SPREAD OF INCOME ON SALE OF PATENT RIGHTS Clause 45 Issue: Spreading of taxable income on sale of patent rights Submission (568 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The proposed three-year spread on the sale of patent rights is supported. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Consistency with the sale of other “technology rights” Submission (578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The taxation of the sale of patent rights should be consistent with the sale of other “technology rights”. Comment Other technology rights are treated as assets, with gains on sale not considered taxable income unless the vendor is a trader in “technology rights”. Patents can generate income either through licensing the patent and earning a stream of royalties, which is assessable income, or by selling the patent. Gains on the sale of patent rights are treated as assessable income to ensure consistency with the treatment with income earned by licensing patent rights. The consistency ensures that decisions about whether to license or sell patents are not driven by tax consequences. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 54 Issue: Depreciable property Submission (578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) It should be clarified that patent rights are “depreciable property”, given that there can also be a deduction for cost when gains on sale of a patent are calculated. Comment Patents and the rights to use patents are already included in Schedule 17: Depreciable intangible property. Section DB 31 allows both a depreciation deduction and a deduction for cost when calculating the gain on sale of a patent. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Consistency of wording Submission (597 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Proposed section EI 3B(1) should be reworded so that it refers to the sale of patent applications and patent rights, which is consistent with the heading of section CB 26. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 55 CHARITABLE DONEE STATUS Clause 89 Submission (578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The submission agrees with the proposed additions to the list of approved donee organisations in section KC 5(1) of the Income Tax Act 2004. Inclusion in this list allows individual taxpayers to claim a rebate of 33 1/3 percent of the amount donated, to a maximum of $630 a year for all donations made. The submission has suggested that the government consider increasing the maximum. Comment United Future’s Confidence and Supply Agreement with the government includes a review of the charitable donations rebate. The review, which is planned for later this year, will be considering this issue. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (978W – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The organisation The World Swim for Malaria Foundation should be added to the list of approved donee organisations in section KC 5(1) of the Income Tax Act 2004. Comment Organisations seeking listing in section KC 5(1) are subject to an approval process which includes consideration by Cabinet. Granting approval in the manner sought would circumvent this process and would therefore be unfair to all other organisations which have been subject to it. Officials will report to Ministers on this application in due course. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 56 THE IMPUTATION SYSTEM AND COMPANIES TREATED AS NOT BEING RESIDENT UNDER A DOUBLE TAX AGREEMENT Clause 113(1) Issue: Drafting Submission (578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The definition of “foreign company” (in section OB 1) should be used in section ME 1(2)(b), instead of the new wording introduced by clause 113(1). Comment It would not be appropriate to use the definition of “foreign company” in section OB 1. That definition covers both non-resident companies and resident companies treated as not being resident under a double tax agreement. Section ME 1(2)(b) deals only with the latter category. It provides an exception to general rule that resident companies must establish and maintain an imputation credit account. The new wording introduced by clause 113(1) is similar to that used in equivalent provisions elsewhere in the Income Tax Act. (See, for example, sections IG 2(11)(b)(ii) and LF 1(2)(v).) Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The language used in provisions equivalent to section ME 1(2)(b) could be standardised, to aid interpretation and application of these rules. Comment There are a number of provisions in the Income Tax Act that refer to companies’ resident status under a double tax agreement. The Rewrite Project is responsible for rewriting the Income Tax Act in plain language. Officials will consider the scope for standardising the relevant provisions as part of the Rewrite Project’s work on Parts F to O of the Act. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 57 Issue: Accuracy of the commentary Submission (594 – New Zealand Law Society) The Commentary to the bill says that the amendment to section ME 1(2)(b) made by Clause 113(1) “clarifies” the law and that the removed words are “descriptive” and “\[set\] out the general consequence of deemed non-residence under a double tax agreement”. The Commentary does not accurately articulate the historical position because the equivalent section in the Income Tax Act 1976 originally had the same effect as Clause 113(1) is intended to achieve, but had to be amended to deliver the policy intent of the imputation regime. The Commentary should accurately reflect the historical position. Comment The Commentary is correct as it stands. The equivalent section in the Income Tax Act 1976 was section 394B. This was introduced by section 55 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 5) 1988. Under section 394B as originally enacted, a company that was resident in New Zealand but treated as not resident under a double tax agreement was required to establish and maintain an imputation credit account. Section 394B was amended by 61(1) of the Income Tax Amendment Act 1989, which introduced new paragraph (aa). Paragraph (aa) was the equivalent to section ME 1(2)(b), which Clause 113(1) amends. From the outset, the drafting of paragraph (aa) was similar to the current drafting of section ME 1(2)(b). The rule now at section ME 1(2)(b) has therefore been similarly cast since it was first introduced. Clause 113(1) does not remove that rule and revert to the position before the changes made by the Income Tax Amendment Act 1989. As stated in the Commentary, it simply clarifies the drafting of the rule. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 58 CONSOLIDATED GROUPS AND FOREIGN LOSSES Clauses 126 and 162 Issue: Proposal contrary to the original policy intention of the consolidated group rules Submission (578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 597, 597b – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposal is contrary to the original policy intention of the consolidated group rules, as Parliament did not make the consolidation loss rules consistent with group loss rules at the time of enactment. Comment While it was not clear whether this issue was considered at the time of enactment of the consolidation rules, the loss rules for consolidation do appear to indicate that it was expected that all the rules governing losses, including those for dual resident companies, would be incorporated. However, the drafting appears not to have achieved this. No explicit concession was ever intentionally given to consolidated groups. This amendment is, therefore, consistent with the rules applicable to consolidated groups. The consolidation rules were introduced to reduce compliance costs, not to provide tax advantages over groups of companies that do not consolidate, and so the amendment is appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Consolidated rules analogous to branch treatment Submission (597, 597b – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 1279 – Deloitte) The consolidated group rules are analogous to, and should be made consistent with, company-branch treatment. They should not be aligned with the standard grouping rules. 59 Comment Officials accept that in some situations the loss treatment received by dual resident companies within a consolidated group is analogous to the treatment received by a foreign branch of a New Zealand company. However, this amendment is simply to align the tax treatment of consolidated and non-consolidated groups. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Amendments should focus on specific areas of concern Submission (1279 – Deloitte) The amendments are unnecessarily broad. They should be focussed on the specific areas of concern rather than making all dual resident companies ineligible to be a member of a consolidated group. The effect of the amendments is to make dual resident companies ineligible to become or remain members of a consolidated group, which is broader than denying loss offsets to dual resident companies. Comment Officials agree that amending the definition of “eligible company” has the effect of making the amendment wider than strictly necessary. However, in order to specifically deny loss offsets to dual resident companies within a consolidated group, all dual resident companies would need to effectively de-consolidate and prepare separate tax accounts, but group only if in profit. The rules required to carve out the dual resident companies within a consolidated group would be extremely complex. This effectively defeats the purpose of the consolidation rules. Therefore, from a compliance perspective, it is more practical to make a dual resident company ineligible to be a member of a consolidated group. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 60 Issue: Tax residence not easily manipulated Submission (1279 – Deloitte) The proposal is unnecessary as a company’s tax residence cannot be easily manipulated. Comment While officials accept that some aspects of tax residence cannot be easily manipulated, other aspects can be. For example, the residence test based on a company’s directors can be manipulated through the movement of the directors outside New Zealand. Furthermore, in the case of New Zealand, incorporation can also be moved to other jurisdictions. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Full consultation needed Submission (594 – New Zealand Law Society, 568 – Corporate Taxpayer Group, 1279, 1279a – Deloitte) The proposals should be removed until the full Generic Tax Policy Process, including full consultation, is undertaken. Comment As this is a base maintenance issue, it was not appropriate to apply the Generic Tax Policy Process. Full consultation was not undertaken in order to prevent further opportunities for taking advantage of the misalignment of the rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 61 Issue: Unit trusts may be excluded from consolidation Submission (578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 1279 – Deloitte, 597 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Unit trusts cannot meet the requirement that that the entity must be incorporated in New Zealand, as a unit trust cannot be incorporated. Comment The grandparenting provision proposed below ensures that the current law (which does not require incorporation) applies to companies, including unit trusts, who have met certain criteria. Therefore the amendment will generally not disadvantage unit trusts that rely on the existing definition. This is an existing issue that is also relevant to the loss rules, as a loss company must be incorporated in New Zealand before its losses can be offset against the income of profit companies. The issue is also relevant to other provisions which refer to incorporation. If there is an issue in practice, it should be dealt with on a comprehensive basis rather than only in the context of a single provision. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Grandfathering provisions Submissions generally supported the intent of the Supplementary Order Paper 44, which protects the position of existing consolidated groups where the consolidated group has made provisional tax payments before 17 May 2006. However, submissions considered that the grandfathering provision should be extended. Submission (568 – Corporate Taxpayer Group, 578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 589a – KPMG, 594 – New Zealand Law Society, 597, 597b – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 1279, 1279a – Deloitte) The amendment should be made on a prospective basis with effect from the 2007-08 income year. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Corporate Taxpayer Group, Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers, New Zealand Law Society) Alternatively, the amendments should enable consolidated groups existing at 17 May 2006 to apply the existing tax rules to the end of their current income year. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) 62 The amendment should grandfather existing non-financing, dual resident companies which had applied to join a consolidated group prior to the 17 May 2006. (Deloitte) The position for the 2005-2006 year should be protected for all taxpayers. The position for the 2006-2007 year should be protected for taxpayers who have relied on the previous legislation, or at least the position should be protected for taxpayers who have had their first provisional tax instalment date prior to the date of the amending SOP, being 20 June 2006. (KPMG) Comment As this is a base maintenance issue, the amendment, as it currently stands, applies from the 1997-1998 income year. This reduces the likelihood that taxpayers will retrospectively take advantage of the discrepancy in the current law by seeking to have their assessments for previous years amended. The amendment does not apply to taxpayers who are part of existing consolidated groups where the consolidated group has made provisional tax payments before 17 May 2006. However, officials agree that the position for all companies should be protected for their 2006-2007 and earlier years if they have elected to join the consolidated group before 17 May 2007, regardless of their provisional tax instalment date. To minimise any possible compliance costs, officials agree that it would be appropriate to grandfather certain existing dual resident companies. These companies must be in business other than a financing business, and must have applied to be a member of a consolidated group before 17 May 2006. This proposal would generally resolve the concerns raised by submissions by grandfathering dual resident entities that are genuine trading companies. A financing business will be determined by comparing the company’s interest expense to its total allowable deductions. A dual resident will not be an “eligible company” if its interest deductions (or deductions under the accrual rules ignoring foreign exchange fluctuations in the debt) for each year are more than 50 percent of total allowable deductions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 63 Issue: SOP – requirement that the taxpayer be a member of a consolidated group Submission (597, 597b – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The requirement that the consolidated group has had its first provisional tax instalment date prior to 17 May 2006 should be removed and replaced with the requirement that the application to become a member had been made before 17 May 2006. Comment Officials agree that the grandfathering provision should be changed to require that the member had applied to be part of a consolidated group by 17 May 2006. Under the SOP as it currently stands, the taxpayer is required to be a member of a consolidated group as at 17 May 2006. However, a taxpayer can backdate the application to the start of the group’s income year in some circumstances. If an application is made within 63 working days of the start of the group’s income year, the taxpayer will be deemed to be a member of a consolidated group from the beginning of the income year. Further, a newly created company can apply to be part of a consolidated group at any time during the income year, and that company will be deemed to be a member of the consolidated group from the start of the income year (as long as the application is made within 63 working days of the incorporation of the new company). To prevent such companies from backdating their application, it is therefore appropriate to require that the member had applied to be part of a consolidated group by 17 May 2006. As noted above, officials agree that the requirement that the consolidated group has made its first provisional tax payment before 17 May 2006 should be removed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 64 Issue: Drafting issues Submission (1279 – Deloitte) Paragraph (e), requiring that a company be incorporated in New Zealand or carry on a business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment, appears to allow some dual resident companies to join consolidated groups. However, the requirement in paragraph (f) that a company must not be liable to income tax under the law of another jurisdiction by reason of domicile, residence or place of incorporation is unlikely to ever be met. Paragraph (e)(ii) is therefore rendered practically ineffective. Comment The bill’s addition of paragraphs (e) and (f) in the “eligible company” definition simply aligns the loss rules for consolidated groups with those for non-consolidated groups. There are some fact situations covered by paragraph (e) that would not also be covered by paragraph (f). Recommendation That the submission be noted. Submission (1279 – Deloitte) Paragraph (e)(ii) seems to allows New Zealand tax losses of a dual resident company to be included in the New Zealand tax consolidated group. However, the consolidation rules do not allow for only part of a company to be included in a consolidated group. This needs to be clarified. Comment The intention of the amendment is to align the loss rules for consolidated groups with those for non-consolidated groups. Inclusion of paragraph (e)(ii) is therefore not intended to change the basis on which consolidated groups are taxed. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 65 Submission (1279 – Deloitte) Paragraph (f) should be removed as it is unclear what purpose it serves. The reference to the law of a foreign jurisdiction is problematic. Comment The requirement in paragraph (f) is a current rule for companies joining groups that are not consolidated, and has applied for a number of years. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (1279 – Deloitte) Guidance should be provided as to what happens where there is only one other New Zealand company within a consolidated group. Comment As a consolidated group can continue if it has only one member, officials do not consider that guidance is necessary. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (1279 – Deloitte) The consequences of exiting a group (such as depreciation recoveries) should be provided for. Comment The rules normally applicable to companies exiting a consolidated group under section FD 8 will apply. Consequences such as depreciation recovery will be dealt with under existing rules. It is therefore unnecessary to enact new rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 66 ANNUAL CONFIRMATION OF INCOME TAX RATES Clause 3 Issue: Support for a broad base, low-rate tax policy Submission (578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The government should restrict the conditions that make tax avoidance attractive by adopting a broad base, low tax rate policy. The existing differential income tax split between corporate and trustee and personal marginal tax rates is causing significant compliance costs domestically as individuals seek to find the most tax efficient business structure. Comment The submission should be noted. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 67 COMMISSIONER MAY ISSUE AN ASSESSMENT WITHOUT FIRST ISSUING A NOPA Clause 149 Issue: Amendment unnecessary and should not be proceeded with Submission (578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 594 – New Zealand Law Society, 1176 – Terry Baucher, Baucher Consulting Limited) The proposed amendment is unnecessary and should not be proceeded with. It derogates from the disputes resolution procedures. (New Zealand Law Society, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The Commissioner should not be able to effectively waive the two-month response period for his own administrative convenience. (Terry Baucher, Baucher Consulting Limited) There are already sufficient procedures available to the Commissioner to issue assessments without following the disputes procedures. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Even if fraudulent activity exists, this does not necessarily mean that the Commissioner’s ability to collect tax is affected. If the proposed amendment proceeds it needs an additional requirement that the Commissioner’s ability to collect tax is directly affected. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment The purpose of the notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) and notice of response (NOR) phases of the disputes resolution process is to encourage an “all cards on the table” approach to tax disputes to ensure that all relevant evidence, facts and legal arguments are canvassed. In the normal course of a dispute initiated by Inland Revenue, the Department would issue a NOPA and the taxpayer has two months to respond by issuing a NOR. If the taxpayer does not respond, then Inland Revenue can issue an assessment. This process is appropriate in the majority of tax disputes. However, section 89C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 lists a limited range of circumstances in which the Commissioner may issue an assessment without first issuing a NOPA. These exceptions recognise that there are situations in which it is appropriate that the NOPA and NOR process not be followed – for example, to reduce compliance or administrative costs and for revenue protection purposes. 68 Fraudulent behaviour by taxpayers is at the extreme end of non-compliant behaviour. Processes that are appropriate and designed to facilitate compliance among the majority of taxpayers who aim to comply with the law are not necessarily appropriate for situations involving deliberate non-compliance. In situations involving fraudulent behaviour it is necessary for Inland Revenue to be able to issue an assessment and begin debt recovery activity quickly. The NOPA and NOR process can be time consuming and resource-intensive, particularly in situations where a fraudulent scheme has involved a number of taxpayers. The consequent delay in issuing an assessment to allow time for the NOPA and NOR process delays the beginning of the debt recovery process, and the funds available for collection may be reduced. Some situations in which the proposed amendment will apply will also be covered by an existing exception – for example, section 89C(e). This exception covers the situation where the Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe that a notice may cause the taxpayer to take steps in relation to the existence or location of the taxpayer’s assets that make it harder for the Commissioner to collect the tax from the taxpayer. However, this potential overlap will only occur in some situations involving taxpayer fraud. It is important to note that taxpayers will still have dispute rights in respect of any resulting assessments made by Inland Revenue, as a taxpayer may issue a NOPA in response to the Commissioner’s assessment. The proposed amendment will enable the Commissioner to begin tax debt recovery sooner when taxpayers choose not to exercise their dispute rights. Consequently, this amendment will help ensure that the revenue base is protected and the Commissioner’s resources are used in the most appropriate way without limiting the taxpayer’s dispute rights. Recommendation That the submission be declined Issue: Circumstances in which the exception will apply need to be more tightly defined Submission (578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 594 – New Zealand Law Society) If this amendment proceeds the following changes are required: • Its application should be tightly defined by reference in the legislation to the criminal tests of fraud. (New Zealand Law Society) 69 • Guidance and safeguards should be provided as to what is considered to be “fraudulent” and what level of evidence the Commissioner should have before this power can or should be exercised. The threshold that the Commissioner only has to “believe” the taxpayer “may” have been involved in fraudulent activity is too low. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment Officials agree that it is desirable for taxpayers to have certainty as to when this provision will be applied. The terms “fraud” and “reasonable grounds” are used in a range of different provisions in the Revenue Acts and consequently have well- established meanings developed through case law. Therefore officials do not agree that it is necessary to define these terms in the Tax Administration Act 1994. However, officials consider that the wording of the provision can be tightened by removing the words “may have” to provide that the exception only applies where the Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe that the taxpayer has been involved in fraudulent activity. Recommendation That the submission be partly accepted, as detailed above. Issue: Delegation level Submission (578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 594 – New Zealand Law Society) If the amendment proceeds: • The legislation should specify which officers of the department can exercise a judgment as to fraudulent activity. (New Zealand Law Society) • Judgements as to the possible existence of fraud and decisions to issue an assessment without first issuing a NOPA need to be made at a senior level of Inland Revenue with tightly defined criteria for application. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment Section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 enables the Commissioner to delegate specific powers to such officers of the department as the Commissioner thinks fit. As the delegation of his powers is a matter for the Commissioner to determine, the delegation of specific powers is set out in administrative guidelines rather than included in legislation. 70 Officials agree that the decision on whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that fraud exists and whether it is appropriate to issue an assessment should be made at a senior level of Inland Revenue. This is reflected in the delegations for the existing section 89C(eb) exception, which is currently delegated to the managerial level, and it is anticipated that this delegation level will be maintained. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part, as discussed above. Issue: The entire disputes process should be reviewed Submission (1176 – Terry Baucher, Baucher Consulting Limited) The entire disputes resolution process should be reviewed to clarify, simplify and speed up what is now a convoluted process. Comment The disputes resolution process was introduced in 1996 in response to the recommendations of the Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Department and was the subject of a comprehensive post-implementation review in 2003. As a result of that review, a number of legislative amendments were enacted in 2004, to ensure that the process is meeting its objectives of resolving tax disputes fairly and efficiently. Consequently, officials do not consider that it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive review of the disputes rules. However, officials will monitor the disputes process to ensure it continues to meet its objectives and will respond to specific issues as they arise. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 71 GST AND FINANCIAL SERVICES Clause 164 Issue: Support proposed change Submissions (568– Corporate Taxpayers’ Group, 576 – New Zealand Venture Capital Association Incorporated, 589 – KPMG, 578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 594 – New Zealand Law Society, 597 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Submissions agree with proposal to treat certain activities involving actively managed investment in connection with equity securities and participatory securities as supplies of financial services. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Passive investment in equity securities and participatory securities Submissions (595 – AXA, 597 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) All investors should be able to treat investments in equity securities and participatory securities as supplies of “financial services”. (AXA) The amendment should apply not only to activity investment but passive investment. The amendments create a bias between active and passive investment. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment Balancing competing considerations – removing tax cascades while taxing the consumption of financial services The amendment is the product of further consultation with interested parties following the commencement of rules on 1 January 2005 that allow the supply of financial services to be zero-rated in a business-to-business context. The policy intent behind those rules is to address the creation of tax cascades brought about by exempting goods and services from GST. 72 Tax cascades arise when irrecoverable GST incurred by a taxpayer is passed on by way of higher prices for goods and services sold by that taxpayer. In the context of equity investment, investors may require higher rates of return from investments to offset any irrecoverable GST. While this impact may not strictly be a “tax cascade”, there are similar economic effects if the inability to deduct input tax results in businesses having to produce higher returns. In the context of equity investment, these effects could potentially result in the following outcomes: • Business may need to increase prices for their goods and services if there is a need to provide higher returns to compensate for the irrecoverable tax cost. • The tax cost may have to be absorbed by businesses through reducing the extent to which retained earnings are reinvested so that shareholders continue to receive a higher rate of return. The removal of tax cascades, however, needs to be balanced against the policy objectives of exempting financial services. Notwithstanding the zero-rating reforms that commenced on 1 January 2005, supplies of financial services in New Zealand are generally still treated as exempt from GST. Exempting the supply of financial services effectively treats financial services providers as if they are final consumers, thereby ensuring that financial services do not escape the GST net and are to a degree aligned in this respect with other services. When tax cascades should be removed Consultation leading to the development of the amendment suggested that the balance between removing tax cascades and the objective of taxing financial services using exemption was weighted against activities providing active equity investment. In relation to equity investment, the argument concerning the creation of tax cascades is strongest in cases when venture capital investment funds and investment companies provide a significant level of expertise and management to businesses in connection with making an investment in the equity of those businesses. This is because the cost of providing the expertise and management is more likely to be borne directly by the entity in which the investor has an ownership interest than would be the case with investment that is more passive in nature. The courts in both New Zealand and the European Union have considered the circumstances when equity investment is an activity that should be included in the GST base and the providers of that activity should be able to deduct input tax. In general, the boundary depends on the nature of the investment. Investment that is passive and involves the receipt of dividends or similar receipts is generally not considered to give rise to a taxable activity involving the provision of goods and services for a consideration. For example, a one-off business-to-business transaction and direct investment by households in equity securities would not generally constitute a taxable activity. Passive investment should be treated as final consumption and not give rise to an entitlement to deduct input tax. 73 If the amendment were changed in the manner suggested by submissions, officials consider there is a risk that the policy behind the financial services exemption would be undermined. The amendment aims to avoid providing concessionary treatment to the consumption of financial services by households if they choose to directly invest in the share capital of an entity. There may be instances where business-to-business investments in shares that do not meet the active test in the bill but give rise to tax cascades in a similar manner to business-to-business investment in debt. Officials are happy to discuss the details of these types of transactions with interested parties. In the meantime, the amendment is deliberately drafted narrowly to ensure that taxpayers are not brought within the GST base because of any isolated or one-off direct equity investment and prevent households from registering for GST in connection with direct equity investment. Because of this potential risk, officials consider that a conservative approach to the amendment outweighs the potential benefits of removing every incidence of tax cascades in the economy. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Supply made for a consideration Submissions (597 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) A deeming rule should be introduced to provide that investing in equity securities and participatory securities is for a consideration. The value of the supplies in proposed section 3(1)(kb) should be specified. Comment Officials consider that the GST Act’s current definition of “consideration” is sufficiently broad to deal with the concern raised by the submission. The amendment contemplates that the supplies in the amendment will be for a consideration. An exception to this view is the situation when the only activity is the receipt of dividends in connection with equity investment. For example, a person investing in shares will not be treated as making a supply for a consideration if the only thing received by the person is dividends. In those circumstances the person is not considered to be carrying on a taxable activity as they are not supplying goods and services for a consideration. 74 The amendment is directed at situations when an entity, either an investment company or venture capital fund, invests in the share capital of another entity and actively manages that investment by, for example, involvement in the strategic direction of the company or the provision of advice. The definition of “actively managed investment” is considered on page 74. The consideration given by the entity to the investor in response to this activity may take a variety of forms. “Consideration” is typically thought of in terms of discrete amounts or obligations, such as explicit fees. “Consideration” can also take the form of margins in certain circumstances. While the application of the GST Act to margins has not been considered by the courts, the GST Act provides specific rules – for example, sections 10(12), 10(14) and 10(15A) – on the valuation of supplies that are calculated on the basis of margins, and the idea has been considered and approved in other jurisdictions. 1 Inland Revenue’s guidelines on the application of the zero-rating of business-to-business supplies of financial services also recognises that financial services providers price their services in a variety of ways and accepts that consideration can be in the form of either discrete fees or margins. 2 To deem the supply to which the amendment applies to be for a “consideration” could have the effect of widening the scope of the amendment beyond that intended. Indeed, the submission could have the effect of overruling the GST Act’s definition of “taxable activity”, which is intended to limit the obligation to charge and return GST to activities that are of a business-like nature. If this limitation were removed it would be possible for households to register for GST in connection with direct share ownership in companies and for one-off business holdings to be treated as taxable activities. The submission raises a second concern about the value of the supplies to which the amendment applies. Officials note that Inland Revenue’s GST guidelines for working with the new zero-rating rules for financial services will apply to taxpayers that seek to zero-rate active investment services under the amendment. Inland Revenue’s guidelines provide commentary on valuing supplies of financial services and the application of the GST Act’s apportionment rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 1 See Commissioners of Customs and Excise v First National Bank of Chicago Case C-1792/96. 2 GST guidelines for working with the new zero-rating rules for financial services. See page 64, Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin Vol. 16 No 10 (November 2004) 75 Issue: Definition of “actively managed investment” Submissions (576 – New Zealand Venture Capital Association Incorporated, 589 – KPMG, 597 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The definition of “actively managed investment” should be changed so that it applies to investments that: • are equal or greater than 10% of all the participatory securities and equity securities issued by an entity; or • allow the investor to influence the management of the entity in which the investment is made. Alternatively, an investor should not lose the status of actively managing an investment if as a result of subsequent events the investment falls below 10%. Comment Meaning of the term “actively managed investment” As currently worded “actively managed investment” means an investment that: • is equal to or greater than 10% of all participatory securities and equity securities issued by the entity into which the investment is made; and • allows the investor, or a person associated with the investor, to influence the management of the business of the entity. Submissions recommend that the two limbs be disjunctive. Arguments against making the limbs disjunctive tests Officials have noted under the heading Passive investment in equity and participatory securities that the amendment is directed at active investment in the share capital of another entity (the investee). We therefore do not agree that taxpayers should be treated as making supplies of financial services if the investment represents 10% of an investee’s share capital but does not allow the investor to influence the management of the investee. To do so would potentially allow passive investment to give rise to input tax deductions. We therefore do not agree that the first limb should operate without reference to the second limb. The second limb considers whether the investment allows the investor an active role in the management of the investee entity. The submissions from New Zealand Venture Capital Association Incorporated (576) and PricewaterhouseCoopers (597) note that the ideas behind the words “management” and “influence” are broad. Officials agree with factors identified by the New Zealand Venture Capital Association Incorporated, such as a seat on the Board, providing management advice, or involvement in the strategic direction of the company, which taxpayers should have regard to when determining whether an investment gives the investor influence. 76 Officials consider that without the first limb it is possible the second limb may need to be reworded to impose a higher level of management influence. It would be necessary to place a more restrictive interpretation on what constitutes “influence” to ensure that passive investment was not included in the scope of the amendment. Officials therefore disagree that the two limbs should be made disjunctive. Alternative suggestion Submissions raise a second point that the definition should provide for situations when an investment interest that initially meets the criterion of an “actively managed investment” but fails following subsequent investment by other parties has the effect of diluting the initial investment. The submission by New Zealand Venture Capital Association (576) at page 7 gives the example of three venture capitalists that take a 20% interest in a target company. After a number of years, the target company becomes successful, and additional investors buy into the target company. The effect of the subsequent investment dilutes the original investment by the venture capitalists and means that they no longer qualify to treat the investment as a supply of financial services. The submission notes that this problem can be rectified if the original venture capitalists combine their interests using another entity through which they invest. The submission considers that this is an unnecessary use of resource and recommends that the first limb of the definition require only that the initial investment exceed 10%. Officials are concerned that if the definition is amended along the lines suggested, it would make it difficult for taxpayers to build up interests that would meet the criterion of “actively managed investment”. While the problem raised by submissions may be typical of investment holdings in the venture capital sector, officials consider that the amendment should not disqualify taxpayers that seek to acquire an initial passive interest in a target company and gradually build on that interest to the point where they can influence the management of the investee. Officials understand that investment interests where influence is exercised are usually greater than 10%. Officials acknowledge that there will be exceptions to this observation because of the mana, personality or specialist know-how possessed by an individual investor. Officials consider, however, that these exceptions are at the margin and that the GST Act may already provide a solution, particularly if the individual investor carries on a taxable activity of providing taxable supplies such as management advice or acting as a director. These supplies would allow the investor access to input tax deductions. Officials further note that the problem identified in submissions can be addressed in the manner suggested in the submission from New Zealand Venture Capital Association. Individual investors faced with the possibility of falling below 10% can aggregate their interests in another entity to preserve their interest in the investee. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 77 Issue: Active management exercised through an independent manager Submissions (576 – New Zealand Venture Capital Association Incorporated, 589 – KPMG, 597 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The second part of the definition of “actively managed investment” applies when an investor or a person associated with the investor is able to influence the management of the investment entity. It is common within the venture capital industry for the manager to be an independent entity. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Paragraph (b) of definition of “actively managed investment” should be amended to include situations when the investor uses an independent third party to influence the management of an investee. 78 GST ON FRINGE BENEFITS Clause 165 Issue: Support proposed change Submissions (568 – Corporate Taxpayers’ Group) The submission agrees with the proposed change Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Application date Submissions (578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The application date of the proposed change should be either 1 October 1986, the date GST commenced, or 10 October 2000 the date the GST treatment of vouchers changed. Comment Officials agree that the correct policy result is not to impose GST in situations when an employer has been unable to deduct input tax in connection with providing a fringe benefit. The issue is whether the amendment should be retrospective or prospective. When the issue of retrospective legislation has previously been considered by this Committee, officials have argued that retrospective legislation is justified when it restores or at least does not contravene the rational and legitimate expectation of all parties. This principle does not, however, justify retrospective changes in the law to implement a policy decision that, had it been made at the time, would have been reflected in the legislation. In any event the practical consequences of retrospective legislation are not sufficiently certain for officials to recommend that the change be made retrospective. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 79 GST GROUPING RULES No clause (refer SOP No 45) Issue: Clarification that representative member must be a registered person Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment is necessary to ensure that the representative member of a GST group is a registered person. Comment Section 55(3) of the GST Act requires one person in a GST group to be the representative member. The section is based on the current requirement that all members of the group are registered for GST. If clause 165B is enacted, this will no longer be the case. It is arguable that a taxpayer may choose an unregistered person to be the representative member of a GST group. This potentially presents a number of systems problems in terms of Inland Revenue receiving GST returns from a person that is technically not recognised as legally being able to charge GST. Officials recommend that section 55(3) be amended to ensure that the representative member is a GST-registered person. It is recommended that the amendment apply from 1 October 2001, in line with the application date of the amendments in SOP 45. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Drafting clarification Submissions (597 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The amendment to section 55(1) of the GST Act should clarify that the test allowing unregistered companies to be included in a GST group measures the ratio of taxable supplies to total supplies to third parties and does not include intra-group transactions. The change ensures that only supplies to persons outside the GST group are measured. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 80 ELECTION TO ZERO-RATE SUPPLIES OF FINANCIAL SERVICES – DRAFTING CIRCULARITY No clause Submissions (576 – New Zealand Venture Capital Association Incorporated, 589 – KPMG) The reference to “registered person” in section 20F(1) should be a reference to “person”. Section 20F(1) currently requires GST-registered persons to elect to zero-rate supplies of financial services to businesses. However, if a person carries on an activity that involves supplying financial services within New Zealand that person is not considered to be carrying on a taxable activity and is prevented from registering for GST. Therefore a person making exempt supplies is not a registered person and is not able to made zero-rated taxable supplies that would enable them to register for GST. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Section 20F(1) should be amended so that it refers to a “person” rather than a “registered person”. Officials recommend that the amendment apply from the date the bill is enacted. 81 CAPITAL RAISING COSTS No clause Submissions (597 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Businesses should be able to deduct GST incurred as part of raising capital. Recent overseas developments in the European Union and Canada support the deduction of input tax in connection with raising capital. Comment Officials note that the submission does not directly relate to the GST amendments in this bill. While there is an arguable connection with raising capital through the issue of equity securities and participatory securities and the amendment treating active investment in these financial instruments as a financial service, the submission seeks to widen the ground on which businesses are able to recover input tax for supplies that are currently treated as exempt supplies. As noted under the heading Passive investment in equity and participatory securities, officials consider that businesses that supply financial services should be treated as final consumers. An exception to this policy applies if the financial services are: • exported, in which case consumption occurs outside New Zealand and should be zero-rated, or • supplied to businesses, in which case if the supplier has elected to do so, should be zero-rated to reduce the incidence of tax cascades. In all other circumstances, officials consider that the supply of financial services should be treated as exempt supplies, and businesses should be unable to deduct GST incurred in making those supplies. This policy is consistent with the objective of GST taxing the widest range of goods and services supplied in New Zealand and recognises the practical difficulties associated with directly imposing GST on financial services. The submission notes that some European Union member countries have started allowing businesses input tax deduction in connection with capital raising following the European Court of Justice (ECJ) decision Kretztechnik AG v Finansamt Linz. 3 The analysis underpinning the ECJ decision has been considered by officials, and the issue has been included in the tax policy work programme. Officials note that under the business-to-business rules for financial services, New Zealand businesses are able to recover a greater percentage of GST incurred in connection with share capital issues to business than was previously allowed before the introduction of the rules. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 3 Case C-465/03 26 May 2005. 82 GST ON IMPORTED SERVICES – RELATED PARTY CHARGES No clause Submission (307W – KPMG) Section 10(15C) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act) does not contemplate the situation when a non-resident makes a supply of services to a resident where either the non-resident or the New Zealand resident (or both) are not companies or unit trusts. This omission means that the value of related party charges subject to the reverse charge cannot be reduced for any salary or interest charges. Comment The issue identified by the submission is not directly connected with the proposed GST changes contained in this bill. Under the reverse charge, which imposes GST on certain imported services, taxpayers may reduce the taxable value of certain imported services to take into account internal salaries, wages and interest costs. The reduction applies when the costs are allocated from a non-resident parent or head office to a New Zealand-based subsidiary or branch. The problem identified by the submission is one of a number of remedial legislative matters that have been identified following the introduction of the reverse charge. These issues are currently on the tax policy work programme. The concern identified by the submission will be added to this work. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 83 REMOVING GST FROM LOCAL AUTHORITY RATES Clauses 164 and 165 Submissions (616W – National Council of Women of New Zealand Incorporated) The submission recommends removing GST from local authority rates. Comment The submission implies that the amendments in the bill to treat actively managed investment as a supply of financial services and remove GST on fringe benefits when the employer is unable to deduct input tax are a departure from the policy that New Zealand’s Goods and Services Tax Act apply to widest possible range of goods and services supplied in New Zealand. Officials disagree and note that the submission is not connected with the GST proposals in the bill. Clause 164 is designed to deal with problems arising from the exemption of certain financial services. Clause 165 is designed to ensure that fringe benefits are not subject to GST twice in certain circumstances. These amendments do not affect the size or scope of the GST base in terms of taxing final consumption in New Zealand. Removing GST from local authority rates would on the other hand reduce the effectiveness of GST as a broad base, low rate tax. The imposition of GST on local authority rates is justified on policy and administrative grounds. Rates are the means by which local authorities charge for the provision of community goods and services such as sewerage, libraries, flood control, and goods and services supplied directly to households, such as water. As such, rates represent consideration for a supply of goods and services. This was the view of the Advisory Panel on Goods and Services Tax, which considered public submissions on the proposed operation of GST in 1985. The Panel observed that the application of GST on rates had caused considerable concern on the part of ratepayers, but concluded that rates should be viewed as payment for the services provided by local authorities. The services represent consumption by ratepayers and GST, being a tax on consumption, should apply. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 85 Remedial amendments 87 TAXATION OF BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURE Clauses 2(8), 11, 47, 48, 49, 132, 142 and 158 New rules for business environmental expenditure were enacted on 21 June 2005 and took effect from 10 June 2005. The changes clarified and expanded tax deductions available for business environmental expenditure. They were made to ensure that all business operating costs, including those for dealing with environmental concerns, are taken into consideration in calculating taxable income, and that the timing of such deductions is appropriate. A number of remedial changes were made to clarify the new business environmental rules and ensure that the original legislation has its intended effect. The two submissions were supportive of the proposed changes to the business environmental expenditure rules. Issue: Support for amendments Submission (589 – KPMG, page 42, 616W – National Council of Women of New Zealand (Inc)) The new application date for the new meaning of “industrial waste” is supported. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 88 Issue: Transfer of ERA deposits to Ministry for the Environment Submission (Matter raised by officials) The section EK 16 reference to funds being transferred to the Ministry for the Environment should be removed. Comment The business environmental rules contain an Environmental Restoration Account (ERA) mechanism that allows business taxpayers, through making a deposit, to set aside a portion of their tax payments to pay for future site restoration and monitoring expenditure. The ERA rules were designed so that deposits in an ERA follow the related restoration liability. Therefore when taxpayers dispose of their restoration liability to another taxpayer (say, through the sale of a site) the related funds in the ERA are transferred to the new owner. It was originally thought that the liability might, in effect, be transferred to the New Zealand government (for example, where there is an orphan site). In this case, section EK 16 provided for any related ERA deposit to be transferred to the Ministry for the Environment. Subsequent work by officials indicates that this is now unlikely. As such, it is no longer necessary to provide for a transfer of funds to the Ministry for the Environment. Recommendation That the recommendation be accepted. Issue: ERA of Consolidation Group Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section EK 20, which deals with the ERA of a consolidated group, should make specific reference to the ability of a nominated company to make transfers. Comment The current wording of section EK 20 allows the nominated company for a consolidated group to make ERA payments and applications for refunds on behalf of the consolidated group. For completeness, the nominated company should also be allowed to make and receive ERA transfers. Recommendation That the recommendation be accepted. 89 TAX DEPRECIATION TREATMENT OF PATENTS Submission (597 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) There is an error in the Commentary on the bill relating to the application date, which should be acknowledged in the Tax Information Bulletin on the new legislation, once enacted. Comment The submission comments that references in the Commentary incorrectly refer to “patent applications with complete specifications lodged before 1 April 2007”. The reference should instead be “patent applications with complete specifications lodged before 1 April 2005”. Officials agree that the correct reference is “patent applications with complete specifications lodged before 1 April 2005” and will clarify this in the Tax Information Bulletin on the new legislation once enacted. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The “costs of patent rights and applications” should be defined for the purposes of the Income Tax Act so that it includes any “costs of invention” provided that these costs have not been claimed as a deduction under section DB 26 (which allows deductions for research and development expenditure) or any other provision of the Act. Comment The submission comments that invention costs may be “black hole” expenditure owing to investors not being able to claim this expenditure under the deductibility provisions for research and development (section DB 26) or opting to capitalise this expenditure. The submission considers that, in these circumstances, invention costs should be included in the cost of patent rights and depreciated. As noted in the submission, in December 2005 the Commissioner of Inland Revenue released an interpretation statement in which he concluded that “invention costs” should not be included in the cost of a patent. Officials consider that this is the correct result because the patent is a separate asset which gives the holder property rights and protections over the use of a product or process. The invention may be the product or process that is patented. 90 To include the costs of invention in the costs of patent rights and applications would also create significant uncertainty as to whether invention costs should be immediately deducted under the research or deductibility provisions or be capitalised and depreciated as part of the cost of a patent. It should further be noted that the government’s recent Business Tax Review discussion document contains an option to provide deductions for so-called “black hole” expenditure, generally. This option would seem to be more applicable to invention costs for which a deduction cannot currently be claimed. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 91 DEPRECIATION RULES Issue: Economic rate for plant, equipment or buildings with high residual value Submission (597 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposed application date is too broad in application so does not achieve its goal of applying section EE25 E to plant and equipment acquired on or after 1 April 2005 and buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005. The scope of the application of this provision should be narrowed. Comment We agree with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Definition of “motor vehicle” Submission (578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The definition of “motor vehicle” should be changed to refer to vehicles not available for hire for a period of longer than one month, vehicles which are taxis, vehicles which are minibuses and vehicles which qualify for a “passenger service licence” under the Transport Services Licensing Act 1989 but not vehicles which qualify for a “goods service licence” under the same Act. Comment The proposed definition of “motor vehicle” is “vehicles which are designed exclusively or mainly to carry people and has seats for no more than twelve people”. We consider this definition is clear and does not require definitions for such terms as “taxi” or “available for hire”. A design-based approach, rather than a use-based approach, as recommended in the submission, seems to more clearly focus on the underlying asset than a use-based approach would. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 92 Issue: Amendment of section EE 25D(2) Submission (1221 – Ernst & Young) Section EE 25D(2) of the Act should be amended to enable aircraft used for top dressing or spraying to be depreciated at rates under sections other that EE 25D. Comment We agree that section EE 25D(2) does apply to aircraft used for top dressing or spraying and this is not the policy intention. Recommendation That section EE 25D(2) be amended to reflect the policy intent. 93 DEATH AND ASSET TRANSFERS Clause 80 Submission (578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) For the avoidance of doubt, the proposed wording in section FI 6 should be amended from “to which subpart FF applies if the beneficiary of the property is within the second degree” to “to which subpart FF applies if the person who is beneficially entitled to receive the property within the second degree”. Comment The amendment ensures that roll-over relief applies to forestry assets at the date of a taxpayer’s death, irrespective of whether a life tenant is entitled to part of the trust property, and irrespective of who the trustees of the estate are. Officials consider that the amendment makes it clear that the roll-over applies if the beneficiary of the forest is related within the second degree to the deceased taxpayer. We consider that no further change or clarification is required. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Clause 81 Submission (597 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The heading to section FI 7 should be amended to read “Relationship of subpart FI to subpart CB”. Comment Currently, section FI 7 is headed “Relationship of section FI 2(2) to subpart CB”. Section FI 2(2) requires certain property to be transferred at market value for tax purposes. Subpart CB deals with income from business or trade-like activities; specifically, profits on certain sales of land are deemed to be taxable income. If section FI 7 did not exist the effect, for the purposes of determining the amount of income relating to those transactions, property would be deemed to be disposed of at market value. Accordingly, officials consider that the heading for section FI 7 is appropriate and should not be changed. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 94 Clause 151 Submission (578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Clause 151 should state that provisional and terminal tax due in the year in which the taxpayer’s death occurs are paid by due date. Comment The intention is that concessionary use-of-money interest rules should apply to any income tax liability arising in relation to the period that ends with the taxpayer’s death (subject to the condition that relevant liabilities are paid on time). A clarification is required to clause 151 to reflect this policy. Recommendation That clause 151 be amended to ensure that the concessional treatment applies only if provisional tax and terminal tax relating to the year of death are paid by the due date. Clauses 80, 81(4), (5) and (6) and 151 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The commencement date for these clauses in clause 2 of the bill should be amended from 21 June 2005 to 1 October 2005. Comment The substantive death and asset transfer provisions were enacted in the Taxation (Base Maintenance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2005. Although the Act received Royal assent on 21 June 2005, the death and asset transfer provisions did not come into force until 1 October 2005. Accordingly, the commencement date for clauses 80, 81(4), (5), and (6) and 151 should be 1 October 2005, rather than 21 June 2005. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 95 SHARE-LENDING RULES Clauses 2(13), 103, 123 and 142) Submission (729W – Ernst & Young Limited, pages 2-4) The reference to an associated person in section ME 5(1)(ac) is unnecessary and should be removed. Comment The definition of “returning share transfer” in section OB 1 includes an associated person test. As part of introducing the share-lending rules, section ME 5(1)(ac) was also amended to include a reference to “a person associated with a share user”. The intention of the change was to cancel the benefit of imputation credits arising from a returning share transfer that does not qualify as a share-lending arrangement. It has been submitted that the reference to “associated person” in the definition of “returning share transfer” is sufficient to achieve the desired result of cancelling the tax benefit obtained by a share user (or associate) in a returning share transfer. Ernst & Young Limited consider that the reference to an associated person in section ME 5(1)(ac) is unnecessary, creates unintended outcomes, particularly for those in the financial services industry, and should be removed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 96 REWRITE ADVISORY PANEL – RECOMMENDED CHANGES Issue: Reversal of intended changes Submission (Matters raised by officials on the recommendation of the Rewrite Advisory Panel) Intended changes in legislative outcomes in the Income Tax Act 2004 as part of the project rewriting the Income Tax Act should be reversed. The provisions involved are sections DO 6 and DP 3 of the Act (sections DO 5 and DL 2 of the Income Tax act 1994) in so far as they relate to certain aquaculture and forestry expenditure incurred before the 1995-06 income year. Comment In rewriting sections DO 5 and DL 2 of the 1994 Act as sections DO 6 and DP 3 of the 2004 Act, application of these rules to qualifying aquaculture and forestry expenditure incurred before the 1995-06 income year was omitted. The basis for this omission was that the provision was spent. This proposal was set out in the Exposure Draft of these provisions, released for public comment in September 2001, and also in the Income Tax Bill 2002. These draft provisions were also reviewed by private sector tax specialists. No submission received before enactment of the Income Tax Act 2004 suggested that the omission of application of these rules to qualifying aquaculture and forestry expenditure incurred before the 1995-06 income year proposal was in error. As a result, sections DO 6 and DP 3 of the 2004 Act do not apply to certain aquaculture and forestry expenditure incurred before the 1995-06 income year. Earlier this year, the Rewrite Advisory Panel received a submission that there remain some taxpayers with qualifying expenditure incurred before the 1995-06 income year. The Panel noted that the non-application of these provisions to this expenditure was an intended change. However, the Panel recommended that officials consider reinstating the application of these rules to the qualifying expenditure. Officials agree with this recommendation as it is clear that some taxpayers with qualifying aquaculture and forestry expenditure incurred before the 1995-06 income year will be adversely affected unless sections DO 6 and DP 3 of the 2004 Act apply to this qualifying expenditure. Recommendation That the proposed amendments to restore the outcomes of the 1994 Act be included in the bill and that they apply from the beginning of the 2005-06 income year, that being the commencement date of the 2004 Act for all taxpayers. 97 Issue: Clause 34 (sections EE 33 and EE 34 of the Income Tax Act 2004) Submission (1221-12 – Ernst & Young) The proposed new sections EE 33(4) and EE 34(3) should provide that the tax depreciable cost limitations in subsections (3) and (2) respectively will not apply to items other than depreciable intangible property where the Commissioner decides that it is appropriate to use the cost of the item. The reference to the Commissioner deciding this matter should be deleted and taxpayers should be allowed to treat their actual cost or the market value price deemed as the transfer price under other provisions of the Act as their tax depreciable cost base for all tangible items. Comment Sections EE 33 and EE 34 are being amended on the recommendation of the Rewrite Advisory Panel. The Panel concluded that section EE 33 contains an unintended change in law in that it is not restricted to transfers of property between associated persons, as was the case under the Income Tax Act 1994. Clause 34 corrects this unintended change and reverses the order of sections EE 33 and EE 34 of the 2004 Act. The submission does not relate to these changes, but instead comments on a provision in sections EE 33(4) and EE 34(3), which is the same as the equivalent provision in the current Act. These subsections have not been amended by this bill but are simply a re-statement of the existing law. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Section CB 11 Submission (574 – Staples Rodway) Section CB 11 should be amended to include the words “to the extent that the amount is derived from the carrying on or the carrying out of the undertaking or scheme”. Further the scope of the section would be more appropriately confined if it was subject to sections CB 18 and CB 21 (business and investment exclusions). 98 Comment This submission is making the same points on section CB 11 as has been put to the Rewrite Advisory Panel, chaired by Sir Ivor Richardson. Those submissions to the Panel have argued that the omission of the words “to the extent” has led to an unintended change in law. This argument has not been accepted by the Panel, which has stated publicly on its website that it is not persuaded that an unintended change in law has occurred in the drafting of section CB 11. Officials agree with the conclusions of the Rewrite Advisory Panel. We also note that the submission seems to be requesting that an amendment to section CB 11 be inserted into the current bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 99 FAMILY ASSISTANCE REMEDIAL PROVISIONS Submission (578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 616W – National Council of Women of New Zealand (Inc)) Neither organisation has specific submissions to make on these changes, although the National Council of Women of New Zealand (Inc) (NCWNZ) finds the re-defined definitions helpful. However, each submission takes the opportunity to make more general observations about the family assistance provisions in the Income Tax Act 2004. The New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants comments on the complicated nature of the legislation relating to family assistance and considers that a thorough review of the legislation is needed to identify opportunities for simplification and clarity. The NCWNZ reminds the government of its policy of a Universal Child Benefit as a more appropriate instrument to assist all families. Comment It is understood that New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants has made a submission on the exposure draft of the Rewrite of Part K of the Income Tax Act 2004. The Rewrite is the appropriate vehicle for achieving greater simplicity and clarity of the family assistance legislation. One of the key objectives of the Working for Families package of assistance was to ensure income adequacy, with a focus on low and middle-income families with dependent children to address issues of poverty, especially child poverty. Providing assistance to all families would inevitably mean that the available funds would have to be spread more thinly, meaning there would be a less positive impact for families whose income is inadequate to meet their needs. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 100 LIMIT ON REFUNDS AND ALLOCATIONS OF TAX Clause 112 Submission (578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The change is supported because it corrects an anomaly in the existing provisions. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Submission (578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The wording of clause 121 should be aligned with that of clause 161. Comment Clauses 121 and 161 amend the 1994 and the 2004 Income Tax Acts respectively, to extend the circumstances when tax overpaid before a breach in shareholder continuity can be refunded. The drafting of the amendment to the 2004 Act (clause 121) incorporates a change made in the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006 to the same underlying section. As the amendment made in the 2006 Amendment Act does not apply until the 2008-09 income year, it should not have been included in the current amendment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 101 FRINGE BENEFITS Clause 115 Submission (597 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The exemption in the proposed section ND 1A(1F)(b) should apply to vehicles owned or leased by the employer or associated person for five years since the beginning of the period of the employer’s initial return for the vehicle. Comment The amendment in the bill requires that vehicles for which an initial FBT return has been made by the employer before 1 April 2006 must be valued in return periods after that date at their cost price. An exception is provided when a vehicle has been owned for at least five years from the beginning of the initial return period, in which case the employer then has the option of using either the vehicle’s cost price or tax value. The reason this exception does not extend to vehicles leased for at least five years is that, as we understand, leases do not last five years and hence we wished to avoid adding further qualifications to what is already complex legislation. However, it may be possible that an employer has both owned and leased the same vehicle for at least five years; for example, the vehicle may have been owned for three years and then sold by the employer to an associated person and leased back. The suggested change made by the submission would allow for this possibility, and we see this as being consistent with the original policy intention. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (594 – New Zealand Law Society, 578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Any interest and penalties suffered by taxpayers arising from the retrospective nature of the change in clause 115 should be waived. Comment The amendments in clause 115 are proposed to apply for FBT return periods beginning on or after 1 April 2006. Both the Law Society and the Institute of Chartered Accountants consider these amendments to be a fundamental change to the law enacted earlier this year. Given that taxpayers will have to file FBT returns based on their reasonable interpretation of that law for a couple of return periods before any law change is passed, the submissions argue that taxpayers should not suffer any 102 penalties or interest if their positions are subsequently revised by back-dated changes in the law. Officials question the extent to which the changes in clause 115 are a fundamental change rather than a clarification of the earlier law change. But we do agree that taxpayers who take a reasonable interpretation of the law should not in this instance incur penalties should the changes in clause 115 result in a revision in their FBT liability for returns made before the law change was made. Officials do not, however, agree that this waiver should extend to interest because use-of-money interest merely reflects the time value of the underpaid tax rather than being a penalty, and the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has very limited ability to waive interest. The Commissioner can remit interest when it is consistent with the collection of the highest net revenue over time. In this regard, the Commissioner will need to consider each case on its own merits but, as a general rule, interest will be remitted when an Inland Revenue officer has given incorrect advice (for example, if the taxpayer has directly been given an incorrect date or amount for tax payment) or when the taxpayer has relied on incorrect information contained in an Inland Revenue publication. Retrospective legislative change would not, however, qualify as general grounds for a waiver. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in relation to waiving penalties but declined in relation to waiving any interest. Submission (594 – New Zealand Law Society) There should be public acknowledgement, such as commentary in a Tax Information Bulletin, that new section ND 1A(1E) represents a change in the law. Comment As noted in the previous submission, officials question the extent to which the changes in clause 115 are a fundamental change rather than a clarification of the earlier law change. For example, we would argue that the area of doubt relates essentially to the treatment of vehicles leased before 1 April 2006 rather than to owned vehicles. Consequently, we consider that the more appropriate focus should be on resolving the practical implications rather than on to what extent law is being changed. The proposal to waive penalties, as outlined in the previous submission response, should address any practical implications of the amendment, and this aspect would be covered in a Tax Information Bulletin. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 103 Submission (578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Clause 115 should be amended to remove the proposed section ND 1A(1E)(b)(ii). Comment The submission considers that section ND 1A(1E)(b)(ii) is already covered by section ND 1A(1E)(b)(i) and is therefore superfluous. Officials disagree. Provisions b(i) and b(ii) specify which vehicles have to use the cost price method. Provision (b)(i) refers to vehicles that were owned, leased or rented during the initial return period for the vehicle, being a period beginning before 1 April 2006, whereas b(ii) refers to vehicles owned, leased or rented before 1 April 2006. There is a difference in the coverage of the two provisions. Provision b(i) covers the general case of previously leased vehicles that were already subject to FBT in return periods beginning prior to 1 April 2006. In contrast, provision b(ii) is designed to cover 9-to-5 and flip-flop leased vehicles which, because they were outside the FBT net prior to 1 April 2006, would have had no initial FBT return period before that date. Hence, removing b(ii) would enable 9-to-5 and “flip- flop” leased vehicles to be valued under the tax value option and would hence significantly reduce the tax liability below that intended in such cases. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (Matter raised by officials) How the tax value of a vehicle is calculated when it is acquired from an associated person should be clarified, in particular that if the new owner wishes to use the tax value option then: • When the associated person had either used the cost price method or had not used any method at all, the new owner would need to use the higher of their cost price and the cost price to the associated person as the basis for their tax value. • When the associated person had used the tax value method, then the new owner would use the higher of their cost price and the tax value of the associated person as the basis for their tax value. This change would apply from the date of enactment of this bill. 104 Comment A problem has been identified with the way that section GC 16 interacts with clause 3 of Part A of Schedule 2. Section GC 16 requires that when a vehicle is acquired from an associated party, the new owner of the vehicle must, for FBT purposes, value that vehicle at the higher of its cost price to the associated person or the cost price to the new owner. This rule ensures that an FBT liability cannot be lowered through switching ownership of the vehicle back and forth between associated parties to get a new lower cost price each time. Because section GC 16 predates the latest FBT changes, it does not have any rules about what is the tax value when a vehicle is transferred between associated persons. Since the aim is to produce comparable outcomes under either valuation option, then some rules are needed in this area. The problem is highlighted by clause 3, Part A of schedule 2. According to clause 3, the tax value is the value of the vehicle as determined under subpart EE (Depreciation) at the beginning of the income or tax year, unless the vehicle is acquired partway through the year, in which case its value is its cost price. In most cases there is not a problem unless the vehicle is acquired from an associated person. When there is an associated person, one reading of these provisions is that the cost price that is relevant if a vehicle is transferred part-way through the year is the cost price in accordance with section GC 16 (that is, the associated person’s cost price) but subsequently the tax value is the value determined under subpart EE, which does not take the associated person’s cost price into consideration. This is confusing and potentially provides an opportunity for reducing the FBT liability below that intended. Association is more likely to be a problem given that a number of vehicles that were subject to 9-5 or flip-flop leases are likely to be transferred from being owned by the employee to being owned by the employer, to reduce compliance costs. Section GC 16 may apply in these cases because an employer and employee are associated if the employee has a sufficient shareholding in the company. Quite apart from these lease situations, association will also arise on an on-going basis. The proposed approach for resolving this problem is as follows: Anyone could use the cost price option, which would be based on the highest cost price for the associated persons, as already provided for under the legislation. If someone wished to use the tax value option then: • If the associated person had either used the cost price method or had not used any method at all, the new owner would need to use the higher of their cost price and the cost price to the associated person as the basis for their tax value. • If the associated person had used the tax value method, the new owner would use the higher of their cost price and the tax value of the associated person as the basis for their tax value. 105 Application date Given that the change is being publicised only as an amendment at the select committee stage, officials recommend that this amendment apply from the date of enactment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (Matter raised by officials) The provisions that value a benefit in the form of subsidised transport need to be amended to achieve the intent that the value of the benefit is 25% of the highest fare charged by the employer or another company in the same group of companies as the employer. Comment This remedial change to section ND 1C is to ensure that the change agreed by the select committee in relation to a group of companies that includes a transport operator (see page 97 of the officials report of 14 February 2006 to the Finance and Expenditure Committee) is given effect to. That change allowed transport benefits provided to employees of other than the transport operator to have their transport benefits valued on the same basis as employees of the transport operator if the employer of the employees and the transport operator are in the same group of companies. Changes were made to the definition of “subsidised transport” to reflect this, but no change was made to the associated valuation provisions in section ND 1C. A couple of submissions on the bill had recommended this change but it was overlooked. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 106 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Consequential changes to cross-references in sections ND 1U and ND 1V should be made to reflect the changes made to schedule 2 as part of the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act. Comment Schedule 2 was changed significantly as part of the FBT changes earlier this year, but the cross-references to that schedule in sections ND 1U and ND 1V were not updated. Consequently, the changes in clauses 115C and D are to ensure that these sections correctly cross-reference the relevant parts of the revised schedule. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section DB 45 should be amended to ensure that the owner of a vehicle that is subject to a 9-to-5 or flip-flop lease is able to claim a deduction for the full amount of any depreciation, not just the business portion. Comment Section DB 45 was added as part of the recent changes to the FBT rules, in exchange for applying FBT to 9-to-5 and flip-flop leases. Its purpose was to provide a full deduction of the costs associated with operating a motor vehicle. Without the provision only the business portion of those costs would be deductible. The wording of the provision covers deductions in relation to expenditure incurred in operating a motor vehicle. It has been pointed out to us that there is a question of whether this extends to depreciation, as depreciation is treated in the tax legislation as a loss in value of a capital item rather than as expenditure. The proposed solution is that section DB 45 should refer to both expenditure and depreciation loss to ensure that both are fully deductible. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 107 DATE ON WHICH NOTICES ARE DELIVERED Clauses 138, 139 and 140 Submission (578 – New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, 597 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Clauses 138 and 140 should be deleted. Comment Clauses 138 and 140 amend sections 14(9) and 14C(8) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to repeal rebuttable presumptions that notices are delivered on the day on which they are postmarked. The submissions argue that these presumptions, relating to notices given by the Commissioner and notices between a taxpayer and a third party, should be retained as they provide certainty. The presumptions are being repealed because they are of little value. They are rebuttable, so senders are able to give oral evidence that a notice was posted prior to the date of the postmark, if that was the case. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (597 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) If the submission above (that the presumption should be retained so that taxpayers who have retained postmarked envelopes received from Inland Revenue are able to rely on the presumption) is rejected, further guidance should be provided as to what evidence the Commissioner will consider in coming to his view on whether a notice would have been delivered “in the ordinary course of the post”. Comment The Commissioner will continue to use the same rules that were used in the past. A postmarked envelope will be accepted as evidence that the notice was posted, at the latest, on the day of the postmark. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 108 PAYROLL SUBSIDY Submission (Matter raised by officials) Minor technical revision should be made to section NBB 5(5) of the Income Tax Act 2004. Comment A drafting error resulted in incorrect cross-reference to “subsection (3)” being used instead of a cross-reference to “subsection (4)”. The redrafted version of NBB 5(5) should include correct cross-references. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 109 CHANGING GST TAXABLE PERIODS Submission (Matter raised by officials) A legislative amendment should be made to the GST Act to fix a drafting oversight whereby GST-registered taxpayers will not be able to change between different GST taxable periods. The error occurred as part of the recent changes to align provisional tax payments with GST payments. Comment Section 15A of the GST Tax Act 1985 enables provisional taxpayers to change between different GST taxable periods – for example, from paying GST monthly to two-monthly. A number of sections, including section 15A of the GST Act, were amended by the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006. However the provisions which enable GST-registered taxpayer to change between different taxable periods was omitted. Officials recommend that these omitted provisions be reinstated, with effect from the 2008-09 income year, being the date of the other GST changes. Recommendation That the submission be accepted 110 MISCELLANEOUS TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS Issue: Allocation of research and development tax deductions Clause 46 Submission (597 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The rationale for this clarifying amendment is supported but the wording of the two new subsections is cumbersome and overly complex and should be simplified. Comment Officials do not agree that the drafting of the two new subsections is unwieldy. The provisions clearly state the maximum and minimum thresholds for the amount of the relevant deduction that can be allocated to an income year. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Corporate migration terminology Clauses 121, 125, 146 and 147 Submission (597 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Section 29(1C)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should also be amended so that the term “emigration time” is used in that provision instead of “emigration date”. Comment Officials agree with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 111 Issue: Corporate migration changes Clauses 121, 125, 146 and 147 Submission (565 – NZBio) Investors in companies conducting significant research and development should be excluded from the corporate migration amendments enacted in 2005. Comment The amendments in this bill make minor terminology corrections only to the corporate migration amendments enacted in a separate Act last year. The submission, which seeks to make substantive changes to the corporate migration rules, is therefore outside the scope of this bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 113 Other matters raised by officials 115 TEMPORARY EXEMPTION FOR NEW MIGRANTS Submission (Matter raised by officials) Legislation earlier this year introduced a tax exemption for new migrants. The exemption is available to people coming to live in New Zealand on or after 1 April 2006 for the first time or after an extended absence. It lasts for four years after migration and covers most types of foreign income. Since that legislation was enacted, three technical difficulties have been identified: • In certain circumstances, new migrants may become tax-resident in New Zealand without qualifying for the exemption, contrary to the policy intent. • While some new migrants may be better off without the exemption, there is currently no mechanism allowing them to opt out. • Current law may require that resident withholding tax is deducted from income covered by the exemption. These problems should be corrected. Comment Timing and eligibility There are two ways new migrants can become tax-resident in New Zealand: by acquiring a “permanent place of abode” (making their home) here or by being present in the country for more than 183 days in a 12-month period. (Where the 183-day rule applies, a person becomes tax-resident from the first of those 183 days.) Currently, new migrants qualify for the exemption only after they acquire a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. Focusing on permanent place of abode was intended to avoid situations where people can qualify for the exemption “too soon” – for example, where a temporary visit to New Zealand before actual migration triggered tax residence under the 183-day rule. However, it has now become clear that this approach introduces a potential mismatch between the rules for the exemption and the general tax residence rules: in certain circumstances, new migrants may become tax- resident in New Zealand without qualifying for the exemption. Officials therefore recommend that the timing and eligibility rules for the exemption be amended, as follows: • To avoid the possibility that a new migrant may become resident for tax purposes without qualifying for the exemption, the eligibility and timing rules for the exemption should be aligned with the general tax residence rules. 116 • To resolve issues associated with people qualifying for the exemption too soon, any backdating under the 183-day residence rule should be ignored for the purposes of the eligibility rules and time-limit for exemption. Allowing people to opt out of the exemption In certain circumstances, new migrants may be better off not receiving the exemption – for example, where they have foreign losses, or wish to claim family assistance, or have little or no foreign income and prefer to defer their claim. It was therefore always intended that people should be able to choose whether or not to receive the exemption. The legislation currently in force does not allow people to make this choice, however. Officials therefore recommend that a mechanism be introduced whereby taxpayers can opt out of the exemption if they so wish. Removing the requirement to deduct resident withholding tax Resident withholding tax (RWT) is required to be deducted from interest and dividends paid to New Zealand residents. RWT applies to “resident withholding income”, as defined at section NF 1(2). There is currently nothing that removes foreign-sourced interest and dividends of a transitional resident from this definition. In certain circumstances – such as where an agent or trustee received the income on behalf of a transitional resident – this could mean that RWT had to be deducted from such income, notwithstanding that there was no underlying liability to tax. To avoid this, officials recommend that the definition of resident withholding income be amended to exclude income covered by this exemption. Giving effect to these changes Because people may be unfairly excluded from the exemption under existing law, or required to receive it contrary to their best interests, it is recommended that the changes outlined above apply retrospectively. This will mean that people are able to qualify or opt out under the new rules from the outset. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 117 GST APRIL DUE DATE Submission (Matter raised by officials) The April GST due date should be changed from the 28th of April to the 7th of May to provide more time for businesses and tax agents to file and pay GST and provisional tax. Comment With the enactment of the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006, the GST due date will change from the last working day of the month to the 28th of the month. Tax agents with smaller number of clients have approached officials, concerned about the impact the GST and provisional tax changes will have on businesses’ and tax agents’ workloads in the April period. In April each year tax agents ensure that businesses pay their terminal tax liability and the agents complete GST returns. From next year, GST will be due up to two days earlier in April, and from 2008 the final provisional tax instalment will move from March to April and be paid along with GST. This increases the workload of agents and reduces the timeframe for filing/paying. Also, in most years the Easter and ANZAC holidays both fall in April, and from April 2007 employees will be entitled to four weeks of annual leave. This further reduces the time available in April for businesses to provide information to tax agents and for tax agents to complete GST and provisional tax calculations before the due date. Tax agents consider that the work pressure in April could be reduced by moving the April due date to 7 May. To address these concerns, the government has agreed to change the April GST due date from the 28th April to 7 May. This change will apply to taxable periods ending on or after 31 March 2007. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 118 REVERSE TAKEOVERS AND CONCESSIONARY CONTINUITY RULES Submission (Matter raised by officials) Technical amendments to the concessionary continuity rules that were introduced in the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006 are needed to ensure that they reflect their policy intention. Comment Normally, a company must have a continuity of shareholding of 49% to enable it to carry forward its tax losses for New Zealand tax purposes. In relation to imputation credits, the required continuity percentage is 66%. Concessionary rules allow for the fact that it is not practical to trace shareholders through groups of companies to non- corporate shareholders in a number of circumstances. New provisions were inserted by the 2006 Act to provide concessionary ownership tracing rules for reverse takeovers, for example, where a widely held listed company (the initial parent) took over or merged with a larger one. The new rules do not operate in accordance with the policy intent where: • treasury stock or cross shareholdings are cancelled without consideration upon the takeover; or • a subsidiary of the initial parent is a “limited attribution company”, for example, a building society, co-operative company, listed company, widely-held company or a foreign company that is not a closely-held company. We consider that the new rules should be amended as soon as possible to remove these anomalies, and that the amendments should apply for changes in ownership occurring in the 1998-99 or subsequent years, if the company files a tax return on the basis that requirements of a continuity provision are satisfied in relation to the change of ownership. More generally, the amendments should apply from 3 April 2006, the date of assent of the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006. This amendment has been discussed with the one taxpayer that we know is affected. Recommendation That the concessionary continuity rules that were introduced earlier this year be amended to ensure that they apply appropriately where: • treasury stock or cross shareholdings are cancelled without consideration upon the takeover; or 119 • a subsidiary of the initial parent is a “limited attribution company”, for example, a building society, co-operative company, listed company, widely-held company or a foreign company that is not a closely-held company. The amendments should apply for changes in ownership occurring in the 1998-99 or subsequent years, if the company files a tax return on the basis that requirements of a continuity provision are satisfied in relation to the change of ownership. More generally, the amendments should apply from 3 April 2006, the date of assent of the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT, and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006. 120 MINOR REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS Issue: GST associated persons definition: drafting correction Submission (Matter raised by officials) The test for associating relatives in the associated persons definition in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 should be amended to correct an unintended drafting error in a recent amendment. Comment The Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act 2005 amended the test for associating relatives in the associated persons definition in section 2A of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act). The purpose of the amendment was to associate persons who are in a civil union or de facto relationship. This amendment was part of a number of amendments designed to remove unjustified discrimination in the application of laws on the grounds of marital status or sexual orientation so laws are neutral on their application to different relationships and consistent with human rights obligations. Former section 2A(5) of the GST Act provided that the test associating relatives extended to trustees for relatives. The amendment in 2005 did not maintain the effect of this provision in current section 2A(1)(c)(iv). It was clearly not intended that this aspect of the relatives associated persons test be changed. An amendment correcting this drafting error should therefore be made to the test associating relatives in section 2A of the GST Act to reinstate the trustee aspect of this test. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Extension of time bars Submission (Matter raised by officials) The right of taxpayers to extend a time bar by a further six-month period in section 108B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be amended so that the taxpayer can do this by giving notice to the Commissioner before the end of the initial 12-month extension period. The change will correct an omission and ensure that the section works as intended. 121 Comment Section 108B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 sets out the rules for extending the time bars for amending tax assessments. Subsection (1)(a) provides that the time bar can be extended by a period of up to 12 months, where the Commissioner and the taxpayer agree in writing. Subsection (1)(b) allows the taxpayer to extend the time bar for a further six months from the end of the 12 month extension period. This further six-month extension period was enacted in 2004. Section 108B(2) requires any time bar waiver under subsection (1) to be in the prescribed form and to be signed and delivered to the Commissioner before the end of the original four year time bar period. It was intended that the further six-month extension of the time bar in section 108B(1)(b) could be effected by the taxpayer giving notice to the Commissioner before the end of the 12-month extension period allowed in section 108B(1)(a). However, the necessary consequential amendment was not made to section 108B(2) when the further six-month extension period was enacted in 2004. A remedial amendment should therefore be made to section 108B(2) to ensure that the time bar extension provisions operate as intended. Recommendation That the submission be accepted.

Volume 3 deals with the technical submissions on the offshore tax proposals, including the new fair dividend rate method. Therefore, volumes 2 and 3 should be read together, with volume 3 being referred to for officials’ main comments. The Committee forwarded us about 1350 submissions that fell into this category. About one-quarter of them appeared to be variations of standard forms or standard material. We were sent only a few of the many submissions that consisted of signed, standard forms, reportedly over 2000 of them, because they were, in many cases, nearly identical. Submissions covered in this volume of the report often supported the proposals relating to portfolio investment entities, when they were mentioned, but not those relating to offshore investment. Only two submissions supported the offshore investment proposals. Key concerns expressed by most of this group were that the proposed changes would introduce a capital gains tax, and they were excessively complex. We note that the proposed fair dividend rate approach, which is under consideration by the Committee, should deal with their concerns to a large extent. This volume covers the main issues raised in the submissions, both those forwarded to us by the Committee and the form letters of which we received samples. Given the number of submissions, points made in them are not attributed to those who made them. The appendix to this volume lists submissions by number and name as they were supplied to us by the Committee. It does not include the sample standard-form submissions described above. 4 5 GENERAL COMMENTS ON WHY THE OFFSHORE PROPOSALS SHOULD NOT PROCEED Nearly all the submissions covered in this volume of the report were opposed to the offshore tax proposals. Most argued that the grey list should be retained, and that the proposals should not proceed. Many were concerned that the offshore proposals introduced a tax on capital gains. Some argued that a modified grey list should be retained for certain countries, including the UK, Canada and the US. Several submitted that the Australian exemption should apply to the UK, Canada and the US. Others argued that the grey list should be extended to all countries with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement, or to countries with which New Zealand has an important trading relationship, such as Asian or European countries. The main reasons for general opposition to the proposals are given in more detail below. Issue: The proposals will distort investment decisions Several submissions noted that they were not opposed to a capital gains tax, but that any capital gains tax on offshore shares should be extended to other assets such as local shares and property. In particular, many expressed concern that capital gains on shares are taxed, whereas capital gains on property are not taxed. Comment The proposals were introduced to remove several distortions from the current savings rules, between investing in portfolio shares in grey list countries and non-grey list countries, and between investing directly and investing through managed funds. Under current rules, investment in New Zealand companies is taxed fairly comprehensively (under New Zealand’s company tax rules), whereas investment in foreign companies resident in grey list countries is generally taxable in New Zealand on dividends only, if held by individuals. This can create an incentive to invest in grey list companies, especially if the company pays little or no tax in the foreign jurisdiction. On the other hand, investments in non-grey list countries (which comprise most of the world) are generally taxed on 100% of the change in share value each year. This is a significant tax barrier to investing in those countries. The current tax rules also create different outcomes depending on whether investment is via a managed fund (generally taxable on capital gains as well as dividends) or directly by an individual (generally taxable on dividends only). This disadvantages investors who use managed funds to invest in New Zealand and offshore. 6 The proposals aim to correct the imbalance by treating investments in New Zealand and Australian companies via a managed fund on a similar basis to direct investments in those companies. This will result in investments in Australian- resident listed companies being taxable primarily on dividends only. This is reasonable as the Australian tax system, like the New Zealand tax system, encourages a significant proportion of the earnings of Australian companies to be paid out as dividends. The approach is also justified given the Closer Economic Relationship between the two countries, and the desirability of treating the two markets as one for investment purposes. For investments outside Australia and New Zealand where dividend-only taxation is not reasonable (given the low level of dividend distribution), the new rules will treat portfolio investors in grey list countries (outside Australia) in the same way as investors in non-grey list countries. In the case of the former, these new rules would, for substantial portfolios, generally result in more tax being payable than at present. In the case of the latter, the new rules will reduce the amount of tax they are required to pay. The new rules should therefore improve the current tax position for those who have investments in Asia and other non-grey list countries and encourage more New Zealanders to diversify into those countries. Issue: The proposals are unfair Submissions cited a range of reasons for considering the proposals unfair: • The proposals are unfair because other investments such as rental property and local shares are not taxed on capital gains. • The proposals are unfair to existing investors who have saved for their retirement. • The proposals discriminate against “ordinary New Zealanders” (taxpayers with middle or lower incomes) as these taxpayers will not be able to rearrange affairs easily and will not have investments under the exemption threshold. • The proposals are not as fair as overseas tax systems such as Australia. • The proposals are unfair because offshore investments are already taxed twice (first in their own jurisdiction and secondly when New Zealand tax is imposed on dividends received). • The proposals are unfair to migrants who have overseas investments. • It is unfair to individual beneficiaries of Maori trusts and incorporations, for whom directly held global investments are owned for their long-term benefit. These beneficiaries should not be disadvantaged by the ownership structure because this is not something they can change. • The proposals are unfair to professional share traders who will not get relief from tax on their New Zealand and Australian shares. 7 Comment The proposals are designed to make it easier and fairer for most investors to invest and save. The key principle behind the changes is that it is only fair that if you live in New Zealand, you should pay tax in New Zealand on your income, whether it comes from New Zealand or overseas. The proposals are designed to levy a reasonable amount of tax on overseas income each year and to remove a number of current distortions. One such distortion is the difference in tax treatment when an investor invests in shares (both onshore and offshore) directly and through a New Zealand managed fund. Issue: The proposals are unnecessary Several submissions questioned the need for the new rules for offshore investment when taxpayers are already taxed on overseas dividends. Comment Low levels of dividend distribution mean that investments in grey list countries are not comprehensively taxed, unlike shares in non-grey list countries. The proposals are designed to address this issue by ensuring that tax is paid on an amount similar to a reasonable dividend yield. Issue: Diversity will be discouraged Many submissions argued that the proposals would discourage diversity of investment by discouraging portfolio investment into overseas shares, and encouraging investment in local shares and property. Some noted that it is particularly important that our overseas investment is diversified, to protect New Zealanders’ wealth in the event of a disaster such as a tsunami or an outbreak of foot and mouth disease. Several submissions noted that one of the fiduciary obligations imposed on trustees and investment advisors is the duty to invest prudently, and that the effect of the proposals might cause trustees to breach this obligation. That might occur because if the trustee attempted to satisfy the obligation to invest prudently by ensuring that a trust portfolio contained overseas shares, it would subject the portfolio to higher tax. Many submissions noted that the New Zealand Superannuation fund diversifies by investing overseas. 8 Comment The proposals are designed to encourage diversity, by correcting the imbalance in the current rules, which give favourable treatment to investments into certain countries and require more tax from investments made into others. That is, under the proposals, diversification will be encouraged by systematically reducing the tax that is paid on investments in countries outside the grey list, including Asian countries such as China and Singapore. Issue: Savings will be discouraged Many submissions expressed concern that the offshore proposals would discourage retirement savings, especially amongst among lower and middle income earners. Some held that savings should not be taxed, or should not be over-taxed. Comment For the substantial majority, the proposals should provide a worthwhile boost to savings. Under the proposals, the many New Zealanders who invest through managed funds will receive significant capital gains tax relief and will have their investment income taxed at the correct rate – for example, 19.5% taxpayers will be taxed at 19.5%, not at 33%, as under current law. Issue: The proposals undermine KiwiSaver Submissions expressed concern that the proposals would discourage investment in KiwiSaver because KiwiSaver will be taxed on its offshore shares. Comment KiwiSaver has been a key driver in ensuring that investment via a managed fund is not tax-disadvantaged. Many thousands of ordinary New Zealanders will receive capital gain tax relief and tax rate relief on their KiwiSaver investments from 2007 under the new rules. 9 Issue: The proposals will inflate the property market Many expressed concern that the effect of the proposals would be to discourage savings in overseas shares and encourage investors to hold residential property. If this happened, they said, it would inflate the property market, making home ownership more unaffordable. Comment If, as has been suggested, there is a significant flow of funds back to New Zealand, and into property, one could reasonably expect that the risk associated with such investments would increase. Consequently, in risk-adjusted terms, there should still be an incentive for New Zealanders to hold a diversified portfolio of assets. It is also worth noting that there are comprehensive tax rules for those people who buy and sell assets, such as residential property, with the intention of making a profit, and these people are required to pay tax on any capital gain. Therefore, it is incorrect to say that there are no tax consequences associated with investing in property with the intention of making capital gains. Issue: The proposals will deter skilled migrants from coming to New Zealand or encourage skilled people to leave Submissions expressed concern that the proposals would encourage skilled people to leave New Zealand, or discourage skilled migrants from coming or returning to New Zealand, because many skilled migrants have investments in overseas shares. Comment Most overseas jurisdictions have realised capital gains tax on their investments and some, like Australia, also have foreign investment fund rules (for “passive” investments offshore) that generally tax full unrealised capital gains. Most overseas residents will also have experience paying a realised capital gains tax on their investments. In contrast, the proposed fair dividend rate method attempts to tax a reasonable dividend yield. The proposed rules should therefore not be a significant disincentive to relocate to New Zealand, especially given the recently introduced four- year exemption from New Zealand’s foreign investment fund rules for new migrants and returning residents. This four-year window should provide plenty of time for them to become familiar with the new rules and, if necessary, make any adjustments to their portfolios. 10 Issue: The proposals are very complex and will impose significant compliance costs • Most submissions expressed concern about the complexity of the proposals. Many argued that they were difficult for ordinary taxpayers to understand. Several argued that the rules were overly complex in relation to the tax that will be collected. • Compliance costs would be greatly increased because taxpayers who had previously completed returns themselves would need to employ accountants. Several were concerned that compliance costs would fall disproportionately on lower income taxpayers. • Administrative costs for Inland Revenue would be increased as it would be difficult to collect the tax. • Many submissions suggested that the number of people affected by the proposals would be more than expected. • More taxpayers would be required to file tax returns because of the proposals. • More people would incur use-of-money interest and penalties as a result of not being able to apply the rules because they are too complex. Comment Concerns about the complexity of the new offshore tax rules relate to the smooth market value method proposed in the bill as introduced. The government has suggested that it be replaced with a new fair dividend rate method. Under the fair dividend rate method: • Individuals would be taxed on a maximum of 5% of the opening market value of their offshore shares in a given year. • When individual investors make a return of less than 5%, their taxable income would be correspondingly lower. • No tax would be payable when investors make losses. • Dividends would not be taxed separately even if they exceed 5%. The fair dividend rate method would be much simpler to apply than the offshore tax proposals in the bill as introduced, because complex calculations to work out income would not be necessary. For example, gains of more than 5% would not have to be carried forward to be taxed in later years, which was the main reason for the complexity in the smoothed market value method. For most individuals, taxable income would simply be 5% of the value of their shares at the start of the year, and less if they made a return lower than 5% for the year. 11 Issue: Changes will not raise revenue Several submissions suggested that the measures would not raise revenue expected by the government, because taxpayers would withdraw their savings from offshore investments and invest in onshore shares or property, or simply not comply with the measures. Revenue gains would be offset by increased use of public health services and welfare agencies by older investors, who would lose planned income as a result of the changes. Comment It should be noted that the aim of the proposals was not to raise revenue. Rather, the key rationale was to reduce investment distortions. The overall impact of these specific changes to the taxation of overseas investment is largely revenue-neutral. The whole package of investment tax changes (including the PIE rules) will actually reduce government revenue by over $100 million a year. However, the government has said that if we are to improve the savings culture in New Zealand, this is a valuable investment to make. Issue: Biased towards managed funds Several submissions were concerned that the proposals encourage investment in managed funds rather than direct investment because managed funds would get an exemption from tax on offshore shares. They noted that managed funds should not be given an advantage but should be treated the same as individuals. Comment Investors in managed funds would not, in fact, receive an advantage over direct investors in relation to investments in offshore shares. The proposed exclusion for Australasian trading gains made by PIEs broadly reflects the treatment of Australasian investments if held directly. Like direct investors, managed funds would be subject to the fair dividend rate, if it is adopted, on investments outside Australasia. Further, managed funds would pay tax on a flat 5% rate, which may be seen as less attractive than the 5% variable rate for individual direct investors, although this would be offset by the benefits to managed fund investors from the PIE tax rules. In addition, investors in managed funds would not receive the benefit of the $50,000 threshold. The reason for these differences is to minimise any potential compliance costs faced by individuals. 12 Issue: New Zealanders do not invest overseas to avoid paying tax New Zealanders do not invest overseas in order to avoid paying tax. Many New Zealanders invest in offshore shares and funds that pay dividends. Comment It is acknowledged that most New Zealanders who invest offshore do so for genuine reasons, including diversification and access to industries not available in New Zealand. However, the tax systems of many countries discourage the payment of dividends, with the result that dividend yields are low. To ensure that a reasonable level of tax is paid on the income of New Zealand residents’ offshore income, it is necessary to deem a reasonable dividend yield. Issue: Insufficient consultation Several submissions stated that there had been insufficient consultation and, in particular, there had been a lack of consultation with private investors. Comment Officials conducted significant consultation with a wide variety of interested parties. While it was impossible to consult with all interested private investors, we consulted with a number of groups representing individual investors. These included stockbrokers, investment advisers, the New Zealand Shareholders’ Association, and the Retirement Commissioner. General recommendation on these submissions Officials have recommended in volume 3 that the fair dividend rate method replace the market value and smoothed market value methods proposed in the bill. The fair dividend rate should address complexity concerns and concern that gains in excess of 5% would be taxed on repatriation. Officials consider an extended grey list with a black list is not sustainable for the following reasons: • It would create significant complexity to define and maintain a black list. For example, it would be difficult to monitor effective tax rates and tax advantaged vehicles in an expanded group of grey list countries. • There would be a significant fiscal cost to extending capital account treatment to managed funds. 13 • The incentive to invest in countries that do not have a comparable company tax system to New Zealand would remain. • It would not address the issue that many offshore shares do not provide a reasonable dividend yield, meaning that offshore investment would continue to be tax advantaged relative to New Zealand shares. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. It should be noted that the proposed fair dividend rate method should address many of the concerns raised in submissions. Other general submission points Issue: Unrealised gains should not be taxed Many submissions expressed concern that offshore shares would be subject to tax on unrealised gains. Several noted that they did not oppose tax on capital gains, but that they were opposed to tax on gains that were not realised at the time. Several submissions expressed concern that taxpayers would have to sell assets in order to meet their tax liability. Comment The smoothed market value method, which in most years would tax only 5% of the value of an investment, was designed to address liquidity concerns. This meant that in most years, tax on more than 5% of the investment’s value could be met with dividends of less than 2%. Most people should be receiving a dividend yield of at least 2% from a diversified portfolio, which would generally eliminate the need for investors to sell an investment to pay a tax liability. This concern has been further addressed by the introduction of the fair dividend rate, which would not require gains in excess of the 5% cap to be carried forward to be taxed in later years. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 14 Issue: Tax rates should not be different for grey list and non-grey list countries Submission Several submissions expressed concern that the proposals introduced different tax rates for investment in grey list and non-grey list countries. Comment The proposals do not, in fact, introduce different tax treatment for grey list and non- grey list countries. Instead, they remove the existing distortion which encourages investment in grey list countries. Under current rules, investments in such countries are not fully taxed on their income, while investors in non-grey list countries are generally taxed on 100% of their gain. The proposals remove this distortion by generally reducing the amount of tax payable on shares in a non-grey list country and ensuring that the same level of tax is paid on overseas shares regardless of whether the investment is in a grey list country. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 15 DEFERRAL OF INTRODUCTION OF THE NEW RULES Submissions • The introduction of the offshore proposals should be delayed until further review. • The introduction of the offshore proposals should be delayed until at least 2008 to provide time for further consultation. • The introduction of the offshore proposals should be delayed until at least 2008 to give investors time to rearrange their portfolios. • Many noted their support for the proposed portfolio investment entity (PIE) rules, but argued that the introduction date of the PIE and offshore rules should not be linked. Comment The current application date in the bill provides that both the new offshore tax rules and the PIE rules will apply for income years starting on or after 1 April 2007. The key policy objective of the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules is to remove the current distortions between investing directly or through a managed fund and between investing in grey list and non-grey list countries. These distortions should be removed as soon as practicable, and given the scheduled enactment date of this legislation before the end of this year, this would support a general 1 April 2007 application date, as is currently proposed in the bill. The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue wrote to the Committee in August recommending that the application date for the new PIE tax rules be deferred until 1 October 2007. This deferral was connected to the deferral of the KiwiSaver scheme (since the PIE tax rules will be compulsory for KiwiSaver default funds). The deferral to 1 October 2007 also gives savings vehicles more time to prepare for the implementation of the PIE tax rules. The resulting non-alignment between the application dates for the new offshore tax rules (1 April 2007) and the PIE tax rules (1 October 2007) creates tax timing problems for some savings vehicles that intend to become PIEs from 1 October 2007. Officials consider that these problems can be addressed by allowing entities that will be eligible to be PIEs to elect that the new offshore tax rules will not apply to them until 1 October 2007, or, if an entity elects to become a PIE in its first income year starting on or after 1 October 2007, from the date that the election is effective. This does not necessarily mean that less tax will be paid by these entities during this interim period because, in general, more tax is paid by institutions under the current offshore tax rules than will be paid under the new rules. 16 Officials do not support shifting the current 1 April 2007 application date to 1 October 2007 for the offshore tax rules for individuals. The majority of individuals have a 31 March balance date, and to defer the introduction date to 1 October would mean that individuals would need to calculate their offshore investment tax liabilities under two different sets of rules for the income year starting on 1 April 2007. This would involve significant complexity for individual investors. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 17 DISCOUNT ON MARKET VALUE METHODS Submission The taxable amount of gains on overseas shares should not be 85% as currently proposed. The taxable amount should be limited to between 5 to 70% of the change in the value of the share price, with many submissions suggesting that the taxable amount should be limited to 25% or 50% of the share gain. Comment Officials consider this issue does not need to be addressed in light of the recommendation to replace the market value and smoothed market value methods with the fair dividend rate. The level of discount is not relevant to the fair dividend rate method. Recommendation Officials have recommended that the market value and smoothed market value methods be replaced with the fair dividend rate method. If this recommendation is accepted the issue in this submission will no longer be applicable. 18 THE $50,000 THRESHOLD Issue: Level of threshold Submissions • The $50,000 threshold level should be raised to a more realistic level. • The threshold should be raised to a level that would ensure that lower or middle income investors are not caught by the rules. • Submissions suggested various higher threshold levels between $80,000 and $5 million. Quoted figures included $80,000, $100,000, $150,000, $200,000 $250,000, $300,000, $350,000, $500,000, $1,000,000, and, $5,000,000. Comment Raising the proposed threshold significantly would undermine the core objective of these reforms, which is to remove the current distortion between investing directly in offshore shares and investing through New Zealand collective investment vehicles. A modest threshold such as that proposed in the bill can be justified as the extra accuracy from applying more complicated tax rules can be outweighed by the extra compliance costs for modest holdings. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Threshold should be inflation-indexed Submission The level of the threshold should be inflation-indexed. Comment While an argument exists for inflation-indexing thresholds, such an approach would significantly increase complexity. For this reason, such an approach is not adopted for other thresholds in tax legislation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 19 Issue: Actual cost Submission The actual cost of the share rather than its market value should be used in determining whether a person’s shareholdings are under the threshold. Comment The main rule for determining whether a person’s share portfolio falls below the threshold is cost, not market value. Therefore there is no need to make an amendment to the bill. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Family trusts Submission The threshold should be extended to include discretionary family trusts, as these are legitimate vehicles for estate planning. Specific anti-avoidance should be enacted if there is a risk of abuse. Comment The reason the $50,000 threshold does not apply to trusts is to prevent it being exploited by the creation of multiple trusts for the benefit of the same individuals. For example, ten family trusts could be established for the benefit of the same individual, thereby effectively increasing the threshold to $500,000. Officials do not consider it is feasible to introduce specific anti-avoidance rules to effectively address the risk of trusts being used to exploit the exemption. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 20 FIVE-YEAR EXEMPTION (GPG) Issue: GPG should not get an exemption Submissions • It is unfair that GPG gets special treatment. • Investors in GPG should not get an exemption when investors in other offshore companies do not. Comment The five-year exemption will give widely held foreign companies that have a substantial New Zealand shareholder base, such as GPG, time to consider shifting their headquarters to New Zealand. This will provide sufficient time for the government to complete its review of the controlled foreign company rules. The outcome of this review could materially affect the decision of such companies on whether to relocate their headquarters to New Zealand. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 21 POTENTIAL DOUBLE TAXATION Submission Investors could be double taxed because they could be taxed on year-to-year increases and then on the gain realised upon sale of the shares. Comment Double tax as described above was not possible under the smoothed market value method. This is because gains taxed on a year-to-year basis are not included in the excess gains that are carried forward. Therefore, the gains that are taxed on repatriation are those that have not been taxed in previous years. This issue does not arise under the fair dividend rate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 22 TREATMENT OF CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS Submission Gains made as the result of currency fluctuations should not be taxed. Comment The concern raised is that rules that tax offshore income under a change in value approach can give rise to volatile tax results as currency cross-rates can shift significantly during the measurement period. Under the recommended fair dividend rate, taxable income in most years will be determined by applying 5% to the investment’s opening value at the beginning of the tax year. As taxable income under this method will now not generally depend on the change in value of the investment over the measurement period, the volatility issue described above will largely be addressed. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 23 INFLATION Submission Inflation should be taken into account when calculating share gains for the purposes of the new rules, as investors should not be taxed on gains made from inflation. Comment As a general rule, New Zealand’s tax system works on a nominal basis and does not take account of inflation. To inflation-index the proposed rules would be inconsistent with this general approach and could lead to additional distortion. Further, inflation- indexing would add significant complexity to the rules. Officials note that the issue has been superseded as the recommended fair dividend rate does not target capital gains, rather something approximating a reasonable dividend yield. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 24 FOREIGN TAX CREDITS Submission Credit should be given for foreign tax paid against the realised gain. Comment This was an issue under the FIF rules proposed in the bill. However, because the recommended fair dividend rate method does not tax capital gains, no credit should be allowed for foreign capital gains taxes. Credits for foreign tax paid on any dividends would be allowed under the fair dividend rate method. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 25 TREATMENT OF LOSSES Submission If gains on shares will be taxable, losses on shares should also be recognised in the calculation of taxable income. Comment Losses would have been deductible under the smoothed market value method in the same way and to the same extent that any gains would have been taxable. It is not appropriate to allow capital losses under the fair dividend rate because it does not target capital gains. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 26 VENTURE CAPITAL Submission Shares in companies that start in New Zealand and subsequently migrate to a grey list country should be exempt for a period of five to seven years from the date of migration. Comment Officials agree with the need for an exemption for venture capital companies that migrate offshore. The primary reason for this exemption is that venture capital investment is not substitutable for normal offshore portfolio investment. Officials have developed exemption criteria for a broad range of venture capital cases. These criteria are discussed in volume 3 of the officials’ report. Recommendation That it be noted that officials are proposing new exemption criteria for investments in venture capital. 27 EMPLOYEE SHARE OPTIONS Submissions • Employee share schemes should be exempt. Such schemes encourage employee loyalty and are distinguishable from other shareholdings as they can be considered “active” investments. • There should be a five-year holiday for investors in employee share schemes upon leaving the employment. Alternatively, shares acquired before a certain date or those with restrictions on disposal should be exempt for five years. • The threshold should be raised to $300,000 when employee share options are owned. Comment Officials agree that a temporary exemption from the new offshore tax rules for employee share options is justified in certain circumstances. This issue is considered in volume 3 of the officials’ report. Recommendation That it be noted that officials are proposing new exemption criteria for shares acquired through employee share purchase schemes in certain circumstances. 28 EXEMPTION FOR SHARES IN AUSTRALIAN COMPANIES Issue: Australian shares should not be exempted Submissions • Australian shares should not be exempted. Exempting shares will give the Australian share market a competitive advantage with no corresponding gain for New Zealand. • New Zealand residents do not get a franking credit on Australian dividends, so the exemption should not be extended to Australia. Comment There are three main reasons for treating investment in Australian-resident listed companies differently. First, Australian companies pay out a high proportion of their earnings as dividends. (Dividend distribution is encouraged by the Australian tax system.) Second, New Zealand has a close economic relationship with Australia. Making a special case for Australia will help to move the two countries closer towards a single market for the purposes of investment and is therefore consistent with this relationship. Third, the New Zealand Inland Revenue has close contact with the Australian Tax Office and the Australian Treasury, which should allow the tax authorities to close down any tax loopholes that might arise. The proposed treatment for Australian companies reflects a simplification benefit – taxation on dividends – rather than a tax advantage. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Exemption for Australian shares should be extended Submissions • All Australian entities should be exempted from the rules. • All Australian listed and unlisted companies should be exempted; otherwise there is an unfair advantage to larger and listed entities. • Companies that are not listed on the ASX should also be exempt. • Australian property trusts and funds and infrastructure funds should be exempt. • Australian-based international funds should be exempt. 29 • All companies listed on New Zealand and Australian exchanges should be exempt, even if based overseas. • Australian companies that trade on overseas exchanges should be exempt. • Australian-based intermediary funds should be exempt. • Managed funds listed on NZ and Australian exchanges should be exempt. • Index funds which invest in major indices on New Zealand and Australian exchanges should be exempt. Comment Officials consider that the exemption for Australian-resident companies should be restricted to companies listed on the official approved list of the ASX, which should cater for most of New Zealanders’ portfolio investment in Australia. This should provide some assurance that Australian companies will not be used as conduits to avoid the proposed offshore tax rules. It is less likely that such conduits could be established via companies listed on the ASX because to do so would be more difficult and costly. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Stapled securities Submission The Australian exemption should extend to Australian-based stapled securities. Comment Officials consider that the Australian exemption should be limited to shares in Australian-resident listed companies without stapled rights in foreign companies. Stapled securities would be subject to the fair dividend rate method which is the appropriate treatment for such interests. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. The Australian exemption would be limited to shares in Australian-resident listed companies without stapled rights. 30 Issue: Australian unit trusts Submissions • Australian unit trusts should be included in the Australian exemption. • Both unlisted and listed Australian unit trusts should be included in the Australian exemption. Comment Investments in Australian unit trusts were excluded from the proposed exemption for investments in Australian-resident listed companies because they could be used as roll-up vehicles to invest outside Australia in companies that pay little or no dividends (and therefore avoid the new offshore tax rules). New Zealand investors could therefore invest in these vehicles and derive income in the form of capital gain, without a tax liability arising on this income in either Australia or New Zealand. However, officials agree that investments in certain Australian unit trusts should be included in the Australian exemption subject to certain criteria being met. These criteria are discussed in volume 3. Recommendation It should be noted that this issue is covered in volume 3 of the officials’ report. 31 FURTHER EXEMPTIONS Issue: Tax liability should be extinguished on death Submission A person’s tax liability should be extinguished on death. Comment Under the smoothed market value method, any excess gains that are carried forward are extinguished on the death of the investor. This is no longer an issue as the fair dividend rate does not target capital gains. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Exemption for retired individuals Submissions • The tax liability should be removed when the person reaches retirement (between the ages of 60 and 65). • The tax should not apply to people aged over 80. Comment Officials consider there is no justification for an age-based exemption from the offshore tax rules. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 32 Issue: Exemption for gifted or inherited shares Submission Shares that are not bought but are acquired by bequest or gift should be exempt or given a period of relief because beneficiaries have not chosen to invest in these shares. Comment Officials consider there is no justification for exempting inherited shares from the FIF rules. Income from inherited offshore shares should be treated in the same way as income from other offshore shares. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Tax liability extinguished on shares held for more than five years Submission Deferred capital gains should be extinguished on investments held for longer than five years. Comment The issue does not arise under the recommended fair dividend rate method as excess gains would not be carried forward. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 33 Issue: Shares in overseas companies with New Zealand subsidiaries Submission Shareholders in overseas companies with New Zealand subsidiaries should be exempt as these countries contribute to the New Zealand economy. Comment The issue of the double taxation of New Zealand shareholders of foreign companies with New Zealand subsidiaries currently exists. This is because tax can be paid in New Zealand on its business operations but the foreign parent cannot flow through imputation credits to its New Zealand shareholders on its resulting dividends. A solution to this problem may seem to be to allow the foreign company to maintain an imputation credit account. The policy reason that only New Zealand-resident companies can maintain imputation credit accounts is to ensure that there remains an incentive for a current New Zealand-resident company to remain resident in New Zealand. A New Zealand-resident company is liable to New Zealand tax on its worldwide income, whereas a non-resident company is liable to New Zealand tax only on its New Zealand-sourced income. If a non-resident company was allowed to maintain an imputation credit account for the benefit of its New Zealand shareholders this could provide an incentive for a New Zealand-resident company to migrate to escape tax on its foreign source income while still passing on the benefit of New Zealand tax on its New Zealand-sourced income to its New Zealand shareholders. Investments in companies such as these would be subject to the fair dividend rate method, which is an appropriate treatment for such interests. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Overseas retirement funds should be exempt Submissions • Retirement funds in overseas countries should have exemptions or, alternatively, be deferred until the gains are realised. • In particular, US retirement funds and UK pension funds should be exempt as they are locked in. 34 Comment Officials note that there are already extensive exemptions for employment-related superannuation interests contained in sections EX 36 and EX 37. These exemptions will typically exclude from the FIF rules the foreign pensions of persons who migrate to New Zealand. Officials do not consider that further exemptions are justified. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Exemption for shares in South Africa Submission South African migrants require a special exemption for blocked capital assets that they are unable to repatriate because of South African restrictions. Comment Officials note that the current FIF rules already contain an exemption where exchange controls in a foreign country prevent a person from repatriating income from offshore interests. This exemption would continue under the new offshore rules. Therefore, no further amendment is necessary. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Exemption for recent migrants Submissions • Recent migrants with overseas shareholdings should be exempted from the rules, either permanently or temporarily. • Recent migrants or people who have recently returned to New Zealand should be given a temporary exemption from the rules to allow them time to repatriate their funds to New Zealand. 35 Comment Officials consider the recently enacted temporary exemption for new migrants is sufficient. A permanent exemption would not be fair vis-à-vis other New Zealanders. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Exemption for shares purchased with funds that have been earned overseas Submission Shares purchased with funds that have been earned overseas should not be taxed. Comment Officials do not believe there is justification for exempting shares purchased with funds that have been earned overseas. Such an exemption would be virtually impossible to administer and would create an incentive for investing offshore, as other categories of return from overseas-earned capital would be taxable. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Temporary exemption for existing investors Submissions • Existing investors should have a ten-year exemption to rearrange their portfolio. • The rules should take account of losses made in previous years, because recovery of losses should not be taxed. To ensure that the recovery of losses made from the past few years is not taxed, there should be a five-year exemption for existing investors. 36 Comment There is no rationale to provide a time-limited exemption for existing investors. It would favour those who invested before the changes were enacted and could lead to investors retaining offshore investments when it would make economic sense to sell the investment (if not for the exemption). It is possible to argue for some limited grandfathering if the rules being introduced are particularly harsh or complex. However, this is not the case under the fair dividend method, which would tax in essence a reasonable dividend yield. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Temporary exemption for UK trust shares where market value at transition date is less than original cost Submission There should be a five-year exemption for holders of UK trust shares whose market value at 1 April 2007 is less than the original cost. Comment Officials do not consider that there is any policy rationale for treating investments in UK investment trusts differently to other offshore shares under the fair dividend rate method. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 37 ALTERNATIVES SUGGESTED TO OFFSHORE RULES Issue: Redefinition of capital/revenue boundary Submission Several submissions argued that shares held for over one year should not be taxed, or taxed at a lower rate, and that shares held for less than one year should be taxed as income, or taxed at a higher rate (as in the US). Comment Officials note that adopting this alternative proposal would mean that all gains on shares (New Zealand and offshore) held for more than 12 months by all New Zealand investors would be exempt from New Zealand income tax because New Zealand does not have a general capital gains tax. The United States treatment is not comparable as the United States has a comprehensive capital gains tax. Implementation would have a huge revenue cost and the submission is effectively outside the scope of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Increasing discount on long-term investment Submission There should be a sliding scale whereby the shares are taxed at a higher rate if they are held for a shorter period. Comment Under the proposed fair dividend rate, taxable income would be capped at 5% of the opening market value of an investment. The level of discount is not relevant to the fair dividend rate method. Recommendation Officials have recommended that the smoothed market value method be replaced with the fair dividend rate method. If this recommendation is accepted the issue in this submission will no longer be applicable. 38 Issue: Alternative FIF calculation methods Submissions • A deemed rate of return method on all offshore shares would be preferable because it would be much simpler to apply. • A deemed rate of return should apply to all offshore shares, including Australia, as this would be fairer. • There should be a deemed rate of return based on a figure that equates to the average dividend yield of Australian ASX 200 shares. • There should be a deemed rate of return of 2 to 3% upon all overseas shares and property investments as a simple compliance cost alternative. • The deemed rate of return should be a simple calculation based on the average actual rate of all shares listed on the NZX. • There should be a standard rate of return calculated at 5% of the cost of the share. • The tax should be a deemed dividend on investments outside New Zealand and Australia, being the greater of actual income received or deemed dividend income of 3% of the value of the investment at 1 April each year. Comment Officials note that these submissions have been taken into account as part of the government’s decision to recommend consideration of the fair dividend rate method by the Finance and Expenditure Committee. Recommendation That the submissions to replace the market value methods with a deemed rate of return method be noted. 39 OUTSIDE SCOPE OF THE BILL Some submissions on the offshore proposals also suggested changes that were outside the scope of the bill: • A tax on realised gains should apply to all assets (for example, at a rate of 30%). Personal income tax rates should be correspondingly reduced. Owner-occupied housing could be excluded from the tax. The first $10,000 in gains could be excluded from the tax. Some submissions further suggested that this tax should be independent of the taxpayer’s marginal rate, and some suggested it should be an inflation-indexed tax. • Imputation credits should be given for foreign dividends. • Company tax and income tax should be reduced. • Company tax rates should be higher than individual tax rates. • Income tax on low levels of income should be abolished or minimised and replaced with a capital gains tax and higher GST on alcohol, high-fat foods and TV to modify New Zealanders’ behaviour. • Healthy food should be exempt from GST. • GST should be increased, which means a larger number of people contribute to the tax take, including overseas visitors. • Personal tax should be abolished to give greater incentives to work longer hours and to an older age. • The requirement for returning New Zealanders to have been absent for at least ten years to get the exemption on their foreign income should be lowered to five years. • There should be a stamp duty on property, with a limited threshold for owner- occupied housing. Comment Some of these submissions, such as those relating to the company tax rate, will be addressed by other government initiatives such as the Business Tax Review. Other measures, such as the temporary exemption from tax on overseas income for new migrants, relate to previously enacted legislation. However, all these submissions are outside the scope of this bill. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 40 APPENDIX OF SUBMISSIONS No. Name 1W Earle Williamson 2W Peter Schmuck-Poeschl 3W Robert Fong 4W Dave Sedcole 5W Robin Grant 6W Ronald (Leo)Leader 7W

submissions on the new tax rules for offshore portfolio investment in shares. The bill, as introduced, contained proposals to change the tax rules for investments of less than 10% in foreign companies. The objective of these changes was to tax portfolio investments in offshore companies more consistently, regardless of whether the investment was made through a managed fund, or made directly, and regardless of where the investment was located. It was also considered important to have offshore tax rules that did not bias investment away from New Zealand. The fundamental principle underlying tax reform is that a reasonable level of tax should be payable on New Zealanders’ income, irrespective of whether the income is earned in New Zealand or offshore. The original proposals suggested taxing offshore portfolio share investments on 85% of any gain in value, with this limited to 5% of the opening value (with any excess gain being carried forward). We were forwarded over 1,400 submissions on the bill proposals, with the vast majority opposing them on the basis that they would introduce a capital gains tax and were excessively complex. In response to these concerns, and the suggestions in a number of submissions that a deemed rate of return be considered, the government invited the Finance and Expenditure Committee to consider a fair dividend rate method for taxing offshore portfolio share investments. This would involve taxing investors on 5% of the opening market value of shares held at the start of a year. However, individuals investing directly and via family trusts would be able to pay tax on their actual return, if this was lower than 5%, with no tax payable when returns are negative. The fair dividend rate method was considered preferable to the bill proposals, both on the grounds of simplicity and fairness, as it would tax something approximating a reasonable dividend yield rather than targeting capital gains. The Finance and Expenditure Committee released an interim report outlining the government’s fair dividend rate proposal (attaching draft legislation) and invited comment from stakeholders representing individual investors, financial advisors, managed funds and tax and legal professionals. Many of the submissions on this new proposal stated that their first preference was for the current offshore tax rules to remain, with certain modifications such as expansion of the grey list and extension of capital account treatment for managed funds. However, submitters did acknowledge that the fair dividend rate was preferred to the proposals currently in the bill. Submissions on the fair dividend rate proposal raised two key policy issues. The first major policy issue was the level of the fair dividend rate. Submissions were generally unsupportive of the proposed 5% fair dividend rate. They considered a lower fixed rate of between 3 and 4% should apply, as this was more representative of average offshore dividend yields. 4 The second major concern of submissions was that the proposal did not align the treatment of direct offshore investment and offshore investment via a New Zealand managed fund. That is, investments via a New Zealand managed fund would be taxed on a fixed 5% fair dividend rate, while direct investment would get the benefit of a lower rate (or no tax being payable) depending on actual returns. In particular, submissions were concerned that the difference in treatment could result in New Zealanders investing in offshore managed funds rather than New Zealand managed funds. Submissions saw a reduction in the 5% fair dividend rate as a means of aligning the two tax treatments. Officials consider that a 5% fair dividend rate is appropriate as this broadly approximates the dividend yield on Australasian equities. Unlike New Zealand and Australia, which have dividend imputation systems, many other countries have tax systems which discourage dividend payment. Low dividend yields on offshore shares is one of the main reasons why reform of the offshore tax rules is necessary. A lower fair dividend rate based on average offshore dividend yields is not appropriate as the low average offshore dividend rate is the problem and therefore should not be part of the solution. Officials consider concerns raised that New Zealand managed funds would be put at a competitive disadvantage compared to offshore funds are significantly overstated. They do not take into account that: • the bill removes the current major tax disadvantages that New Zealand funds face – full tax on capital gains and over-taxation of low rate investors; • the proposals cap the tax rate on fund investors at 33%, versus 39% for direct investors; • managed fund investors will not have their social assistance entitlements affected; and • managed funds will now be exempt on Australasian share gains, whereas individual share traders will continue to be taxed on these gains. It is important to keep in mind that the New Zealand managed fund industry has survived to date despite the major tax disadvantages it faces. It is, therefore, not credible to suggest that the existence of a relatively minor difference in the fair dividend rate treatment – 5% fixed for managed funds versus 5% variable for individuals investing directly – could be significant. The submissions on the fair dividend rate proposal raised a number of technical issues, which are discussed in this report and will be taken into account in the drafting of these amendments. Submissions on the bill as introduced also raised a number of technical issues. These issues are discussed in this report, although a number of these would no longer be applicable if the recommendation to replace the market value and smoothed market value methods currently in the bill with the fair dividend rate method is accepted. 5 OFFSHORE PROPOSALS SHOULD NOT PROCEED Submissions 597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 12a – NZ Funds, 578 – NZICA, 569 – ING, 594 – NZLS, 591 – Duncan Cotterill, 555 – Forsyth Barr, 596 – ISI, 588 – Trustees Corporation Association, 592 – Tower, 594 – NZLS, 581 – Russell McVeagh, 556 – AMP, 585 – NZ Exchange listed UK Investment Trust Companies, 560 – Institute of Financial Advisers, 565 – NZBio, 566, 936 – ABN AMRO Craigs, 568 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 570 – Richard Entwistle, 571 – Dr Kelvin Duncan, 575 – Direct Broking, 997W – Grosvenor, 881, 1138 – Perpetual Trust Limited, 1142 – Carter Holt Harvey Employee Benefits Plan and Retirement Plan, 573 – Guinness Peat Group, 1141 – MCA NZ, 1146 – General Electric, 936 – ABN AMRO Craigs, 1221 – Ernst & Young, 965, 1226 – Deloitte, 1239W – Blackmore Virtue & Owens, 1347W – Northplan Financial Services / Swain Investment Services/ Colin Strang Financial Planning, 1382W – Equity Investment Advisers & Sharebrokers, 460 – Securities Industry Association, 468W – Platinum Asset Management, 492, 880 – First NZ Capital, 496W – Fundsource, 510 – Liontamer, 603 – Goldman Sachs JBWere, 1221 – Ernst & Young for Maunsell, 613W – Phillips Fox, 615 – Business NZ, 734 – Todd Corporation, 988 – American Chamber of Commerce in NZ, 574 – Staples Rodway, 674W – Waterfront Industry Superannuation Fund, 1131 – David Patterson (MinterEllisonRuddWatt), 657W – Sothertons, 682W – Private Trust Company, 503W – Anonymous, 478W – Anonymous, 471W – David Sissons, 467W – M.D. Macfarlane, 415W – Andrew Reid, 462W – Stuart Scott, 194W – Phillipa Williams, 70W – Howard Cedric Zingel, 87W – Howard and Glenys Baker, 882W – Lee Stevens, 926 – Associate Professor Martin Young & Professor Lawrence C.

In particular, submissions commented that: • The proposals are too complex and will result in significant compliance costs for qualifying funds and investors (which will result in inadvertent and deliberate non-compliance). • A capital gains tax on unrealised gains is the harshest possible form of tax treatment and will give rise to cash-flow issues. • The proposals encourage New Zealanders to leave and discourage new immigrants from coming to New Zealand and expatriates from returning. The proposals conflict with other policy objectives such as the recently enacted exemptions for new migrants and returning New Zealanders. • Informed investors are aware they should have a diversified portfolio and the proposals discourage investment into non-Australasian shares and therefore provide a disincentive against having a diversified portfolio. The proposals would leave New Zealand investors dangerously over-exposed to local assets. 6 A number of submissions suggested alternatives to the proposals currently in the bill, including: • Offshore portfolio equity investments should be taxed based on an expanded grey list which would include all countries that broadly meet the criteria set out in the Tax Reform Consultative Committee report and the Taxing Income Across International Borders discussion document. Investments in the expanded grey list should be given capital account treatment (that is, not taxed on capital gains). • Alternatively, investments in an expanded grey list should be taxable on the higher of actual distributions or a minimum return percentage, based on average dividend yields to deal with the problem of investment in grey list roll up vehicles. • Capital gains on equities from countries outside an expanded grey list (so-called “black list” countries) should be fully taxed. Rolled-up income from any expanded grey list vehicles and vehicles that invest into “black list” countries should also be fully taxed. The $50,000 de minimis threshold for individuals’ direct holdings should be maintained for investments in “black list” countries. • The exemptions from the proposed offshore tax rules should be expanded to include countries with high distribution rates such as the United Kingdom. • Alternatively, the grey list should be maintained and a specific exemption included for managed funds for their trading gains on their grey list investments. This would put direct and indirect grey list investors on the same tax footing. PIEs should be exempt from tax on proceeds from the sale of shares in grey list companies, subject to specific exceptions. If this is not accepted, the capital gains tax on non-Australasian shares should be limited to 5% per annum of the opening value of the shares, so as to (at least) reduce the distortion that would disincentivise investment in non-Australasian shares. • Any concerns with specific grey list vehicles (for example with UK Investment Trusts) should be addressed independently, with the grey list retained. The grey list, while not perfect, is far less distortionary than the current proposals in the bill. • The requirement to pay tax on unrealised gains should be removed. If a capital gains tax has to be levied on offshore portfolio investments in shares, then it should be based on 50% of the capital gains at the time of disposal. Alternatively, gains should be taxed on a realised basis only. • A broad “active business” exemption (such as in Australia) should be introduced. This proposal was supported by the Tax Review 2001 (“McLeod”) Committee as an area warranting further investigation. 7 Comment As noted in our response to the non-technical submissions in the bill (Volume 2 of the officials’ report), the proposed changes to the taxation of investment income were introduced to remove a number of distortions in the current tax rules for offshore portfolio investments. These include the difference in tax treatment when investing in offshore shares directly and via a managed fund and also when the investment is made in a grey list country versus a non-grey list country. The offshore tax proposals are designed to create a more level playing field by applying broadly the same tax rules for direct investors and managed funds and for investments in the current grey list and non-grey list countries. The tax changes are also designed to ensure that investment in offshore shares is not tax-advantaged compared to investment in New Zealand companies. The fair dividend rate method, if accepted as an alternative to the current offshore tax proposals in the bill, should achieve the above objectives while addressing the key concerns raised in relation to the bill proposals. These concerns were the complexity and perceived unfairness of the market value and smoothed market value methods in the bill. The alternative suggestions put forward in submissions of retaining or expanding the current list of eight grey list countries and applying capital account treatment to investments in those countries (for both individual and managed fund investors) would not achieve the objective of having tax rules that do not favour offshore investment. This is because New Zealanders would still have incentives to invest in vehicles that pay little or no tax in foreign jurisdictions (there are a number of such vehicles in the current grey list) and pay little or no dividends. Increasing the number of countries that would be eligible for grey list treatment would simply exacerbate this issue. Dealing with specific concerns in the grey list independently is not feasible, as it would be difficult for Inland Revenue to constantly monitor effective tax rates in other countries and to close down the use of tax-advantaged vehicles in these countries (e.g. by “black listing” them). The proliferation of such vehicles and efficient international tax planning would mean that such an approach would always be “two steps” behind the latest schemes. A “black list” approach generally for all countries other than those in an expanded grey list would be arbitrary, and therefore undesirable. Officials also do not consider that an active business exemption is viable for portfolio share investments (i.e. investments of less than 10% in foreign companies) as, in order to apply such rules, investors would need to work out whether the underlying investments are “active” or not. This would be difficult for portfolio investors to comply with. 8 Recommendation That the submission to tax non-Australasian shares at 5% of the investment’s opening value each year be accepted. This concept has been incorporated in the proposed fair dividend rate method, which should address a number of concerns raised by submitters in relation to the complexity and perceived unfairness of the current bill proposals. The remaining submissions should be declined. 9 TIMING OF THE INTRODUCTION OF THE NEW RULES Issue: General deferral of introduction of new offshore tax rules Submissions (591 – Duncan Cotterill, 555 – Forsyth Barr, 1142 – Carter Holt Harvey Employee Benefits Plan and Retirement Plan, 1382W – Equity Investments Advisers and Sharebrokers, 615W – Business NZ, 611 – New Zealand Assets Management Limited) If the proposals in the bill are to proceed, implementation should be deferred for five years to allow affected investors time to adjust, for example by realising assets that would otherwise be double taxed. Contrary to views expressed by government and officials, there is no need to have the overseas tax changes implemented by 1 April 2007 for KiwiSaver, particularly as they result in higher tax liabilities and lower diversification. The commencement date of the offshore tax rules should be deferred until 1 April 2009. The proposed changes for the taxation of offshore portfolio investment should be postponed for at least 12 months or longer. The government should proceed with the changes to managed funds, however it should defer the proposed rules for offshore investment until the full consequences have been debated, understood and accepted. The Committee should consider deferring the offshore proposals so that additional work can be undertaken on the deemed rate of return approach to taxation of international investments. Comment The key policy objectives of the offshore tax changes is to remove the current distortions between investing directly or through a managed fund and between investing in grey list and non-grey list countries. These distortions should be removed as soon as practicable, particularly given the 2007 application date for KiwiSaver. Therefore, officials recommend that the 1 April 2007 application date for the offshore tax changes, as is currently in the bill, be retained subject to the recommendation under the next issue. Recommendation That the submission to defer the application of the new offshore tax rules be declined, subject to our recommendation under the next issue. 10 Issue: Alignment of new offshore and portfolio investment entity tax rules Submission (FDR 5 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, FDR 6 – AMP, FDR 8 – ISI, FDR 15 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Entities that will be eligible to qualify as PIEs should be able to elect that the new offshore tax rules do not apply to them until 1 October 2007, or, if the entity elects to become a PIE in its first income year starting on or after 1 April 2007, from the date the election is effective (the current offshore tax rules will continue to apply until that date). One submission on the fair dividend rate proposal suggested that the application date of the new offshore tax rules for individuals should also be delayed for 12-18 months to allow Inland Revenue to publicise the amendments and individuals to consider the impact of the changes. Comment The current application date in the bill provides that both the new offshore tax rules and the PIE rules will apply for income years starting on or after 1 April 2007. The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue wrote to the Committee in August this year recommending that the application date for the new PIE tax rules be deferred until 1 October 2007. This deferral was connected to the deferral of the KiwiSaver scheme (the PIE tax rules will be compulsory for KiwiSaver default funds). The deferral to 1 October 2007 also gives savings vehicles more time to prepare for the implementation of the PIE tax rules. The resulting non-alignment between the application dates for the new offshore tax rules (1 April 2007) and the PIE tax rules (1 October 2007) creates tax timing problems for some savings vehicles that intend to become PIEs from 1 October 2007. These problems can be addressed by allowing entities that will be eligible to be PIEs to elect that the new offshore tax rules will apply to them from 1 October 2007, or, if the entity elects to become a PIE in its first income year starting on or after 1 October 2007, from the date that the PIE election is effective. The current offshore tax rules would continue to apply until that date. The proposed offshore tax rules should continue to apply from 1 April 2007 for individuals and other non-PIE investors as a 1 October 2007 application date would mean that these investors would be subject to different sets of tax rules in their 2007- 08 income year. That is, the current offshore tax rules would apply for six months until 30 September 2007, with the fair dividend rate method (if implemented) applying from 1 October 2007. This would result in unnecessary complexity. We also do not support delaying the offshore tax rules for individuals until 1 April 2008, as this would be arbitrary. Individuals will have until 1 April 2007 to consider their affairs, prior to the new rules applying. Recommendation That the submissions that PIEs should be able to defer the application date of the new offshore tax rules until 1 October 2007 be accepted. 11 ALTERNATIVE FIF CALCULATION METHOD – TAXING A DEEMED RETURN Submissions (597 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 581 – Russell McVeagh, 579 – Macquarie, 585 – NZX, 555 – Forsyth Barr, 556 – AMP, 585 – NZ Exchange listed UK Investment Trust Companies, 1146 – General Electric, 936 – ABN AMRO Craigs, 1347W – Northplan Financial Services / Swain Investment Services / Colin Strang Financial Planning, 460 – Securities Industry Association, 492, 880 – First NZ Capital, 496W – Fundsource, 603 – Goldman Sachs JBWere, 611 – New Zealand Assets Management Limited, 1131 – David Patterson (MinterEllisonRuddWatt), 657W – Sothertons, 559 – ABN AMRO New Zealand, 976 – William Stevens (ABN AMRO Craigs), 1148 – Frank Aldridge (ABN AMRO Craigs), 1133 – Stuart + Carlyon) Investors should have the option of applying a modified smooth market value method which would cap tax paid on PIE income to 5% over time, with no wash-up for tax on realisation. The method should also include a “fixed return method” where income is determined as a set percentage of the average value of a portfolio in a year. The fixed return should be less than the 5% cap proposed for the smoothed market value method (around 4%). The capital gains tax on non-Australasian shares should be limited to 5% per annum of the opening value of shares held. The 5% per annum cap should not be available for interests acquired and disposed of within a 12-month period. Rather 85% of the profit or loss on disposal of such interests should be brought to tax. A deemed rate of return would greatly simplify the tax calculation and would remove the distortions between investment in grey list and other countries. A 3.5% deemed rate on equity investments outside Australasia, which equates to the average yield on the Australian equity market, would fit with the government’s implicit assessment that the Australian market returns a “fair” dividend yield. The risk free return method outlined in the McLeod Tax Review should be introduced. The rate should be based on the average yield of the Australian S&P 2000 index – 3.7%. A 5% tax is too high and would represent over-taxation versus investing into NZ and Australia. An investor’s income should be the lesser of 85% of the increase in value of their investment plus dividends or 5% of the opening value of their investment. Any amounts over and above this cap should not be subject to tax. Such a result would ensure that the New Zealand government in effect taxes offshore investments at a 5% rate of return, but only where there are actual unrealised gains and/or cash flow to support the taxation imposed. A deemed dividend income approach that would tax 3% of the value of the investment as at 1 April each year should be introduced. The rate of 3% can be reasonably argued as an income tax and not a wealth tax as it roughly approximates the long run dividend yield of world equity markets, excluding New Zealand and Australia. At 5% there is the argument of a wealth tax rather than an income tax. 12 A deemed rate of return on all foreign investments within a range of 2-3% should be introduced. This approximates the average gross dividend yield on a globally diversified share portfolio. A standard return rate which would equate to the New Zealand government five-year bond rate multiplied by the average capital value of offshore investments held with credits given for income received from these investments should be introduced. An earnings per share based model could be used to assess tax on offshore portfolio investment. Comment Officials note that these submissions, which broadly advocate a deemed rate of return approach, have been taken into account as part of the government’s decision to recommend the fair dividend rate method to the Finance and Expenditure Committee. The fair dividend rate method is based on taxing deemed income, with actual income that exceeds the deemed amount not taxed. The 5% fair dividend rate method recommended by officials is not out of line with what many of the submitters are suggesting – particularly given that individuals would not be taxed in years where they make a loss (making the effective fair dividend rate about 3.5%). The detailed design of the fair dividend rate method is outlined in the next section. Recommendation That the submissions to replace the market value and smoothed market value methods with a deemed rate of return method be noted. 13 FAIR DIVIDEND RATE METHOD Overview A number of submissions on the bill suggested that the market value method (which would tax 85% of offshore share gains each year) and the smoothed market value method (which would limit the tax on 85% of the gains to 5% of the opening value in a given year, with the excess carried forward) should be replaced with a deemed rate of return. The key concerns raised were the complexity of the smoothed market value method – in particular the need to carry forward gains in excess of the 5% cap – and the perceived unfairness of both methods. In response to these concerns and the suggestions that a deemed return approach be considered, the government wrote to the Finance and Expenditure Committee suggesting a fair dividend rate method for taxing New Zealanders’ offshore portfolio share investments. The Committee released an interim report attaching an issues paper on the detailed design of a fair dividend rate method, and draft legislation containing the proposal. Submissions from 20 stakeholders representing managed funds, investment advisors, individual shareholders and tax and legal professionals were sought on the new proposal. This section outlines the key issues raised in those submissions and officials’ comments in respect of them. Issue: Reaction to the fair dividend rate Submissions (FDR 1 – Securities Industry Association, FDR 2 – Bruce Raymond Sheppard, FDR 3- Craig Stobo, FDR 4 – NZ Assets Management, FDR 5 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, FDR 6 – AMP, FDR 7 – First NZ Capital, FDR 8 – ISI, FDR 9 – ABN AMRO, FDR 10 – NZICA, FDR 11 – Robert McLeod, FDR 12 – NZ Funds, FDR 13 – New Zealand Law Society, FDR 14 – Staples Rodway, FDR 15 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, FDR 16 – GPG, FDR 17 – Brook Asset Management, FDR 18 – Saxe-Coburg, FDR 19 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) A number of submissions commented that the preferred solution would be to keep the current grey list for offshore portfolio investments. Some of the submissions reiterated earlier suggestions that the grey list should be extended and managed funds be given capital account treatment on their grey list equities. These submissions commented that specific avoidance concerns should be dealt with separately. The submissions did, however, generally comment that the fair dividend rate proposal was preferable to the proposals currently in the bill. One submission supported the fair dividend rate method as an interim measure. A few submissions commented that the fair dividend rate proposal should not proceed as it was a wealth tax, had a number of inadequacies which were incurable and 14 fundamental, and would result in incentives for tax haven investing. A few submissions also objected to the fair dividend rate proposals on the basis of the compressed time-frames and lack of public consultation. These submissions were concerned that any resulting legislation would contain unintended anomalies and problems which would be difficult to fix. Submissions were also received suggesting, on principle, that the grey list exemption should be removed. One submission on this issue suggested, however, that such a proposal should be subject to a full consultation process. Another submission suggested that the final design of the tax rules for offshore portfolio investment should ideally be determined by the design of the tax rules for foreign direct investment (currently under review). However, if this suggestion was not accepted the fair dividend rate was supported subject to concerns around interest deductibility being addressed. Comment For the reasons outlined earlier we do not consider that retaining or expanding the current grey list and applying capital account treatment to investments in these countries is viable. We therefore recommend that these submissions be declined. Officials note some support for removal of the grey list exemption for offshore portfolio investments. On the issue of the timeframes for consulting more fully on the fair dividend rate proposals, it should be noted that a number of submissions on the bill as introduced suggested that a deemed rate of return approach be considered. We also consider that the fair dividend rate proposal is similar in effect to the smoothed market value method originally proposed. The key differences are the removal of the need to carry forward gains in excess of 5% and the ability to claim losses. Therefore, it is not correct to say that the fair dividend rate proposal is a complete change in tax policy direction which requires further consultation. Furthermore, the limited consultation on the fair dividend rate proposal suggests a general acceptance that the fair dividend rate proposal is preferable to the current bill proposals and the feedback on the detailed design has suggested that the technical issues with the fair dividend rate method can be addressed. We do not consider it desirable to delay reform of the tax rules for offshore portfolio investments to align with the outcome of the review into the controlled foreign company rules, as this would prolong the current tax distortions that favour direct offshore portfolio investment over investment via managed funds. The review of the CFC rules will take into account the proposed reform of the tax rules for portfolio investment (that is less than 10% interests) in foreign companies. Recommendation That the submissions recommending the grey list be maintained or extended to other countries (and investments in these countries be afforded capital account treatment) be declined. Submissions recommending deferral of the offshore portfolio tax changes should also be declined. 15 Issue: The appropriate fair dividend rate Submissions (FDR 1 – Securities Industry Association, FDR 2 – Bruce Raymond Sheppard, FDR 3- Craig Stobo, FDR 4 – NZ Assets Management, FDR 5 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, FDR 6 – AMP, FDR 7 – First NZ Capital, FDR 8 – ISI, FDR 9 – ABN AMRO, FDR 10 – NZICA, FDR 12 – NZ Funds, FDR 13 – New Zealand Law Society, FDR 15 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, FDR 17 – Brook Asset Management, FDR 18 – Saxe- Coburg, FDR 19 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) Submissions commented that a 5% fair dividend rate was too high and should be lowered to between 3 and 4% (with no reduction in this rate in loss years). A 3-3.5% rate was considered a more appropriate representation of average offshore dividend yields (although one submission suggested 2.6% as the appropriate benchmark based on MSCI World Index yields). A 4% yield was considered appropriate as this was considered the average dividend yield on Australasian equities. One submission commented that 5% was an appropriate compromise, in so far as, both individuals and managed funds received the same treatment. Submissions also commented that the fair dividend rate need not be set in stone (for example, it could be set by Order in Council). Comment The fair dividend rate method is aimed at taxing a reasonable dividend yield on offshore portfolio share investments. What is reasonable should be measured against the dividend payout rates by New Zealand companies, which due to dividend imputation, can be expected to pay out a large proportion of their earnings to shareholders – around 6.5% inclusive of imputation credits. The average dividend yield on Australian shares, whose tax system is the closest comparator to the New Zealand one, is also high at around 4.5% (net of Australian franking credits). Most other countries have tax systems that discourage companies distributing dividends, with the result that income can be rolled-up in the company, and realised as a tax-free capital gain to the New Zealand shareholder. Low dividend yields from offshore shares is one of the main reasons why it is not sustainable to maintain rules that only tax actual dividends from offshore investments. Such rules create a tax distortion in favour of investing offshore rather than in New Zealand companies. Submissions that the fair dividend rate should be set at the average dividend yield on offshore equity investment in the US and UK, for example, do not address the policy concern that offshore dividend yields are generally low. A fair dividend rate of around 5% does not seem unreasonable compared to average dividend yields of around 6.5% (gross) for New Zealand companies and around 4.5% (net) for Australian companies. A 5% fair dividend rate is also significantly lower than the historical returns on world equity investments, which have averaged around 9% over the last 20 years. 16 A 3-4% fair dividend rate would also put pressure on the boundary between what is a genuine offshore equity investment (and therefore subject to equity risk) and an investment in an offshore company that invests in high-yield debt (effectively generating “guaranteed returns” in excess of the fair dividend rate). If these offshore debt investments were made directly, they would be fully taxable. We therefore recommend later in this report that investments that generate so-called “guaranteed returns” – that is, investments akin to debt – should be excluded from the fair dividend rate method. However, it is worth noting that under a 5% fair dividend rate, the incentives to use roll-up offshore vehicles to access debt returns is likely to be significantly less than if the fair dividend rate were 3%. Consequently, the need for more complex anti-avoidance rules should be mitigated under a 5% fair dividend rate. Officials also note that one submission has suggested that the interest deductibility rules should be tightened under a fair dividend rate method, as otherwise investors could borrow money to make the investment and receive a tax deduction for the full interest cost even though the full return is not being taxed under the fair dividend rate. However, investors can currently receive a full interest deduction for money borrowed to invest in grey list companies most of which are likely to pay very low or no dividends. Officials, therefore, do not propose changing the interest deductibility rules for investors. Recommendation That the fair dividend rate be set at 5%. Issue: Different method for individuals and managed fund investors Submissions (FDR 1 – Securities Industry Association, FDR 2 – Bruce Raymond Sheppard, FDR 3 – Craig Stobo, FDR 4 – NZ Assets Management, FDR 5 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, FDR 6 – AMP, FDR 7 – First NZ Capital, FDR 8 – ISI, FDR 9 – ABN AMRO, FDR 10 – NZICA, FDR 12 – NZ Funds, FDR 13 – New Zealand Law Society, FDR 15 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, FDR 17 – Brook Asset Management, FDR 18 – Saxe- Coburg, FDR 19 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) Submissions broadly suggested that the same fair dividend rate methodology should apply to individual (and family trust investors) and managed funds. These submissions did not consider that the benefits conferred by the PIE tax rules would be a sufficient offset to the tax difference for managed funds from having a fixed 5% fair dividend rate apply, even in loss years. Some submissions suggested that “loss protection” for individuals could be accommodated by providing managed funds investing in offshore portfolio shares with a lower fixed fair dividend rate, at 3-4%, while allowing individuals and family trusts the benefit of a variable, 0-5%, fair dividend rate methodology. A variant of this was allowing a variable fair dividend rate to individuals and family trusts as a once- and-for all election. One submission suggested the variable fair dividend rate should be extended to trustees of employee share purchase schemes. 17 Other submissions commented that alignment of treatment between individuals investing directly and via New Zealand managed funds could best be achieved by having a lower fair dividend rate across the board – that is, a rate that applied equally to managed funds, other non-individuals, natural persons and family trusts. Comment As noted in response to submissions on the appropriate fair dividend rate, officials consider that the correct starting point for analysis of the fair dividend rate proposal is a 5% fair dividend rate as, in the main, this represents a reasonable dividend yield. For individuals investing in offshore portfolio shares directly and via family trusts, it was considered that taxing a 5% return in years in which offshore shares made negative returns could result in cash-flow difficulties and be perceived as inequitable. The government therefore proposed allowing individuals and family trusts to elect to be taxed on the lower of 5% of the opening market value of shares held and the actual return on those shares, under the fair dividend rate method. Such a concession was not considered appropriate for larger investors, such as managed funds, as they would generally be in a better position to manage the volatility associated with investing in offshore equities (they currently have to manage both share market and exchange rate volatility). Furthermore, a fixed fair dividend rate for PIEs, and managed funds generally, would have a considerable simplicity benefit compared to a variable fair dividend rate. This is because, under the PIE tax rules, PIEs would generally allocate investment income to investors daily and pay tax on this income at investors’ tax rates each quarter. There is also a fiscal concern with allowing managed funds a lower fixed fair dividend rate of around 3.5%. The extra fiscal cost would be around $65 million per annum. New Zealand managed funds versus offshore managed funds The concerns put forward by New Zealand managed funds are that allowing individuals who invest offshore directly to pay no tax when offshore equities make losses would incentivise investment in offshore managed funds (such as Australian unit trusts or United Kingdom investment trusts) to the detriment of the New Zealand managed funds industry. This is because no tax would be payable under the fair dividend rate when the value of the offshore managed fund falls (due to losses being made on the underlying equities), whereas an investment via a New Zealand managed fund holding the same offshore equities would be taxable on 5% even if losses are made. Two potential options to correct this anomaly are discussed below. Option 1: Fixed 5% fair dividend rate for investment in offshore managed funds The first option is to subject individuals and family trusts investing in offshore managed funds to a 5% fair dividend rate (without variation), to align with the tax treatment of an investment offshore via a New Zealand managed fund. 18 This option would ensure that offshore investment through either an offshore managed fund or a New Zealand managed funds are treated similarly for tax purposes. However, this would result in tax being payable by an individual or family trust investor on a 5% deemed return even where an investment in an offshore managed fund has fallen in value. This compares with the treatment of a direct portfolio investment in an offshore company, like Microsoft, which would receive the benefit of loss-protection. Option 2: High dividend yield Australian unit trust investments taxed on dividends The second option would be to include investments in Australian unit trusts in the proposed Australian FIF exemption. These unit trusts generally turn over a reasonable proportion of their investments and distribute any returns to investors (as the failure to distribute results in a significant tax penalty in Australia). The dividend yield on Australian unit trusts that turn over investments regularly should therefore be comparable to a 5% fair dividend rate, thereby removing the incentive to use Australian unit trusts as a tax-effective alternative to New Zealand managed funds. Investments in Australian unit trusts that do not turn over a higher proportion of their investments and consequently do not pay high dividends, should not be subject to the exemption. This option would require investors to know the underlying turnover of investments held by an Australian unit trust. This option would also not address the issue of investments in other offshore managed funds, which receive tax preferences, such as United Kingdom investment trusts. Fixed 5% fair dividend rate not a significant disadvantage for New Zealand funds In considering whether the fair dividend rate proposals put managed funds at a tax disadvantage compared to direct portfolio investments offshore, it is important to bear in mind that managed funds have had far worse tax treatment compared to direct investment historically. Historically, managed funds have been taxed on dividends plus realised gains while individuals have been taxed on dividends only. To quantify this, over the last 10 years or so total international share returns have been about 9% per year and dividend yields about 3% per year. This means active managed funds have been taxed at the equivalent of a 9% return rate and individuals at the equivalent of a 3% return rate, a differential of 6 percentage points. Under the fair dividend rate proposal, managed funds would be taxed at a 5% rate and individuals at an approximate 3.5% effective rate over the long term, a differential of 1.5 percentage points. Given that the tax disadvantage faced by funds is reducing so dramatically, it seems very unlikely that investors would abandon New Zealand managed funds and switch to investing through offshore managed funds directly under the fair dividend rate method. The reduction in the tax disincentive is supported by industry commentary, which suggests that for actively managed funds, the application of a fixed 5% fair dividend rate should be a significant improvement over the current taxation treatment. Research undertaken by AON Consulting suggests that for the period 2002-2006, when global returns averaged 8.3%, managed fund investors on the 33% tax rate would have been 19 30 basis points better off under the fair dividend rate method compared to the current tax rules while investors on the 19.5% tax rate would have been 130 basis points better off. 1 Officials also consider that the fair dividend rate method proposed for funds should not be viewed in isolation. The impact of the other tax proposals in the bill – that is, the PIE tax rules – as well as KiwiSaver should also be taken into account. Managed fund investors would receive a number of benefits that are not available to individual direct investors. These benefits are not immaterial and include: • having the tax rate on investment income capped at 33% (versus 39% for direct investors); • investment income not counting towards family assistance entitlements under Working for Families or affecting student loan repayment or child support payment obligations; • investors in PIEs receiving Australasian share gains free of tax, whereas individual share traders would continue to be taxable on these gains; and • not having employer contributions to KiwiSaver funds subject to tax. The total value of the tax changes for managed funds in the bill (as measured in terms of the revenue cost of the PIE tax rules) is in excess of $100 million per annum. While this is not of itself an argument for treating individual direct investors and investors using New Zealand managed funds differently, given the other policy objectives, it is not obviously clear that applying a fixed 5% fair dividend rate would result in a significant tax disadvantage for investors in managed funds, compared to investing directly in offshore shares. Recommendation Submissions suggesting a 3-4% fixed fair dividend rate method for both managed funds and individual direct investors should be declined. 1 AON investment update October 2006. 20 Issue: The fair dividend rate method to replace the current bill proposals Submission (Matter raised by officials) Subject to our comments in respect of the appropriate fair dividend rate and methodology, we recommend the following fair dividend rate methods for taxing offshore portfolio shareholdings replace the market value and smoothed market value methods in the bill: • Individual investors and family trusts should be taxed on a maximum of 5% of the opening market value of their offshore portfolio share investments at the start of an income year. If these investors can show that their actual return is less than 5%, they would be taxed on this lower amount with no tax payable when the total return is negative. • Non-natural persons (other than family trusts) should be taxed on 5% of the value of shares held each year. There would be no variation to this rate in years where the investor earns less than 5%. Comment Officials recommend that the fair dividend rate to replace the market value and smoothed market value methods in the bill should: • tax 5% of the market value of offshore shares held at the start of an income year; • apply only to portfolio investments in offshore shares – that is an interest of less than 10% in a foreign company – that have market values, with the current FIF rules continuing to apply to interests of 10% or more; • work on a pooled approach, rather than on an investment-by-investment approach for assets that qualify (this pooled approach would not apply to those assets for which a different income calculation method is used); • ignore purchases and sales of shares during a year (except where the shares are bought and sold in the same year – separate “quick sale” rules are proposed for these). • would not tax dividends separately. (Although foreign withholding tax deducted from dividends would still be available as a foreign tax credit under section LC 1(1) and (4) of the Income Tax Act 2004.) 21 For individual investors and family trusts, a variation to the fair dividend rate approach outlined above should be allowed. Under this variation if investors can show that their total return on all their offshore shares, for which the fair dividend rate method is allowed to be used, is less than 5% of the opening market value they would be taxable on the actual return. If the total return for the year is negative, no tax would be payable. The total return would be calculated by reference to the following formula: (closing market value of shares held + total sales proceeds + dividends received) – (opening market value of shares held + total value of purchases) For New Zealand managed funds, including portfolio investment entities, and non- natural persons, other than family trusts, the variation outlined above should not apply. This would mean that tax would be payable on a fixed 5% return irrespective of how investments perform. The 5% fair dividend rate would apply to the average value of the entity’s offshore portfolio share investments for the year. That is, for investment vehicles, such as unit trusts and superannuation funds, that calculate the value of their investments on a regular basis, the taxable income for each valuation period (which could range from a day to a quarter) would be calculated using the following formula: 5% x market value of investments at start of period x the number of days in the period number of days in the income year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Rule for assets that are bought and sold in the same income year (“quick sales”) Submissions (Matter raised by officials) If the fair dividend rate method is accepted, shares that are purchased after the start of the income year and then sold before the end of the same income year should be taxed on 5% of the cost of the purchase. (FDR 5 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, FDR 6 – AMP, FDR 8 – ISI, FDR 9 – ABN AMRO, FDR 12 – NZ Funds, FDR 13 – New Zealand Law Society, FDR 17 – Brook Asset Management, FDR 19 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) Submissions suggested that the application of the fair dividend rate method should be pro-rated for the number of days the investment was held during the year. Alternatively, they suggested that the proposed rules should be modified so that they tax the lesser of 5% of the cost or the actual gains when a “quick sale” is made. 22 One submission suggested that the proposed “quick sale” rules should be removed altogether and a general anti-avoidance rule be drafted instead to capture those who buy and sell within a year to defeat the application of the fair dividend rate method. Two submissions commented that the “quick sale” rules as presently drafted were unworkable. Comment We consider that a rule is needed to tax shares that are bought and sold within the same income year – that is, shares that are purchased after 1 April and sold before the following 31 March. Shares that are bought and sold within an income year would otherwise escape tax under a fair dividend rate method as they would not be reflected in the value of shares held at the start of the year or the start of the next year. We consider that the appropriate way to deal with shares that are bought and sold in the same income year, under a fair dividend rate method, would be to tax 5% of the average cost of offshore shares purchased during a year that are sold before the end of the year. These are described as “quick sales” in the draft legislation. The average cost is necessary as different parcels of shares may be purchased during the year at different prices. Taking the average cost of all such share parcels purchased in a year should be easier than requiring investors to track the cost of each share that is subsequently sold. Under the proposed variation to the fair dividend rate method for individual investors and family trusts, individuals would only be taxable on 5% of the average cost of any offshore shares that are bought and sold within the year, if their portfolio as a whole has made a total return of 5% or greater. For example, if their portfolio has made a return of only 3%, the investor would only be taxed at 3% of the average cost in relation to the “quick sale”. Managed funds that value their offshore investments daily, such as unit trusts would not need to apply this rule, as income would be calculated daily under the fair dividend rate method. However, where the valuation period is longer than a day, for example a quarter, this “quick sale” rule should apply to any shares that are bought after the start of the quarter and are sold before the end of the quarter. Submissions have however raised valid concerns in relation to instances where an investor purchases shares (in say A Co) during a year and sells these shares before the end of the year, and then uses the proceeds to buy shares in another company (B Co) which are sold before the end of the year. Under the “quick sale” rules as currently proposed these investors would be subject to tax on 5% of the cost of each lot of A Co and B Co shares bought and sold during the year. This could be irrespective of the profit (or loss) made on these “quick sales” as investors other than individuals and family trusts would not be able to pay tax based on the actual return if this is less than 5%. Therefore, a superannuation fund that is not a daily valuer may be caught by these rules in respect of their offshore trading activities. In these instances, we consider that investors should be able to pay tax based on the lower of 5% of the cost or the actual gains made on any “quick sales”. 23 Rules are also required to deal with situations where an investor buys and sells shares during an income year and there is a share split between when the shares were purchased and when they were sold. This is described as a “share re-organisation” in the draft legislation. Investors would need to work out the average cost of the “equivalent interest” that is sold for the purposes of applying the fair dividend rate. Recommendation That the officials’ submission be accepted, subject to our comments about amending the “quick sale” rules for investors (other than daily valuers) to allow them to pay tax based on the lower of 5% of the cost or the actual gains made on any “quick sales”. Issue: Offshore investments for which the fair dividend rate would not apply Submission (Matter raised by officials) The fair dividend rate method should not apply to investments which have an effectively non-contingent obligation, directly or through an arrangement, to return an amount to the investor that exceeds the issue price of the investment. These investments, which are akin to debt, should be subject to the comparative value method in the foreign investment fund rules. Further, there should be discretion for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to issue a determination that: • an investment that did not meet the definition outlined above, but was still substantially debt in nature, would be treated as a non-qualifying investment and therefore subject to taxation under the comparative value method; and • an investment that did meet the definition but was not substantially debt in nature would not be treated as a non-qualifying investment and therefore remain subject to the fair dividend rate method. Investments in foreign companies in the form of fixed-rate shares (as defined in section LF 2(3) of the Income Tax Act 2004) and non-participating redeemable shares (as defined in section CD 14(9)) should specifically not qualify for the fair dividend rate method. As a further safe-guard, investments in offshore entities whose assets comprise 80% or greater New Zealand dollar denominated financial arrangements (i.e. debt instruments) should also not qualify for the fair dividend rate method. 24 (FDR 6 – AMP, FDR 8 – ISI, FDR 10 – NZICA, FDR 12 – NZ Funds, FDR 15 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, FDR 19 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) Submissions suggested that: • As a matter of practicality, managed funds be allowed to elect (via notification to Inland Revenue) that a particular investment be treated as debt. • The proposed “guaranteed return” rules were too wide and should be made more specific. Alternatively, a submission suggested that a public binding ruling should be issued on the application of this section at least two months prior to its application date for managed funds. • Any resulting Commissioner determination should be on a prospective basis, unless the taxpayer is subject to the tax penalties rules (for example, for taking an abusive tax position) in respect of the investment that is subject to the determination. • The proposed Commissioner determination process should allow fund managers to obtain a determination in a timely and cost effective fashion. Comment Officials consider that the fair dividend rate method should not apply in the case of certain offshore portfolio share investments, which effectively offer New Zealand investors “guaranteed returns” in excess of the fair dividend rate. For example, a portfolio investment in a company resident in a low-tax jurisdiction that invests in high-yield debt or other guaranteed return instruments (with rates of return greater than 5%) would be taxable on a maximum return of 5% under the fair dividend rate whereas if they had invested directly in these instruments they would be taxable on the full return. The fair dividend rate should therefore not apply to such investments. Officials consider that the Australian “economic substance” test for determining whether an instrument is debt or equity, would be useful in determining investments for which the fair dividend rate method should not apply. That is, an investment which has an effectively non-contingent obligation, directly or through an arrangement, to return an amount to the investor that exceeds the issue price of the investment should not be subject to the fair dividend rate, as such an investment would in essence be debt. Contingencies that are immaterially remote would be ignored for the purposes of this rule (guidelines issued by the Australian Tax Office should provide guidance on understanding what an “immaterially remote contingency” is). Investments that are carved out of the fair dividend rate method should be subject to the comparative value method under the foreign investment fund rules. 25 Officials also consider that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue should be able to issue a determination: • that an investment that did not meet the definition of “debt” outlined above, but was still substantially debt in nature, would be treated as a non-qualifying investment and therefore subject to taxation under the comparative value method; and • that an investment that met the definition but was not substantially “debt” in nature would not be treated as a non-qualifying investment and therefore remain subject to the fair dividend rate method. This determination process should provide sufficient flexibility to deal with cases close to the boundary. We do not consider that the Commissioner determination process should apply in the case of investments in foreign companies in the form of fixed-rate shares (as defined in section LF 2(3) of the Income Tax Act 2004) and non-participating redeemable shares (as defined in section CD 14(9)). These investments, which offer “guaranteed return”, should automatically be subject to the comparative value method. As a further safe-guard, investments in offshore entities whose assets comprise 80% or greater New Zealand dollar denominated financial arrangements (i.e. debt instruments) should also not qualify for the fair dividend rate method. This is necessary, as the rules proposed above may not be effective in instances where the investment is in a foreign bond fund that invests back into New Zealand government debt. This is because the obligation to provide a return in excess of the issue price would apply in respect of the foreign fund holding the NZ debt, not between the NZ investor and the fund. We consider the scope of such a rule could be limited to offshore entities holding New Zealand dollar-denominated debt, given the exchange rate volatility (and therefore risk) associated with debt instruments denoted in other currencies. Also, foreign debt is generally unlikely to yield a risk-free return that is higher than 5%. In relation to the points raised in submissions, we consider that managed funds should apply the objective rules proposed earlier when determining whether an offshore investment should be subject to the fair dividend rate method or the comparative value method (rather than simply electing that an investment is in substance debt). On the issue of the proposed so-called “guaranteed return” rules being more targeted, officials have attempted to draw a reasonable debt/equity distinction (based on what is used by the Australia tax system) with a Commissioner determination to deal with issues close to the boundary. Objective tests of this kind are inherently difficult, but are needed as otherwise there would be significant scope for abuse of the fair dividend rate method. We do, however, agree with submissions that any determinations should be on a prospective basis, unless the taxpayer is subject to the tax penalties rules (for example, for taking an abusive tax position) in respect of the investment that is subject to the determination. We are also currently working through the practical issues with the Commissioner determination process. Inland Revenue will endeavour to ensure that this process operates effectively. 26 Recommendation That the officials’ submission and the submission that any Commissioner determinations be on a prospective basis, unless the taxpayer is subject to the tax penalties rules (for example, for taking an abusive tax position) in respect of the investment that is subject to the determination, be accepted. Other submissions should be declined. Issue: Interests greater than 10% Submissions (FDR 5 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, FDR 6 – AMP, FDR 8 – ISI, FDR 10 – NZICA, FDR 11 – Robert McLeod, FDR 12 – NZ Funds, FDR 15 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, FDR 17 – Brook Asset Management) Submissions suggested that the fair dividend rate method should be able to be applied in respect of 10% or greater interests in foreign investment vehicles that are held by managed funds. Another submission commented that the fair dividend rate should be able to be used in respect of interests greater than 10% if the New Zealand investor is not able to control or influence the distribution policies of a foreign entity. A submission also commented that the fair dividend rate method should be available for interests of greater than 10% in non-grey list countries. Comment As noted earlier, the new offshore tax rules would generally apply only to portfolio investments (that is, interests of less than 10%) in foreign companies. However, managed funds and PIEs would be subject to the proposed offshore tax rules in respect of all their non-controlling offshore share investments (which due to the widely-held nature of these funds can be viewed, as in substance, being portfolio investment). The current bill proposals would have applied the market value method for interests greater than 10% in offshore companies held by PIEs and other managed funds that were not CFCs. PIEs, any entity eligible to become a PIE (such as a superannuation fund that does not elect), or a life insurance company holding a 10% or greater interest in a foreign investment vehicle, as defined for the purposes of the PIE rules, should be allowed to apply the fair dividend rate method in respect of these investments. This should largely address the concerns raised in submissions. The proposed definition of foreign investment vehicle (which is similar in nature to that of a PIE) should mean that there is sufficient independence of control. In the case of individuals and non-PIE investors, the current tax rules would continue to apply to interests of 10% and greater in foreign companies. This would include the grey list exemption and the existing FIF rules. The appropriate tax treatment of non- controlled offshore investments of 10% or greater is relevant to the current review of 27 the CFC rules. Officials therefore do not recommend any changes in this area as part of this reform. Recommendation PIEs, any entity eligible to become a PIE (such as a superannuation fund that does not elect), or a life insurance company holding a 10% or greater interest in a foreign investment vehicle, as defined for the purposes of the PIE rules, should be allowed to apply the fair dividend rate method in respect of these investments. The other submissions should be declined. Issue: Treatment of portfolio investments for which market values are not available – new cost-based method Submission (Matter raised by officials) A cost-based method should be available for offshore portfolio investments for which it is not possible or practical to obtain market values (that is, investments for which the fair dividend rate method is not practical). This method, which would replace the cost method currently in the bill, would tax 5% of the cost of a person’s investments, with the cost base increased by 5% each year to proxy for an increase in the value of the investment. (FDR 2 – Bruce Raymond Sheppard, FDR 5 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, FDR 9 – ABN AMRO, FDR 10 – NZICA, FDR 15 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, FDR 19 – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) Submissions commented that: • The proposed rules should not apply in respect of investments in private companies or shares acquired through employee share purchase schemes. • A “wash-up” should be allowed under the proposed cost method, if an investor elects to do one. • Where shares are not listed on a recognised exchange, investors should have the ability to use an independent valuation as the initial cost base for the investment. • Taxpayers should be allowed to use the cost method in respect of any of their offshore portfolio investments, not just those subject to the FIF rules. • The cost method should be permitted where the shares are in a company that is not listed on a recognised exchange. 28 Comment The bill currently contains an income calculation method for offshore portfolio investments for which it is not possible or practical to obtain a market value. Under the bill proposal, these investments would be taxed on 5% of the cost, each year, with this base increased by 5% per annum. When the investment is sold, there would be a wash-up calculation to ensure any gains not already taxed or any losses that have not been deducted are brought to account. The fair dividend rate method does not contain a wash-up calculation. Consequently, a variation of the fair dividend rate method is needed for investments which do not have market values. These investments would include interests in unlisted foreign companies as well as non-exempt interests in foreign superannuation schemes and foreign life insurance policies, for which the fair dividend rate method is not practical. A cost-based version of the fair dividend rate is proposed with the following features: • It would tax 5% of the cost of the portfolio investment each year plus an up-lift of 5% to account for investment growth. • No tax would be payable in the year in which the investment is made (as there would be no cost base at the start of the year). • The cost base for each subsequent year (denoted as the “opening value” in the draft legislation) would be adjusted by any sales and purchases in the previous year and increased by the FIF income for the previous year (5% of the “opening value” in the previous year), to account for investment growth. • Any dividends derived would not be taxed separately and would not be subtracted from the opening value in the next year. This is because 5% deemed growth is likely, on average, to underestimate the actual increase in the value of the investment. • The rules for shares bought and sold within the same income year (“quick sales”) would apply to portfolio investments for which this new cost method is used. Submissions have suggested that a wash-up calculation is desirable to allow investors who have made a gain of less than 5% (or potentially a loss) to square-up. Having a wash-up provision, as per the cost-based proposal currently in the bill, would add considerable complexity and in years where the investment has increased by more than 5% would amount to a capital gains tax. Officials therefore do not recommend that a wash-up provision be added to the proposed cost method. As noted earlier, 5% growth each year is likely to underestimate the performance of such investments (given historical equity returns of around 9%); consequently, the lack of a wash-up mechanism should not give rise to significant issues. 29 However, we consider that investors should have the ability to re-value their interests in companies subject to the cost-method (for example, through an independent valuation) and adjust their opening value accordingly. This should allow investors to lower their cost base if the capital value of their investment has decreased. We do not consider that portfolio investments in private offshore companies (which are likely to be subject to the proposed cost method) or shares acquired through employment should be exempt from the new rules. This would provide a tax preference to certain offshore investments and not others. We agree with the submission that investors should have the ability to use an independent valuation as the initial cost base if there is no available market value for the investment (e.g. the company is not listed). This would be a one-off valuation requirement to allow these investments to access the proposed cost-method. The cost method should not be allowed as a general option under the new offshore tax rules for portfolio investments. This method is intended as a back-up, if use of the fair dividend rate method is not practical due to the absence of market values. Allowing use of the cost method in situations where market values are available does not make sense, as the fair dividend rate would be the more accurate method. We consider that the cost method would be permitted where the shares are in a company that is not listed on a recognised exchange and a market value is therefore not available. Recommendation That the officials’ submission be accepted. Investors should also have the ability to use an independent valuation as the initial cost base if it is not practical to obtain a market value for the investment (for example, the company is not listed) with a further ability to update their opening value through independent valuations. Issue: NZD$50,000 de minimis exemption from new offshore tax rules Submission (Matter raised by officials) We recommend that the NZD$50,000 threshold for application of the new offshore tax rules to individual investors should remain if the recommendation to replace the current bill proposals with the fair dividend rate method is accepted. Investments below the NZD$50,000 threshold would continue to be taxed as at present. 30 (FDR 3 – Craig Stobo, FDR 4 – NZ Assets Management, FDR 5 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, FDR 6 – AMP, FDR 10 – NZICA, FDR 12 – NZ Funds, FDR 13 – New Zealand Law Society, FDR 15 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, FDR 17 – Brook Asset Management, FDR 18 – Saxe-Coburg) A number of submitters recommended removing the NZD$50,000 de minimis threshold if a low fixed fair dividend rate method was implemented. Some suggested that the de minimis threshold could be made elective, with taxpayers able to waive the de minimis on a once-and-for-all basis. One submission, that did not support the fair dividend rate proposal, recommended that the NZD$50,000 de minimis threshold should be raised to $100,000 and be extended to family trusts that met certain criteria. Comment The NZD$50,000 threshold for individual direct investments in offshore companies (outside Australia and New Zealand) was designed to limit the application of more complex tax rules to individuals with moderate to large offshore share portfolios. The threshold represents a trade-off between accuracy and simplicity for individual investors with small amounts invested offshore and recognises that any additional accuracy gained from imposing more complex tax rules is likely to be more than offset by the compliance costs involved. Under the exemption, individuals would generally pay tax on dividends only, if the total cost of their offshore investments is NZD$50,000 or less. The fair dividend rate method would be significantly simpler for individuals to apply than the current bill proposals. Therefore, there is an argument to remove the NZD$50,000 de minimis threshold on simplicity grounds. Removing the threshold would also better align the tax treatment of direct investment in offshore portfolio shares with the treatment of investors that invest offshore using managed funds (who currently do not receive the benefit of the NZD$50,000 exemption). A number of submissions on the fair dividend rate proposal have advocated removing the de minimis exemption on these grounds. On balance, however, officials consider that the NZD$50,000 threshold should be retained as dividend-only taxation, under the exemption, may be simpler for smaller investors to understand and the tax difference is not likely to be significant (given the size of the portfolios involved). We also do not agree with submissions that taxpayers should have the ability to waive the de minimis exemption on a once-and-for-all basis. While there is some justification for such an approach, it would add further complexity to the offshore tax rules. The submissions that the de minimis threshold be raised and apply to offshore portfolio share investments held through family trusts have been considered later in this report. Recommendation That the officials’ submission be accepted. The other submissions should be declined. 31 Issue: Exemption for investments in Australian-resident listed companies Submission (Matter raised by officials) We recommend that the proposed exemption for investments in Australian resident listed companies be retained if the recommendation to replace the current bill proposals with the fair dividend rate method is accepted. Investments in these companies by individuals and non-PIE entity investors would continue to be taxable as at present. Investment in Australian-resident listed companies by PIEs would be taxable only on dividends. (FDR 3 – Craig Stobo, FDR 4 – NZ Assets Management, FDR 7 – First NZ Capital, FDR 10 – NZICA, FDR 12 – NZ Funds, FDR 15 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, FDR 18 – Saxe-Coburg) Submissions were generally of the view that the proposed exemption for investments in Australian-resident listed companies should also be removed (or at the least be made elective). Some submissions commented that if the Australian exemption was retained, it should also encompass interests in listed Australian unit trusts and shares in unlisted widely held Australian companies acquired through employee share purchase schemes. Comment The bill currently contains an exemption from the new offshore tax rules for investments in companies that are Australian tax-resident and are listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. The rationale for this exemption is that the franking credit rules in the Australian tax system (like the New Zealand imputation model) create incentives for Australian companies to pay out a significant portion of their earnings as dividends. As a result, dividend yields from New Zealand and Australian companies are significantly higher (at around 4.5% net of tax credits) than dividend yields from companies resident in other countries, such as the United States, where average dividend yields are around 2%. Therefore, taxing primarily dividends from investments in Australian companies was considered a reasonable approach given the relative simplicity of such a regime. For PIEs, it was proposed that realised share gains on qualifying Australian investments should not be taxed, to align with the general tax treatment of direct investors. As noted earlier, the fair dividend rate method would be much simpler to apply than the offshore tax proposals currently in the bill. If applied to Australian-resident listed companies, it would tax individuals and family trusts on a 5% return in most years. This should be broadly similar to the tax these investors would pay on a dividend-only taxation basis. Given this, there is an argument for retaining the exemption as most direct investors would be more familiar with dividend taxation compared to the fair dividend rate method. At a lower flat fair dividend rate (of around 3%), investors would generally be better off under a fair dividend rate method than dividend taxation, due to Australian dividend yields being, on average, around 4.5%. Support for removal of the Australian exemption is largely conditional on a lower than 5% fair 32 dividend rate applying. Officials have recommended that the fair dividend rate be set at 5%. Removal of the Australian exemption would eliminate the boundary between investments in Australian-resident listed companies and non-listed equity investments, such as Australian unit trusts. Under the proposals in the bill, Australian unit trusts would not be subject to the proposed exemption because they could be used to derive income in the form of unrealised capital gains that are not taxable in either New Zealand or Australia. This rationale is still valid and, therefore, officials do not consider that Australian unit trusts should generally be part of the Australian exemption. However, later in this report we recommend that investments in certain Australian unit trusts that turn over a high proportion of their investments and have a New Zealand proxy that withholds tax on behalf of investors be able to access the Australian exemption. The issue of shares acquired through employee shares schemes is discussed later in this report. The key reason for retaining the exemption for Australian-resident listed companies, is that moving from a regime that explicitly taxes Australian dividends to a regime that approximates a reasonable dividend yield (under the fair dividend rate) could raise issues in relation to trans-Tasman recognition of imputation credits. The proposed Australian exemption would, to the extent it applies generally, preserve the status-quo, which is important as officials have not had time to consult with the Australian Treasury on trans-Tasman credit recognition issues. We therefore do not support removing this exemption or making it elective. Recommendation That the officials’ submission be accepted. The other submissions should be declined. Issue: Exemption for investments in certain grey list companies Submission (Matter raised by officials) If the recommendation to replace the current bill proposals with the fair dividend rate method is accepted, the proposed temporary exemption (outlined in Supplementary Order Paper No. 44) for investments in certain companies, like GPG, should be retained, as the policy rationale for such an exemption has not changed. Investors in a company like GPG would be taxed under current rules. If this exemption is retained: • Institutional investors (PIEs and other managed funds) should be taxed on their GPG investments under the fair dividend rate method, as otherwise tax would be payable on realised share gains. • A two-year exemption from the offshore tax rules should be allowed for investments in the New Zealand Investment Trust (a UK based investment trust that invests predominantly in New Zealand and Australian companies). 33 (FDR 3 – Craig Stobo, FDR 4 – NZ Assets Management, FDR 6 – AMP, FDR 10 – NZICA, FDR 12 – NZ Funds, FDR 16 – GPG) Submissions were generally of the view that this exemption should also be removed under the fair dividend rate method. One submission recommended that the exemption remain and be amended so that all shareholders of GPG (particularly institutional investors) were treated as if they held shares in a New Zealand company for the duration of the exemption. Comment Under this temporary exemption, investments in companies that meet certain criteria would continue to be taxable under current tax rules for a period of five years. To qualify, the investment must be in a company that is resident in a grey list country, is liable to tax in that country, is listed on a recognised stock exchange and the majority of its shareholders in both number and by proportion of shares held are New Zealanders. Officials are not aware of investments in any foreign companies, other than GPG (a UK-resident company), which will meet this criteria. The rationale for the temporary exemption was to allow time for completion of the government’s review of the controlled foreign company tax rules. Pending the outcome of this review, which will include consideration of whether the controlled foreign company rules should exempt income from active investment (e.g. investment in factories) while continuing to tax income from passive investment (e.g. investment in securities), GPG may consider relocating to New Zealand. If this were the case, the new offshore tax rules for portfolio investments would not apply to investments in GPG. The outcome of this review would be important for GPG in its consideration of whether or not to relocate, as its primary investment would likely be an active investment in a controlled foreign company. On the one hand the fair dividend rate method would be relatively simple for investors to apply on their shares in GPG and would result in a more reasonable level of New Zealand tax being payable on investments in GPG. However, the rationale for this exemption – to allow time for GPG to make a decision regarding relocation to New Zealand pending completion of the CFC review – has not changed since the proposal was announced by Ministers earlier this year. Therefore, notwithstanding the submissions on this issue we recommend that the exemption be retained, if the fair dividend rate method is accepted as a replacement for the offshore tax proposals currently in the bill. 34 If this exemption is retained, we consider that institutional investors (that is, PIEs and other managed funds) should be taxed on their GPG investments using the fair dividend rate method. Under the current offshore tax rules, institutional investors would generally hold these investments on revenue account, and would be taxable on any gains that are realised. In many cases, the fair dividend rate method would result in a lower tax liability for such investors. A fair dividend rate method would also be easier for managed funds to apply under the PIE tax rules. We do not consider that institutional investors should be exempt on their GPG holdings for reasons discussed later in this report. We also consider that a temporary exemption would be justified for investments in New Zealand Investment Trust (NZIT), a UK-based investment trust, which has the majority of its assets invested in New Zealand and Australian-resident companies. Officials consider that this particular investment trust would benefit from relocating to New Zealand and becoming a PIE. Under the PIE tax rules, NZIT would benefit from not having their capital gains from trading Australasian shares taxed (a benefit that is currently procured through the UK tax rules) but would also be eligible to pass through the imputation credits attached to NZ dividends to investors (this is currently not allowed as NZIT is a UK entity). Therefore, if the temporary exemption for investments in GPG was retained an exemption of two years for investments in the NZIT, to allow time for it to relocate and become a PIE, would be justified. A two-year exemption would not give NZIT a competitive advantage over New Zealand PIEs as NZ PIEs would also not be taxable on realised gains from Australasian equities. The detail of how such an exemption should be drafted is discussed later in this report. Recommendation That the officials’ submission be accepted. The other submissions should be declined. Issue: Exemption for investments in New Zealand start-up companies (venture capital) Submissions (Matter raised by officials) An exemption for investments in New Zealand start-up companies that migrate offshore to gain access to finance should be included in the new offshore rules, even if the recommendation to replace the current bill proposals with the fair dividend rate method is accepted. 35 (FDR 5 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The exemption for New Zealand venture capital-type investments should remain under the fair dividend rate method. Comment This exemption would carve out from the proposed offshore tax rules investments in New Zealand start-up companies that migrate offshore to gain access to finance (venture capital or private equity investment). As a result of offshore capital raising, New Zealand investors typically end up holding portfolio interests in the migrated company. Officials consider that applying comprehensive tax rules to such investments may result in a large tax liability arising when there is no underlying income stream, as start-ups will typically be making losses even though their share value, in anticipation of future earnings, is increasing. Therefore, even the application of the fair dividend rate (which would tax a maximum of 5% of the value of the investment) could result in cash-flow issues for investors in such companies. Importantly, the new tax rules for offshore portfolio share investments are designed to create a level playing field between investing directly and via a managed fund. As direct investment in start-up companies does not compete with investment via managed funds, venture capital investment is not the target of the proposed tax rules. For the reasons outlined above, officials consider that an exemption to cater for this situation should be included in the offshore tax rules. The criteria for application of this exemption is discussed later in this report. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Availability of other FIF calculation methods Submission (Matter raised by officials) In addition to the proposed fair dividend rate and cost-based methods, investors with portfolio investments should be able to use the branch equivalent and accounting profits methods. The default FIF calculation method for offshore portfolio investments should be the fair dividend rate method, with the cost method available if use of the fair dividend rate method is not practical due to the unavailability of market values. 36 The comparative value method should apply for interests for which the fair dividend rate method is not allowed to be used, with the deemed rate of return method available for these interests if use of the comparative value method is not practical (due to unavailability of market values). Comment The current bill allows investors the option of continuing to apply the branch equivalent and accounting profits methods (under the current FIF rules). This should continue if the fair dividend rate method is accepted as an alternative to the market value and smoothed market value methods currently in the bill. We consider that the default FIF calculation method for offshore portfolio investments should be the fair dividend rate method. The default method would apply if a person fails to elect a FIF calculation method. It is needed to ensure that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has a basis for assessing an investor’s income if no tax return is filed. In cases where market values for offshore portfolio investments are unavailable, the proposed cost-based variant of the fair dividend rate method should apply. We also consider that the comparative value and deemed rate of return methods (also under the current FIF rules) should apply for portfolio investments for which the fair dividend rate method is not allowed to be used. As noted in a matter raised by officials, there would be certain offshore portfolio investments for which the fair dividend rate would not be applicable (for example, where so-called “guaranteed returns” are made). While the comparative value method would need to be used in these circumstances, the deemed rate of return, which is currently used for FIF interests which do not have market values should also be available if use of the comparative value method is not practical. The comparative value and deemed rate of return methods should not, however, be generally available – that is, they should only be applicable for offshore portfolio investments for which the fair dividend rate and cost-based methods are not allowed to be used. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 37 Issue: Other technical issues raised in submissions on the fair dividend rate method Submission (FDR 8 – ISI, FDR 10 – NZICA, FDR 12 – NZ Funds, FDR 15 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) A number of technical submissions were made in relation to the fair dividend rate method. These include: 1. Section EX 38 needs modification to include the fair dividend rate and cost methods and to drop the market value and smoothed market value methods. 2. Sections EX 40(4) and EX 44 need reinstatement. 3. Section EX 44C needs to be removed from the bill. 4. Section EX 44(7) could be redrafted more simply. 5. Section EX 44B(1)(b) – add “whether or not vested” after “assigns each investor an interest”. 6. Section EX 44B(4) – replace “FIF loss” with “any FIF loss”. 7. Section EX 44B(15)(a) – given the frequency of seven-day pricing and monthly pricing, seven days or monthly should be substituted in the quick sales formula to accommodate normal practice. If the submission is not accepted, there will be the need to discuss precisely what information can be sourced from offshore managers where daily pricing is not used. 8. Section EX 44B(16) – average weighted cost should be used instead of average cost in the quick sale rules. 9. The suggestion that LIFO be used to determine quick sales is inconsistent with the software used by most managed funds, which is based on FIFO. 10. Section EX 45B(7) – references in sub-paragraphs (a)-(c) should be to “FIF income in the preceding year”. 11. The comparative value method in the bill should be the market value method in section EX 44B. 12. Section EX 40(5)(a) – the fair dividend rate method should be an option for interests of 10% or greater in widely held foreign investment vehicles, even for those that would otherwise constitute controlled foreign companies (CFCs). If CFC investments cannot be reported using the fair dividend rate method, then the comparative value method should remain the default. 38 13. Section EX 44(6) – the fair dividend rate method should apply in respect of 10% or greater interests in foreign companies held by PIEs. Interests of less than 10% that are subject to comparative value (i.e. debt) should be able to claim losses. 14. The NZ IFRS requirements for distinguishing between debt and equity could be used an as alternative for the Australian economic substance test. 15. Determination under section EX 40(5)(b)(iii), (iv) should be for borderline products only. Determinations should be issued by the Financial Sector Corporates Desk with a benchmark turnaround time of 30 days at no charge (if a charge is deemed necessary it should be a fixed fee). 16. For Australian unit trusts investing in debt, the RWT proxy mechanism should be retained with application of the comparative value method under the proxy for those who hold interests of greater than NZD$50,000 in these vehicles. 17. If the submission that a flat 3.5% fair dividend rate without variation is not accepted, then managed funds (especially PIEs) should be permitted to switch to comparative value from the fair dividend rate method. 18. Section EX 51 should be amended to accommodate swapping from the fair dividend rate method to the cost method or comparative value method. 19. The foreign dividend withholding payment rules should not apply under the fair dividend rate method as it is not a dividend. 20. Where investors use the fair dividend rate or cost methods, the market value should be the opening value. If comparative value was being used, the higher of cost or market value would be appropriate. 21. It would be desirable to confirm that investment expenses incurred in deriving fair dividend rare income are deductible. 22. The rules should allow people to move between the cost and other methods when circumstances dictate. 23. The cost of gifted or inherited shares and shares acquired through an employee share purchase plan should be clarified. 24. The rule in section EX 40(5) should be drafted as a stand-alone provision 25. Losses in respect of FIF interests correctly determined under the comparative value method should be offset against taxpayers’ other assessable income. 26. The legislative approach needs to clearly reflect the policy as to whether the fair dividend rate method is a true pooling regime. 27. There should be no difference in outcome between grey list and non-grey list equities (under section EX 40(5) and EX 40(9)) 39 28. The ability to use the fair dividend rate method should be available if the FIF interest is held through a CFC. 29. Section EX 44(6C) should apply only to an investment that has been subject to the fair dividend rate method. The variable component of the fair dividend rate method should be drafted as part of the standard method. 30. Sections EX 40(5) and (6) should be redrafted to reduce the complexity caused by having multiple provisions considered “in the absence of” various other provisions. 31. “Market value” should be defined for the purposes of the fair dividend rate method as including fair value under the New Zealand international financial reporting standards. 32. Managed funds should have the option of using a fair dividend rate formula that minimises the effect of compounding which arises under the proposed daily calculation for funds that unit price daily. 33. Where an interest in a foreign company falls below 10% during a year, no fair dividend rate income should arise in the year (or alternatively a more accurate income calculation method should be made available). Comment Officials will take the various technical submissions outlined above into account in drafting the fair dividend rate legislation. Recommendation It should be noted that officials will take into account the technical submissions outlined above when drafting the fair dividend rate legislation. 40 MARKET VALUE METHOD Clause 58 Issue: Including dividends in the market value formula Submission (597 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 12a – NZ Funds, 578 – NZICA, 589 – KPMG, 965, 1226 – Deloitte, 415W – Andrew Reid) The market value method formula in section EE 44B(1) should be amended to include dividends. This would address the issue of double taxation of revenue account investors who hold FIF interests under the market value method. Consequentially, the amendment to section EX 47(2) should be omitted. Section CD 26 should also be repealed or alternatively, the reference to “market value method” be omitted from section CD 26. Comment Officials would agree with this submission in part, if the market value method were retained – that is, the market value method should be amended to include dividends in the formula and the amendment to section EX 47(2) should not proceed. However, officials consider that this issue would not need to be addressed if the recommendation to replace the market value method with the fair dividend rate method is accepted. Recommendation Officials have recommended that the market value method be replaced with the fair dividend rate method. If this recommendation is accepted the issue in this submission will no longer be applicable. 41 SMOOTHED MARKET VALUE METHOD Clause 58 Issue: Rollover relief Submissions (12a – NZ Funds, 594 – NZLS, 734 – Todd Corporation) That rollover relief under the smoothed market value method should apply only to family trusts if they have offshore portfolio share investments of $50,000 or less. (Rollover relief would continue to apply to natural persons.) Rollover relief should also be extended to closely held companies, with appropriate measures to avoid exploitation of this provision. All investors should qualify for rollover relief. The formula should allow for rollover relief to span a tax balance date when the prior investment is realised close to the balance date but the replacement is not made until after balance date. Comment Officials consider that this issue would not need to be addressed if the recommendation to replace the smoothed market value method with the fair dividend rate method is accepted. This is because there is no wash-up under the fair dividend rate method when shares are sold, so no rollover relief is necessary. Recommendation Officials have recommended that the smoothed market value method be replaced with the fair dividend rate method. If this recommendation is accepted the issue in this submission will no longer be applicable. Issue: Opening value Submission (12a – NZ Funds) The definition of “opening value” under the smoothed market value method should be amended to allow cost to be used as the opening value only in the first year that an interest becomes subject to the FIF rules. 42 Comment The submission raises a valid issue with the smoothed market value method in the bill. However, officials consider that this issue would not need to be addressed if the recommendation to replace the smoothed market value method with the fair dividend rate method is accepted. Recommendation Officials have recommended that the smoothed market value method be replaced with the fair dividend rate method. If this recommendation is accepted the issue in this submission will no longer be applicable. Issue: Clarifying application of method Submission (589 – KPMG) The wording in section EX 44C should be clarified to make it clear that the section applies only to those FIF interests where the person has elected to use the smoothed market value method. Comment Officials consider that this issue would not need to be addressed if the recommendation to replace the smoothed market value method with the fair dividend rate method is accepted. Recommendation Officials have recommended that the smoothed market value method be replaced with the fair dividend rate method. If this recommendation is accepted this submission will no longer be applicable. Issue: Allocation of cost to sale proceeds Submission (1221 – Ernst & Young) The formula in the proposed section EX 44C(6)(a) for calculating a person’s FIF income for an income year includes all amounts derived during the year from holding or disposing of shares less expenditure incurred during the year in acquiring further offshore shares. 43 This formula unfairly penalises investors by not effectively allowing a deduction for the cost base of investments sold against gross proceeds derived from the sale of investments. This is because the formula fully taxes gross proceeds on sale but does not permit a pro-rata deduction for the cost of shares sold against those proceeds. This disadvantages those investors who wish to realise some of the gains derived from shares that have risen in value by taxing them on the full amount of that gain without allowing them a deduction for the cost of the shares sold. Comment Officials consider this is not an issue under the smoothed market value method as the opening value of any shares held at the beginning of the year would be allowed as a deduction. In any event, officials consider that this issue is not applicable if the recommendation to replace the smoothed market value method with the fair dividend rate method is accepted. Recommendation Officials have recommended that the smoothed market value method be replaced with the fair dividend rate method. If this recommendation is accepted this submission will no longer be applicable. Issue: Application of FIF income limit Submission (1221 – Ernst & Young) There appears to be an anomaly in the smoothed market value method in an income year where there is no opening value and expenditure is incurred in acquiring FIF interests during that income year. Comment Officials consider that this issue would not need to be addressed if the recommendation to replace the smoothed market value method with the fair dividend rate method is accepted. Recommendation Officials have recommended that the smoothed market value method be replaced with the fair dividend rate method. If this recommendation is accepted the issue in this submission will no longer be applicable. 44 Issue: Pooling FIF interests Submission (734 – Todd Corporation) All investors should be able to apply the regime on a pooled basis. This is currently restricted to individuals and trusts. Comment Officials consider that this issue would not need to be addressed if the recommendation to replace the smoothed market value method with the fair dividend rate method is accepted. It should be noted that officials have earlier recommended that investors should be required to pool their offshore portfolio investments when applying the fair dividend rate method. Recommendation Officials have recommended that the smoothed market value method be replaced with the fair dividend rate method. If this recommendation is accepted this submission will no longer be applicable. The fair dividend rate method would apply on a pooled basis. 45 DISCOUNT ON MARKET VALUE METHODS Clause 58 Issue: Level of discount Submission (597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 596 – ISI, 12a – NZ Funds, 578 – NZICA, 589 – KPMG, 588 – Trustees Corporation Association, 595 – AXA, 582 – NPF, 579 – Macquarie, 586 – Promina, 585 – NZX, 555 – Forsyth Barr, 556 – AMP, 557 – AllianceBernstein, 560 – Institute of Financial Advisers, 568 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 572 – NZ Fire Service Super Scheme, 577 – ASB Group, 997W – Grosvenor, 965, 1226 – Deloitte, 1484 – Mercer Investment Consulting, 460 – Securities Industry Association, 603 – Goldman Sachs JBWere, 604W – Meat Industry Superannuation Scheme, 734 – Todd Corporation, 966 – NZ Harbours Superannuation Scheme, 618W – The Retire Fund, 657W – Sothertons, 682W – Private Trust Company, 467W – M.D. Macfarlane, 415W – Andrew Reid) Submissions commented that if the market value methods were to proceed, a lower level of tax on offshore investments (than taxation on 85% of gains) should apply. Submissions suggested that the level of discount on the market value methods should be increased, with suggestions ranging from taxing 15% of gains to 70%. Most technical submissions considered a discount of around 50% was more reasonable. Comment Officials consider this issue does not need to be addressed if the recommendation to replace the market and smoothed market value methods currently in the bill with the fair dividend rate method is accepted. The level of discount is not relevant under the fair dividend rate method. Recommendation Officials have recommended that the market value and smoothed market value methods be replaced with the fair dividend rate method. If this recommendation is accepted this issue would not be applicable. Issue: Applying a discount to dividends Submission (597 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 556 – AMP) Dividends should be taxed on the same basis as market value movements (that is, the discount should apply to dividends). 46 Comment Dividends would not be separately taxed under the fair dividend rate method. Therefore, this submission would no longer be relevant, if the fair dividend rate recommendation is accepted. Recommendation Officials have recommended that the market value and smoothed market value methods be replaced with the fair dividend rate method. If this recommendation is accepted the issue in this submission will no longer be applicable. Issue: Claw-back of discount Submissions (597 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 596 – ISI, 608 – ING, 595 – AXA, 556 – AMP, 557 – AllianceBernstein, 568 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Distributions by non-PIE entities to their shareholders should not be subject to claw- back of the 15% discount allowed under the market value and smoothed market value FIF methods. An alternative is that the new international regime applies only to PIEs and the status quo is maintained for all non-electing entities. The taxation of life insurers’ policyholder base should be amended to exempt claw- back of the 15% discount. Comment Officials have earlier recommended that the market value and smoothed market value methods be replaced by the fair dividend rate method, which would make the issue of the discount irrelevant. We note that a design feature of the New Zealand imputation system is that preferences that are received at the company level are effectively clawed back at the shareholder level. Under the current offshore tax rules, offshore portfolio share investments in grey list countries that are held on capital account by a company would be fully taxable when the gains are realised and distributed to investors (as there would be insufficient imputation credits to fully offset the tax payable on the dividend). This claw-back of preferences for companies should continue if the fair dividend rate method is adopted – that is, gains in excess of the 5% fair dividend rate would become taxable if the shares are sold and the proceeds distributed to shareholders. It should be noted that offshore portfolio share investment via PIEs would not result in individual investors being taxed on more than 5% of the value of their investments, as the PIE rules are designed to put managed fund investors on a similar footing to investing directly. 47 In relation to the taxation of life insurers’ policyholder base, officials note that the government has announced a review of the tax rules for life insurance and the issue raised in this submission would be more suitably addressed under that review. Recommendation Officials have recommended that the market value and smoothed market value methods be replaced with the fair dividend rate method. If this recommendation is accepted the issue in this submission will no longer be applicable Issue: Applying the discount to currency hedges Submissions (608 – ING, 593 – BT Funds) The currency hedge on international shares (outside those in Australian-resident listed companies) should be treated in the same way as the gain or loss on shares – only 85% of the gain or loss on the hedge should be taxable. The currency hedge on shares in Australian-resident listed companies should be excluded income. Currency hedges held by a PIE, either in relation to Australian or other offshore investments, should only be taxable to the extent that currency movements on the underlying assets are taxable. Comment Officials do not consider that the currency hedge on international shares should be taxable using the fair dividend rate method – the financial arrangement rules should continue to apply to tax the gains and losses on these instruments. Similarly, in the context of investments in Australian-resident listed companies by PIEs, if the exemption is retained for these investments, we do not consider that gains on currency hedges should excluded income (to mirror the treatment of the underlying share gains for PIEs). Officials note that similar situations arise where there are exchange losses for which there is a deduction while the underlying asset has increased in value. This is an inherent feature of the financial arrangement rules. Recommendation Officials have recommended that the market value and smoothed market value methods be replaced with the fair dividend rate method. If this recommendation is accepted the issue in this submission will no longer be applicable 48 Issue: Increasing the discount on long term investment Submission (510 – Liontamer) Long-term investment should be rewarded by means of an increasing scale on the level of the discount. For instance, for investments held for less than five years tax could be imposed on 85% of the gains and for those held for more than five years this could be reduced to a tax on 50% of the gains and for investments over 10 years, 25% of the gains would become taxable. Comment Taxing gains on offshore portfolio investments on a sliding scale would not be relevant if the fair dividend rate recommendation is accepted (as the fair dividend rate does not target capital gains, but rather something approximating a reasonable dividend yield). Recommendation Officials have recommended that the market value and smoothed market value methods be replaced with the fair dividend rate method. If this recommendation is accepted the issue in this submission will no longer be applicable. 49 COST METHOD Clause 60 Issue: Carried forward FIF income Submission (597 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The concession for deferred tax on the death of an investor under the smoothed market value method should also be available to persons under the cost method. Comment This issue no longer applies in light of the recommendation to replace the cost method that is currently in the bill with a new cost method that is based on the fair dividend rate concept. The new cost method would not contain a wash-up when an investment is sold. Therefore, the submission to defer the tax on gains arising on wash-up is not relevant. Recommendation Officials have recommended that the cost method in the bill be replaced with a new cost method that is based on the fair dividend rate concept. If this recommendation is accepted this submission will no longer be applicable. Issue: Opening value definition Submissions (12a – NZ Funds, 608 – ING, 965, 1226 – Deloitte) The reference in section EX 45B(4)(b)(ii) should be to “FIF income from that interest”, not “FIF income” generally. The reference in section EX 45B(4)(b)(ii) to “subsection (1)(a)” should be to “subsection (1)(a)(i)”. Clarification is needed on the definition of FIF income in the definitions of “opening value” and “commencing value” in section EX 45B. Comment Officials agree with the first submission. We consider that this suggested change would address the issue raised in submission two. It should be noted, however, that the recommendation to replace the cost method that is currently in the bill with a new cost method that is based on the fair dividend rate concept should address this issue. 50 Recommendation It should be noted that the recommendation to replace the cost method that is currently in the bill with a new cost method that is based on the fair dividend rate concept should address the issues raised. Issue: Cost method “wash-up” rule Submissions (578 – NZICA, 603 – Goldman Sachs JBWere) The proposed “wash-up” rule (where an investor sells their interest) under the cost method option is very difficult to follow and should be redrafted. The rule seems to be similar to a base price adjustment for a financial arrangement and should be drafted as such to make the legislation easier for users. The draft legislation should be amended to ensure that under the cost method, a taxpayer gets a deduction for the cost of acquiring a FIF interest that is disposed of in the same income year (for the purposes of the wash-up rule). The taxation of disposal proceeds under the cost method is unnecessary. In essence since the deemed rate of return would tax expected earnings, it would not bias investment decisions even if ex-post the return ended up higher or lower than expected. Comment These submissions no longer apply in light of the recommendation to replace the cost method that is currently in the bill with a new cost method that is based on the fair dividend rate concept. As noted earlier, the new cost method would not contain a wash-up when an investment is sold. Recommendation Officials have recommended that the cost method in the bill be replaced with a cost method that is based on the fair dividend rate concept. If this recommendation is accepted, submissions on this issue will no longer be applicable. 51 FIF LOSSES AND FOREIGN TAX CREDITS Clauses 58 and 60 Issue: Carrying-back FIF losses Submission (597 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 556 – AMP, 567 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting) Losses arising under the new FIF rules should be capable of being offset against all income (including non-FIF income) from previous income years. At a minimum, losses should be able to be offset against FIF income arising in previous years. Comment The recommended replacement of the market value and smoothed market value methods with the fair dividend rate method should remove this issue for a majority of investors, as under the fair dividend rate no FIF losses would arise. Investors would need to use the comparative value method for offshore portfolio investments for which the fair dividend rate is not allowed (that is, investments that generate “guaranteed returns”, akin to debt). We do not consider that application of the comparative value method, in this instance, should give rise to the ability to carry back FIF losses. This would be inconsistent with the general tax loss rules which allow losses to be carried forward but not carried-back. It would also create significant administrative costs for Inland Revenue from having to reopen past assessments and would create uncertainty for government revenue flows. Recommendation That the submission be declined. It should be noted that the recommended replacement of the market value and smoothed market value methods with the fair dividend rate method should remove this issue for a majority of investors, as under the fair dividend rate no FIF losses would arise. 52 Issue: Carrying-back foreign tax credits Submission (578 – NZICA, 591 – Duncan Cotterill, 965, 1226 – Deloitte) There needs to be an allowance in the foreign tax credit rules for New Zealand residents to be able to claim a full credit for the foreign tax paid when the investment is realised against the total New Zealand tax paid in relation to that investment (not just the amount reported in the New Zealand return for that particular year). Subpart LC should be amended to allow foreign tax credits to be carried back to earlier years for tax paid in foreign jurisdictions on the realisation of an interest in a FIF. Comment This was an issue under the offshore tax proposals originally contained in the bill. However, because the new fair dividend rate proposal does not seek to tax capital gains (but rather approximates a reasonable dividend yield on offshore shares) no credit should be allowed for foreign capital gains taxes. Credits for foreign tax paid on any dividends received would continue to be allowed under the fair dividend rate method. Recommendation That the submission be declined, as the fair dividend rate method does not seek to tax capital gains. Therefore no credit should be allowed for foreign capital gains taxes. 53 GREY LIST ISSUES Clause 51 Issue: Schedule 4 approach to addressing base maintenance concerns Submission (594 – NZLS) If the current grey list exemption from the FIF rules is maintained and PIEs are made exempt on their grey list share gains, base maintenance concerns should be addressed by excluding certain problematic entities. This could be achieved by listing them in schedule 4 of the Income Tax Act 2004. The type of entities that could be so listed are those known to enjoy favourable tax treatment in the relevant grey list country. Comment Officials do not consider that a schedule approach to dealing with specific tax avoidance concerns is sustainable due to the significant resources that would need to be expended in monitoring potential tax-preferred offshore entities and “black listing” them. Tax systems and tax planning structures are dynamic and change frequently. It is for this reason that officials consider reform of the offshore tax rules is necessary to ensure that a reasonable level of tax is payable on offshore portfolio share investments. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Listed company limitation to address base maintenance concerns Submission (594 – NZLS) If the schedule 4 approach is not considered sufficient to address base maintenance concerns, a more comprehensive limitation would be to restrict the exemption so it would apply only to listed companies not themselves operating as investment vehicles. The intent of this limitation would be to restrict the grey list exemption to listed companies carrying on an active business. 54 Comment This approach would require monitoring of the activities of offshore companies which is likely to require a significant resource commitment and be less certain for taxpayers. As noted in the response to the previous submission, we consider that more wide-ranging reform of the offshore tax rules is necessary. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Extension of Australian exemption to include other countries Submission (575 – Direct Broking, 1146 – General Electric, 471W – David Sissons, 301W – Canada New Zealand Business Association) The present exemption for Australian-listed entities should be extended to include all entities listed on the UK and US stock markets. The exemption should also apply to investments in Canadian companies. Comment Extending the proposed exemption from the new offshore tax rules to investments in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States is not feasible. Firstly, unlike Australia and New Zealand, the tax systems in these counties do not generally encourage companies to pay out a reasonable portion of their earnings as dividends (consequently gross dividend yields in these countries are around 2-3% compared to net dividend yields of around 4-5% in NZ and Australia). Second, the Australian exemption can also be justified on the basis of the Closer Economic Relationship between the two countries and the benefits of treating both economies as a single investment market. Third, the New Zealand Inland Revenue has a close working relationship with the Australian Tax Office, which should facilitate quickly shutting down structures set up to exploit the Australian exemption. It would be exponentially more difficult to monitor and clamp down on investments in structures that are set up and marketed to New Zealanders to reduce their tax liabilities, if the Australian exemption were extended to investments in Canadian, UK and US entities. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 55 VENTURE CAPITAL Clause 51 Submissions (597 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 589 – KPMG, 576 – NZ Venture Capital Association, 583 – NZ Venture Investment Fund, 563 – No 8 Ventures Management, 662 – Simon Earl Wilkinson, 664 – Richard Francis Locke) Section EX 33(1)(c)(iv) should be amended so that, provided the other criteria are satisfied, investors that are not widely held can still claim the exemption notwithstanding that the investee company also has widely held investors. The qualifying criteria in section EX 33(1)(c)(iv) should be deleted and an additional exemption should be available for investors in venture capital funds who cease to qualify because of expansion into foreign markets and/or investment by offshore investors. That is, a further exemption for investments in a Qualifying Venture Investment Company (QVIC) should be introduced. To qualify to be a QVIC the following criteria must be met: • At the time of the initial capital investment, the company, whether incorporated in New Zealand or not, must be unlisted and have a majority of its assets or employees in New Zealand. • The company must have been in operation for a minimum of one year before the company migrates from New Zealand (although Inland Revenue could waive this requirement if they were satisfied the company was genuine venture capital). • The investee company must maintain a permanent establishment in New Zealand. • Unlisted foreign companies that control companies that satisfy the above requirements should be treated as QVICs. Investments in a QVIC by New Zealand investors should be eligible for the exemption, notwithstanding that the investment may be made after the company migrates from New Zealand. Investors should be able to claim the benefit of the exemption until the earlier of the company ceasing to have operations in NZ or ten years from the date of initial investment. Investors should have a grace period of six months following the company losing QVIC status to exit their investments. The exemption should also apply to investments made prior to 1 April 2007. Other submissions commented that New Zealand investors in New Zealand-born and bred companies that migrate offshore should be exempt from the proposed tax for a period of 5 to 7 years following migration. 56 Comment Officials support an exemption from the offshore tax rules for investments in NZ start-up companies that migrate offshore to gain access to finance. We consider that such an exemption is justified on the basis that venture capital investments do not compete with investment via New Zealand managed funds. Officials recognise the venture capital exemption, as currently drafted in the bill, does not cover the full range of venture capital cases. We have therefore worked with the venture capital industry to develop a new set of criteria, which more appropriately identifies the types of venture capital investments involved. The criteria we have identified, which is generally supported by the industry, is as follows: • The shares are in a New Zealand-resident company that migrates to a grey list country, but has a fixed establishment in New Zealand, which has at least $1 million of deductible expenditure or capital expenditure (not including interest) each tax year or 10 full time employees or contractors providing services ("significant operations"). • Prior to migrating the company had been tax-resident in New Zealand for a minimum of 12 months and had the majority of its assets or employees in New Zealand for at least a year. • The exemption would apply to NZ investors who first invest before the company lists on a recognised exchange ("qualifying investors"). Qualifying investors would be able to continue to invest after the company has listed without losing the exemption. • The exemption would last for 10 years from the date the company migrates. • Qualifying investors would lose the exemption if a company ceased to have significant operations (as defined above) in New Zealand. The investor would have six months, from the date of cessation, to dispose of the shares prior to the new FIF rules applying. • The shares would enter the new FIF rules at market value following the lapse of the 10-year period or cessation of significant operations in New Zealand. • The exemption would also apply to shares in a grey-list company received in exchange for shares in a New Zealand resident company that satisfies the criteria above or shares purchased in an unlisted grey list company that owns a New Zealand company that meets the criteria. The 10-year rule would apply from the time the grey list company acquired a majority of the shares of the NZ company. A provision incorporating these criteria should replace section EX 33(1)(c) currently in the bill. 57 Recommendation That the exemption for venture capital investments currently contained in the tax bill be replaced by the criteria outlined in the officials’ comment. 58 EMPLOYEE SHARE PURCHASE SCHEMES Submissions (578 – NZICA, 594 – NZLS, 581 – Russell McVeagh, 554 – NZ Bankers Association, 557 – AllianceBernstein, 559 – ABN AMRO New Zealand, 568 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 580 – Stratex Networks, 1146 – General Electric, 1221 – Ernst & Young, 965, 1226 – Deloitte, 1239W – Blackmore Virtue & Owens, 1282W – Bell Gully, 1221 – Ernst & Young for Maunsell, 987 – HSBC, 988 – American Chamber of Commerce in NZ, 1131 – David Patterson (MinterEllisonRuddWatt), 494 – Clemenger Communications) Shares acquired under an employee share purchase agreement (as defined in section CE 7 of the ITA) should be excluded from the new offshore tax rules. If this is not accepted, for the purposes of applying the new FIF rules, the cost of shares obtained under employee share schemes should be the market value at the time the shares were obtained (rather than the cost to the investor). This should also be the case for shares that are gifted or inherited. Where a taxpayer holds shares in a “grey list” overseas company through their employment, these shares should be exempted from the FIF regime with shareholders continuing to be taxable on dividends as they are received. Comment Officials do not consider that shares acquired through employee share purchase schemes should, as a general rule, be exempt from the new offshore tax rules, especially given the replacement of the current bill proposals with the fair dividend rate method. This could result in a New Zealand employee of a foreign company receiving an exemption if they acquire the shares in that company through work, versus acquiring the shares privately. It would also mean that different investors, holding the same shares, could be treated differently for tax purposes depending on how the shares were acquired. A similar issue would arise in relation to exempting offshore portfolio share investments that are gifted or inherited. A temporary exemption may be justified in cases where shares acquired through an employee share purchase scheme contain restrictions on disposal. We consider that such an exemption should be limited to shares held by a person in a foreign company where: • the foreign company is resident in a grey list country and is the employer of the employee or owns, directly or indirectly, the New Zealand-resident employer of the employee; • the shares are acquired through employment; and • there are restrictions in the share purchase agreement preventing the person disposing of the shares for a period other than on the grounds of serious hardship. 59 This exemption should apply only for the period that there are restrictions on the disposal of the shares and employees should have six months from the date the restrictions on disposal no longer apply to dispose of their investments. After this period, the shares would enter the new FIF rules (that is, be subject to the fair dividend rate method) at their market value. Recommendation The new offshore tax rules should contain a limited exemption for offshore shares acquired through employee share purchase schemes to the extent there are restrictions on disposal of the shares. The exemption should only be valid for the duration of the restrictions. 60 OFFSHORE INVESTMENT TRUSTS Issue: Offshore investment trusts should be exempted Submission (585 – NZX, 936 – ABN AMRO, 1347W – Northplan Financial Services / Swain Investment Services/ Colin Strang Financial Planning, 503W – Anonymous, 471W – David Sissons) Shareholders in non-resident investment trusts which are listed on the NZX, as at 1 May 2006, and which can satisfy the criteria as set out in the supplementary order paper, should be granted, like the investors in GPG, a “five-year holiday” from the proposed new rules. This five-year holiday from the new offshore tax rules would allow Investment Trust Companies and their shareholders time to consider restructuring their affairs and product offerings in a manner which is most appropriate for the new regime. In the long-term, the tax issues will be minimal, but the compliance costs and risks of technical non-compliance (and hence enforcement) would be high if this approach is not taken. Comment The reason for granting GPG a five-year holiday was to give it the opportunity to consider relocating to New Zealand pending the outcome of the review of the CFC rules. If the outcome of this review was the introduction of an active business income exemption this would benefit GPG as its principal offshore holding would probably be covered by such an exemption. UK investment trust companies would not have similar incentives to consider re-locating to New Zealand as they are typically portfolio investors (that is, the outcome of the CFC review would not impact on these entities). An exception is the New Zealand Investment Trust (NZIT), which because it invests predominantly in New Zealand and Australian companies, would benefit from re-locating to New Zealand and becoming a PIE. Officials have therefore recommended that investments in NZIT receive a two-year exemption from application of the offshore tax rules to allow NZIT time to relocate. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 61 Issue: Offshore investment trusts should not be exempted Submission (1142 – Carter Holt Harvey Employee Benefits Plan and Retirement Plan) The Australasian exemption should not apply to overseas-based actively managed products (e.g. UK listed Trusts) that are currently tax-favoured and are inconsistent with the existing tax regime. Comment For reasons outlined earlier in this report, and in the submission on this issue, officials do not consider that the proposed Australian FIF exemption should be extended to include these products. Investments in these products should be subject to the proposed fair dividend rate method. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 62 AUSTRALIAN EXEMPTION Clause 51 Issue: Clarification of criteria Submissions (597 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 12a – NZ Funds, 578 – NZICA, 608 – ING, 589 – KPMG, 593 – BT Funds, 595 – AXA, 581 – Russell McVeagh, 579 – Macquarie, 584 – Smartshares, 557 – AllianceBernstein, 560 – Institute of Financial Advisers, 568 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 575 – Direct Broking, 1221 – Ernst & Young, 965, 1226 – Deloitte, 510 – Liontamer, 602W – ANZ National, 603 – Goldman Sachs JBWere, 603 – Goldman Sachs JBWere Transtasman Unit Trust, 734 – Todd Corporation, 1131 – David Patterson (MinterEllisonRuddWatt), 657W – Sothertons, 415W – Andrew Reid) Inland Revenue should be required to publish a definitive and binding list each year of shares that qualify for the Australian exemption. Investors should be able to rely on this list when applying the revised rules until the list changes at which point investors should be given a period to dispose of their interests without application of the FIF rules. Under the proposed exemption: 1. The “official list of the Australian Stock Exchange” should be defined and applied consistently in section EX 33(1)(a) and section CX 44C(a)(ii). 2. The meaning of “resident in Australia” should be clarified, for example, by reference to New Zealand tax law (section OE 2). 3. The exemption in section EX 33 for investment in Australian-resident listed companies should be amended by deleting new section EX 33(1)(a)(ii) and (iii). Alternatively section EX 33(1)(a)(iii) should be clarified. 4. Section EX 33(1)(a) should be replaced with a requirement that the company is listed on the ASX unless specifically identified by IRD as not qualifying for the Australian exemption. The proposed exemption should apply to all Australian-listed company shares, including stapled securities with no requirement to ascertain Australian tax liability. The requirement for an Australian company to be liable to Australian tax on its worldwide income should be removed as it would be practically impossible for an investor to work this out. Also, Australian law exempts companies’ foreign branch profits and dividends from foreign subsidiaries in most circumstances. As such, the exemption would not seem to apply to investments in Australian companies that have foreign branches. 63 The exemption test should be restricted to the company being Australian tax-resident, listed and entitled to maintain a franking account. The exemption should be extended to include Australian-resident companies that are listed on any Australian or New Zealand-based “recognised exchange”. The exemption requirement to be listed on the Australian Stock Exchange and hold a franking credit account and be liable to income tax on income derived from Australia and not derived from Australia should be removed in favour of an exemption that applies to all Australian-listed companies’ tax-resident in Australia. The requirement for the exemption should be modified from “resident in Australia” to “registered in Australia” to recognise that several large Australian-listed companies are dual-listed. All listed entities in NZ and Australia should be exempt from the proposed tax, irrespective of country of residence. The Australian exemption should be extended to cover all Australian-resident companies (that keep franking credit accounts) be they listed or unlisted companies. All Australian-resident companies should qualify for grey list status provided their principal business and/or investments are held in Australasia. Comment If the exemption from the proposed offshore tax rules for investments in Australian- resident listed companies is retained, we consider that the following technical changes should be made to the exemption, in response to submissions: • Officials agree that the ASX references in sections EX 33 and CX 44C should be consistent. However, the reference to the ASX should replaced by the “ASX approved list”. The ASX-approved list includes the ASX All Ordinaries, ASX 50 and ASX 200. • Officials consider that it should be clarified that the “resident in Australia” reference in section EX 33 cross-refers to the definition of a foreign company in section OE 2(3). • Officials agree that EX 33(1)(a)(iii) should be clarified by replacing it with a provision which excludes Australian-resident companies that tie-break to another country other than New Zealand under an Australian tax treaty. The wording in section ME 1A(1), which serves a similar purpose, could be used as the basis for the drafting of new section EX 33(1)(a)(iii). In response to other submissions, we do not support the proposal that Inland Revenue be required to publish a binding list of companies that qualify for the Australian FIF exemption. Under the current grey list exemption in the offshore tax rules, investors are required to ascertain whether a foreign company is tax-resident in one of the eight grey list countries. We consider that this self-assessment approach should continue 64 under the proposed Australian exemption. Generally, a New Zealand investor that receives a “franked” dividend from a company that is listed on the ASX will be able to access the proposed exemption. We do not consider it is feasible to replace the requirement that a company be Australian tax-resident with a requirement simply that it be listed on a recognised Australian exchange. As noted in response to earlier submissions, officials consider that a key justification for exempting investments in Australian companies is on the basis that, on average, these companies pay out a large proportion of their earnings as dividends. This incentive to pay high dividends is created by the application of the Australian tax system (in particular the franking credit rules). A company that is not Australian tax-resident would not necessarily have the same incentives to pay dividends (even though it may be listed on the ASX). Therefore, the requirement that a company is subject to the Australian tax rules is important. Submissions have indicated that the exemption should apply in respect of any investment in an Australian-resident company, regardless of whether it is listed or not. Officials consider that the exemption for Australian-resident companies should be restricted to companies listed on the official approved list of the ASX which should cater for most of New Zealanders’ portfolio investment in Australia. The listing requirement would make it easier for officials to identify vehicles that have been set up to take advantage of the exemption (for example, vehicles that roll-up gains). We do not consider that an active income exemption is feasible for Australian companies, as this would require investors who hold portfolio (that is, less than 10%) interests in Australian companies to ascertain the nature of the companies’ activities. An active business exemption is generally more useful in the context of controlling investments, as investors will have greater access to information. Recommendation That the submissions on technical changes to the exemption for Australian-resident listed companies be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. The other submissions should be declined. Issue: Stapled securities Submission (597 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 589 – KPMG, 579 – Macquarie, 553 – Brook Asset Management, 936 – ABN AMRO, 575 – Direct Broking, 1221 – Ernst & Young, 965, 1226 – Deloitte) The Australian exemption should be extended to include stapled securities listed on the ASX. At present, it is not clear whether the Australasian exemption applies in situations where an otherwise eligible security has other securities stapled to it. 65 The legislation should ensure that shares in Australian companies are not disqualified from the Australian exemption in the FIF rules where a unit in an Australian unit trust is stapled to the share, provided the unit only provides an entitlement to distributions. Comment Officials consider that the Australian exemption should be limited to shares in Australian-resident listed companies without stapled rights. Our understanding of stapled securities is that the Australian security would have “stapled” to it an interest in a foreign company. The exemption should apply only to the Australian security (to the extent it is issued by an Australian-resident listed company); the proposed offshore tax rules should apply to the attached interest in the foreign company. In practice, however, it would seem difficult to separate the two. Therefore, we consider that the appropriate treatment for stapled securities issued by Australian entities should be the application of the fair dividend rate method to such interests. Recommendation That the submission be declined. The proposed Australian FIF exemption should be limited to shares in Australian-resident listed companies without stapled rights. Issue: Non-PIE revenue account holders of Australasian shares Submission (595 – AXA, 492, 880 – First NZ Capital) Revenue account property holders that are not PIEs will be taxed at 85% on their non- Australasian shares but will be taxed at 100% (on a realisation basis) on their Australasian shares. The different treatment of Australasian and other shares appears to be an unintended consequence of the reforms. Accordingly revenue account property holders that are not PIEs should only be taxed on 85% of the gain on their Australasian shares (with all other equity investments, including New Zealand shares, also treated as international shares). Comment The issue of the discount under the market value and smoothed market value methods has been superseded by the proposed fair dividend rate method. Non-PIE revenue account holders of interests in Australian-resident listed companies would be taxed on realised share gains (which is their current treatment), under the proposed Australian exemption. Officials consider that it is appropriate for this current tax treatment to apply in respect of shares in Australian-resident listed companies held by non-PIE revenue account investors. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 66 Issue: Exchange traded funds Submission (640W – State Street Global Advisors) Investments in Australian exchange traded funds (that invest in Australian companies), which are listed entities but operate under a trust rather than corporate structure, should be exempt from the new FIF rules. Comment We consider that it would be very difficult to construct an exemption that specifically targeted exchange traded funds to the extent that they invested in Australian-listed companies, especially given that stapled securities are a feature of the Australian stock market. Officials have recommended, in the next section, that investments in certain Australian unit trusts (including listed unit trusts that are exchange traded) that meet certain turnover requirements and other criteria should be allowed to access the Australian FIF exemption. This should address some of the concerns raised. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 67 AUSTRALIAN UNIT TRUSTS Clause 51 Issue: AUTs should be included in Australian exemption Submissions (12a – NZ Funds, 578 – NZICA, 608 – ING, 589 – KPMG, 579 – Macquarie, 553 – Brook Asset Management, 560 – Institute of Financial Advisers, 575 – Direct Broking, 925W – ASFONZ, 936 – ABN AMRO, 1221 – Ernst & Young, 1347W – Northplan Financial Services / Swain Investment Services/ Colin Strang Financial Planning, 468W – Platinum Asset Management, 496W – Fundsource, 603 – Goldman Sachs JBWere, 674W – Waterfront Industry Superannuation Fund, 1131 – David Patterson (MinterEllisonRuddWatt), 471W – David Sissons, 467W – M.D. Macfarlane, Plan B Financial Services, 640W – State Street Global Advisors, 631 – R P Deeble, 1136 – Stuart + Carlyon) If the offshore proposals proceed, the bill should be modified to include investments in certain Australian unit trusts within the scope of the proposed exemption in the FIF rules for Australian resident listed companies. The exemption should apply only to investments in the following two classes of Australian unit trusts (so called “recognised Australian unit trusts”): (1) An Australian-resident unit trust: • whose New Zealand-resident investors are only a portfolio investment entity; a qualifying unit trust; a GIF; a life insurer; or a superannuation fund; and • that invests 90% or more of its assets in Australian-resident companies; or turns over a minimum of either 25% of its assets (by value) each year or 33% of its assets on a rolling three-year average basis. (2) An Australian resident unit trust: • that uses the RWT proxy rules for meeting the tax obligations of its New Zealand investors; and • turns over a minimum of either 25% of its assets (by value) each year or 33% of its assets on a rolling three-year average basis. Investors who have interests in Australian unit trusts and elect into the RWT proxy regimes offered by such vehicles prior to 1 April 2007 should have this income excluded from the FIF rules (and will not have to file a return). The RWT proxy rates for an Australian unit trust should be based on PIE portfolio investor rates. 68 Investments in all Australian unit trusts (both listed and unlisted) should be included within the proposed exemption from the new offshore tax rules. Alternatively the legislation should treat investments in listed Australian unit trusts the same as listed companies whilst imposing a minimum deemed income (5% pa) based on the Australian unit trust’s opening value. Investments in Australian unit trusts that themselves invest exclusively or primarily in Australian-resident companies should be exempt. Three suggested constraints for investors to receive the exemption are: • 85% or more of the holdings of the trust are Australian-resident companies listed on the Australian stock exchange that are subject to Australian tax law. • The trust is listed on the Australian stock exchange. • Holdings of the unit trust are publicly available on a frequent basis. Comment Australian unit trusts were not included in the proposed exemption from the FIF rules for Australian investments because they could be used as roll-up vehicles to invest outside Australia in companies that pay little or no dividends (and therefore avoid the new offshore tax rules). New Zealand investors could invest in these vehicles and derive income in the form of capital gain, without a tax liability arising on this income in either Australia or New Zealand. A number of the submissions have made useful suggestions to address the concerns about the ability to use Australian unit trusts to roll-up gains and avoid the application of the new FIF rules. Officials consider that investments in Australian unit trusts that meet minimum turnover requirements and where the investor elects to use the RWT proxy mechanism for their investment in an entity should qualify for the Australian FIF exemption. This is meant to accommodate current arrangements, where investors in certain Australian unit trusts can have their tax liabilities satisfied by way of the RWT proxy, thereby reducing compliance obligations. Officials consider that the Australian unit trust should be required to turn over a minimum of 25% of its profit-making assets each year. This would result in Australian capital gains tax being payable on realised gains on these assets which should reduce the incentive to invest in Australian unit trusts because they roll-up offshore share gains to avoid tax. The minimum turnover requirement should not take into account investments in loss because otherwise there could be an incentive to dispose only of such investments to meet the minimum turnover requirement. The exemption should only be available to those investors in the Australian unit trust who elect to use the RWT proxy mechanism. This is because the RWT proxy mechanism gives some assurance that New Zealand tax liabilities will be satisfied. Investors that do not elect to use the RWT proxy rules would be subject to the fair dividend rate method. It is also expected that the RWT proxy, who will generally be a New Zealand-based agent, will be able to advise investors on whether an Australian unit trust meets the turnover requirements. 69 Recommendation That submissions to include certain Australian unit trusts in the proposed Australian FIF exemption be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Listed Australian unit trusts should not be included in Australian exemption Submission (593 – BT funds) Listed Australian unit trusts should not be included in the proposed tax-free capital gains tax treatment for PIEs as otherwise a compliance-intensive anti-avoidance regime will be required to stop Australian unit trusts being used to frustrate the proposed new international tax regime. Unlisted Australian unit trusts should receive the benefit of the capital gains tax exemption as this is necessary to allow New Zealand funds to access international share exposures without creating tax inefficiencies. Comment Australian unit trusts that meet the criteria outlined in the response to submissions on the previous issue, should qualify for the Australian FIF exemption from the proposed offshore tax rules, regardless of whether or not they are listed. Whether an Australian unit trust is listed or not does not seem to be a relevant factor in determining whether it should be exempt from the FIF rules. This is because the proposed criteria to qualify for the Australian FIF exemption should ensure these vehicles distribute a reasonable level of income each year (which would be taxable in both Australia and New Zealand) and the use of the RWT proxy should mean that the New Zealand tax liabilities will be satisfied. Recommendation That the submission that listed Australian unit trusts be excluded from the Australian exemption be declined, subject to officials’ comments. 70 Issue: Exemption for Australian unit trusts that invest in Australian-listed equities Submission (575 – Dimensional) Australian unit trusts that primarily invest in Australian-listed equities should effectively receive the benefit of the Australian FIF exemption. Qualifying Australian unit trusts should be treated as being in the New Zealand system for the purposes of allocating their income and calculating the tax liability of New Zealand investors, with the obligation for payment of tax falling on the New Zealand investor. To provide tax neutrality it would be necessary to divide the capital gains of Australian unit trusts into exempt (i.e. Australian listed companies) and non-exempt capital gain. An approach for Australian unit trusts with New Zealand investors is to make a monthly determination of the proportion of taxable and non-taxable securities in the Australian unit trust. By averaging the monthly values over a year a good estimate of the average underlying exposure of the Australian unit trust to taxable and non- taxable securities should be obtained. Comment Officials consider that an appropriate approach to deal with investments in Australian unit trusts has been developed in response to the earlier submissions on this issue. The preferred approach would exempt from the FIF rules investments in Australian unit trusts that meet certain turnover requirements and which incorporate the RWT proxy mechanism. The approach proposed in this submission would be complicated to incorporate in legislation and difficult to apply in practice. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 71 FIVE-YEAR EXEMPTION (GPG) Supplementary Order Paper No.44 Issue: Exempting revenue account investors from tax on realised share gains for duration of holiday Submission (573 – Guinness Peat Group, 597 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 608 – ING, 593 – BT Funds, 582 – NPF) PIEs should not be taxed on realised gains on shares subject to the five-year holiday, that are disposed of during that holiday. This treatment would provide consistency in taxation between direct and indirect investment. It would also be consistent with the rationale for the five-year holiday, which is to allow time for the government to review the CFC rules and then give entities covered by the holiday time to consider shifting their headquarters to New Zealand. Finally, this treatment would remove unnecessary compliance costs for PIEs who would otherwise have to separately account for shares covered by the holiday on a realised basis which is difficult to incorporate with the look-through treatment under the PIE rules which require attribution on a quarterly basis. Comment We consider that the policy rationale for the five-year exemption has not changed under the proposed fair dividend rate method and therefore recommend that the exemption be retained. We also consider that revenue account investors in GPG should be given the option of applying the fair dividend rate method, rather than the current tax rules (which would tax their realised share gains). We do not however consider that investments by PIEs in GPG should be treated as an investment in a New Zealand or Australian company for the simple reason that GPG is not a New Zealand company. It is therefore not subject to New Zealand’s tax rules. The comprehensive nature of New Zealand’s company tax system, which encourages dividend distribution, was a key reason for providing PIEs with an exclusion from tax on their share trading income from investments in New Zealand companies. GPG, in contrast, does not pay out a large percentage of their earnings by way of dividends and taxing PIEs only on this income would improve the competitive position of an investment in GPG compared to all other offshore portfolio share investments (which would be taxed on a 5% fair dividend rate). This would not be desirable. Officials consider that institutional investors in GPG should have the option of paying tax on their GPG investments using the fair dividend rate method. This should address the compliance point that paying tax on realised shares gains would be difficult to incorporate with the effective look-through treatment under the PIE tax rules. 72 Recommendation That the submission that PIEs holding investments in GPG only be taxed on the dividend income from those investments be declined. Investors on revenue account should have the option of applying the fair dividend rate method to these shares. Issue: Exclusion for foreign entities with substantial NZ presence Submissions (578 – NZICA, 564 – Austral Pacific Energy, 568 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Investments in foreign companies with a substantial presence in New Zealand (for example, where 50-90% by value of the entity’s assets are in New Zealand) should be excluded from the proposed FIF rules. The GPG exemption should be expanded to apply to other companies whose principal business is based in New Zealand. This should be achieved by changing the following requirements: • The requirement for there to be 20,000 shareholders should be reduced to 20 shareholders (to be in line with the definition for electing into the PIE rules where 20 non-associated investors set the requirement for widely held status). • The appropriate threshold for a significant proportion of New Zealand shareholders should be 20%, not 50%. Comment The reason for exempting interests in certain grey list companies (GPG) for five years from the FIF rules was to give these entities time to consider relocating to New Zealand pending the outcome of the review of New Zealand’s controlled foreign company rules. This reason is quite different from the situations being submitted on above, which suggest that an exemption is justified based on the foreign company being invested into having a substantial New Zealand trading or business presence. The issue of the double taxation of New Zealand shareholders of foreign companies with a substantial New Zealand presence currently exists. This is because the foreign company can pay tax in New Zealand on its profits but cannot flow through imputation credits to its New Zealand shareholders on the resulting dividends. A solution to this problem may seem to be to allow the foreign company to maintain an imputation credit account. The policy reason why only New Zealand resident companies can maintain imputation credit accounts is to ensure that there remains an incentive for a current New Zealand-resident company to remain resident in New Zealand. A New Zealand-resident company is liable to New Zealand tax on its worldwide income whereas a non-resident company is only liable to New Zealand tax on its New Zealand-sourced income. If a non-resident company was allowed to maintain an imputation credit account for the benefit of its New Zealand shareholders 73 this could provide an incentive for a New Zealand-resident company to migrate to escape tax on its foreign-sourced income while still passing on the benefit of New Zealand tax on its New Zealand-sourced income to its New Zealand shareholders. We therefore recommend that the submissions be declined. Investments in these companies should be subject to the proposed fair dividend rate method. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Revenue account investor election Submission (597 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 608 – ING, 593 – BT Funds, 582 – NPF) Investors who hold shares on revenue account that qualify for the temporary exemption from the proposed FIF rules, for investments in certain grey list entities, should be able to elect that such shares are able to be taxed under the FIF rules. Comment As noted earlier, officials agree that revenue account investors that invest in companies that qualify for the five-year exemption should be able to elect to apply the fair dividend rate method. This is likely to be particularly beneficial for PIEs that invest into such companies as attribution of income to investors would be simpler under the proposed fair dividend rate method. In contrast, if the existing tax rules were to apply, investors would be subject to tax on realised gains on these investments. This would require deferred gains and losses to be allocated across tax years and current and future investors, which would be difficult for PIEs to manage. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 74 FURTHER EXEMPTIONS Issue: Exemption for work-based superannuation schemes Submission (1142 – Carter Holt Harvey Employee Benefits Plan and Retirement Plan) The proposed offshore investment taxation changes should not apply to work-based superannuation schemes, or as a minimum should be deferred for five years. This is no different to the exemption granted to GPG and the same reasons should apply. Comment There is no basis for exempting offshore shares held by corporate superannuation schemes. Investors in these schemes should be treated no differently to other New Zealand investors (including those investing offshore via other savings vehicles, such as unit trusts). To provide an exemption for offshore shares held via a corporate superannuation scheme would give investors in these schemes an unfair advantage. The rationale for the five-year exemption for investments in certain grey list companies – to give these companies time to consider relocating to New Zealand pending the outcome of the review of the controlled foreign company rules – does not apply in the case of offshore shares held by work-based superannuation schemes. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Exemption for new immigrants Submission (591 – Duncan Cotterill, 575 – Direct Broking) The offshore proposals should not apply to portfolios acquired before immigration to New Zealand, prior to enactment. All retirement savings held offshore by immigrants to New Zealand should be exempt. Comment A permanent exemption for new migrants on shares acquired pre-migration to New Zealand would be unfair vis-à-vis other New Zealanders. Officials note that these migrants will have sufficient time to adjust their holdings, to take into account New Zealand’s offshore tax rules, under the recently introduced four-year exemption from 75 tax for new migrants (and returning New Zealanders) on their offshore investments. It should also be noted that most migrants will have experience paying capital gains taxes in other jurisdictions. In contrast, the fair dividend rate method would tax a reasonable dividend yield from their offshore portfolio share investments. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Temporary exemption for non-resident entities investing in Australasian shares Submission (1167W – New Zealand Investment Trust) A temporary exemption from the new offshore tax rules should be provided for interests in non-resident entities that invest primarily in Australasian equities to allow them time to relocate to New Zealand. Comment As noted earlier, we consider that investments in the New Zealand Investment Trust (NZIT) should receive a two-year holiday from the proposed offshore tax rules, if the exemption for investments in GPG is retained. This is because New Zealand investors in NZIT and other grey list entities that have a predominantly Australasian investment policy, would benefit if these entities were to relocate to New Zealand to become PIEs. Another major advantage for the shareholders from these entities migrating to New Zealand is that they would get the benefit of New Zealand imputation credits (which are currently lost). To qualify for this two-year holiday, the New Zealand Investment Trust, and any other grey list entities would need to have at least 90% of their assets (by value) invested in New Zealand-resident and Australian-resident listed companies. This Australasian investment requirement would have to be maintained throughout the two-year exemption period. Such entities would also need to be listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange on the date of introduction of this bill and have a substantial New Zealand ownership. A further condition of this temporary exemption should be that the relevant entities notify the Commissioner within 30 days of the date of enactment of this bill that their investors qualify for this exemption. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 76 Issue: Publication of list of qualifying companies Submission (597 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) IRD should publish a list of companies that meet the qualifying criteria for the proposed five-year exemption from the proposed FIF rules. Comment Inland Revenue will publish in its Tax Information Bulletin a list of companies that have provided notification that their shareholders qualify for the temporary exemptions (i.e. the five-year and two-year exemptions referred to previously) from the FIF rules. An amendment is needed to give Inland Revenue the authority to publish these company names notwithstanding the secrecy provisions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted by making an amendment to the secrecy provisions to allow Inland Revenue to publish the names of companies that it has received notification from that their shareholders qualify for the temporary exemptions from the FIF rules. Issue: Exemption for inherited shares Submission (965, 1226 – Deloitte) There should be some relief for shares which have been inherited, as beneficiaries have not actively chosen to invest. For example, holders could be given a timeframe within which to exit the investment. Comment Officials consider there is no policy justification for exempting inherited shares from the FIF rules. Income from inherited offshore shares should be treated in the same way as income from offshore shares acquired through other means. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 77 Issue: Extension of holiday for new migrants Submission (734 – Todd Corporation) A new immigrant in Australia would be taxable on their employment income and investment income having an Australian source. Foreign income would not be subject to Australian tax. The person can remain temporarily resident so long as they do not acquire Australian citizenship. In response to this New Zealand has introduced a four-year holiday. The Committee should note the need to align the taxing provisions of New Zealand and Australia. Comment The temporary exemption from the offshore tax rules for new migrants (and certain returning New Zealanders) was enacted by a previous Act of Parliament. This submission is therefore outside the scope of this bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Exemption for returning New Zealanders Submission (615 – Business NZ) The exemption from the FIF rules for returning New Zealanders should decrease the minimum amount of time they should have been out of the country from 10 years to a minimum of five years. Comment As noted in response to the previous submission, the temporary exemption from the offshore tax rules for new migrants and certain returning New Zealanders was enacted by a previous Act of Parliament. This submission is therefore outside the scope of this bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 78 Issue: Exemption for retired individuals Submission (734 – Todd Corporation, 1333P – G C Gould) The international tax proposals should not apply to retired individuals who hold offshore shares on capital account and who are aged over 65 as at 1 April 2007. Comment Officials consider there is no policy justification for an age-based exemption from the offshore tax rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 79 DE MINIMIS THRESHOLD Clauses 7 and 20 Issue: Level of threshold Submissions (578 – NZICA, 589 – KPMG, 588 – TCA, 585 – NZ Exchange-listed UK Investment Trust Companies, 560 – Institute of Financial Advisers, 568 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 575 – Direct Broking, 577 – ASB Group, 881, 1138 – Perpetual Trust Limited, 580 – Stratex Networks, 936 – ABN AMRO, 965, 1226 – Deloitte, 1339W – Blackmore Virtue & Owens, 1347W – Northplan Financial Services / Swain Investment Services/ Colin Strang Financial Planning, 492, 880 – First NZ Capital, 510 – Liontamer, 657W – Sothertons, 503W – Anonymous, 471W – David Sissons, 467W – M.D. Macfarlane, 415W – Andrew Reid, 882W – Lee Stevens, 631 – R P Deeble) Submissions commented that the proposed NZD$50,000 de minimis was too low and should be raised. Alternatives given ranged from $80,000 to $1 million (with the average between $100,000 and $250,000). The de minimis was considered too low on the basis that the removal of the grey list exemption for portfolio investments will effectively reduce the benefit of the current threshold. NZD$50,000 was also not considered representative of the level of savings required for financing retirement. However, some submissions (from managed funds) commented that if the de minimis remained only for individuals investing offshore directly and was not extended to cover investments through a PIE, it should be set lower than NZ$50,000. Comment Officials earlier recommended keeping the de minimis threshold for individuals, if the fair dividend rate method recommendation is accepted. We do not recommend increasing the threshold above the NZD$50,000 level that is currently proposed. Increasing the de minimis significantly would undermine the core objective of these reforms which is to remove the current distortion between investing directly in offshore shares and investing through New Zealand managed funds (investors investing offshore via PIEs would not get the benefit of this threshold). A modest de minimis level for individual direct investors, such as that contained currently in the bill, can be justified on compliance cost grounds. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 80 Issue: Family trusts Submission (578 – NZICA, 589 – KPMG, 588 – TCA, 560 – Institute of Financial Advisers, 568 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 575 – Direct Broking, 881, 1138 – Perpetual Trust Limited, 1221 – Ernst & Young, 965, 1226 – Deloitte, 1347W – Northplan Financial Services / Swain Investment Services/ Colin Strang Financial Planning, 510 – Liontamer, 682W – Private Trust Company, 503W – Anonymous, 467W – M.D. Macfarlane, 631 – R P Deeble) The de minimis exemption should be extended to trusts that invest on behalf of beneficiaries that are individuals (for example, family trusts). If this is not done then investments through trusts will be disadvantaged compared to direct investments, creating a distortion. Specific anti-avoidance rules should be designed to counter the risk of multiple trust structures being used to avoid the offshore tax rules. Comment The NZ$50,000 de minimis threshold currently does not apply to offshore portfolio share investments held via family trusts to prevent this threshold being exploited by the creation of multiple trusts for the benefit of the same individual. For example, if ten family trusts could be established for the benefit of the same individual, the de minimis would effectively be increased to $500,000. The use of specific anti- avoidance rules to prevent this mischief, as suggested in submissions, would not be feasible as family trusts are discretionary. This could result in persons being made beneficiaries of the trust in future, with no way for Inland Revenue to determine who the real beneficiaries of the trust are. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Court ordered trust exemption Submission (589 – KPMG, 588 – Trustees Corporation Association, 586 – Promina) The requirement for the settlor to be a relative or legal guardian (or associates) under section CQ 5(6)(a)(i) and section DN 6(5)(a)(i) should be removed. Comment The NZ$50,000 de minimis threshold for application of the new offshore tax rules would be available to a small minority of trusts. That is, where the trust arises under the operation of the law and the settlor of the trust is a relative or legal guardian of the beneficiary or a person associated with a relative or legal guardian of the beneficiary 81 and is required by a court order to pay damages to the beneficiary; when the settlor is the ACC; and when the trust is of the estate of a deceased person. As noted earlier, family trusts which are discretionary trusts would not get the benefit of the de minimis exemption. We consider that the requirement for the settlor to be a parent or legal guardian is consistent with a similar provision in the tax rules for minor beneficiaries. However, officials consider that an amendment should be made to this provision to include the situation where an estate is the settlor and a Court order requires the proceeds of damages or compensation to be held on trust for the beneficiaries of the relevant trust. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Separate de minimis for nominal value investments Submission (597 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) There should be a separate de minimis available to all taxpayers in respect of specific FIF interests (e.g. memberships in professional organisations), where the interest has a nil or nominal value and where there have been no distributions of income from the FIF. Comment Officials do not consider that mere membership in a professional organisation of the type mentioned would normally result in a member having an interest subject to the FIF rules. Officials therefore consider it is unnecessary to have a specific exemption in these circumstances. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 82 Issue: Extending de minimis to indirect interests Submissions (592 – Tower, 560 – Institute of Financial Advisers, 577 – ASB Group, 1142 – Carter Holt Harvey Employee Benefits Plan and Retirement Plan, 1131 – David Patterson (MinterEllisonRuddWatt)) The NZD$50,000 de minimis exemption should be expanded to include individuals who invest in managed funds. Where the total value of an investor’s investments are below the de minimis, irrespective if these are invested directly or through managed funds, they should not be subject to the FIF rules. The de minimis should be applied to work-based savings schemes, based on the average account balance allocated to overseas shares. A certification regime could be adopted which would allow investors to certify that their investments outside New Zealand and Australia are less than $50,000 with the result being that they are exempt under the PIE regime. Comment The rationale for the de minimis is to provide relief for investors with modest portfolios where the cost of compliance with more complex tax rules would outweigh the additional accuracy of applying such rules – the purpose of the de minimis is not to provide a tax concession as such. This compliance cost reduction rationale does not apply to offshore investments held via managed funds, as it is the fund who would be complying with the offshore tax rules and their scale should mean that they are able to comply with more accurate tax rules. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue Reduction in investments bringing portfolio below de minimis Submission (570 – Richard Entwistle) The submitter asks if the value of a portfolio falls below $50,000 for any reason, whether the exemption would apply. The value of the portfolio may fall due to redemption or a fall in market value. 83 Comment The de minimis is based on the cost of offshore shares held rather than their market value. This is so taxpayers can refer to actual cost when determining whether the de minimis applies to them, rather than having to track market values over time. Where an investor holds shares in a year costing more than the de minimis and disposes of a sufficient quantity of them during the same year to bring the cost of shares held under the de minimis, they will still be subject to the new offshore tax rules in that year (as they have held shares costing greater than NZD$50,000 for part of the year). They will, however, receive the benefit of the de minimis in the following year, to the extent they do not purchase any additional shares in that year. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 84 FIF INTERESTS HELD BY CFCS Submission (597 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) An exemption from the new FIF rules should apply for grey list FIF interests held by a grey list CFC. Alternatively, a tax credit mechanism needs to be introduced to ensure that excess New Zealand taxation does not arise. Comment Officials consider there is no basis for exempting a grey list FIF interest held through a grey list CFC. Under New Zealand’s current controlled foreign company rules, non- grey list FIF interests held via a grey list CFC are required to be attributed directly to the New Zealand shareholders in the CFC. The proposed offshore tax changes would extend this attribution requirement to less than 10% grey list interests held by CFCs, as the grey list exemption is being removed for portfolio investments (other than for investments in Australian-resident listed companies). This is appropriate as a less than 10% grey list interest would be subject to the new offshore tax rules if it were held by a New Zealand-resident directly. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 85 FIF INCOME AND TRUSTS Issue: Treating unrealised gains as beneficiary income Submission (597 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The tax rules should clarify that a trustee can treat FIF income from unrealised gains as beneficiary income. Comment Whether unrealised gains (such as FIF and accrual income) are beneficiary income is an existing issue. Officials consider that this matter is outside the scope of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Calculating FIF income using same methods as a natural person Clause 58 Submission (1221 – Ernst & Young) Qualifying trusts should be able to calculate their FIF income limit under section EX 44C(2) in the same way as natural persons. Although the proposed treatment for qualifying trusts may be concessionary where dividend yields are lower than 5% of opening value, from a policy perspective there seems to be no reason to treat qualifying trusts any differently to natural persons. Comment Officials consider this issue would not need to be addressed if the recommendation to replace the smoothed market value method with the fair dividend rate method is accepted. Recommendation Officials have recommended that the market value and smoothed market value methods be replaced with the fair dividend rate method. If this recommendation is accepted the issue in this submission will no longer be applicable. 86 TRANSITIONAL ISSUES Clause 71 Issue: Value at which offshore interests enter the new rules Submission (597 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 608 – ING, 592 – Tower, 595 – AXA, 556 – AMP, 568 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 575 – Direct Broking, 1484 – Alexander Wilson, 734 – Todd Corporation, 674W – Waterfront Industry Superannuation Fund, 692 – Lyon Family Trust) Both individual and non-individual investors with investments on capital account should use the same basis (i.e. higher of cost or market value) for determining the value at which offshore interests enter the new rules. All investors should be able to elect higher of cost or market to enter the regime to recognise earlier losses. Currently this is restricted to individuals holding on capital account. Comment The issues outlined in submissions would be superseded if the market value and smoothed market value methods are replaced by the fair dividend rate method. In the context of the fair dividend rate method it is appropriate that all taxpayers enter the new offshore tax rules at the market value of their investments on the start date of the new tax rules (which for most individuals will be 1 April 2007). It would not be in the interests of individual investors to have the higher of cost or market value under the fair dividend rate method as the higher amount would result in more tax being payable. Recommendation That all offshore portfolio investments should enter the new offshore tax rules at their market value on the start date of the new tax rules. 87 Issue: Spreading tax payable on revenue account gains Submission (596 – ISI, 604W – Meat Industry Superannuation Scheme) The notional windup on 1 April 2007 will result in tax being paid early (on 85% of share gains) rather than on realisation (at 100%) sometime in the future. The tax arising on shares in grey list countries (other than Australia) held on revenue account, as a consequence of transitioning into the new FIF rules, should be allowed to be spread over three years. As drafted, only PIEs will be allowed to smooth the transitional tax obligation created by the offshore tax changes over three years. This transitional provision should be available to all entities. Comment Investors who hold grey list equities on revenue account should be required to undertake a deemed disposition at market value on 31 March (on entry into the fair dividend rate method), to crystallise any revenue account gains up to this date. Accordingly, draft section EX 54B(2) should be omitted and draft section EX 54B(3) amended to include revenue account investors. Given that in many cases this deemed disposition for revenue account investors will accelerate the tax that would otherwise be payable, it is reasonable for this tax to be able to be spread over three years and for it not to affect provisional tax or use-of- money interest. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in the context of the new fair dividend rate method, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Entry into FIF rules for non-standard balance date taxpayers Submission (589 – KPMG) The transitional rules in section EX 54B do not cater for taxpayers with early or late balance dates. Comment Officials agree with the submission and note that this issue has been addressed in the Supplementary Order Paper No. 44 introduced on 20 June 2006. 88 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 89 GENERAL FIF ISSUES Issue: Migration of persons holding FIF interests Clause 69 Submission (585 – NZ Exchange-listed UK Investment Trust Companies) The crystallisation of a liability for unrealised capital gains on cessation of NZ tax residency should be removed. Comment The FIF rules currently provide for a deemed realisation of a person’s FIF interests if that person ceases to be a New Zealand resident. Officials consider that this should not be changed. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Removal of FIF income from provisional tax rules Submission (585 – NZ Exchange-listed UK Investment Trust Companies) FIF income assessed under the bill should be placed outside the provisional tax regime. Comment Under the fair dividend rate method, the taxable income in a year would be a maximum of 5% of the opening market value of a person’s total portfolio of offshore shares at the start of the year. This certainty should alleviate provisional tax concerns for most investors. Investors would also be able to plan for this tax liability (an average dividend yield of around 2% on their portfolio would be sufficient to meet the resulting tax liability under the fair dividend rate for a 39% taxpayer). Officials also consider there is no policy reason for generally excluding investors subject to the FIF rules from the provisional tax rules. 90 Recommendation That the submission be declined. It should be noted that provisional tax concerns for most investors should be largely addressed by the proposed fair dividend rate method. Issue: Exemption for employment-related foreign pensions Submission (585 – NZ Exchange-listed UK Investment Trust Companies) Overseas employment-related pensions held by New Zealand tax residents should be excluded from the FIF regime. Comment Officials note that there are already extensive exemptions for employment-related superannuation interests contained in sections EX 36 and EX 37 of the Income Tax Act 2004. These exemptions will typically exclude from the FIF rules the foreign pensions of persons who migrate to New Zealand. Officials do not consider that further exemptions are justified. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Extension of rollover relief on reinvestment Clause 58 Submission (560 – Institute of Financial Advisers) The rollover relief available for reinvestment offshore should be extended for six months beyond the end of the tax year. Comment Officials consider this issue would not need to be addressed if the recommendation to replace the smoothed market value method with the fair dividend rate method is accepted, as there is no wash-up when shares are sold under the fair dividend rate method (and hence no need for rollover relief in relation to gains on disposal). 91 Recommendation Officials have recommended that the market value and smoothed market value methods be replaced with the fair dividend rate method. If this recommendation is accepted the issue in this submission will no longer be applicable. Issue: Research and development register exemption Submission (565 – NZBio) An additional exception could be developed where investors in companies that are on a research and development company “register” are exempt from the FIF rules. Companies that attribute more than 50% of their expenditure on research and development could elect to be included on the register. Comment Officials have recommended, earlier in this report, an exemption from the offshore tax rules for investments in New Zealand start-up companies that move offshore to gain access to finance. We consider that this exemption is sufficient to deal with the concerns raised. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Restriction on what is a FIF interest Submission (568 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Unlisted portfolio investments should be exempted from the proposals or another practical solution, such as further income calculation methods, should be implemented. For unlisted portfolio investments (and unlisted non-grey list FIFs where the investor holds more than 10% of the entity) the proposed methods are not always applicable or comparable to the true economic result. Comment Officials consider the proposed cost-based variant of the fair dividend rate method should cater for portfolio interests in entities for which market values are not available (for example, investments in unlisted offshore companies). 92 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Family companies Submission (568 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) Investments in family companies have a different genesis to normal international investments. They are not of the nature that competes with investments held in funds. They should be excluded from the ambit of the proposed regime. Comment Officials consider that a general exemption from the FIF rules for portfolio investments in family companies could allow investors to circumvent the offshore tax rules by investing through an unlisted offshore company. As noted in response to the previous submission, the proposed cost-based variant of the fair dividend rate method should cater for investments in family companies if such an investment has no market value. More importantly, investments in family companies would not be subject to the new offshore tax rules if they comprise a 10% or greater interest in a grey list company. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Exemption from wash-up requirements Clause 58 Submissions (575 – Direct Broking, 1142 – Carter Holt Harvey Employee Benefits Plan and Retirement Plan, 492, 880 – First NZ Capital, 510 – Liontamer) The elimination of the accumulated tax liability on capital gains on offshore investments on the death of the investor (as proposed at present) should be extended such that any carry forward gains are extinguished after 10 years of continuous offshore investments and upon the investor reaching the age of 65 years. The requirement to pay tax on gains above the 5% level by a work-based savings scheme, when capital is repatriated to New Zealand, should be removed. 93 Comment Officials consider this issue would not need to be addressed if the recommendation to replace the smoothed market value method with the fair dividend rate is accepted. As there would be no wash-up under the fair dividend rate method, no relief for tax on accumulated gains is necessary. Recommendation Officials have recommended that the market value and smoothed market value methods be replaced with the fair dividend rate method. If this recommendation is accepted the issue in this submission will no longer be applicable. Issue: Redefinition of capital/revenue boundary Submission (587 – Russell Investment Group) A new definition of capital gains should be introduced so that an increase in the value of an investment held for more than 12 months should be defined as a capital gain, and for less than 12 months as income. This approach is used in the United States. Adopting this definition would immediately remove the differences between direct investors and investors in pooled vehicles and remove the tax bias in favour of or against overseas versus New Zealand investments. Comment Officials consider that a proposal to tax all gains on shares (New Zealand and offshore) held for more than 12 months would be arbitrary. New Zealand does not have a general capital gains tax. Instead, the tax system deems certain gains to be income (for example, if the gains are derived as part of a taxpayer’s business). The United States tax treatment is therefore not comparable as the United States has a comprehensive capital gains tax. The proposed fair dividend rate should remove the key tax distortions between investing in offshore shares directly and via New Zealand managed funds. The application of the fair dividend rate method should also result in a reasonable level of tax being payable on offshore investments, compared to the status quo. This should achieve a better alignment with the current tax treatment of investments in New Zealand companies. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 94 Issue: Foreign currency conversions Submission (1221 – Ernst & Young, 657W – Sothertons) The legislation should provide explicitly for the New Zealand currency amounts which need to be included as opening values, carried income or carried loss amounts in years following the first year in which a FIF income calculation is performed. It is not clear if calculations would be made firstly in the foreign currency amount and then converted to NZ$ at the conclusion of the calculation or whether the calculation would use the converted NZ$ balances. Comment Officials agree that the foreign currency conversion provisions in the FIF rules need to be made more certain as to how they should be applied from year to year. In particular, having chosen a currency conversion method – actual rates or an annual average rate – for an attributing interest in an FIF the same method should be used in subsequent years for that interest. In respect of the fair dividend rate method, a person should be required to use the same currency conversion method – that is, either actual (spot) exchange rates or an annual average rate – for all attributing FIF interests for which the fair dividend rate method is used. Recommendation That the foreign currency conversion provisions under the FIF rules be clarified in accordance with officials’ comments. Issue: Shares which have no cost Submission (1221 – Ernst & Young) The legislation should be amended to specify the value of shares which have been gifted or inherited. This is particularly important with respect to the de minimis. Comment Officials consider that the Income Tax Act 2004 already provides that shares that have been gifted or inherited are treated as being acquired for an amount equal to their market value: subpart FI and section GD 14(3) and (4). This deemed market value rule would also apply for the purposes of the NZ$50,000 de minimis exemption from the offshore tax rules. 95 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Reduction in number of methods Submission (577 – ASB Group) In light of the opportunity to simplify the current offshore investment tax rules, the options available to portfolio investors to calculate offshore investment income should be reduced to three alternative methods: the cost method, the market value method and the smoothed market value method. Comment The branch equivalent and accounting profits method are currently available under the FIF rules and should not be removed from the suite of available FIF calculation methods for portfolio investments (that is, investments of less than 10% in foreign companies). We note that these methods can currently be used in respect of portfolio investments in non-grey list companies and should continue to be available for taxpayers who can use them. These methods attempt to tax the investor on their share of the foreign entity’s underlying earnings. Officials also consider that the comparative value and deemed rate of return methods should be retained in respect of offshore portfolio investments for which the fair dividend rate is not allowed (that is, investments which generate so-called “guaranteed returns”). Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Alternative FIF method for unlisted widely held companies Submission (965, 1226 – Deloitte, 1192 – Alistair Tod) Investors who hold investments in widely held unlisted companies are for practical purposes left with only one method to calculate income – this being the cost method. Consideration should be given to allowing individuals to adopt a modified accounting profit method. Under this method, tax payable in New Zealand would be the greater of the share of profit of the company or actual dividend distributions. This could 96 operate similarly to the smoothed market value method but rather than adopting market values, accounting profits would be the basis of the calculation. Comment Officials consider that there would be sufficient FIF calculation methods to cater for different taxpayers’ circumstances, if the branch equivalent and accounting profits methods were retained, in addition to the proposed fair dividend rate and cost-based methods. We therefore do not consider that a further income calculation option is necessary or desirable. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Making the international tax regime a code Submission (577 – ASB Group) The new international tax regime should be drafted as a legislative code. Once a particular income stream has been subject to the new international tax regime, no other provisions of the Income Tax Act 2004 should apply to that income. Comment Officials consider that this issue will be addressed if the recommendation to replace the market value and smoothed market value methods with the fair dividend rate method is accepted. Under the fair dividend rate method, offshore shares will not be taxed outside the FIF rules. In particular, dividends will not be separately taxable. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 97 TECHNICAL AND DRAFTING ISSUES Issue: Market value references Clause 58 Submission (12a – NZ Funds) “Market value” should be defined and where it is not clear what market value should be, “fair value” adopted for accounting should be sufficient. Comment Officials note that “market value” is a general concept used in the Income Tax Act 2004 and should be sufficient for the purposes of applying the proposed fair dividend rate method. “Market value” has been used in the FIF rules since their inception in 1993. The tax rules do not currently contain a “fair value” concept and officials consider that introducing such a concept would create uncertainty. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Attributing interest terminology Submission (12a – NZ Funds) The drafting should be clarified by replacing references to “FIF interests” with “attributing interest” terminology. Comment Officials agree with this submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 98 Issue: Carried forward FIF income definition Clause 58 Submission (12a – NZ Funds, 578 – NZICA, 965, 1226 – Deloitte) The reference to “FIF income” in section EX 44C(13)(a)(ii) should be amended to “formula FIF income” and the reference to “FIF loss” in section EX 44C(13)(a)(iii) should be amended to “formula FIF loss”. Comment Officials consider this issue does not need to be addressed if the recommendation to replace the smoothed market value method with the fair dividend rate method is accepted. Recommendation Officials have recommended that the market value and smoothed market value methods be replaced with the fair dividend rate method. If this recommendation is accepted the issue in this submission will no longer be applicable. Issue: Limits on changing FIF calculation methods Clause 66 Submission (12a – NZ Funds) Section EX 50(2)(d), which allows a taxpayer to change their FIF income calculation method from the cost method in certain circumstances, should be clarified. Comment Officials consider that the current drafting is sufficiently clear. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 99 Issue: Redundant New Zealand-resident-reference Clause 51 Submission (589 – KPMG) Proposed section EX 33(1)(c)(i) includes a New Zealand-residence requirement. This reference is redundant because the FIF rules apply only to New Zealand residents and therefore should be omitted. Comment Officials agree with this submission but note that this provision in EX 33(1)(c) is being replaced as part of amendments proposed to the exemption as currently drafted. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Drafting of wash-up provision in cost method Clause 60 Submission (1239W – Blackmore Virtue & Owens) The effect of the formula contained in section EX 45B(2)(b) for a person who has to use the cost method for a FIF which is acquired in the income year of disposal is that they are taxed on 85% of the disposal proceeds with no deduction for the cost of the investment. Also section EX 45B(2)(b) only gives a deduction from the disposal proceeds of cost plus past gains recognised without grossing those gains up by dividing them by 0.85. That is, tax is being charged on the 15% of the unrealised gains which have previously been excluded. Comment Officials consider this issue does not need to be addressed if the recommendation to replace the cost method currently in the bill with a cost-based variant of the fair dividend rate method is accepted. If this recommendation is implemented then the submission will be superseded because a consequence of the replacement of methods is that the wash-up in section EX 45B(2)(b) will be removed. 100 Recommendation If the recommendation to replace the cost method currently in the bill with a cost- based variant of the fair dividend rate method is accepted, this submission will no longer be applicable because there would be no wash-up under the new proposal. Issue: Foreign unit trusts Submission (597 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 577 – ASB Group, 468W – Platinum Asset Management) The current section CD 7 and the section OB 1 definition of “taxable bonus issue” should be repealed in light of the proposed changes in the international tax regime. There is no longer a need for this legislation as the proposed regime will tax 85% of the movement in market value of any bonus units retained by unit holders and 85% of the proceeds from units disposed of where these units are repatriated. If retained, these bonus issues would be taxed at 100% if treated as dividends compared to 85% for bonus issues in a company. Comment In light of the recommendation earlier in this report to exclude investments in certain Australian unit trusts from the new offshore tax rules, we consider that it is necessary to retain the recently enacted provisions which treat bonus issues arising from foreign unit trusts as dividends for tax purposes. If these amendments were repealed, the previous base maintenance problem would recur in respect of investments in Australian unit trusts that are exempt from the new FIF rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined.

vehicles that meet the definition of a “portfolio investment entity”. Under these optional rules, collective investment vehicles that satisfy certain criteria will not be taxable on realised share gains made on New Zealand and Australian companies. Portfolio investment entities will pay tax on investment income based on the tax rates of their investors (capped at 33%). Income earned via a portfolio investment entity will not affect investors’ entitlements to family assistance or their student loan repayments and child support obligations. The new rules will treat investment through portfolio investment entities in the same way as direct investment by individuals, thus removing long-standing disadvantages of saving through intermediaries like managed funds. They will also prevent over- taxation of lower income savers, and eliminate the taxation of capital gains on New Zealand and Australian shares held through a fund. These changes are particularly important given the implementation of KiwiSaver next year. There were over 120 submissions on the proposed tax rules for portfolio investment entities. Submissions generally welcomed the proposals and, in particular, supported the objective of aligning the tax treatment of investors in managed funds with that of direct savers. Submissions sought a number of technical amendments to ensure that the proposed rules would achieve their intended policy effect. One concern was that the rules were overly prescriptive – in particular, in the area of the eligibility criteria for becoming a portfolio investment entity. Another concern was that the rules, as introduced, were overly complex and did not reflect the current commercial practice of certain funds. Officials, taking into account the technical concerns raised, have recommended a number of amendments to the proposed portfolio investment entity tax rules, including: • Deferring the application date of the portfolio investment entity tax rules to 1 October 2007, to align with KiwiSaver. • Making it easier for entities that satisfy current definitions of a widely held investment vehicle to qualify as a portfolio investment entity. • Allowing portfolio investment entities to recognise income, for tax purposes, in the same manner the entity allocates income to investors. • Allowing portfolio investment entities to generally apply a zero percent tax rate in relation to investors that exit the fund. • Providing refunds for tax losses and excess tax credits directly to portfolio investment entities, who will apply the refunds for the benefit of investors, instead of these amounts being rebated directly to investors. • Allowing simplified tax calculation methods for portfolio investment entities that are listed companies and superannuation funds. 2 TIMING OF THE INTRODUCTION OF THE NEW RULES Clause 85 Issue: Deferral to 1 October 2007 Submissions (597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 12a – NZ Funds, 589 – KPMG, 588 – Trustee Corporation Association of NZ, 598 – Trustees Executors, 582 – National Provident Fund, 556 – AMP, 568 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 881 & 1138 – Perpetual Trust Limited, 1141 – MCA NZ Limited, 613W – Phillips Fox) The commencement date of the PIE tax rules should be deferred until 1 October 2007, to enable PIEs to be ready to accept the first flows of KiwiSaver funds and to allow entities wishing to elect further time to develop systems fully and inform investors about their new products. Furthermore, there should be a process of speedy and binding resolution of issues in advance of the enactment of the legislation. Any requests made by the savings industry for a deferral of the implementation date of the new rules would be supported. Some changes could be made for 1 April 2007 to allow KiwiSaver to be launched and to level the playing field between direct investment and investment via collective investment vehicles, with more comprehensive changes introduced in 2008. Consider extending the 1 April 2007 deadline. Comment The timing of the PIE tax rules is inherently linked with the application date of the KiwiSaver work-based savings initiative. The government has decided to defer the application date for KiwiSaver to 1 July, to take into account provider concerns. More importantly, employee contributions will not be transferred to KiwiSaver providers until 1 October 2007. As this is when the appropriate tax rules need to be in place, we agree with submissions recommending that the application date of the portfolio investment entity tax rules should be deferred to 1 October 2007. This should give fund providers (including KiwiSaver default funds) an extra six months to ensure that their systems are fully tested and operational. Recommendation That the application date of the portfolio investment entity tax rules be deferred to 1 October 2007. 3 Issue: Deferring attribution requirement to 1 April 2008 Submissions (592 – Tower, 734W – Todd Corporation) To allow sufficient time for systems development, PIEs should be able to defer application of the requirement to attribute income to investors to 1 April 2008. However, the 1 April 2007 application date should continue to apply for the purposes of the exclusion of trading gains on Australasian equities. Comment Allowing further time for systems development will be addressed by the preceding recommendation to defer application date of the entire PIE rules to 1 October 2007. It is not appropriate that the primary benefits of the regime (the exclusion of the trading gains on Australasian shares) should apply earlier than the requirement to attribute income to investors. The regime is intended to operate as a whole. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: The bill should be split into two parts Submission (558 – Christopher Milne (Business Builders Group) on behalf of several NZ Exchange listed UK Investment Trust Companies) The bill should be split into two. The parts relating to the removal of capital gains taxes for managed funds investing in NZ and Australia and the taxation of individual investors in managed funds at their personal marginal tax rate should come into force on 1 April 2007. The parts relating to investments outside NZ and Australia coming into force on 1 April 2008 or later. Comment Deferring the offshore tax changes until 1 April 2008 or later would adversely affect PIEs. If the current offshore tax rules were retained, PIEs would generally be taxable on realised gains on offshore shares. As the proposed rules require PIEs to allocate income to investors on a regular basis and pay tax on this income at investors’ tax rates, having assets that are taxable on realisation would create difficulties for funds in determining how unrealised gains should be allocated to investors. Equally, retaining the current “grey list” exemption would mean that investment in the grey list via PIEs would continue to be tax-disadvantaged relative to direct investment in these countries. This would be undesirable, particularly given the 2007 start-date for KiwiSaver. We therefore recommend that the submission suggesting separating the PIE tax rules from the offshore tax changes be rejected. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 4 Issue: Deferral to at least 1 April 2008 Submission (567 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting) The implementation date needs to be set back, with the effective date being no sooner than 1 April 2008. As an alternative, changes could be elective from 1 April 2007, with compliance required from 1 April 2008. Comment The deferral of the PIE rules until 1 October 2007 should allow sufficient time for entities to adopt the necessary procedures. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 5 SUPPORT FOR PIE PROPOSALS Submissions (592 – Tower, 594 – New Zealand Law Society, 558 – Christopher Milne (Business Builders Group) on behalf of several NZ Exchange listed UK Investment Trust Companies, 560 – Institute of Financial Advisers, 568 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 570 – Richard Entwistle, 577 & 577a – ASB Group, 604W – Meat Industry Superannuation Scheme, 615W – Business NZ, 734W – Todd Corporation, 611 – New Zealand Assets Management Limited, 467W – M D Macfarlane) “We strongly support the PIE regime, which will assist in levelling the playing field between direct and indirect investment (subject to our concerns in relation to international investment).” (Tower) “The society supports the proposed PIE regime in principle, as leading to a closer alignment between the tax imposed on direct investment and the tax imposed on investment though a New Zealand managed fund. However, it must be recognised that the proposed tax regime is unique, and poses some unique problems.” (594 – New Zealand Law Society) “The Institute supports the proposed qualifying PIE regime, permitting alignment of taxation with a lower income individuals’ marginal tax rate and capping tax at the rate of 33% for other investors. The Institute supports the proposal to exempt New Zealand resident shares and Australian resident listed companies from the unrealised capital gains tax.” (Institute of Financial Advisers) Comment Officials welcome this support for the PIE proposals. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 6 PIE RULES SHOULD NOT PROCEED Submissions (881 & 1138 – Perpetual Trust Limited, 1141 – MCA NZ Limited, 1142 – Carter Holt Harvey Employee Benefits Plan and Retirement Plan, 1382W – Equity Investment Advisers & Sharebrokers Limited, 1478 – Mercer Investment Consulting, 657W – Sothertons Chartered Accountants, 393W – Fair Home, Graeme Martin James Hall, Gerald Gibbard, Stuart + Carlyon, Bruce Fraser) The tax disadvantages of New Zealand-based collective investment vehicles should be removed. However, the proposed PIE rules will lead to higher administration and compliance costs. The problems in the legislation cannot be solved in time for fund managers to implement the necessary systems changes or alter prospectuses and trust deeds before 1 April 2007. Group investment funds and qualifying unit trusts investing in New Zealand or in Australian listed securities should be able to elect to be taxed as a trust, rather than as a company, with investments held to be on capital account. This will mean that they are not subject to capital gains tax, and that income distributions have resident withholding tax deducted at the investor’s marginal rate. The following solution allows the Inland Revenue to differentiate between 19.5% and 33% taxpayers but does not create the administrative strain on providers: • Do not differentiate between taxable and non-taxable gross income at a CIV level. • Maintain unit pricing on a net basis. • Require each provider to submit each individual’s proxy gross income as (net income)/(1 – tax rate). • Require the calculation on an annual basis. For 19.5% taxpayers, quarterly calculations are not warranted given the dollars involved at this level. The current PIE proposals do not meet any cost benefit test. As such, most employer schemes will not become PIE compliant or may wind up because of overall increased costs, which is not the intention of the legislation. Therefore the PIE regime should not proceed. The general intent in relation to PIEs is supported but the objectives could be much simpler by adopting a similar approach to Australia, where vehicles “pass-through” income and tax credits to the investor. It appears it may be better to design a system whereby each year’s tax liability is an issue between the Inland Revenue and each individual, if a proper flow-through principle is to be applied to investment income generated through a pooled vehicle such as a PIE. It may be too much to expect that a PIE can perform this task efficiently and fairly and at a reasonable cost to the PIE. 7 The bill gives undue weight to the desires of the collective investment vehicle sector, which is only a part of the larger total investment market. The proposed measure in the taxation bill that will see the collective investment vehicle sector granted significant tax concessions not available to other investors is opposed. Also opposed is the general public being offered substantial incentives to invest exclusively in these vehicles in New Zealand. There is agreement in theory with the general concept of the tax treatment of investments in PIEs being more closely aligned with the tax rates of the underlying investors but the proposed method is opposed on a cost benefit basis. It would be cheaper and easier to administer the tax implications through the already well- understood method of filing individual tax returns on an annual basis and claiming back any overpayment of tax. New Zealand investors should also be able to continue investing in passive index funds as these funds provide relatively risk-free access into the share markets in both New Zealand and Australia and are a low cost alternative to a trading unit trust. To remove the bias against New Zealand unit trusts, there should be no tax on capital gains for unit trusts investing in any listed securities (including Australia, New Zealand and foreign exchanges) and income should be taxed at a flat 33% rate with physical distributions taxed at marginal rates (with an imputation credit for tax paid by the fund). To cater for low-income earners and to encourage true retirement savings, KiwiSaver funds and all superannuation schemes should have lock-in to age 55 or 65 and not be taxed on capital gains, with income taxed to the fund at 15% or 19.5%. Comment The benefits of PIE status (such as the Australasian share trading exemption) should not be separated from the other policy objectives of: • taxing investors at their correct tax rates; • not affecting their social assistance requirements; and • not requiring taxpayers to file a tax return when they currently do not have to. The submissions listed above do not meet these policy objectives, as they either require investors to file returns to get their correct tax rate (which will affect social assistance entitlements and may create tax compliance obligations that currently do not exist) or that funds be taxed at a concessionary tax rate (for example, 15%, which would be lower than investors’ marginal rates). For these reasons, we do not consider that these submissions should be accepted. Officials also note that, as explained below, a new, simplified method of attribution will be available for entities such as superannuation funds that will achieve these objectives with fewer compliance costs. This new method should broadly allow superannuation funds to operate as at present, while undertaking a single tax calculation at the end of the year in respect of their investors (instead of requiring quarterly tax calculations). Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 8 BILL PROCESS Issue: General concerns Submissions (578 – NZICA, 558 – Christopher Milne (Business Builders Group) on behalf of several NZ Exchange listed UK Investment Trust Companies, 613W – Phillips Fox) The New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants has submitted that while supporting the overall thrust of the PIE proposals, it has reservations about the method of implementation and strong reservations about the drafting. It has commented that significant changes to the bill are required to successfully achieve the policy objectives. Other submissions have recommended that: • The Finance and Expenditure Committee should request further information, both from officials and large and small tax advisors, regarding the extent of compliance costs resulting from this bill; and • A review of the areas of tax law in question should be started again, using a process that does not have the restrictions and flaws inherent in the process that has been adopted to date. (They suggest that this does not mean that the work undertaken to date will be ignored or wasted; rather, its conclusions should be reassessed in light of the wider issues). Comment Officials recognise that the draft legislation on the PIE tax rules is highly technical and complex. This reflects the nature of the subject matter, which involves putting investors in managed funds in a similar position to direct investors. In particular, ensuring that managed fund investors receive their tax rate on investment income derived via a PIE requires a “flow-through” concept to be incorporated in the draft legislation. This is a significantly different approach from entity taxation than has previously been considered and, as a result, a degree of legislative complexity is unavoidable. The Committee process of the bill has afforded an opportunity to review and streamline the PIE tax rules. This should reduce compliance costs for taxpayers and advisers. For example, the PIE tax provisions have been re-ordered more logically. The PIE tax rules also contain a legislative overview, or roadmap, of the different provisions to guide users. On the issue of the compliance cost of the changes, the proposals in the bill will impose some additional compliance costs on individual investors (mostly currently investing in “grey list” countries outside Australia) and managed funds (from having to implement the new PIE tax rules). The proposed “fair dividend rate” for taxing individuals’ offshore share investments is, however, significantly simpler than the current offshore tax proposals in the bill. The PIE tax rules may impose some additional systems costs (from taxing PIE income at investors’ tax rates) but there would be clear benefits for investors in PIEs – namely, being taxed at their correct tax rate and receiving capital gains on New Zealand and Australian equities tax-free. 9 The proposals in the bill have been the culmination of a number of reviews into the taxation of investment income. These range from the 2001 Tax Review and its recommendations for taxing offshore portfolio share investments to issues papers released by Inland Revenue and the Treasury, a 2004 review of the investment tax rules by Mr Craig Stobo and the release of a government discussion document outlining reform proposals last year. A number of different stakeholders were consulted as part of these reviews, and officials consider that the problems with the current tax rules and options for reform were exhaustively canvassed. We do not consider that abandoning the reform proposals in the bill, especially the proposed PIE tax rules, for a fresh review of the tax rules for investment income is likely to result in a better outcome. It would simply delay the correction of the tax disadvantages facing investors in New Zealand managed funds, which would not be desirable given the imminent application of KiwiSaver. Recommendation That the submissions be noted; however, the submission that the current proposals be abandoned and a fresh review of the investment tax rules be commenced should be declined. Issue: Opportunities to review draft legislation Submission (594 – New Zealand Law Society, 578 – NZICA) The PIE legislation highlights a weakness in New Zealand’s tax policy process, which is that there is insufficient consultation on the actual drafting of legislation. The bill should not be enacted until there has been the opportunity for the release of a further draft, and the opportunity for public submission on that draft. Officials should be instructed to consult on the changes to the legislative detail to ensure that the legislation is free from anomalies, omissions and errors. Comment This bill has followed normal Parliamentary practice, which requires that Parliament refer draft legislation to a sub-committee for detailed consideration and report-back with recommendations for change. There does not seem to be a special case for departing from this normal practice. The Finance and Expenditure Committee has given officials permission to consult with submitters. This is designed to ensure that, where concerns have been raised in relation to the legislative drafting, these concerns are able to be reflected to the Committee for consideration. Officials have consulted extensively with submitters on a number of issues, including concerns regarding the drafting. Recommendation The submission be noted. 10 Issue: Purpose provision in section HL 1 Submission (578 – NZICA) Section HL 1 would benefit from a purpose provision as an aid to interpretation. This section would also benefit from the use of flow charts to show the linkages in the rules and how income, losses and tax credits flow through the PIE. Section HL 1(2) should be omitted as it repeats what is in section HL 12. It should be replaced with a flow-chart. Section HL 1(3) should be clarified. Section HL 1(4)(a) should refer to section CP 1 so that there is a clear link to income, and section HL 1(4)(b) should refer to section DB 43 (deductions). The rules for determining class income, class losses and credits should be set out diagrammatically in a flow-chart or similar aid. Comment Section HL 1 has been redrafted and should now meet the concerns raised in submissions. Re-drafted section HL 1 should provide a useful roadmap to the PIE tax rules. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: General legislative framework Submission (598 – Trustees Executors) Anti-avoidance measures should be removed from the substantive provisions that have general application and be limited to transactions that have the intention and effect of avoiding tax. Comment It is preferable from a certainty perspective to have objective rules to counter avoidance concerns rather than subjective rules based on the intention of avoiding tax. Examples of such objective rules include those to prevent PIEs converting taxable income (for example, dividends from New Zealand and Australian companies) to non-taxable amounts (under the PIE trading exemption on Australasian shares). This approach should reduce taxpayer compliance costs, uncertainty and administrative costs. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 11 IMPLICATIONS OF PIE TAX RULES FOR DIRECT SAVERS Submission (578 – NZICA) Direct savers should be allowed to designate some or all of their portfolio as a PIE. This would provide direct savers with similar protection on their New Zealand and Australian share gains as is afforded to a PIE. The current PIE tax rules introduce a bias in favour of investment in New Zealand and Australian shares via a PIE rather than directly. This is because a direct investor can be subject to revenue account treatment (that is, be taxable on realised share gains). Comment The PIE tax rules aim to put investors in New Zealand managed funds (that elect to be PIEs) on a similar footing to direct investors. At present, direct investors are more able to achieve capital account treatment for their share investments than institutional investors. Therefore, there is no need to provide a separate exemption for direct investors. Doing so would also result in certain types of labour income – trading in shares – not being taxable. This could create an incentive for individuals to substitute away from (taxed) employment to trading in shares (un-taxed). The case law in this area has resulted in managed funds typically applying revenue account treatment (unless they have a ruling from Inland Revenue that they are a passive index tracker). This is to maintain equity between current and future investors if Inland Revenue challenges a capital account election on a particular investment, made today, at some future date. This conservatism amongst trustees of managed funds has resulted in the need to provide certainty to managed funds that their New Zealand and Australian share investments made on behalf of investors, the vast majority of whom would be on capital account, would not be subject to tax on capital gains. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 12 GENERAL ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS Clause 85 Issue: Commissioner discretion Submissions (597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 592 – Tower, 582 – National Provident Fund, 567 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting, 925W – ASFONZ) Inland Revenue should have the discretion to allow an entity that does not meet one or more of the PIE eligibility requirements to elect into the regime if the Commissioner is satisfied that the entity is of a type that from a policy perspective should be treated as a PIE. There needs to be discretion for the Commissioner to grant dispensation from the eligibility requirements contained in section HL 6. Comment Officials consider that such a discretion for the Commissioner would be inconsistent with self-assessment. It is also preferable that the PIE eligibility criteria are objective in nature rather than dependent on the exercise of an official discretion (which could give rise to challenges). Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Generic eligibility criteria (including “safe harbour” approaches) Submissions (578 – NZICA, 593 – Westpac NZ/BT Funds Management NZ, 556 – AMP, 12a – NZ Funds, 569 & 608 – ING, 597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 596 – ISI, 589 – KPMG, 588 – Trustee Corporation Association of NZ, 598 – Trustees Executors, 586 – Promina Group Ltd, 585 – NZX, 568 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 577 & 577a – ASB Group, 1221 – Ernst & Young) A PIE should be a vehicle that: • is principally an investor in savings and investment instruments; • is either a portfolio or non-portfolio investor; • is widely held; • not able to be controlled by any group of investors (unless when starting up or winding down); 13 • has a prospectus on issue or is listed on the main board of the New Zealand Exchange; • has an entity responsible for its management (except for qualifying listed companies); and • is a wholesale fund or subsidiary of a PIE if it is reasonably regarded as a vehicle for investment by a PIE. An entity that is or has been offered to the public under the Securities Act 1978 should be able to elect to be a PIE without the need to comply with: • the independent management requirement (if this is retained); • the entity history requirement; • the investor class requirement; • the investor size requirement; and • the investor interest repurchase requirement. A “safe harbour” should be introduced for fund managers by changing the criteria so that the PIE must: • be a public issuer for the purposes of the Securities Act; • have established principally for the purposes of investment and savings; • be widely held (20 or more investors); and • have fewer than 20 investors where available for widely held investments (such as start up funds). or • have investors that meet the above rules. Publicly listed entities and unlisted entities that issue a prospectus in relation to equity interests in the entity should be deemed to meet the investment size requirement under the investor test. PIE eligibility could be based on the “qualifying unit trust” definition (modified for entities that are not unit trusts). Entities that meet the “qualifying unit trust” definition should be treated as satisfying the investor eligibility requirements (that is, a safe harbour). If this is not accepted (for example, if there is a concern a PIE could be used as a means of replacing or substituting for direct investment), there could be tiered eligibility requirements depending on whether the fund is widely held or not. Alternatively, there could be a safe harbour for widely held vehicles. The ongoing costs of monitoring and compliance with the eligibility criteria are contrary to the government’s aim of low cost intermediary services. PIE definitional requirements should be extended to include property entities and cater for the unique investment characteristics surrounding property investment. 14 Comment The PIE eligibility criteria are designed to distinguish genuine savings and investment vehicles from other entities. This distinction is important as PIEs will not generally be taxable on their realised New Zealand and Australian share gains. Among these requirements is that investors in the PIE are portfolio investors (the investor requirements) and the PIE itself is a portfolio investor in companies it invests into (the investment size requirements). It is also important that the PIE has the majority of its assets employed in deriving what is typically known as passive income (such as income from trading shares, dividends, land and rents). These criteria are broadly designed to replicate the situation of the vast majority of individuals who invest directly (the alternative to investing via a managed fund). If these tests were not present, then direct investors who are share traders would be able to manipulate the PIE rules to gain the advantages of being a PIE, while maintaining control of their trading activities. This would not be desirable for reasons explained earlier. Submissions have commented that instead of the preceding bright-line tests, a more appropriate qualification requirement is to require an eligible entity to be an issuer of securities to the public under the Securities Act or an entity that is a qualifying unit trust. A “qualifying unit trust” is a defined term in the Income Tax Act and, broadly, describes a widely held investment vehicle. In the bill, as introduced, a PIE can have investors that are themselves PIEs or entities that qualify as a foreign investment vehicle (under the definition in the bill) without breaching the investor requirements. These investors can currently hold up to 100% of a PIE, and a PIE does not need 20 other investors if it has either a PIE or a foreign investment vehicle as an investor. Officials are recommending a number of amendments to further simplify the investor requirements. We agree with submissions that entities that meet the “qualifying unit trust” definition in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 should be safe harboured from the investor requirements. We consider this safe harbour should be available to entities that meet paragraphs (a), (c) to (e) of the qualifying unit trust definition or that would meet the definition if the entity were it a unit trust. We do not consider that entities that meet paragraph (b) of the definition – which largely describes wholesale managed funds – should be included in the safe harbour, as officials consider that the investor requirements for wholesale funds can be adequately dealt with under the amendments being proposed below. We also consider that amendments are needed to accommodate the National Provident Fund and Government Superannuation Fund (if these entities elect to become PIEs). We understand that these entities would meet the “qualifying unit trust” definition if not for the requirement to offer securities to the public. As these funds are widely held entities (and are operated under statute), we do not see any concerns in relation to providing the safe harbour from the investor tests under the PIE rules to these entities. We consider that entities that would meet the PIE eligibility criteria but do not elect to be PIEs should be allowed to hold up to 100% of a PIE without the PIE breaching its PIE status. Similarly, life insurance companies (which are not eligible to become PIEs under the rules as currently drafted) should also be allowed to hold up to 100% of a PIE. We also understand that the New Zealand Superannuation Fund and funds operated by the Earthquake Commission and the ACC can hold large interests in other investment vehicles. These investors have similar characteristics to other collective vehicles and should be allowed to hold up to 100% of a PIE. 15 If a PIE has one or more of these types of investors, the 20 investor test would not need to be met. The amendments above should mean that a wholesale managed fund would be able to have, as investors, other funds that are PIEs, entities eligible to be PIEs but which do not elect to be, life insurance companies, foreign investment vehicles, and certain specified funds (such as the New Zealand Superannuation Fund) without breaching the investor requirements. Further, investors other than those listed above should be allowed to hold up to 20% of a PIE (the current limit in the bill is 10%). Officials understand that this should assist the majority of listed investment entities, such as listed property funds and listed investment companies, that wish to become PIEs to comply with the investor size requirement. We understand that shareholders in a listed company cannot generally increase their holding to 20% or more of the voting rights without triggering certain provisions of the Takeovers Code. This should provide a signal to prospective PIEs that are listed entities that a breach of the investor size requirement is imminent. Officials are also aware of certain listed entities, who have legacy investors holding more than 20% of the entity (and therefore would breach the investor size requirement). We consider that there is scope for grandfathering such legacy investments, to the extent that such investors hold 40% or less of the PIE. This would mean that a listed PIE would be able to have legacy investors, who held an interest in the PIE of greater than 20% without breaching the investor interest size requirement. Rules would be needed to ensure that the entity does not retain PIE status if these legacy investors increase their interests to interests greater than 40%. We do not consider that being a qualifying unit trust or an issuer of securities to the public should be the sole criteria for being a PIE, as there are a number of additional criteria (such as the investment requirements and investment-type requirements) which are necessary to distinguish genuine savings and investment vehicles from other entities. In particular, the investment size requirement (which requires a PIE to hold not more than 20% of an underlying company) is important in re-enforcing the portfolio investor concept as there is no such requirement under the qualifying unit trust definition. Officials consider that monitoring of compliance with the PIE eligibility criteria – required quarterly – would be no different from compliance with existing tax rules (such as the qualifying unit trust definition). Recommendation That submissions recommending a generic eligibility criteria (that is, automatic qualification for certain entities) be declined. However, officials recommend a number of amendments to make compliance with the investor requirements: • Entities that meet paragraphs (a), (c) to (e) of the “qualifying unit trust” definition in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 should not be required to separately meet the investor requirements under the proposed PIE definition (known as the “investor requirement safe harbour”). • Allowing the National Provident Fund and Government Superannuation Fund, also to get the benefit of the safe harbour in relation to the investor requirements. 16 • Allowing entities that are eligible to be PIEs but do not elect to be and life insurance companies to hold up to 100% of a PIE without the PIE breaching its PIE status. (This should address the concerns raised in relation to wholesale funds.) • Allowing the New Zealand Superannuation Fund and funds operated by the Earthquake Commission and ACC to hold up to 100% of a PIE without the PIE breaching its PIE status. • Allowing investors in a PIE generally to hold up to 20% of the PIE, with rules to accommodate legacy investors holding interests greater than 20%. (This should address the concerns raised in relation to listed entities.) Issue: Locating eligibility requirements in a single section Submission (578 – NZICA) The eligibility requirements for entities to be a PIE (new sections HL 5 and 6) should be in one section. Comment The reasons for the eligibility requirements being contained in two sections is that the temporary breach rules apply only to the requirements in the second provision (section HL 6 – for example, the investor and investment tests) and not to the requirements in the first provision (HL 5 – for example, the requirement for a PIE to be a New Zealand resident). The requirements in the first provision are of a strict liability nature. Therefore, there is a reason for the eligibility requirements to be a PIE being in separate sections of the Act. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 17 Issue: Relationship between investor and investment requirements Submissions (578 – NZICA, 589 – KPMG, 551 – Macquarie Goodman, 590 – Property Council, 582 – National Provident Fund, 552 – Kiwi Income Property Trust, 577 & 577a – ASB Group) The circularity in the investor and investment requirements in sections HL 6(4), HL 6(6) and HL 6(7) should be corrected. Alternatively, if a property fund meets the eligibility requirements of section HL 5 and HL 6, other than subsections (6) and (7) of HL 6, it should be deemed to meet the investment value requirement in section HL 6(7) in certain group situations – for example, if its wholly owned subsidiaries meet the definition of a wholly owned group in the Income Tax Act 2004 and 90% or more of the assets of each of the subsidiaries are land. Comment Officials do not agree that the provisions in section HL 6 of the bill are circular. In any event, the re-drafting and reordering of this provision should substantially address the concerns raised. Amendments are recommended to allow land PIEs to hold interests of greater than 20% in land or in companies whose assets are 90% or more in land. Recommendation That the first submission be declined. It be noted that amendments are recommended to address the concerns raised in the second submission. Issue: Inclusion of wrap accounts in PIE rules Submission (997W – Grosvenor Financial Group) The definition of what constitutes a PIE should be widened to include individually managed accounts (IMAs). The current bill promotes managed funds at the expense of IMAs. The bill risks stagnation in the New Zealand investment climate whilst the rest of the world adopts more efficient vehicles. Comment The aim of the PIE tax rules is to put investors in managed funds on broadly the same tax footing as direct investors. Our understanding is that individuals investing via IMAs are currently able to structure their investments to get the benefit of the exclusion from tax for Australasian share gains. Therefore, we do not consider that investors in IMAs should get a safe harbour from tax for their Australasian share gains. If such an exemption were provided, individual share traders would be able to use IMAs to mitigate the tax on trading gains on New Zealand and Australian shares, which would 18 be undesirable from a policy perspective, for reasons outlined earlier. It would be possible for IMAs to become PIEs if they meet the relevant eligibility criteria. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Australian unit trusts should be allowed in the PIE regime Submission (614W – Plan B Financial Services Limited) An Australian unit trust, while meeting every other criteria, will fail the New Zealand tax residency requirement and therefore cannot elect into the regime. An Australian unit trust should be able to elect into the PIE regime, when it could be subject to the requirement that it has a New Zealand representative who would be liable for the obligations of the Australian unit trust. Comment The PIE tax rules have been designed for New Zealand-resident managed funds as a New Zealand resident investor has the choice to invest directly or via such a vehicle. As noted in response to an earlier submission, investment through New Zealand managed funds is currently tax disadvantaged relative to investing directly (including in an Australian unit trust). The PIE tax rules aim to correct these anomalies. Furthermore, an Australian unit trust would be subject to the Australian tax rules and would therefore be outside New Zealand’s taxing jurisdiction. It is therefore unclear how New Zealand’s tax rules could apply to tax the underlying income of an Australian unit trust. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 19 INCOME INTEREST REQUIREMENT Clause 85 Issue: Category B GIFs Submission (597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Certain trusts, including category B GIFs, should be excluded from the income interest requirement in section HL 5(3). Comment Officials understand that group investment funds deriving category B income are typically trusts administering the estates of deceased taxpayers. These trusts can allocate income to certain beneficiaries and capital to other beneficiaries. Officials are satisfied that group investment funds deriving category B income are genuine commercial arrangements and should therefore be eligible to become PIEs. We therefore consider that the income interest requirement in the PIE tax rules should not apply to group investment funds that derive only category B income. Providing this exclusion to other trusts could undermine the intent of the PIE rules. Recommendation That group investment funds deriving category B income be exempt from the income interest requirement. 20 INVESTOR REQUIREMENTS Clause 85 Issue: Investor class requirement Submissions (594 – New Zealand Law Society, 552 – Kiwi Income Property Trust, 479W – Walker Capital Management, 613W – Phillips Fox, 567 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting, 925W – ASFONZ, 618W – The Retire Fund, 674W – Waterfront Industry Superannuation Fund) Listed entities should automatically meet the investor class requirement in section HL 6(2). Bona fide investment management firms, where more than 90% of the firm’s total funds under management are from third party sources, should be exempt from the investor class requirement in HL 6(2). There should be no minimum number of investors in an investor class. The investor class requirement may be problematic for schemes offering investment choice facilities if each investment choice is considered to be a separate portfolio investor class and fewer than 20 members use a particular option. The investor class requirement should not preclude schemes offering investment choice, and the bill should be clearly worded accordingly. Comment The PIE investor class requirements recognise that managed funds may have different investment options (investor classes), such as conservative, balanced and growth portfolios, within the same fund. The investor class requirement is designed to ensure that for each investor class offered by a PIE, there are a minimum number of investors (20). This is important as otherwise an investor class could be set up that has only one investor, who owns 100% of the underlying investments in the class (but less than 20% of the PIE) and is able to effectively control the investment decisions of that particular investor class. We therefore do not agree that the investor class requirement should be removed from the PIE tax rules. However, as noted earlier, officials are recommending that entities which meet paragraphs (a), (c) to (e) of the qualifying unit trust definition in the Income Tax Act 2004 (or would meet the definition if they were a unit trust) would not need to meet the investor class requirement. The 20 investor requirement would not need to be met if the PIE has at least one investor that is: • another PIE; • a foreign investment vehicle (as defined in the rules); • an entity that would meet the PIE eligibility rules, but does not elect to be a PIE; 21 • a life insurance company; or • the New Zealand Superannuation Fund, the Earthquake Commission or ACC. Officials also agree that an exception to the investor class requirement for 20 or more investors is justified in certain circumstances, such as when a boutique investment option is on offer and fewer than 20 investors take it up. The requirements for this exception should be as follows: • The PIE entity has another class with at least 20 members. • No investor, other than the fund’s manager or trustee, in a class with fewer than 20 members can control the investment decisions relating to that class. • Less than 10% of the PIE’s total assets belong to all classes of the PIE with fewer than 20 members. The definition of “portfolio investor class” in the bill effectively requires each investor in the class to have an interest in the investments of that class, in the same proportion to the other investors in that class. Officials understand that when new investors enter a class, the interests of the new investors in the assets of the class may not match those of existing investors (as the entity would need time to purchase more of the underlying investments). The legislation therefore needs to provide a tolerance for new investors in a class to temporarily have interests in the investments of that class that differ in proportion from the interests held by existing investors. In our view, new investors should be able to have interests in the investments of the class that are different in proportion to those of existing investors for up to five days, from entry. We also consider that investors should generally be able to have interests in the underlying investments that are different in proportion from those of other investors, if this difference is largely immaterial (if the interest in the underlying assets differs by less than 5%). This recognises that, owing to normal commercial arrangements, it is unlikely that an investor in a class will have an interest in the investments of that class that is, at all times, in the exact proportion as the other investors in that class. Recommendation That submissions recommending the investor class requirement be removed be declined. Exceptions to the 20 member investor class requirement, consistent with officials’ comments above, should be available in certain circumstances. We also recommend that the PIE tax legislation provide tolerance for new investors in a class to have interests in the investments of that class that differ in proportion from the interests held by existing investors. 22 Issue: Measuring compliance with investor test Submission (578 – NZICA) The investor tests in section HL 6(4) should be measured quarterly. Comment Officials consider that the draft legislation already requires compliance with the investor tests in HL 6(4) on a quarterly basis. A further amendment is therefore not required. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Associated investors Submissions (597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 595 – AXA, 556 – AMP, 567 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting) Widely held retail funds should not be required to determine whether their investors are associated. The 20 person requirement should be amended to refer to 20 natural persons ultimately holding units. Comment We consider that associated investors should be taken into account for the purposes of the 20 investor requirements as otherwise it could be possible for a group of associated investors to effectively control a PIE. However, we consider that PIEs should be required for the purposes of the association rule to take into account only investors who hold more than 5% of the PIE. This would mean that PIEs should not have to incur the compliance cost of establishing association between investors who have very small holdings. Also, the proposal to safe harbour entities that meet paragraphs (a), (c) to (e) of the qualifying unit trust definition from the investor requirements (including the associated investor requirements), or that would meet the definition if they were a unit trust, should mean that a majority of investment vehicles would not need to be concerned with this requirement. We do not consider that the 20-investor requirement under the investor test should refer to natural persons only, as associated entities such as trusts and companies may be used to gain control of the underlying investments of a PIE. The submission’s main concern is in relation to entity investors in a wholesale fund (of which there may be fewer than 20). As noted in response to earlier submissions, there would be an exception from the 20 investor requirement if the investors in a PIE are, for example, another PIE, an entity that could be a PIE (but does not elect to be one), a foreign 23 investment vehicle or a life insurance company. This should address the concerns raised in the submission. Recommendation That the first submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments – PIEs should not have to take into account associated investors who hold less than 5% of a PIE. The second submission should be declined (and it should be noted that the concerns expressed in the submission will be addressed under the general exceptions to the 20 investor test). Issue: PIE status for wholesale funds Submissions (597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 556 – AMP, 557 – AllianceBernstein) Wholesale funds should be able to “look through” certain entities to determine whether the investor criteria are met. Comment We agree with the key principle underlying these submissions. In response to previous submissions, we have supported allowing the following widely held entities to hold up to 100% of a PIE (including wholesale PIEs): • other PIEs; • foreign investment vehicles (as defined in the draft legislation); • a vehicle that is eligible to be a PIE but does not elect to be one; • life insurance companies; and • the New Zealand Superannuation Fund and funds operated by the Earthquake Commission and the Accident Compensation Commission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted consistent with officials’ comments. 24 Issue: Investor size requirement Submissions (12a – NZ Funds, 578 – NZICA, 569 – ING, 588 – Trustee Corporation Association of NZ, 592 – Tower, 579 – Macquarie New Zealand Limited, 594 – New Zealand Law Society, 595 – AXA, 590 – Property Council, 582 – National Provident Fund, 585 – NZX, 584 – Smartshares Limited, 552 – Kiwi Income Property Trust, 595 – Brook Asset Management, 574 & 574a – Staples Rodway, 577 & 577a – ASB Group, 1167 – New Zealand Investment Trust, 1221 – Ernst & Young, 479W – Walker Capital Management, 608 – ING Property Trust, 613W – Phillips Fox, 734W – Todd Corporation) The investor interest size requirement is too low and should be increased to 20%. PIEs that are listed on the New Zealand stock exchange should have the investor interest size requirement increased to 20%. Non-resident life insurers should be allowed to hold up to 20% of a PIE. The maximum total percentage an investor can hold of a PIE should be increased to 25%. Section 32D of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which requires a unit holder of a qualifying unit trust to provide the trustee with a statement of the persons associated with the unit holder, should be extended to cover the associated persons information necessary to comply with section HL 6(4). Qualifying unit trusts, group investment funds, New Zealand-resident life insurers, superannuation funds and PIEs should be allowed to hold up to 100% of a PIE. Other investors or associated investors should be allowed to hold up to 25% of a PIE. The associated persons criteria should not apply to investors in a widely held vehicle. Investors other than PIEs should be able to hold up to 49% in a portfolio investor class, provided the investment vehicle either has one or more PIE investors or 20 or more non-associated investors. There should be no limit on the size of investments in PIEs. For publicly listed entities there should be no investor interest size requirement as such entities will necessarily be widely held. One submission does not necessarily agree that to be a PIE the investors in it must be, in effect, portfolio investors. It comments that, given that many people do not discuss their business/investments with anyone other than their spouse, the inclusion of the associated persons requirement seems unworkable. Bona fide investment management firms, where more than 90% of the firm’s total funds under management are from third party sources, should be exempt from the investor size requirement in section HL 6(4). The investor size requirement should be amended to exclude entities which are eligible to be a PIE but have not elected to be one. Guidelines should be developed to measure an investor’s interest in a PIE. 25 Comment The investor size requirement (along with the investor class requirement) is designed to ensure that no single investor or an investor combined with associated parties can control the underlying investments of a PIE. These two tests are meant to reflect the fact that investors in PIEs should be portfolio investors. We therefore do not agree with removing this requirement altogether, as some submissions have suggested. As noted in response to an earlier submission, officials are recommending that a number of entities investing in PIEs be safe harboured from the investor requirements (both the investor class and size requirements) under the PIE tax rules. These include other PIEs and foreign investment vehicles, as wells as entities that are eligible to be PIEs but do not elect to be PIEs, life insurance companies and the New Zealand Superannuation Fund, EQC and ACC. These entities will not need to meet the investor size requirement when investing in a PIE. Entities that meet paragraphs (a), (c) to (e) of the qualifying unit trust definition would also not need to worry about the investor requirements (with respect to entities investing in them). For investors other than those covered by the proposed exceptions, we have recommended that the investor size threshold be raised from 10% to 20%. Officials consider that the suggestion to have a provision similar to section 32D of the Tax Administration Act is unnecessary given the proposed changes to the associated persons tests for PIEs (meaning the association rule should only take into account investors who hold 5% or more) and the proposed safe harbour for entities meeting paragraphs (a), (c) to (e) of the qualifying unit trust definition. In terms of measuring an investor’s interest in a PIE, this should be calculated with reference to the ownership of the underlying assets held (in the case of an entity such as a unit trust or superannuation fund that elects to become a PIE). In the case of a listed entity that elects to be a PIE, the investor size requirement would be calculated in relation to the investor’s shareholding. Recommendation That the submissions recommending that the investor size requirement be removed be declined. It should be noted, however, that, in response to earlier submissions, officials have recommended that a number of widely held entities be allowed to hold up to 100% of a PIE and that other investors be allowed to hold up to 20% (versus the 10% currently in the bill). The submissions recommending that section 32D of the Tax Administration Act apply for the purposes of determining association should also be declined. 26 Issue: Collective investment vehicles investing into PIEs Submissions (567 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting, 881 & 1138 – Perpetual Trust Limited) An exemption should be included to allow small collective vehicles to invest into a widely held PIE. This exemption would need to be similar to section HL 6(4), which allows a PIE to invest into another PIE. There should be no restrictions on PIEs, unit trusts, group investment funds, or other CIVs investing in each other. The ability to invest on a wholesale basis gives managers efficiency options and aids diversification, while limiting this ability serves no purpose. Comment We consider that the proposed exemptions from the investor size requirements for a number of widely held entities (such as entities that are eligible to be PIEs but don’t elect to do so) and increasing the investor size requirement for other investors to 20% should largely address the concerns raised. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Allowing New Zealand Superannuation Fund, EQC, and ACC to invest into a PIE Submission (Matter raised by officials) Under the current bill a large investment into a PIE by the New Zealand Superannuation Fund, the Earthquake Commission or the Accident Compensation Commission could result in a loss of PIE status. This should not be the case. Comment Officials consider that an exception to the investor interest size requirement in section HL 6(4) as currently drafted should be made to allow the New Zealand Superannuation Fund, ACC, or EQC to make an investment of any size into a PIE without jeopardising that PIE’s status. This is because these investors share certain characteristics with collective investment vehicles which will also be allowed to make investments of any size in a PIE. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 27 Issue: Employer sponsored super schemes investing into a PIE Submission (567 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting) Employer-sponsored registered superannuation schemes should be permitted to invest into an Australasian shares PIE with a portfolio investor rate of 33% to obtain the PIE treatment for capital gains on such holdings, but to otherwise continue to operate as at present and without the need to apply look-through. Comment Simpler PIE tax rules are being recommended for superannuation funds (which should address many of the compliance cost concerns of being a PIE). Further, under the proposed safe harbour from the investor requirements, superannuation schemes that are eligible to be PIEs but do not elect to be a PIE can hold up to 100% of another PIE. This should allow these schemes to invest in a PIE and get the benefit of the exclusion from tax for Australasian share gains, without having to be a PIE themselves. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 28 INVESTMENT REQUIREMENTS Clause 85 Issue: Investment value requirement Submissions (597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 12a – NZ Funds, 578 – NZICA, 569 & 608 – ING, 589 – KPMG, 594 – New Zealand Law Society, 595 – AXA, 679W – Goldman Sachs JBWere, 613W – Phillips Fox, 734W – Todd Corporation) The investment value requirement should apply only in relation to equity investments in companies and should be measured in terms of the PIE’s voting interest in the underlying company. These requirements should not apply to debt investments or investments in land. “Value” in section HL 6(6)(b) should be defined to mean “fair value” as adopted for accounting purposes. The way the investment size test is expressed, by reference to the “value of the entity’s assets”, is ambiguous. The commentary to the bill indicates that this is an “ownership interest” (equity) and, if that is the case, then the fact it refers to equity interests (and does not apply to investments in debt securities) should be clarified in the legislation. The investment value requirement should be removed or relaxed for PIEs that qualify under the proposed “safe harbour” or as long as the PIE does not exert control over the investment. A single investment must not exceed 49% of the PIE’s total assets. The investment value requirement should be amended to allow a PIE to hold all of the shares in a New Zealand resident single asset company and still qualify for PIE treatment even if the special purpose company makes up more than 10% of the total portfolio. It appears more appropriate that the proposed 10% maximum investment size requirement, to the extent to which one asset can dominate a portfolio, should be increased to 25%. Comment Officials agree that the investment value requirement should apply only to equity held in a company (that is, a PIE would be allowed to hold up to 100% of non-equity investments such as debt or land). Our understanding is that property funds, for example, typically hold greater than 20% interests in land and buildings, either directly or through a holding company (defined as a company whose assets are 90% or more and, in substance, in the form of land). We consider that this should continue to be allowed under the PIE rules, as the tax status of property investments (unlike Australasian equities) would not change. 29 We also agree that investment value requirement should be measured by reference to the percentage of the total voting interests in the company held by a PIE. Officials do not agree that the references in section HL 6(6)(b) should be to “fair value” as the Income Tax Act 2004 does not employ this concept. We agree with submissions recommending that the investment size requirement should be raised to 20% for investments in companies, without the need for a PIE to offer a facility for investors to redeem their interest in the PIE at an estimated market value. We understand that such a “buy-back” requirement is of significant concern to listed entities who currently do not offer such a mechanism (the investment can only be redeemed in a secondary market) as well as superannuation schemes. Removing the “buy-back” requirement and raising the investment size threshold from 10% to 20% (the level at which the Takeovers Code generally applies) should address many of the concerns raised. Officials do not consider that the investment size requirement should be abandoned altogether for equity investments, as suggested in some submissions. Along with the investor requirements, the investment size requirement is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the PIE tax rules are available only to genuine widely held investment vehicles. These vehicles should be portfolio investors, which the maximum investment size requirement of 20% for interests in companies would achieve. Recommendation That the submissions recommending that the investment size requirement only be applied to equity held in a company and be measured by reference to the percentage of the total voting interests in the company held by a PIE be accepted. We also recommend that the investment size requirement be raised to 20% (from 10%) without the need to offer a buy-back mechanism to investors. Issue: Buy back requirement Submissions (12a – NZ Funds, 578 – NZICA, 569 – ING, 589 – KPMG, 588 – Trustee Corporation Association of NZ, 551 – Macquarie Goodman, 599 – Kingfish Limited, 600 – Fisher Funds Management Limited, 590 – Property Council, 552 – Kiwi Income Property Trust, 577 & 577a – ASB Group, 608 – ING Property Trust, 674W – Waterfront Industry Superannuation Fund) The investor repurchase requirement for PIEs should be removed or a safe harbour from this requirement should be implemented for unit trusts, superannuation schemes, GIFs, listed property trusts and life insurance companies. Comment As noted in response to the previous submission, officials agree with submissions to remove the investor repurchase requirement for PIEs, as it would not be possible for superannuation funds (including those offering KiwiSaver) and listed entities to meet this requirement. Officials consider that the other eligibility criteria are sufficient to ensure that only genuine collective investment vehicles are able to qualify as PIEs. 30 Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Type of investments Submissions (597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 12a – NZ Funds, 578 – NZICA, 569 & 608 – ING, 567 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting, 577 & 577a – ASB Group) An investment in a life insurance policy should be added to the list of eligible investments in section HL 6(5)(b). It is not appropriate to adopt a detailed list approach for the allowable investments for a PIE. Instead the list of eligible investments should provide that 90% or more of a PIE’s assets should comprise: • an interest in land; • a financial arrangement or excepted financial arrangement; • rights or options relating to land, financial arrangements and excepted financial arrangements; and • any derivative investment approved by the International Swap Dealers Association. The list of things that an entity can invest into in section HL 6(5) should be able to be updated and amended, perhaps through Order in Council. Life insurance, securitisations, and finance leases and derivatives based on commodity prices are four further investment products that should be on the list in section HL 6(5). An indirect investment in land should come within the scope of the investment-type requirement. Consideration should be given to how deferred tax assets fit within the financial arrangement rules. As it stands, an entity with a significant deferred tax asset could be precluded from satisfying the PIE rules. Comment Officials agree that the investment-type requirement under the PIE tax rules is too prescriptive. We consider that the list of eligible investments for PIEs should encompass investments in land, financial arrangements and excepted financial arrangements, rather than attempting to provide an exhaustive list. Both financial arrangements and excepted financial arrangements are currently defined terms. 31 We also consider that a requirement that at least 90% of the taxable income derived by a PIE be from investments in land (rents only), financial arrangements (such as interest), excepted financial arrangements (such as dividends from New Zealand companies) and foreign investment fund income (under the fair dividend rate) should be included in the eligibility criteria. Together with the investment-type requirement, this “income-type” requirement is designed to ensure that PIEs are set up primarily for the purpose of investment and savings. Recommendation That the current prescriptive list of eligible investments (under the investment-type requirement in the PIE tax rules) be replaced with a requirement that at least 90% of the PIEs assets are in land, financial arrangements or excepted financial arrangements. We further recommend that the investment-type test be further buttressed by a requirement that at least 90% of the taxable income derived by a PIE be rents from investments in land, income from financial arrangements, excepted financial arrangements and FIF income. Issue: Private equity funds electing to be PIEs Submission (593 – Westpac NZ/BT Funds Management NZ) A private equity fund with a fixed term should be able to elect to be a PIE without being restricted to having only 10% of its investments in 25% or greater interests in New Zealand companies, and without being required to offer to repurchase units. Comment Officials consider that the portfolio-into-portfolio concept of the PIE tax rules is important. Private equity does not typically fit into such a framework. Investors in private equity, typically take a controlling interest in the companies they invest into (often being involved in their management). The PIE tax rules are not specifically designed to apply in these cases (although PIE would be able to hold up to 100% of an underlying company if the total of all such investments does not exceed 10% of the total assets of the PIE). We do not consider that a special exception should be made for private equity funds to become PIEs where the fund takes ownership interests of greater than 20% in underlying companies (and these investments comprise more than 10% of the total value of the fund). Recommendation That the submission be declined. 32 FOREIGN INVESTMENT VEHICLE REQUIREMENTS Clause 85 Submissions (597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 596 – ISI, 12a – NZ Funds, 578 – NZICA, 569 – ING, 551 – Macquarie Goodman, 593 – Westpac NZ/BT Funds Management NZ, 590 – Property Council, 585 – NZX, 552 – Kiwi Income Property Trust, 914W – Dominion Funds Group, 608 – ING Property Trust) It is not realistic to require a PIE to determine whether a foreign entity which invests in it is a foreign investment vehicle. The definition of a foreign investment vehicle in the bill should therefore be relaxed. An option could be for the foreign investment vehicle requirement to be determined by reference to a simpler test which is in line with the present definition of “qualifying unit trust” in the Income Tax Act 2004. A foreign investment vehicle should not be required to comply with the investor interest size requirement (under the PIE rules) and should be allowed to have fewer than 20 investors, if the vehicle can be regarded as a vehicle for collective investment either directly or indirectly despite the lesser number of investors. The definition of foreign investment vehicle (as defined in section HL 6(10)) should be similar to NZICA’s proposed definition of a PIE. The following requirements should be removed from the foreign investment vehicle criteria: • the investor size requirement; • the investment-type requirement; • the investment value requirement; • the investor interest repurchase requirement; • the independent management requirement; • The investor interest adjustment requirement. The foreign investment vehicle definition should only impose the investor class requirement and the investment-type requirement. It would be appropriate to extend foreign PIE equivalents that are part of the investor class requirement to wholesale foreign PIE equivalents. Comment The foreign investor vehicle definition is designed to allow PIEs to hold up to 100% of a foreign investment vehicle and to describe foreign savings vehicles which can hold up to 100% of a PIE. As the PIE rules confer certain benefits to investors in PIEs, it is important that the ability to wholly own a PIE and for a PIE to hold 100% of another entity be restricted to genuine widely held savings vehicles. The mechanism for doing this, in the case of non-resident entities, is applying a subset of the PIE eligibility requirements to these foreign vehicles. 33 We recognise that some of the criteria may be difficult to apply as the PIE may not be able to source this information from the foreign vehicle. The information that a PIE may not be able to access will typically relate to other investors in the foreign vehicle. Therefore, for the purposes of the eligibility requirements to be a foreign investment vehicle, we consider that the investor size requirement should apply only to New Zealand resident investors in the foreign investment vehicle. That is, non-resident investors would be able to hold more than 20% of the foreign vehicle without breaching the foreign investment vehicle definition under the PIE rules. A PIE would be able hold any ownership interest in a foreign investment vehicle as long as no other New Zealand resident investor (for example, that is not a PIE, or an entity that would otherwise be allowed to hold 100% of a foreign investment vehicle) holds an ownership interest of 20% or greater. In the case of foreign investment in PIEs, we consider that a rule is necessary to ensure that the foreign entity is a widely held vehicle. That is, a single non-resident investor should not be able to hold 100% of a PIE and gain access to New Zealand and Australian share trading gains tax free (as they would not gain the safe harbour if they had invested directly in New Zealand companies). Also, in many cases these investors would hold less than 20% of the New Zealand PIE and therefore would not jeopardise the New Zealand entity’s PIE status. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. However, for the purposes of applying the investor size test to foreign investment vehicles, the investor size requirement should only apply in respect of New Zealand resident investors. 34 PIE INVESTMENTS IN PIES – QUALIFICATION CRITERIA Clause 85 Submissions (597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 588 – Trustee Corporation Association of NZ, 569 & 608 – ING Property Trust) The eligibility criteria need to be amended to allow a PIE to hold 100% of another PIE. The circularity in the PIE eligibility criteria in proposed section HL 6(2), (6) and (8) means this outcome is not achieved. Comment Officials consider that the legislation already allows a PIE to hold up to 100% of another PIE. Therefore, no further amendment is required. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 35 INDEPENDENT MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENT Clause 85 Submissions (597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 596 – ISI, 12a – NZ Funds, 578 – NZICA, 569 – ING, 589 – KPMG, 588 – Trustee Corporation Association of NZ,592 – Tower, 551 – Macquarie Goodman, 594 – New Zealand Law Society, 595 – AXA, 590 – Property Council, 586 – Promina Group Ltd, 585 – NZX, 552 – Kiwi Income Property Trust, 595 – Brook Asset Management, 556 – AMP, 557 – AllianceBernstein, 567 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting, 574 & 574a – Staples Rodway, 577 & 577a – ASB Group, 925W – ASFONZ, 1221 – Ernst & Young, 314 – Aspiring Asset Management, 479W – Walker Capital Management, 604W – Meat Industry Superannuation Scheme, 608 – ING Property Trust, 734W – Todd Corporation, 618W – The Retire Fund, 674W – Waterfront Industry Superannuation Fund, 1131 – David Patterson) The independent management requirement should be removed. If not, clarification is needed as to the applicable test for association in section HL 5(4). The independent management requirement should be amended to allow investors that also manage the PIE to hold a 20% interest in the PIE. The independent management requirement should be amended to accommodate common structures within the savings industry, including the fund manager or associates having an interest in the fund. The independent management requirements in HL 5(4) should be amended to include an exception for other investment vehicles where no underlying investor can influence investment decisions. Alternatively, a provision could be drafted that allowed investment decisions made under a delegated independent investment mandate, to be deemed to be operated under independent investment management. Often fund managers have a vested interest in their property fund. This should not preclude them from becoming a PIE. Comment Officials agree with submissions that the independent management requirement creates uncertainty as to what level of ownership interest in a PIE the fund manager can maintain. The current wording of this requirement has been interpreted as precluding any investment in the PIE by management; this was not intended. Officials also consider that the other PIE eligibility requirements (such as the investor and investment requirements) are sufficient to ensure that only genuine widely held investment vehicles can qualify as a PIE. As with any other general investment in a PIE, the manager / trustee would be able to hold up to a 20% interest. Recommendation That the submissions that the independent management requirement be removed from the PIE eligibility criteria be accepted. 36 BREACH OF PIE CRITERIA Clause 85 Issue: Inadvertent breaches Submission (596 – ISI) If an entity elects to be a PIE and sets up systems to meet the requirements discussed below, it should remain a PIE unless it elects out or winds up. The permanent loss of PIE status because of an inadvertent breach or a breach outside the control of a manager is unreasonable. Comment The PIE tax rules contain comprehensive temporary breach rules for PIEs. Under these comprehensive rules, PIEs would have up to six months to correct temporary breaches. It is also worth noting that the proposed safe harbour from the investor tests in the PIE tax rules for entities that meet paragraphs (a), (c) to (e) of the qualifying unit trust definition should also mean that qualifying unit trust status would need to be lost before this safe harbour is breached. Even if qualifying unit trust status is lost, the entity would still be able to rely on the temporary breach provisions in the PIE rules. Officials have earlier recommended a number of amendments to both the investor requirement (investor class and size requirements) and investment size requirements which should reduce the scope for breach of these criteria and therefore loss of PIE status. These include a number of exemptions from the investor requirements for certain widely held entities, and raising the investor size requirement and investment size requirement to 20%. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 37 Issue: Loss of PIE status on a prospective basis Submissions (597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 569 & 608 – ING, 593 – Westpac NZ/BT Funds Management NZ, 595 – AXA, 599 – Kingfish Limited, 600 – Fisher Funds Management Limited, 585 – NZX, 595 – Brook Asset Management, 1221 – Ernst & Young) If PIEs have to lose their PIE status, it should only be on a prospective basis. A PIE should lose its PIE status from the end of the next quarter (six months after the initial breach is notified) or the following 1 April. Where a breach occurs, a PIE should have two quarters from the earlier of when it is notified of the breach or should reasonably have known of the breach before triggering the loss of PIE status. Comment Officials agree with the principle of submissions that loss of PIE status should be prospective. We consider that PIE status should be lost if a PIE fails to meet the relevant eligibility criteria on the last day of two consecutive quarters (that is, a period of 6 months). PIE status would be lost from the start of the third quarter. Recommendation That submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Consequences of breach Submissions (596 – ISI, 597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 556 – AMP, 568 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 577 & 577a – ASB Group, 914W – Dominion Funds Group) If an investor’s investment in a PIE gives rise to a breach of the investor eligibility requirements for a PIE, the consequences of the breach should fall on the investor instead of the PIE losing its PIE status. This would likely involve Australasian equity gains and losses otherwise not taxable being taxable at the investor level. The investor who breached the threshold should become subject to a prescribed investor rate of 0% and become taxable at his or her own marginal rate. Comment We consider that imposing the consequences of a breach on the investor – whose share of Australasian share gains would no longer be excluded income – for exceeding the investor size requirement could lead to uncertainty over how PIE tax should be calculated for that investor. (For example, what if the breach is only temporary?) 38 Furthermore, the use of the provisions in the qualifying unit trust definition as a safe harbour from the investor tests (and increasing the PIE ownership threshold generally to 20%) should significantly reduce the likelihood of a PIE breaching the investor requirements. Therefore, the suggested change of imposing the consequences of breaching the investor tests, under the PIE tax rules, is unnecessary. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Deliberate breaches Submission (578 – NZICA) In addition to the temporary breach rules, a PIE should be given a reasonable opportunity to explain and correct a deliberate breach. If no action is taken by the PIE, the Commissioner should be given the power to revoke the PIE’s status. Comment Officials consider that there should be no genuine reason for entities to deliberately breach the PIE rules. Breaches that are outside the control of the PIE will be dealt with under the temporary breach rules. Therefore, the suggested change is unnecessary. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Removing temporary breach provisions Submission (578 – NZICA) The temporary breach provisions in section HL 6(9) should be removed. The appropriate place to deal with eligibility is at the entry stage. Unless there is a material change in circumstance, such as a change of residence or complete change in the nature of activity, then PIE status should be uninterrupted. Comment We do not consider that it is desirable for the eligibility criteria to be applied only when an entity first enters the PIE tax rules, as this would negate their usefulness if the entity is subsequently used to circumvent the policy intent of the PIE tax rules. With regard to the temporary breach rules in section HL 6(9), these rules allow entities to maintain their PIE status if breaches of certain eligibility requirements are 39 temporary (and result from factors outside the entity’s control) and are fixed within prescribed timeframes. In other words, this provision can only be of benefit to taxpayers and should therefore remain available. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Notification of compliance with PIE rules/breaches Submission (569 & 608 – ING, 599 – Kingfish Limited, 585 – NZX) PIEs should provide quarterly certificates to the Inland Revenue as to their status (whether they have breached or not). If a PIE breaches its status it will notify the Inland Revenue as part of its quarterly certificate and resolve the breach by the end of the following quarter. If it fails to resolve the breach, it will notify all investors that it will lose its PIE status within 60 days of notification by the Inland Revenue. Comment Officials consider that PIEs should not need to provide compliance certificates to Inland Revenue on a quarterly basis. Currently, entities that are qualifying unit trusts, for example, do not need to provide such certification unless they fail to meet the relevant criteria. We therefore consider that PIEs should be required to notify Inland Revenue only if they fail to meet the eligibility criteria (and in the case of temporary breaches, where the breach is not rectified within the prescribed timeframe). Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Length of temporary breach period Submissions (589 – KPMG, 593 – Westpac NZ/BT Funds Management NZ, 314 – Aspiring Asset Management) The allowed temporary breach period for new PIEs should be longer than six months. A two-year time frame would be more workable. The breach criteria, like existing qualifying unit trust criteria, should not be time bounded. 40 New investment funds can take time to gain traction as prospective investors wait for a track record to be established. Therefore the six-month grace period for PIEs to comply with eligibility requirements should be lengthened to 12 months to allow for new products to gain wide acceptance. Comment As noted earlier, the safe harbour from the investor tests for entities that meet the paragraphs (a), (c) to (e) of the qualifying unit trust definition and other proposed amendments to the investor size test means the likelihood of a PIE breaching these tests should be significantly reduced. Officials also consider that the current six- month period in the bill provides a sufficient grace period for any temporary breaches to be resolved. To have a period longer than this could provide opportunities for abuse of the PIE tax rules. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Clarification of factors within a PIE’s control Submission (594 – New Zealand Law Society) The reference in section HL 6(9)(b) to the entity’s failure being “due to factors within (its) control” is ambiguous. Comment The temporary breach rules under the PIE eligibility criteria are designed to apply where one or more of the relevant eligibility criteria (such as the investor size or investment size requirements) are not met, the breach is of a temporary nature, and the reason for the breach is outside the control of the entity. In relation to the breach being due to factors outside the PIE’s control, this is where the breach has not arisen owing to actions of the PIE. An example of this is where the 20 investor requirement is not met because a large number of investors exit the PIE (which may also result in the 20% investor size requirement being breached as remaining investors may hold more than 20% of the underlying assets). Similarly, the proposed investment size requirement of 20% could be breached for no fault of the manager, because the PIE’s holding in an underlying company increases as a result of other investors in the company exiting. The temporary breach rules are designed to provide adequate time to undertake remedial measures to ensure compliance with the relevant PIE eligibility criteria is restored. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 41 Issue: Application of grace period to foreign investment vehicles Submission (594 – New Zealand Law Society) Foreign investment vehicles should be given the benefit of the same grace periods as applied to a PIE in section HL 6(9). Comment Officials agree with the submission. Recommendation The submission be accepted. Issue: Consequences of loss of PIE status Submissions (584 – Smartshares Limited, 567 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting, 568 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 604W – Meat Industry Superannuation Scheme) A permanent breach of the PIE rules causing a PIE to lose its PIE status should not constitute a permanent exclusion from PIE status, particularly in view of the fact that entities will likely incur high compliance costs. Comment The restriction on entities re-entering the PIE tax rules post-breach is designed to prevent entities from manipulating the rules. If entities were allowed to deliberately breach the PIE tax rules with no consequences (that is, if they were able to re-enter the rules in the following year), these entities would effectively be able to pick the years in which they were PIEs, according to the relative tax benefits. This could create undesirable incentives for PIEs to deliberately breach the PIE rules when Australian and New Zealand share markets are making losses (as doing so would remove the safe harbour on Australasian share gains, allowing capital losses to be claimed as a deduction) and re-enter the rules when the market increased in value. Officials therefore consider that if a PIE deliberately breaches the PIE eligibility criteria, there should be no opportunity for it to become a PIE in future. It should be noted that PIEs would be able to voluntarily cease to be a PIE (by giving notice to the Commissioner). However, the entity would not be eligible to re-enter the PIE tax rules for a period of five years, to prevent gaming. It should also be noted that PIEs would have comprehensive temporary breach rules for factors outside their control (and the amendments proposed to safe harbour entities that meet certain provisions of the qualifying unit trust definition and to raise the investor size requirement should also reduce the risk of breach). 42 Recommendation That submissions be declined. Issue: Breach of portfolio-in requirements Submission (556 – AMP) The submission questions the need for there to be any adverse consequences from breaching the portfolio-in (investor class and size) requirements. Comment The rationale for the investor class (minimum of 20 investors) and size (no single investor holding more than 20% of a PIE) requirements is to ensure that no single investor in the PIE (or group of associated investors) can control the investment decisions of the PIE. Exceptions to the investor tests are proposed for investments by other PIEs and vehicles which can broadly be described as widely held (and not controlled by any single investor). As outlined earlier, the PIE tax rules are designed to apply to vehicles that are genuine widely held savings vehicles. Recommendation That it be noted that the PIE tax rules are designed to apply to genuine widely held savings vehicles. Such vehicles, by definition, have investors that hold portfolio interests in the vehicle and are themselves portfolio investors in the companies they invest into. 43 PIE ENTITY TAX OR FINAL WITHHOLDING TAX Clause 85 Issue: Replace PIE entity tax with a final withholding tax Submissions (596 – ISI, 569 & 608 – ING, 589 – KPMG, 588 – Trustee Corporation Association of NZ, 592 – Tower, 594 – New Zealand Law Society, 595 – AXA, 600 – Fisher Funds Management Limited, 567 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting, 577 & 577a – ASB Group) The bill should be amended to replace the PIE entity tax with a final withholding tax liability. A flow-through regime similar to the current designated group investment fund rules provides a better result for both the industry and officials. The PIE tax rules should be redrafted so that all investors are taxable on their share of PIE income; the PIE should withhold RWT from such income; and if desired PIE income could be excluded for social assistance calculation purposes. Comment The PIE entity tax approach has been adopted because it is considered to be the simplest approach, especially in relation to how the new rules interact with other provisions in the Act. We do not consider that an entity tax approach would result in a different tax outcome for investors (in relation to the application of their elected tax rates on portfolio investment entity income) than a withholding tax model. Recommendation That submissions be declined. Issue: Financial reporting Submissions (597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 596 – ISI, 578 – NZICA, 589 – KPMG, 588 – Trustee Corporation Association of NZ, 593 – Westpac NZ/BT Funds Management NZ, 582 – National Provident Fund, 556 – AMP, 577 & 577a – ASB Group) The legislation should be amended to provide that PIE tax is a tax paid by PIEs on behalf of investors. Financial reporting standards require a reporting entity to recognise as income tax any tax levied on the income of the entity. There remains a possibility that PIEs may have to show PIE tax in their financial statements. This would have implications for unit trusts, which would need to quote different unit prices, net of tax, for zero-rated, 19.5% and 33% investors. This would be impractical for these funds. 44 The PIE tax rules need to be re-written to better reflect that the tax liability is not the entity’s. (The entity only calculates and withholds the tax on behalf of investors.) Amendments should be made to the bill that deal with the situation where the outcome is not consistent with the principle of investor liability on attributed income and withholding tax, including a statement in the bill as to what is the substance of the regime and why it takes the entity-liability approach as a matter of form. Comment As noted above, the entity model for calculating PIE income tax has been adopted as it is considered the simplest method of taxing investors on their share of the PIE’s income at the correct rate while ensuring that this income does not affect investors’ other liabilities or entitlements. However, it is acknowledged that PIE income is, in economic substance, the investors’ income. Officials therefore agree that the PIE tax rules would benefit from a purpose provision in order to clarify that the tax levied on behalf of an investor at the PIE level is intended to resemble the tax that an investor would pay on the income if the investor had made the investment directly. A purpose provision of this nature should reduce the risk that entities would be required, for financial reporting purposes, to recognise as income tax any tax levied on the income of the PIE. Recommendation That those submissions requesting the inclusion in the PIE rules of a purpose provision relating to financial reporting be accepted. 45 ANNUAL ATTRIBUTION OPTION Clause 85 Submissions (597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 596 – ISI, 592 – Tower, 556 – AMP, 572 – New Zealand Fire Service Superannuation Scheme, 577 & 577a – ASB Group, 1142 – Carter Holt Harvey Employee Benefits Plan and Retirement Plan, 604W – Meat Industry Superannuation Scheme, 679W – Goldman Sachs JBWere Transtasman Unit Trust, 966 – New Zealand Harbours Superannuation Plan, 618W – The Retire Fund, 674W – Waterfront Industry Superannuation Fund, 569 & 608 – ING, 593 – Westpac NZ/BT Funds Management NZ, 586 – Promina Group Ltd) A PIE should have the option of attributing income to investors annually and be able to attribute income and account for tax on behalf of withdrawing investors quarterly. Comment The bill as currently drafted does not provide PIEs with the ability to attribute income to investors annually. The bill provides that PIEs must allocate income to investors at least quarterly and pay PIE tax on that income at least quarterly (or more often at the election of the PIE). The quarterly attribution and payment of tax ensures that tax receipts from PIEs are not deferred. The bill also provides that the PIE will be liable for tax on all the income that they earn during the quarter – even if an investor exits during the quarter. Officials recognise that this approach could result in significant investor equity issues for some PIEs. This is because the tax liability on the PIE income for the quarter – including the income that was attributed to exiting investors – would be borne by those investors that remained in the PIE at the end of the quarter. The only way PIEs could address this issue would be to approximate an amount of tax to withhold on exiting investors. Such an approximation would inevitably be inaccurate and would result in investor inequity. It is therefore recommended that PIEs have the ability to pay tax on income earned in a period at 0% for those investors that have exited the PIE during the quarter and within five days after the end of the quarter. Under this approach, the PIE would inform Inland Revenue of investors that had exited during the year and how much taxable income had been allocated to each exiting investor. The outstanding PIE tax liability would then be a matter for Inland Revenue to follow up with the investor concerned. Officials also consider that an annual attribution and payment of PIE tax should be permitted, provided that a fund accurately withholds tax when investors exit during the year. Under this approach, the fund would deduct an accurate amount of tax from the exiting investor’s proceeds and would return this to Inland Revenue in the month following the exit. While this would delay the tax receipts from those PIEs that adopted this approach, it would result in the most accurate and least administratively expensive method for collecting tax from PIEs. 46 Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part. That is, PIEs who calculate and pay PIE tax each quarter should be able to apply a 0% tax rate for investors who exit in a quarter. PIE should also be provided with the option of attributing and calculating PIE tax annually provided that they withhold tax accurately from investors exiting the PIE during the tax year and pay that tax to Inland Revenue in the month following the month in which the investor exists the PIE. 47 BASING PIE TAX ON PIE’S ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY Clause 85 Issue: Allocation of income to PIE investors Submissions (597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 596 – ISI, 12a – NZ Funds, 569 & 608 – ING, 589 – KPMG, 588 – Trustee Corporation Association of NZ, 592 – Tower, 594 – New Zealand Law Society, 598 – Trustees Executors, 582 – National Provident Fund, 556 – AMP, 577 & 577a – ASB Group, 925W – ASFONZ) PIEs should be able to use any attribution method that meets the overriding requirement that all taxable income is attributed and the attribution results in investors being allocated income that reflects their actual economic interest in the PIE. Inland Revenue should have the discretion to accept the methods adopted, subject to meeting these requirements. Clear guidance on the attribution methods that PIEs will be required or allowed to use should be made public as soon as possible as this information is fundamental to the design and development of systems required to undertake flow-through. The legislation should provide a framework for a calculation and attribution mechanism, but with sufficient flexibility for a particular manager’s circumstances. Therefore the bill should cater for fund managers who are able to accommodate more accurate taxable income and tax credit calculations, while retaining the rules currently in the bill for those who cannot. For example, where a fund manager spreads items in a manner that is acceptable for unit pricing and accounting purposes, and such spreading accords with the trust deed, then the spreading should also be acceptable for PIE tax calculation purposes. All PIEs should perform taxable income calculations based on taxable income and tax credits attributable to each investor to ensure fair and equitable results. The methodology for attributing income should be made more flexible so that the different methods actually applied by funds can be used to allocate income for tax purposes as well. The legislation should explicitly recognise the strict fiduciary responsibilities of fund trustees to treat investors equitably and the effect this may have on the PIE’s ability to return the exact amount of tax payable. In some cases, it may not be possible to strictly apply the tax rules and collect every cent of tax due, while discharging its fiduciary responsibilities. This requires that the new regime sensibly balances the trustee’s fiduciary responsibilities with the complexity of the regime and compliance costs associated with collecting the exact amount of tax. The Commissioner should have the ability to agree to the particulars of any given approach. 48 Comment Officials acknowledge that the current bill does not provide sufficient flexibility to PIEs in calculating PIE tax. The current drafting does not recognise that different PIEs may adopt different methods for attributing income to their investors. Officials agree with the general principle that the PIE tax rules should recognise income in the same manner that the PIE allocates that income to investors. In other words, as a general rule, the tax liability of the PIE should equal the aggregate of all amounts attributed to investors, multiplied by each investor’s tax rate for the tax calculation period. Officials therefore agree that the PIE tax calculation methodologies should be redrafted to provide PIEs with additional flexibility to ensure that a calculation methodology is available that reflects the way that the particular PIE attributes income to its investors. Additional flexibility can be achieved by generally allowing PIEs to choose the period that income is allocated to investors for tax purposes. As a general rule, this would allow PIEs to ensure that the allocation period for tax purposes matches their allocation period for commercial purposes. For example, a unit trust that calculates unit prices daily (and therefore allocates income to investors daily) will be able to choose a daily allocation period for tax purposes. In addition, the rules can be made even more flexible by ensuring that the period that the PIE recognises income and expenditure for commercial purposes is mirrored by the period the amounts are recognised for tax purposes. A good example of this is expenditure on audit fees. While these fees are often formally incurred for tax purposes at the end of the tax year, a PIE will often recognise these fees for commercial purposes from the beginning of the year to which the expenditure relates. It is also recognised that the current rules do not accommodate non-unitised superannuation funds adequately. The recommendations outlined later in this report should allow such funds to calculate their PIE tax in a manner that more closely reflects the way they currently pay tax. Recommendation Officials agree with submissions that, in general, allocation of income under the PIE tax rules should mirror the allocation that the PIE performs for accounting or unit pricing purposes. 49 Issue: Definition of income to follow IFRS Submissions (596 – ISI, 569 & 608 – ING, 589 – KPMG, 593 – Westpac NZ/BT Funds Management NZ, 598 – Trustees Executors, 586 – Promina Group Ltd) The bill should provide that taxable income calculated under generally accepted accounting principles or IFRS (for unit pricing) should be acceptable, notwithstanding other provisions of the Income Tax Act 2004. The tax timing rules should be aligned with the rules for recognising income and expenses for accounting and unit pricing. The calculation of PIE taxable income should be able to be based on the calculation of investor returns. An allocation of income and expenses that is applied for unit pricing and/or financial reporting should be acceptable for tax purposes, provided any differences that arise are merely timing differences, and the allocation is not done with the intention and effect of avoiding tax. Comment As noted above, officials agree that additional flexibility can be achieved by ensuring that the timing of income and expenditure under the PIE tax calculation follows the timing of that income and expenditure for accounting and unit pricing purposes. Recommendation That the timing of income and expenditure under the PIE tax calculation should follow the timing of that income and expenditure for accounting and unit pricing purposes. 50 FILING/INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS Clauses 144, 145, 148, 154 and 155 Issue: Disclosure requirements Submissions (597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 596 – ISI, 569 & 608 – ING, 594 – New Zealand Law Society, 582 – National Provident Fund, 567 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting) Likely disclosure requirements (such as quarterly returns and the annual reconciliation) should be conveyed in a timely manner (that is, before enactment of legislation) as this information is essential for systems development. This includes the form of any prescribed information required to be provided by PIEs to their investors. The bill should contain a provision similar to section 29 (shareholder dividend statements) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 requiring PIEs to provide investors with information such as: • Their amount of income or loss from the PIE for the year. This is necessary for zero-rated investors so they can complete their tax returns, and for others so they can determine whether or not they are over the $48,000 threshold for the first quarter of the next year. • For zero-rated investors, the amount of PIE tax credits they are entitled to and, in relation to foreign tax credits, the amount of foreign source income attributable to them from the PIE (since their ability to claim a credit is limited to the tax on their foreign source income). Comment Inland Revenue officials are consulting on the form and content of information that prospective PIEs will need to provide to Inland Revenue. Officials consider that PIEs should be required at the end of each year to provide to their investors information that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue prescribes. This information would include details of the investor’s share of the PIE’s taxable income and the rate that the PIE has used on behalf of that investor. This should ensure that all categories of PIE investors are provided with the necessary information to comply with their tax obligations. Officials consider that this can be achieved with a general provision that requires PIEs to furnish information to investors in a form prescribed by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. 51 Recommendation That PIEs be required to provide their investors with the information prescribed by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (such as their share of the PIE’s income and the tax rate used on behalf of the investor). Issue: Payment of tax and provision of returns Submissions (597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 596 – ISI, 12a – NZ Funds, 569 & 608 – ING, 595 – AXA, 582 – National Provident Fund) Tax payments and returns for PIE attributions should be due on the 15 th of the second month following the end of the month that the attribution is undertaken. The annual reconciliation showing PIE tax paid for the year should be due on 30 June each year (instead of 20 May as the bill currently provides). A PIE should only be required to submit a return quarterly regardless of the PIE’s portfolio entity period. An annual return should only be used to collect information, not as a reconciliation or wash-up. Section 57B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be amended to specify the information required to be submitted to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Comment The current bill requires that tax payments and PIE returns are due by the end of the month immediately following the end of the PIE’s calculation period. This effectively gives PIEs one month to calculate and pay their PIE tax. Officials consider that this one-month period is sufficient and should not be extended. Officials agree that the date by which the annual reconciliation statement must be filed should be extended to 30 June. The current bill contemplates and provides for PIEs that choose to allocate income to investors more regularly than quarterly (for example, daily). The relevant submission concerns how often such PIEs would be required to pay PIE tax. The issue has been superseded given our recommendations later in this report that PIEs generally not be permitted to calculate PIE tax for investors (remaining in the PIE) more often than quarterly. The current annual return requirement only requires information to be provided and does not require a tax reconciliation or wash-up. Therefore no amendment is required. 52 Officials consider that it would not be desirable to closely prescribe in section 57B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 the information required to be included in PIE returns because this would be too inflexible. It may be necessary to change returns at short notice to take account of changing circumstances, and this would take much longer if the legislation had to be periodically amended to allow this. Such a non- prescriptive approach is consistent with other return-filing requirements. Officials further consider that PIEs that wind up or permanently breach the PIE eligibility rules should be required to complete all return and payment obligations within two months of the date of cessation. Recommendation That the submission recommending that the annual reconciliation showing PIE tax paid for the year should be due on 30 June each year (instead of 20 May as the bill currently provides) be accepted, and PIEs that wind up or permanently breach the PIE eligibility rules be required to complete all return and payment obligations within two months of the date of cessation. It is further recommended that the remaining submissions be declined. Issue: Matching income year to tax year Submissions (567 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting, 925W – ASFONZ) Section HL 2(3)(d) has the effect of making all PIEs have income years coinciding with the tax year. For practical reasons this is likely to move all PIEs to balance dates of 31 March. This will create significant resourcing issues in the managed funds industry. The bill proposes that all PIEs have an income year ending 31 March. A significant number of current schemes have balance dates other than 1 April, and it is not clear that an additional workload at that date can be managed. Comment PIEs that are required to attribute income regularly to their investors should be required to have the same tax year as the majority of their investors – namely the standard tax year ending on 31 March. This is important as a number of PIE investors will need to know in a timely manner how much PIE income they have earned for a tax year. In addition, Inland Revenue will be issuing refunds to certain PIEs that have incurred tax losses during the year or have excess tax credits. This process would be better facilitated if the end of the PIE’s tax year matched the end of the standard tax year. 53 However, certain PIEs (such as listed company PIEs and PIEs that elect to remain as provisional taxpayers) will not attribute income regularly to their investors and will not receive refunds for tax losses incurred during the year or excess tax credits. There is less necessity for these types of PIEs to match their tax year with the standard tax year. It is therefore recommended that these PIEs be permitted to have an income year that does not end on 31 March. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part. That is, PIEs that are not required under the PIE tax rules to calculate PIE tax regularly should be permitted to have an income year that does not end on 31 March. Issue: Income year aligned with PIE tax period Submission (595 – AXA) A new section should be introduced for the purposes of subpart CX defining the income year as being a period consistent with a PIE period. For example, the market value and smoothed market value methods under the proposed international tax regime would need to apply based on a PIE tax period. Comment Officials agree with the submission’s general point that the PIE tax calculation period should function appropriately with the proposed international tax rules. Under the fair dividend rate method this should be achieved by ensuring that the fair dividend rate reflects the PIE’s tax calculation and allocation periods. Recommendation That the submission be accepted subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Treatment of losses and excess credits Submissions (595 – AXA, 556 – AMP) New section HL 11 should be amended to allow yearly attribution. PIEs should be given the option (but it should not be mandatory) to be allowed to adjust PIE tax so that quarterly losses can be used over the income year. 54 Comment Officials accept the submissions’ argument that not providing PIE investors value for losses incurred in one calculation period to offset income derived in later calculation periods is problematic. One option would be to allow PIEs that incur losses in one calculation period to offset those losses against profits in later calculation periods. Officials have considered this option but have concluded that it would add significant complexity to the mechanics of the PIE tax calculation. Officials consider that the issue can be more appropriately addressed by providing a refund of tax to PIEs that calculate PIE tax quarterly to compensate for any losses or any excess tax credits in a quarter. These PIEs would then be required to allocate the benefit of these losses and credits appropriately among their investors. Providing refunds to PIEs in this way would remove the need to rebate these amounts directly to investors. Recommendation That, although the concern raised by the submission is valid, the issue be dealt with by providing refunds to PIEs that calculate PIE tax quarterly, for losses and excess tax credits. Issue: Requiring equitable income calculations Submissions (598 – Trustees Executors, 567 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting) PIEs should be able to perform taxable income calculations based on the frequency on which investors can enter and exit the PIE to ensure fair and equitable results for all investors. Such calculations will ensure that investors coming into a fund or exiting during a calculation period will be taxed correctly on income they actually derive. It would allow investors to enter and exit PIEs as they currently do and all investors will be treated equitably. Any potential for abuse should also be removed. PIEs should be able to determine PIE tax on a daily basis without averaging class income over the portfolio entity period. Comment Officials agree with the submissions. It is recommended that the bill be amended to allow PIEs to choose the frequency that income is allocated to investors. Recommendation That submissions be accepted. 55 Issue: Legislating multiple unit pricing model Submission (598 – Trustees Executors) A multiple unit pricing model should be specifically legislated for in order to calculate and return PIE tax at the investor’s correct marginal tax rate. Comment Officials consider that it is unnecessary to legislate specifically for a multiple unit pricing, as suggested by the submission. The current rules would allow PIEs to run a single gross unit price for investors that have elected different tax rates. Investors’ individual tax rates would be reflected when the PIE adjusts investors’ interests at the end of the PIE’s calculation period (as the proposals would require for most PIEs). Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Alternative method: separate PIEs for different rate investors Submission (598 – Trustees Executors) An alternative model would involve funds setting up three PIEs to cater for 33%, 19.5% and 0% rate taxpayers respectively. This model ensures that investors are taxed at their correct marginal rate. Comment There is nothing in the proposed rules that would prevent the establishment of separate PIEs for investors with different tax rates. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 56 Issue: Aggregation of losses, credits and net income for the year Submission (600 – Fisher Funds Management Limited) Losses, credits and net income for each quarter should be accumulated until the end of the year and the payment made to Inland Revenue in the month following the end of the year. This achieves a fairer treatment for the investor and involves less administration for PIEs and Inland Revenue. Comment This issue has been superseded by the recommendation to allow PIEs that calculate PIE tax quarterly to receive a refund for losses incurred during a quarter, as well as for excess credits. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Alternative method: rebate for 19.5% and 0% investors Submission (1142 – Carter Holt Harvey Employee Benefits Plan and Retirement Plan) Inland Revenue should investigate a process under which a scheme pays tax at 33% and individuals claim back a rebate similar to the charitable donation rebate regime based on the attribution certification given. Comment The submission would result in increased compliance costs for investors and significantly increased administrative costs for Inland Revenue. To prevent 19.5% investors from being overtaxed under the system suggested by the submission, each 19.5% investor would be required to claim a rebate, and Inland Revenue would be required to process each individual claim. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 57 Issue: Alternative method: PIE tax rate of 19.5% Submission (1142 – Carter Holt Harvey Employee Benefits Plan and Retirement Plan) Instead of attribution, the tax rate for genuine long-term superannuation schemes should be reduced to 19.5%. Not only would this solve the complexity, it would also stimulate genuine retirement savings much like other developed countries where retirement savings have a concessionary tax treatment. Comment The suggestion would amount to a significant tax concession for investment through managed funds. This is inconsistent with the policy underlying the proposals, which is to level the playing field between direct investment and investment through managed funds. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Inappropriate marginal investor tax rates Submissions (1143 – Retirement Policy & Research Centre, 1347W – Northplan Financial Services/Swain Investment Services/Colin Strang Financial Planning, 657W – Sothertons Chartered Accountants) There appears to be no real justification for using anything other than the contributor’s marginal tax rate. Accordingly, it is difficult to understand why the top rate applied by the PIE should be other than 39%. For members earning more than $38,000, including PIE income, but less than $48,000, the appropriate rate that the PIE should apply to this group should be 33% because that is what the member would have paid on this income if it had been earned directly. The 19.5% tax rate for those earning less than $38,000 a year will be inappropriate for almost every contributor. The rate for this group should be 21%. The bill provides an ideal time to remove the “under $38,000 rebate” and to formalise four statutory tax rates of 15%, 21%, 33% and 39%. An alternative solution is to formalise the 19.5% tax rate for investment income for those under a total income of $38,000. This could be achieved by making the resident withholding rate applied by banks a final rate of 19.5%. It would also be necessary to gross up benefits and New Zealand Superannuation so that they are taxed at 19.5% and not give New Zealand superannuitants the under $38,000 rebate. 58 Comment Officials acknowledge that arguments can be made for taxing income relating to 39% PIE investors at 39%. It should be noted, however, that the 33% tax rate cap applying to PIEs was chosen to remove the dilemma that trustees of certain funds would otherwise face. That is, if the top PIE tax rate were 39% the trustee of a superannuation fund that is currently taxed at a final rate of 33% would face a dilemma of whether to elect into the PIE rules, as such an election would advantage the fund’s 19.5% investors but could disadvantage the fund’s 39% investors. This would be a significant practical concern facing funds and, on this basis, officials recommend retaining a top PIE tax rate of 33%. Officials acknowledge that arguments can be made to retain the boundary between the 19.5% rate and the 33% rate at $38,000. The proposal to set the boundary at $48,000 was to ensure that, in situations where someone’s PIE income from the previous year causes total income to exceed $38,000, they would not be overtaxed on their PIE income. Such over-taxation could otherwise occur as investors would be required to elect a 33% PIE tax rate and have all their PIE income taxed at 33% – even though a portion of the PIE income for the previous year would have been below the $38,000 threshold. The proposed $48,000 boundary would solve this issue in most cases. As discussed earlier, we are recommending that the proposed rules for investors selecting a PIE tax rate be amended so that investors would be required to elect a 33% rate if their income, other than PIE income, from the relevant previous year exceeded $38,000. The exclusion of PIE investment income would also address the over- taxation issue discussed in the previous paragraph. However, a rule is needed to ensure that investors with very little non-PIE income (for example, employment income) but significant levels of PIE income are unable to get the 19.5% tax rate on their income from PIEs. We therefore consider a further rule, which would require investors whose combined income in the relevant previous year from PIEs and other sources exceeds $60,000 to elect the 33% tax rate on their PIE income, is warranted. This $60,000 threshold should balance the potential over-taxation of PIE income with the need to ensure the PIE rules do not create opportunities to reduce tax inappropriately. Officials accept that in many cases an investor’s marginal tax rate on income earned below $38,000 is 21%. This is because investors earning below $38,000 are likely to be earning salary and wage income, and this income receives the benefit of the low income rebate that is clawed back by applying a 21% rate for income earned between $9,500 and $38,000. The low income rebate does not, however, apply for investment income. For investment income a simple 19.5% RWT rate applies. Given that PIE income is investment income, officials consider that it is appropriate to retain the current proposal with the 19.5% rate rather than have a 21% rate applying for PIE income. It is acknowledged that other methods, such as the one suggested by the submission, may be available for effectively making the 19.5% statutory rate more transparent for investment income. Consideration of such methods is, however, beyond the scope of this project. 59 Recommendation That the submission concerning the $48,000 boundary for electing a 33% rate be accepted in part. That is, the boundary for investors electing a 33% rate should be set at $38,000 without the need for investors to include PIE income from the relevant previous year (unless combined PIE income and other income exceeds $60,000). 60 PAYMENT OF PIE TAX Clause 85 Issue: Applying the provisional tax rules to PIEs Submission (578 – NZICA) For the purposes of accounting for PIE tax, a PIE should pay provisional tax as it does currently and offset this against any liability for PIE tax on behalf of investors that arises under section HL 10. Comment PIEs will generally pay income tax regularly and accurately on their income for the calculation period. There is, therefore, no need to require these PIEs to pay provisional tax. PIEs will, however, have the option of continuing as a provisional taxpayer – provided they meet a number of criteria (discussed later). It is envisaged that a number of superannuation funds and listed companies will elect this option. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Extension of time for payment of PIE tax for listed entities Submissions (551 – Macquarie Goodman, 590 – Property Council, 552 – Kiwi Income Property Trust, 569 & 608 – ING Property Trust) Under the NZX listing rules, the minimum period between announcing dividends and making the actual payment is three weeks. It is therefore unworkable for listed property trusts to pay the PIE tax by the last day of the month following the date on which the quarterly calculation would take place. Accordingly, listed entities should have an additional month to pay PIE tax. Comment Officials acknowledge the problem outlined by the submissions. It is noted, however, that the problem would not arise under the recommended PIE tax calculation method for listed companies. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 61 Issue: Payment dates for end of year PIE tax Submission (572 – New Zealand Fire Service Superannuation Scheme) The timeframe for the fourth quarter attribution and payment should be extended to at least 31 May – that is, two months after the end of the fourth quarter. This approach is consistent with fringe benefit tax. Comment There is no justification for providing a longer period to calculate and pay PIE tax for the fourth quarter than is provided for the other quarters. The calculation for the fourth quarter should be no more difficult than the calculations for the first three quarters as there is no reconciliation or wash-up required in the attribution and payment for the fourth quarter. It should be noted that a superannuation scheme (such as the submitter’s) that elected to pay PIE tax as a provisional taxpayer would continue to file returns as it currently does. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 62 INTRA-YEAR GAINS/LOSSES Clause 85 Submissions (597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 596 – ISI, 582 – National Provident Fund, 586 – Promina Group Ltd, 567 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting, 925W – ASFONZ) Under the quarterly attribution option, PIEs should have the option to offset gains and losses for an investor between quarters within the tax year, including (as a minimum) the ability to “carry forward” losses derived in one quarter to offset against gains in subsequent quarters of the same income year. Where a PIE tax liability arises in one quarter and a loss arises in a subsequent quarter, the PIE tax paid should be refunded to the PIE to the extent of the lesser of the PIE tax previously paid or the tax effect of the loss for the quarter using investors’ tax rates. The quarterly attribution approach should allow for timely refunds of PIE tax which has been paid in quarters which were followed by quarters in which losses were made. Comment This issue has been superseded by the recommendation to allow PIEs that attribute quarterly to receive a refund for losses incurred during a quarter, as well as for excess credits. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 63 INVESTOR INTEREST ADJUSTMENT Clause 85 Issue: Separate section for investor interest adjustment requirement Submission (12a – NZ Funds) The investor interest adjustment requirement should be in a separate section of the Act as it is a pivotal provision with regard to the interaction between PIE tax and the adjustment to investor interests. Comment Officials agree that the investor interest adjustment requirement in section HL 6(3) is a key provision in the PIE tax rules. The PIE rules will be restructured, which should aid understanding of the rules and ensure that the investor interest adjustment provision is given appropriate prominence. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Increasing flexibility for adjusting investors’ interests Submissions (578 – NZICA, 594 – New Zealand Law Society, 589 – KPMG) The requirement for a PIE to adjust investors’ interests (in section HL 6(3)) should not form part of the eligibility criteria. PIEs should be afforded flexibility such that adjusting investors’ interests is not the only permitted method for ensuring that investors receive the appropriate after-tax return from a PIE. (For example, a PIE could make a cash distribution to achieve this outcome.) Comment Officials agree that PIEs should be permitted to use methods other than adjusting investors’ interests in order to ensure that investors receive their appropriate after-tax return from their PIE investment. While the legislation should generally require that investors are given their correct after-tax return, there is no need to prescribe the method by which this should occur. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 64 Issue: Consistency in investor interest adjustment methodology Submission (588 – Trustee Corporation Association of NZ, 598 – Trustees Executors) Legislation should be drafted to ensure all PIEs use a consistent approach when performing the investor interest adjustment. Consistency of application of the investor interest adjustment would be achieved by the legislation containing clear and specific rules. Comment As noted above, while the legislation should generally require that investors are given their correct after-tax return, there is no need to prescribe the method by which this should occur. For example, a correct after-tax return could be achieved by distributing differential cash amounts to investors. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 65 FACILITATION OF THE CONSOLIDATION OF FUNDS Submissions (597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 596 – ISI, 589 – KPMG, 592 – Tower, 595 – AXA, 556 – AMP, 567 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting, 577 & 577a – ASB Group) The legislation should permit the consolidation of existing managed fund vehicles without triggering adverse tax consequences. It should allow losses and imputation credits to transfer from one entity to another where those funds are consolidated into one fund. The government should also explore other areas where regulatory relaxation would facilitate the rationalisation of funds. Comment To facilitate consolidation by allowing imputation credits and losses to transfer between funds would require significant additions and amendments to the bill. There has been insufficient time to consider: (i) whether this would be desirable and (ii) the method by which this could be achieved. Officials, therefore, do not support the submission. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 66 ELECTING IN AND OUT OF PIE RULES Clause 85 Issue: Section HL 2(2) – Requirement for effective PIE election Submissions (12a – NZ Funds, 567 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting) Section HL 2(2) should be deleted. This provision provides that if a PIE breaches the eligibility criteria within twelve months of electing to be a PIE it is treated as having never been a PIE. If this submission is not accepted, the bill needs to clarify the treatment of portfolio investment attributed income and portfolio investor rebates previously passed to investors if section HL 2(2) applies to deem the entity to never have been a PIE. If there is to be some form of quarterly test that the entity has met the eligibility requirements over the first 12 months then the wording of section HL 2(2)(b) needs amending. As it stands, a breach will only occur if there is a failure in each quarter not in any quarter. Comment The changes recommended to the PIE definition (discussed earlier) and, in particular the recommended introduction of a safe harbour from the investor requirements for entities that would meet paragraphs (a), (c) to (e) of the definition of “qualifying unit trust” (if the entity were a unit trust), should reduce significantly the risk of a fund breaching the PIE rules. These changes would substantially address the concerns of submitters. The intent of section HL 2(2)(b) is to provide a newly established PIE with 12 months to meet the PIE eligibility criteria. The words in the proposed section HL 2(2)(b) achieve this by providing that a PIE fails to make an effective PIE election by failing to meet the relevant eligibility criteria in each of the quarters during the 12-month period. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 67 Issue: Election to become a PIE Submissions (12a – NZ Funds, 569 & 608 – ING, 594 – New Zealand Law Society, 599 – Kingfish Limited, 600 – Fisher Funds Management Limited, 914W – Dominion Funds Group, 613W – Phillips Fox) A special provision is required to allow entities to elect to be PIEs before 1 April 2007 and for the election to be effective from 1 April 2007. Quarterly elections into the PIE regime should continue after the 2007 year. Elections to be a PIE (for a newly established entity) should be effective from the start of the quarter in which the entity is first established provided the Commissioner receives the election within 20 working days of the entity’s establishment date. A new vehicle should be able to elect into the PIE rules from the date of establishment provided an election notice is sent before the end of its first quarter PIE status should begin from any date stated by the applicant. The entity will be responsible to pay PIE tax at the end of the quarter following election. It should be clearly stated that the PIE regime will remain elective, and will not become mandatory in the future. Comment To allow PIEs more time to make necessary changes it is recommended that the PIE rules apply from 1 October 2007. Officials agree that PIEs should have the ability from 1 April 2007 – six months before the 1 October 2007 application date – to indicate to Inland Revenue their ability to meet the PIE requirements by 1 October 2007. Officials consider that from 1 April 2008 only new entities should be able to elect to be PIEs at any time. For existing entities that want to elect to be PIEs from 1 April 2008, this election should be required to be made before the start of the relevant year. This requirement will facilitate the entity’s transition from the current tax rules to the PIE tax rules. Officials disagree with the submission that the legislation, once enacted, should provide that the PIE tax rules will always remain optional. Even if desirable, it is difficult to see how such a provision could ever be effective. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part, subject to officials’ comments. 68 Issue: Rationalisation of election provisions Submission (578 – NZICA) The rules for electing to be a PIE (or ceasing to be a PIE) should all be contained in one provision. In the alternative, sections HL 2 and HL 7 should be located next to each other. Comment The restructuring of the PIE tax rules should aid comprehension and will ensure that provisions are more logically ordered. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Relationship between election provisions Submission (578 – NZICA) The relationships between section HL 2, HL 5 and HL 6 should be clarified. The rule in section HL 2(3)(a) needs to cater for the rule in section HL 2(2)(b). Comment The PIE tax provisions will be re-ordered and restructured to meet general concerns about the relationships between the different provisions. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 69 Issue: Period before an entity can re-elect to be a PIE Submission (594 – New Zealand Law Society) Where a PIE has ceased to be eligible by election it should be able to re-elect to be a PIE after three years. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue should also have the power to reduce this three-year period. Comment The appropriate “stand down” period for a PIE that has elected out of the PIE rules is a judgment that balances, on the one hand, the problems of an entity electing in and out of the PIE rules to gain a tax advantage and, on the other hand, not raising unnecessary barriers to re-entry into the rules. We consider that the current five-year “stand down” period achieves this balance appropriately. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 70 NON-RESIDENT INVESTORS IN A PIE Clauses 85 and 124 Issue: Non-residents able to claim tax credits Submissions (597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 596 – ISI, 578 – NZICA, 589 – KPMG, 588 – Trustee Corporation Association of NZ, 551 – Macquarie Goodman, 595 – AXA, 590 – Property Council, 552 – Kiwi Income Property Trust, 556 – AMP, 568 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 569 & 608 – ING Property Trust) The legislation should be amended to clarify which tax rate applies when PIE income is attributed to a non-resident investor. The legislation should be amended to allow a PIE that is attributing income to non- residents to apply the non-resident’s NRWT rate under the applicable double tax agreement. The legislation should be amended to specifically allow non-residents to offset any losses attributed to them by a PIE against their future PIE income. When PIE tax is paid on behalf of non-resident investors, those investors should be treated in a way that will allow them to claim foreign tax credits in their country of residence to the extent of the PIE tax paid by them. This includes allowing the foreign investor tax credit (FITC) regime to apply to distributions from PIEs to non-resident investors. To enable non-resident investors to have a tax credit that they can claim in their home jurisdiction, the PIE could be deemed to pay a fully imputed dividend equal to 67/33 of the PIE tax attributable to the non-resident investor for the quarter. This would then feed into the FITC regime and would allow the payment of a supplementary dividend, the payment of non resident withholding tax and the claiming of a FITC. Alternatively, a regime similar in nature to the foreign investor tax credit regime could be introduced for distributions of PIE taxable income made from a PIE to non- resident investors. This would effectively achieve the same result as using the FITC regime but would specifically apply to distributions from PIEs. Non-residents should be allowed to file tax returns to allow a refund of the difference between the correct tax rate and 33%. Comment The bill is clear that the tax rate that applies to a non-resident investor in a PIE is 33%. Compared to the NRWT approach suggested by some submissions this will reduce significantly the costs for PIEs in complying with the rules. That is, under the NRWT approach, a PIE would be required to track different tax rates for the same investor, depending on the type of income derived by the PIE. (For example, interest income would generally have a different rate to dividend income.) In addition, under the change suggested in submission, a PIE would be required to separately take 71 account of the residence of each investor and, if the investor is non-resident, the particular rate that would apply under the relevant tax treaty. A listed PIE will be treated as a company and will therefore gain the benefit of the FITC regime through the normal rules. Officials do not consider it necessary or desirable to enact a separate FITC regime for ordinary PIEs as it would significantly increase complexity. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Conduit regime Submission (568 – Corporate Taxpayers Group) The original proposals to allow a conduit regime for all non-resident investors into PIEs should be enacted as originally proposed. New Zealand fund managers will be competitively disadvantaged without a comprehensive conduit regime for PIEs. Comment This approach would allow PIE income that is sourced outside New Zealand and attributed to a non-resident to be relieved of New Zealand tax. Because there has been insufficient time to adequately consider this issue, and given its complexity, officials do not support this submission. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 72 PRESCRIBED INVESTOR RATES Clause 126 Issue: Over-taxation of investors investing through PIEs Submissions (596 – ISI, 12a – NZ Funds, 569 & 608 – ING, 589 – KPMG, 593 – Westpac NZ/BT Funds Management NZ, 556 – AMP, 567 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting, 674W – Waterfront Industry Superannuation Fund) As the bill is currently drafted, some PIE investors may not obtain the benefit of the 19.5% rate if their total income (including PIE investment income) in the previous year exceeds $48,000. This would arise, for example, where an investor derives only PIE income and this breaches the $48,000 threshold. In this case, every dollar of their PIE income would be taxable at 33% (when some of it should get the benefit of the 19.5% rate). This could adversely affect investors with very little non-PIE investment income, such as retirees. Approaches to dealing with this issue include reducing the 19.5% threshold to $38,000 (and exclude PIE income from the calculation of this threshold) or allowing PIE tax to be refunded to investors to the extent it results in a tax liability in excess of that if the investor had invested directly. If officials are concerned about the ability of individuals to avoid tax by having all their income generated through a PIE, there could be a high threshold of PIE income above which investors are required to file a return. Investors may not be in a position to determine the correct investor rate when the election is required. The bill requires this election to be based on the income of the investor in the preceding income year. However, investors in PIEs that elect into the new rules on 1 April 2007 will not have determined their 2007 taxable income. (KPMG) Comment Officials consider that this potential over-taxation issue should be dealt with by allowing PIE investors to elect a 19.5% rate only if their total income (other than PIE investment income) in the previous year is $38,000 or less (or, if the information is not available for that year, the preceding year). Investors must elect the 33% tax rate if their combined PIE and non-PIE income in the previous year is greater than $60,000. This latter requirement is necessary to ensure that investors that derive significant amounts of PIE investment income (but very little other income) are not able to get the benefit of the 19.5% tax rate. Allowing the election to be based on the income in up to two previous years addresses the transitional issue referred to in the KPMG submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted to the extent outlined in officials’ comments. 73 Issue: Electing higher rates Submissions (597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 578 – NZICA, 569 & 608 – ING, 589 – KPMG, 588 – Trustee Corporation Association of NZ, 593 – Westpac NZ/BT Funds Management NZ, 600 – Fisher Funds Management Limited, 586 – Promina Group Ltd, 572 – New Zealand Fire Service Superannuation Scheme, 1347W – Northplan Financial Services/Swain Investment Services/Colin Strang Financial Planning, 880 – First NZ Capital, 966 – New Zealand Harbours Superannuation Scheme, 674W – Waterfront Industry Superannuation Fund, 267a – The Wealthcare Group) Investors with a prescribed rate of 0% (that is, zero-rated investors, such as trustees) should be able to elect for PIE tax to be paid on their behalf at 33%, but not as a final tax. Trustees (zero-rated investors) should have the option of electing a “prescribed investor rate” of greater than 0%. This would be a final tax. Trustees should also be able to elect a 19.5% rate if they can demonstrate that the beneficiaries of the trust are 19.5% marginal taxpayers. PIE income should be treated in the same way as distributions to minors who are beneficiaries. The trustee would pay tax at a rate of 33% and the income, when distributed, would not form part of the minor’s taxable income. The option should be available for trusts and companies investing in PIEs to have tax deducted at a rate other than 0%, if they so elect. Comment Officials agree that trusts should be allowed to elect 33% as a final tax. This approach will suit trusts that currently have their investment income taxed at the fund level. This would mean income attributed to the trustee would be excluded income and also would not be taxable to the beneficiary (including a beneficiary on a 39% marginal tax rate). The trust rules require that for income of the trust to be beneficiary income there are certain requirements that need to be met. Allowing trustees to elect the 19.5% rate would allow them to circumvent these requirements. It would also be very difficult to prove that all the potential discretionary beneficiaries of a trust had a 19.5% rate. Recommendation That trust be allowed to elect 33% as a final tax rate on PIE income 74 Issue: Electing lower rates Submission (557 – Alliance Bernstein) The list of entities able to elect a prescribed rate of 0% should be extended to include: • any entity with a valid certificate of exemption; • a portfolio investment entity; • a superannuation fund; • a revenue account holder; • a custodian. Comment Officials agree that portfolio investment entities, custodians and superannuation funds should also be able to elect 0%. Any other entity that is not a natural person should come within the definition of “company” and therefore a certificate of exemption process would not be required. The PIE rules do not distinguish between investors who hold PIE interests on revenue or capital account. Consequently, the ability to elect a 0% tax rate on PIE income should not be based on the capital or revenue account status of investors. Officials consider the correct result is achieved if an individual investor who holds an interest in a PIE on revenue account is required to elect 19.5% or 33% and pay tax on any trading gain when the interest is disposed of. Recommendation That the submission be accepted subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Joint investors Submissions (12a – NZ Funds, 593 – Westpac NZ/BT Funds Management NZ, 1347W – Northplan Financial Services/Swain Investment Services/Colin Strang Financial Planning) Investors should be given the opportunity to obtain a refund where too much tax has been paid on their portfolio investor attributed income from a joint investment. This problem could arise where investors have a joint investment in a PIE and the elected rate of the joint investment is 33%, whereas one of the investors is a 19.5% taxpayer. Joint investors should be given the option to elect 33%, 19.5% or 0%, together with an obligation to file a tax return at the end of the year. It is not clear how joint holders with different marginal rates can be accommodated in the currently proposed legislation. 75 Comment PIEs would be required to deduct tax on individual investors’ interests at either 19.5% or 33%. Where joint holders of the investment each qualify to elect the reduced rate they can elect 19.5%. Where more than one rate may apply to an investor interest the PIE would be required to deduct tax at the highest applicable rate. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Allowing individual investors in tax loss to elect 0% Submissions (596 – ISI, 589 – KPMG, 588 – Trustee Corporation Association of NZ, 593 – Westpac NZ/BT Funds Management NZ, 595 – AXA, 577 & 577a – ASB Group) Individual investors with tax losses in the previous year should be able to elect to be a zero-rated investor in a PIE. Investors with a prescribed investor rate of 19.5% or 33% should be able to elect for PIE tax to be paid at 0%, but not as a final tax. For example, this would allow individuals who are not entitled to a rebate because they do not have any non-PIE income on which they have paid tax to offset PIE losses against PIE income from another PIE. However, this treatment should be legislated so as not to affect social assistance entitlements. An investor who has a loss should be able to elect a rate of 0% with an exemption certificate. Comment Individual investors in PIEs are required to pay tax on this income, with the minimum rate being 19.5%. Allowing individual investors to choose to flow through or not could lead to gaming around an investor’s taxable income, flow through occurring when they have a loss in their tax return and not when their other taxable income is high. The submissions’ proposal would also increase the complexity of the rules which would not be desirable. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 76 Issue: Allowing wholesale PIEs to pay tax on behalf of retail PIEs Submission (596 – ISI) A wholesale PIE should have the option, if elected by a retail PIE, to deduct PIE tax at a rate elected by the retail PIE. The rate available for election would be a weighted average rate of the retail PIE’s tax deduction obligations. The retail PIE and its investors would then receive credit for PIE tax deducted at the wholesale PIE level. This would mean the retail PIE would not have to find the cash to pay the tax. Comment Officials note that this would add further complexity to the proposals and, as a final tax, would see individual investors in the retail PIE on the 19.5% rate not receive the full benefit of the lower tax rate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Default rate for entities Submission (12a – NZ Funds) The default rate for investors in PIEs that are charities, trusts or companies that fail to provide their prescribed investor tax rate should be zero. Comment In order to ensure that investors are entitled to take advantage of a reduced rate (19.5% or 0%) they will be required to provide their Inland Revenue tax number as part of electing their prescribed investor rate. Officials consider that having different default rates for individual and non-individual PIE investors would not be feasible. In particular, it would be difficult for PIEs to establish whether an individual holds an investment in a trustee or personal capacity (whether a person holds an investment on trust is generally not notified on registers). Recommendation That the submission be declined. 77 Issue: Prescribed rate based on current year income Submissions (12a – NZ Funds, 613W – Phillips Fox, 674W – Waterfront Industry Superannuation Fund) The bill should allow investors to choose a prescribed investor rate based on a reasonable estimate of current year income. A preferred approach would be to adopt the previous year’s tax rate as an indicative rate on which to base a withholding (not final) tax, and the taxpayer to return the PIE income along with other income in the period and applying the correct marginal tax rate for that period. The prescribed investor rate should be set using a similar method to the withholding tax system currently applied by banks. Comment The use of an estimation process would bring about the need for investors who under-estimate their rate to file a return and would leave them potentially liable to penalties. This would add further compliance costs for investors. Under a withholding tax model there is a potential for many people to be brought back into the tax return filing system, which could affect their social assistance entitlements. Both of these outcomes are inconsistent with the key objectives of the proposed legislation. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 78 Issue: Investors who elect the wrong rate should not be double taxed Submissions (594 – New Zealand Law Society, 567 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting, 925W – ASFONZ, 674W – Waterfront Industry Superannuation Fund) The exclusion in section CX 44D for an individual’s share of a PIEs income does not apply if the person has elected a 19.5% rate when he or she is in fact a 33% rate taxpayer. This means that such a person suffers a combined tax burden of 52.5% (19.5% paid by the PIE and 33% paid by the person). This double taxation would be prevented by allowing the individual a credit for the tax paid by the PIE. The submission accepts that there should be some penalty for a person who either deliberately provides the wrong rate to a PIE or else fails to update an election within a reasonable period (for example, within a year). Investors selecting the wrong rate should not be penalised arbitrarily, other than where there is reason to believe that a lower rate has been selected deliberately. Comment If investors incorrectly elect for PIE tax to be paid at 19.5%, but their prescribed tax rate is actually 33%, the bill provides that all of the attributed PIE income would be taxable to them at their personal tax rate (which could be 33% or 39%). No relief is given for the 19.5% tax already paid by the PIE on the income. This treatment was provided to act as a disincentive for those who deliberately provide the PIE with an incorrect tax rate. There is no specific provision in the tax penalties regime to penalise investors for providing the wrong tax rate. The treatment in the bill should, therefore, provide an effective penalty for deliberately choosing too low a tax rate. Tax payer should be able to elect the appropriate tax rate on their PIE income as they can look back up to two years. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Timing of notification of investor rate Submissions (595 – AXA, 1141 – MCA NZ Limited) The prescribed investor rate should be able to be selected with reference to the year prior to the last completed tax year in order to give investors certainty on this issue. Providers should be allowed one month at the beginning of each tax year to determine if an investor is to pay 19.5% or 33% tax based on their 31 March tax assessment. 79 Comment Officials consider that the rate to be notified to the PIE by the investor should be based on the income of the two previous years. Furthermore, the time available to investors to provide their prescribed investor rate should be extended until the end of the PIE’s tax calculation period. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Achieving greater certainty of prescribed investor rates Submissions (600 – Fisher Funds Management Limited, 1142 – Carter Holt Harvey Employee Benefits Plan and Retirement Plan) A fund manger should be able to provide a list of Inland Revenue numbers in relation to investors on a default rate. Inland Revenue could then provide to the fund manager more accurate tax codes. Inland Revenue should be required to provide scheme trustees with details of members’ tax rates to avoid the need to collect them individually from the members. Comment Secrecy obligations would prevent Inland Revenue from supplying fund managers with taxpayer-specific information. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Clarification over frequency of prescribed rate election Submissions (567 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting, 925W – ASFONZ) Clarification is needed over the frequency with which investors are expected to advise their portfolio investor rate. It should be clarified whether new advice must be given for each portfolio entity period, whether is it only required for each tax year, or whether the advised rate remains in force until the investor advises a new portfolio investor rate. 80 It is not practical for investors to be required to advise their applicable tax rate every year. This should only be required on commencement and whenever a different rate becomes applicable. The balancing payment arrangements applied for bank deposits should be applied in respect of PIE income (that is, balances or refunds should be dealt with through Inland Revenue at the end of each year). Comment Officials agree investors should advise their PIE only of any changes to their prescribed investor rate. If the investors do not advise the PIE of a change in their prescribed investor rate, the PIE should continue to use the last notified elected rate. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Prescribed rates for non-resident investors Submissions (577 & 577a – ASB Group, 1347W – Northplan Financial Services/Swain Investment Services/Colin Strang Financial Planning, 880 – First NZ Capital, 618W – The Retire Fund, 674W – Waterfront Industry Superannuation Fund) For non-residents the prescribed investor rate should be set at 10% or 15% to reflect the current non-resident withholding tax rate for non-residents of treaty countries. In relation to gains on foreign equities, the correct policy perspective is that this income should not be within the tax base of non-residents, and therefore gains (and losses) on foreign equities should have a zero rate of tax. Likewise, foreign dividend income should not be subject to New Zealand tax. Comment Non-resident investors in PIEs will have income which is subject to tax in New Zealand significantly reduced by virtue of both the Australasian trading gains exclusion and only being subject to tax on offshore shares under the fair dividend rate method. It is not desirable for PIEs to be required to track the residence of each investor and also tax different sources of income at various rates for a particular group of investors. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 81 Issue: Restriction of income caught under $48,000 threshold Submission (1141 – MCA NZ Limited) The $48,000 threshold could be applied just to taxable income received from the participating employer and contributions paid by that employer (and not include the PIE’s investment income). This would avoid the providers having to keep records of taxable income for each individual investor. Comment An investor may have more than one source of income, so basing the prescribed investor rate on just one employer’s income details or on the income from one scheme provider will not necessarily result in the correct rate selection. Officials also note that investors may have income tax losses that would reduce their taxable income and allow them to take advantage of the 19.5% rate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 82 TAX CREDITS Clauses 99, 100, 101, 102 and 104 Issue: Separately identifying foreign tax credits (PIEs) Submission (596 – ISI, 569 & 608 – ING, 593 – Westpac NZ/BT Funds Management NZ, 586 – Promina Group Ltd) The bill should be amended to remove the requirement for a PIE to separately identify different tax credits (such as foreign tax credits, imputation credits and resident withholding tax). Income and tax should be grouped as follows: taxable income, resident withholding tax, imputation credits and foreign tax credits. Taxable income should be reduced in the following order: foreign tax credits (with any excess forfeited); imputation credits; and resident withholding tax. All foreign tax credits should be available to be applied against all foreign income in calculating PIE tax. Comment Officials consider that while foreign tax credits need to be separately identified from other credits, for compliance cost reasons, these credits should be able to be offset against tax on all PIE income (irrespective of the source of the income, be it New Zealand or foreign). Therefore only a single pool of foreign tax credits would need to be maintained. Any foreign tax credits that cannot be offset against PIE tax would be forfeited and would not be refunded to investors (which is consistent with the current law). This proposed treatment is a significant simplification, as the current rules for use of foreign tax credits require that credits be separated according to income-type and source. Recommendation That PIEs be allowed to pool foreign tax credits and offset these credits against tax on all PIE income (irrespective of income-type or source). 83 Issue: Separately identifying foreign tax credits (investors) Submission (12a – NZ Funds, 567 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting) There should be no requirement for zero-rated PIE investors to distinguish between non-refundable, convertible or refundable credits. The words “of the type received by the entity” under section HL 18(4) and (6) should be removed. Comment PIEs are required to track each tax credit by its type so that the correct income tax treatment is applied when calculating their PIE tax liability. These details will be passed on to zero rate investors to ensure that they too apply the correct tax treatment. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Identifying credits covered by section HL 18 Submission (589 – KPMG, 588 – Trustee Corporation Association of NZ) The definition of credit under subsection HL 18(4) should be clarified to include the relevant credits – imputation, foreign tax, resident withholding tax and dividend withholding payment. It is currently not clear what the term “credit” in the formula in this section includes. Comment Section HL 18(1) applies to credits for tax paid or withheld; this would cover the credits referred to in the submission with the possible exceptions of imputation and dividend withholding payment credits attached to dividends received by PIEs. Officials therefore consider it should be clarified that these types of credits are covered by this provision. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part subject to officials’ comments. 84 TAX LOSSES Clauses 85 and 86 Submission (596 – ISI) The bill should specify that otherwise taxable income can be attributed to an investor without deduction of PIE tax where the income is sourced from a lower-tier PIE (such as a wholesale fund) and pre-PIE tax losses in the lower-tier PIE (formation losses) have been offset against the income. Comment Wholesale PIEs can deduct their formation losses to the extent of the income in a return period. The wholesale PIE’s formation losses are used to offset income at the wholesale level and cannot form part of any flow-through to a retail PIE. The income that has been offset would not be taxable income at the retail PIE level. Any subsequent distribution by the wholesale PIE would also not be taxable to the retail PIE. Any income that is allocated to a retail PIE will be zero-rated and the income would form part of the retail PIE’s assessable income. Losses that the retail PIE has would be offset against any income it is allocated from a wholesale PIE. Officials therefore believe the bill does not produce the result suggested by the submission. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 85 PORTFOLIO INVESTOR REBATES Clause 98 Issue: Rebate for overpaid PIE tax Submissions (12a – NZ Funds, 569 & 608 – ING, 595 – AXA) PIE investors should be able to claim a refundable rebate for any overpaid tax where the investor has incorrectly elected a portfolio investor rate that is higher than their prescribed investor rate. Also, the rebate should not be restricted to the amount of other tax paid by the investors (that is, it should be refunded in full). Under a quarterly attribution approach, any excess PIE tax (arising from a combination of gains and losses during quarters) should be refunded by Inland Revenue. If the total for the year is still a net loss, this should then be applied to investors’ other income. If the investor has insufficient income to offset the loss, it should be carried forward. Comment Officials consider that PIEs that allocate losses and tax credits to investors for a calculation period should be able to provide value for losses and excess tax credits that cannot be utilised on behalf of the investor in the period. The balance of any losses allocated at the end of the calculation period would be converted to a tax credit at the investor’s prescribed investor rate, as currently proposed in the bill. The tax credit arising from losses would be added to any excess tax credit arising from the PIE tax calculation on the income and associated tax credits allocated to the investor. The value of these combined credits would be paid by Inland Revenue to the PIEs. The PIE would then adjust the level of the investor’s interest in the PIE to provide the investor with the benefit of these combined credits. This would remove the need for the credit types other than foreign tax credits to be separately treated for investors other than those using the zero rate. The current rebate process in the bill involves the value of losses and credits being refunded directly to investors, forming part of the investor’s discretionary income, which may be spent on consumption instead of being reinvested. This new approach leaves the credits within the fund, thereby promoting saving, which is consistent with KiwiSaver concepts. Recommendation That the submission be declined but note that some of the points raised in the submission are addressed by changes outlined above in officials’ comments. 86 Issue: Expenses by PIE investors available as a rebate Submission (569 & 608 – ING) Instead of filing a tax return to claim expenses, investors should be able to file a rebate claim for a refund (which could be done by amending the existing rebate claim form used by taxpayers to claim rebates on charitable donations). Comment Investors currently can claim these expenses by filing a tax return. Officials consider that the PIE amendments should not affect the current process for individual investors making a claim for deductible expenditure. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Quarterly PIE tax rebates Submission (595 – AXA) The tax rebate period should be aligned with the portfolio entity period (that is, rebates should be paid quarterly instead of once a year). Comment Officials consider that this issue will be superseded by the proposal for the value of any unutilised losses and excess tax credits to be paid by Inland Revenue to PIEs, which will then provide the benefit of this payment to investors (for example, by adjusting investors’ interests). Recommendation That the submission be declined. 87 Issue: Industry consultation for rebate process Submission (577 & 577a – ASB Group) Inland Revenue should continue to consult regularly with the industry during the Select Committee process on the specific return and rebate process design, including the expected timeframe for rebates to be available to investors. This will enable the industry to prepare appropriately. Comment Officials consider that industry involvement will increase the likelihood of successful implementation of the changes introduced in the bill. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 88 EXITING INVESTORS Clause 85 Submissions (597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 12a – NZ Funds, 596 – ISI, 578 – NZICA, 569 & 608 – ING, 593 – Westpac NZ/BT Funds Management NZ, 594 – New Zealand Law Society, 598 – Trustees Executors, 600 – Fisher Funds Management Limited, 556 – AMP) If a PIE attributes income and pays tax quarterly, it should determine the attribution based on the tax rates of investors that have a remaining interest. If an investor partially exits, the PIE would cancel units only to the extent that there are remaining units that are able to be redeemed. Any balance of tax not able to be funded by remaining interests would become payable by the investor and not the PIE. In other words, exiting investors are treated as zero-rate investors to the extent they do not have sufficient units to cancel to meet the PIE tax liability. Investors that have exited between the end of an attribution period but before PIE tax is calculated should be treated as zero-rated provided the PIE calculates PIE tax within ten working days following the end of the period. Alternatively, a PIE should be authorised to deduct an estimated amount of tax from the proceeds of the investor’s interest based on earnings to date of exit. Comment PIEs should be able to use their current methods for allocating income, expenditure and tax credits in calculating their PIE tax liability. Where this does not enable a sufficiently accurate assessment of the taxable income for an investor who exits during a quarter, the PIE should be allowed to treat the investor as zero-rated. Officials also agree that investors who exit within five working days following the end of a return calculation period should be treated as zero-rated. At the end of the quarter the PIE will calculate the investor’s allocated income and advise the investor accordingly. The investor would be responsible for squaring up the tax with Inland Revenue. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted subject to officials’ comments. 89 ATTRIBUTION TO INVESTORS Clause 85 Issue: Making attribution to investors optional Submission (592 – Tower, 595 – AXA) Entities that elect into the PIE regime must attribute income of the PIE to investors and account for PIE tax. This requirement to attribute income of the PIE to investors should be optional – for example, at the discretion of trustees. The main effect of the flow-through mechanism is to reduce the tax paid by low marginal tax rate investors. In the case of a fund with virtually all investors on higher marginal tax rates there will be very little reduction in tax because of the flow-through mechanism. Therefore, it does not seem worth the compliance costs of operating the flow-through mechanism to require attribution to investors in such cases. Comment The requirement to have income attributed to investors at their marginal tax rates is an inherent feature of the PIE rules as it ensures that lower income savers are taxed at their correct rate. It is not the policy intention that the fiscal benefits of the PIE rules such as the exclusion for trading gains on Australasian equities should be accessed without the concomitant requirement to attribute income to investors at their personal rates. Officials note that a number of the recommended amendments – such as the proposals for listed companies and superannuation funds – will reduce compliance costs for funds. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: PIE income attributed to a trust Submission (597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Legislation should be introduced that permits trustees of a qualifying trust to deem PIE income attributed to the trust to vest absolutely in one or more beneficiaries (for tax purposes) and therefore qualify as “beneficiary income”. 90 Comment Officials understand the background to this issue is whether income derived but not received in cash (such as attributed PIE income) can constitute beneficiary income for purposes of trust taxation. We note that this issue is broader than PIE taxation but applies to any taxable income not received in cash, such as accrual income. We consider that this issue should not be addressed in this bill but be considered in a wider context. Officials consider that the policy intent is that PIE income attributed to qualifying trusts can vest absolutely in one or more beneficiaries (for tax purposes) and therefore qualify as “beneficiary income”. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Trusts and 33% cap Submissions (597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 589 – KPMG, 588 – Trustee Corporation Association of NZ) Where income is allocated by a PIE to a trust, the legislation should provide that PIE income that is to be passed out by the trust as beneficiary income to a beneficiary on the 39% tax rate is taxable as trustee income at 33%. Resident investors on 33% or 19.5% tax rates should be taxed at each investor’s applicable rate as beneficiary income. A distribution to a non-resident beneficiary should be taxable as trustee income at 33%, unless the income is subject to double tax agreement relief (such as NRWT rates for dividend and interest income) and the non-resident has submitted such rates to the PIE. Comment Officials consider that PIE income derived by a trustee and paid to a beneficiary would be taxed at the beneficiary’s tax rate as beneficiary income. Under section HH 3(2) a trustee must satisfy the income tax liability for beneficiary income as agent of the beneficiary. Tax paid in this manner is taken into account to determine “residual income tax” and therefore should not result in provisional tax obligations for beneficiaries receiving PIE income. Officials recommend that a trustee may choose to have PIE tax apply at 33% (rather than have the PIE income attributed to the trustee as assessable income). This will have the effect of capping the tax rate at 33% even when the income is paid to a beneficiary on the 39% tax rate. 91 Recommendation That trustees investing in PIEs may choose to have PIE tax apply at 33% instead of having the PIE income attributed to the trustee. Issue: Allowing trust income to be taxed at beneficiaries’ rate Submission (589 – KPMG) Trustee income retained in the trust for the benefit of beneficiaries on the 19.5% marginal tax rate should not be taxed at 33%. Comment Trust income is taxed as either trustee income at a 33% rate or as beneficiary income at the beneficiaries’ rate. Distributions of trustee income are not taxed in the beneficiaries’ hands. Beneficiary income is income of a trust that is paid or applied for beneficiaries or vests absolutely in beneficiaries in the income year it is derived or within six months of the end of that year. A general feature of the trust regime is that income derived by a trustee and not paid to a beneficiary within six months of the end of the income year is taxed to the trustee at 33%, even if the beneficiaries who will ultimately receive the income are subject to a lower tax rate. This is a general feature of the trust tax regime. This submission seeks a major change to the trust tax regime which is beyond the scope of this bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Portfolio investor attributed income Submission (578 – NZICA) New section CP 1 should refer to an amount of attributed rather than derived income. Comment Section CP 1 does not refer to a person “deriving” portfolio investor attributed income. This is the correct approach as derivation is a timing concept, whereas Part C of the Act is simply concerned with ascertaining what is income (and not with its timing). Recommendation That the submission be declined. 92 Issue: Making PIE periods shorter than 3 months Submission (567 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting) It may be problematic for a PIE to elect a period that is shorter than three months because investors may not be in a position in the first period of a tax year to determine a correct portfolio investor rate. Comment Officials note it will be possible for investors to elect their prescribed investor rate based on either of the previous two years’ income. Therefore officials consider this issue should no longer pose a problem. It should also be noted that PIEs will no longer be able to choose a calculation period shorter than three months (this is discussed previously). Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Attribution to 19.5% investors only Submission (1142 – Carter Holt Harvey Employee Benefits Plan and Retirement Plan) Schemes should only be required to attribute income to 19.5% taxpayers. For the majority of investors the extra costs of attribution will provide no potential benefit. Comment Officials note that the recommendation to allow a superannuation scheme which is eligible to be a PIE but does not elect to be one to own 100% of the PIE will allow such schemes some of the key benefits of PIE status (tax free Australasian share gains) without incurring the compliance costs of attribution. In addition, the recommended simplified method for superannuation schemes that want to become PIEs should ensure that compliance costs are minimised. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 93 Issue: Clarifying meaning of distribution Submissions (596 – ISI, 12a – NZ Funds, 578 – NZICA, 582 – National Provident Fund) The application of section CX 44D(2) – which provides that distributions by PIEs are excluded income of investors – should be clarified to ensure that any distributions of pre-PIE retained earnings are also excluded income. All distributions from a PIE should be deemed to be fully imputed. It should also be clarified that any amounts received by an investor on redemption of units are a distribution from a PIE and therefore excluded income. For a PIE that is a company, distributions from the PIE are still dividends for the purposes of the Act. The possible consequences of this should be considered – for example, an amendment has been made to the RWT rules to exclude dividends from companies that are PIEs but an equivalent amendment has not been made to the NRWT rules. Comment Officials agree that an equivalent amendment to clause 120 (excluding dividends from companies that are PIEs from the RWT rules) should also be made to the NRWT rules (in section NG 1(2)). Officials consider that the other submissions seeking to clarify that distributions of pre-PIE retained earnings are excluded income are unnecessary as this effect is already achieved under the current provisions in the bill. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted subject to officials’ comments. 94 OPTIONAL FLOW-THROUGH Clause 85 Submissions (582 – National Provident Fund, 572 – New Zealand Fire Service Super Scheme, 925W – ASFONZ, 604W – Meat Industry Superannuation Scheme, 679W – Goldman Sachs JBWere Transtasman Unit Trust, 966 – New Zealand Harbours Superannuation Plan, 618W – The Retire Fund, 674W – Waterfront Industry Superannuation Fund) An existing entity that is closed to new members and elects to be a PIE should have the option of adopting flow-through, rather than this being a mandatory requirement. The Australasian exemption should be decoupled from the requirement to undertake flow-through. The requirement for a PIE to flow through income to investors and be taxed at the investors’ marginal tax rates should not be mandatory. Potentially the compliance costs associated with flow through could outweigh any benefit to those members that have a marginal tax rate of 19.5%. The legislation already allows this for defined benefit superannuation schemes, and this should be expanded to include any other entity that does not consider it cost effective to elect flow through. The decision on whether or not to adopt a flow-through basis for taxing investors should be made by the product provider, taking into account the costs involved and the likely benefit to that product’s investors, if any. To suggest that investors can have the over-taxation removed only if both measures are adopted is unreasonable. The proposals to reduce the tax burden on low income savers (the PIE regime) and the proposals for the taxation of equity investments are unrelated and should not be linked. The weakness in linking the two is that the tax rules for equities are of concern to a much wider constituency, and therefore subject to other pressures. The changes to the taxation of equities, in the current review process or by subsequent governments should not erode the benefits that could accrue under the PIE regime. Comment Officials consider that the use of investors’ prescribed tax rates is a key feature of the new PIE rules. This ensures that investors are taxed on their PIE income at their correct tax rate. Investment vehicles that are prepared to adopt this feature should be allowed the benefit of the Australasian share trading exclusion. As noted in response to previous submissions, a superannuation scheme which is eligible to be a PIE but does not elect to be one will be able to own 100% of a PIE. This will allow such schemes some of the key benefits of PIE status (tax free Australasian share gains) without incurring the compliance costs of attribution. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 95 STATUS OF PIE INVESTORS Issue: Taxation of revenue account investors Submissions (597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 596 – ISI, 578 – NZICA, 569 & 608 – ING, 592 – Tower, 586 – Promina Group Ltd, 556 – AMP, 557 – AllianceBernstein, 577 & 577a – ASB Group) The legislation should be amended to ensure that the taxable gain or loss arising on disposal of an interest in a PIE by a revenue account investor does not include attributed income or losses nor any amounts that are not otherwise taxable to them (realised share gains on New Zealand companies and Australian-resident listed company). Revenue account holders should be allowed to increase their cost base by the new amount of attributed taxable income. Previously attributed income should be either deducted in calculating any taxable gain or loss on realisation of an investment in PIE, or added to the cost price of the investment. Alternatively, PIEs should be given the option of notionally “passing out” to investors’ imputation credit balances (including any tax payable under the notional wind-up calculation), with these credits only being able to be used by revenue account investors in satisfaction of any tax liability on sale of the investment in the PIE (with the credits reduced for any distributions made by the PIE). ICs resulting from deferral of tax payments should be provided to revenue account holders if necessary. If a PIE holds an interest in another PIE on revenue account, there is also potential for double taxation. Revenue account holders of a PIE should be able to elect a 0% rate. Comment Officials do not consider that there is a policy basis for giving a separate exemption for investors who hold their PIE investments on revenue account. It is an inherent feature of the Income Tax Act that the tax treatment of each person is considered separately. Officials do not think it is possible for a PIE to hold an interest in another PIE on revenue account, owing to the proposed exclusion from tax for New Zealand share gains. This would mean that if the investor PIE disposed of its interest in the other PIE, these gains would not be taxable, and therefore there would be no double taxation. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 96 Issue: Determining capital/revenue account status Submission (597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers) PIE income could be deemed to be assessable income for the purpose of determining whether an investor is a capital or revenue account investor. Because a PIE pays PIE tax on attributed income of individual investors, and distributions from a PIE are excluded income, individual investors will not derive any assessable income. This may affect their ability to argue that they hold their PIE investment on capital account. Comment Officials consider that an amendment deeming distributions to be assessable income, for the purposes of determining capital/revenue account status, is not necessary. Such an amendment would unnecessarily complicate the law. Following enactment, officials will include a statement in the Tax Information Bulletin article on the new rules, clarifying that the exclusion for distributions from a PIE does not affect the capital account status of investors. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Effect of PIE income on social assistance Submissions (1143 – Retirement Policy & Research Centre, 613W – Phillips Fox, 657W – Sothertons Chartered Accountants) If an individual is potentially entitled to any state-provided benefit (such as income from Working for Families) or has an obligation to the state (such as a student loan) that, in either case, might be affected by the amount of the individual’s income, the investment income should affect those entitlements or obligations. This concession is manifestly inequitable and gives the impression that New Zealand investors are being bribed to invest in one particular investment structure. If implemented, this concession should apply to all investors regardless of the investment vehicle used. Comment The government decided that PIE income should not affect social assistance entitlements in order to encourage New Zealanders to save and participate in KiwiSaver. As investments in KiwiSaver funds would be locked in until retirement, it would not considered appropriate to abate savers’ family assistance entitlements or trigger student loan and child support repayment obligations for investment income that cannot be accessed until retirement. Officials note that, currently, those who save by investing in superannuation schemes do not have their social assistance affected by the scheme’s income since the income is deemed to be derived by the superannuation 97 scheme and not by the individual investors. The proposed PIE treatment is therefore consistent with this current treatment. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: PIE investors should have to file tax returns Submission (613W – Phillips Fox) The number of taxpayers that would be required to file tax returns solely because of PIE income is expected to be small, and there is no justifiable tax policy reason for such persons not to file returns. Comment The PIE tax rules are designed so that the PIE performs the tax compliance and pays the tax attributable to individual investors. This provides assurance that tax liabilities will be satisfied and minimises compliance costs of the investors. It also ensures that PIE income does not affect individuals’ social assistance entitlements. Officials also note that while, currently, there may not be many individuals who invest in managed funds and do not file tax returns, the number of individuals in that position is likely to grow with the advent of Kiwisaver. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Confirmation that PIE investors are not automatically revenue account traders Submission (734W – Todd Corporation) The bill should be amended to expressly confirm that if an investor buys and sells an interest in a PIE then that activity does not influence the capital/revenue account status of other investments held directly by that investor. Comment The PIE rules were intended to provide that investors who have capital account treatment for their own share trading receive the same treatment when they invest through a PIE, by providing a tax exemption for Australasian share trading income of the PIE. The rules were not intended to allow individuals who are share traders and therefore on revenue account to get the benefit of capital account treatment. We 98 therefore consider that individuals who actively trade in PIE interests should continue to be on revenue account. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Tax incentives for low income savers Submission (618W – The Retire Fund) Individuals with incomes over $60,000 or between $38,000 and $48,000 will pay PIE tax at a lower rate than their marginal tax rates. A similar concession should be introduced to encourage low income earners to undertake long-term savings commitments. Comment The PIE tax reform is significantly reducing the tax on low income savers who invest through managed funds by: • reducing the tax rate to the individual’s marginal rate (capped at 33%); • providing a tax exemption on Australasian share trading income derived by the PIE; and • if the Committee accepts officials’ recommendation regarding the fair dividend rate, reducing the tax on investing in offshore companies through active managed funds from a realised gains basis to a 5% deemed return basis. Officials do not consider that further tax concessions are necessary or advisable given the fiscal cost. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 99 PIE PROXIES: CUSTODIAN HOLDINGS IN PIES Clause 85 Issue: Custodial investors in PIEs Submissions (596 – ISI, 578 – NZICA, 569 – ING, 551 – Macquarie Goodman, 593 – Westpac NZ/BT Funds Management NZ, 600 – Fisher Funds Management Limited, 590 – Property Council, 584 – Smartshares Limited, 552 – Kiwi Income Property Trust, 557 – AllianceBernstein, 577 & 577a – ASB Group, 608 – ING Property Trust, 880 – First NZ Capital) Nominee holdings in PIEs should be treated as zero-rated investors, with the nominee receiving the gross amount and withholding the tax (on behalf of its investors). This could be implemented by extending the existing RWT proxy rules for income from AUTs to include PIE attributed income through a custodian. The PIE tax liability would likely need to be settled out of cash distributions from the PIE, or other cash held on account of the investor where no cash distribution is made. Custodial/nominee unit holders should be allowed to be set up with zero tax so that the tax reporting responsibility is held at their level as the tax status of its underlying investors is unknown. Comment Officials agree that nominees and wrap account providers should perform the PIE tax compliance obligations with respect to their clients. This is necessary as only these custodians, rather than the PIEs themselves, will have the necessary information about the individual investors. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted subject to officials’ comments. 100 DEFINED BENEFIT/HYBRID SCHEMES Clause 85 Issue: Clarification of available options Submission (567 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting) Greater clarity is needed in the legislation or provided in a Tax Information Bulletin at the earliest opportunity to explain the options available to defined benefit schemes and for steps to be taken to ensure the options are viable. Comment Officials will provide more information on compliance for defined benefit schemes in consultation with providers and publications such as the Tax Information Bulletin. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Unallocated amounts in defined benefit schemes Submissions (578 – NZICA, 582 – National Provident Fund, 577 & 577a – ASB Group, 925W – ASFONZ) Section HL 12(1)(c) deals with defined benefit schemes. A better solution may be to treat all unvested interests as interests of a notional person and taxed at the average rate of investors within the fund. The formula could be the sum of ((individual members’ liability/total liabilities) x individual members’ marginal tax rate x unallocated income) Comment The legislation provides that unallocated income of defined benefit schemes be subject to tax at 33%. Officials consider that this is better than the suggested weighted average tax rate as it is simpler. Further, the suggested solution could be subject to some manipulation because it would encourage the practice of keeping income unallocated if the weighted average tax rate is low. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 101 Issue: Allowing defined benefit schemes to carry forward losses Submission (594 – New Zealand Law Society) Section HL 14 should be amended to allow a loss incurred by a defined benefit scheme to be carried forward for offset against PIE income of the scheme. (Such losses cannot be attributed to investors.) Comment Officials agree with this submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Allowing hybrid schemes to become PIEs Submission (734W – Todd Corporation) Trustees of hybrid superannuation schemes should be able to elect to become a PIE, taking into consideration the relative mix of defined benefit and contribution members. If the trustees resolve to deem the whole scheme as comprising defined benefit members they should be able to do so with the default 33% rate applying. Comment Officials agree that the allocated income of defined contribution members should be taxed at the members’ tax rates, and the unallocated income of defined benefit members should be taxed at the 33% rate. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 102 AUSTRALASIAN TRADING EXEMPTION Clause 12 Issue: Extending the trading exemption to individuals/entities other than PIEs Submissions (569 & 608 – ING, 599 – Kingfish Limited, 600 – Fisher Funds Management Limited, 585 – NZX, 568 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 575 – Direct Broking Limited, 1142 – Carter Holt Harvey Employee Benefit Plan and Retirement Plan, 602 – ANZ National Bank, 734W – Todd Corporation, 880 – First NZ Capital, 674W – Waterfront Industry Superannuation Fund, 63W – Shaun Evans, 630 – Lockie & Associates) Extend the capital gains exemption on New Zealand and Australian equities to all unit trusts, superannuation funds, New Zealand life insurance companies and GIFs. If the preceding submission is accepted, redemptions from unit trusts that arise as result of off market share cancellations should not be taxed as a dividend. The sale of interests in certain entities that are not companies, such as partnerships and Australian listed property trusts, should be covered by the Australasian trading exemption. The exemption from tax on capital gains on the sale of domestic and Australian listed shares should be extended to all New Zealand taxpayers that are not in the business of share dealing. The bill creates a new distortion by allowing PIEs to “short-term trade” Australasian stocks without paying tax on gains – something the private investor cannot do. There is no logic to this radical shifting of the long-established revenue/capital boundary. Comment The PIE rules are intended to ensure that investors who get capital account treatment on their direct Australasian investments receive the same treatment when they invest through a PIE, by providing a tax exclusion for Australasian share gains made by the PIE. The rules were not intended to allow individuals who are share traders and on revenue account themselves to get the benefit of capital account treatment. Therefore the Australasian trading income exclusion should be available only to PIEs that are earning income on behalf of their (generally) capital account investors. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 103 Issue: Definition of Australian resident company Submissions (12a – NZ Funds, 595 – AXA) The residence requirement for an Australian resident listed company in new section CX 44C(a)(ii) should be clarified. The requirement for an Australian listed company to be an Australian tax-resident should be removed and replaced with an active income test. Comment The requirement that an Australian listed company be tax-resident in Australia is important to justify the tax exclusion for PIEs on their Australian shares gains. The reason for the exclusion is that Australian tax resident companies generally have a high dividend rate, with these dividends taxable to New Zealand shareholders. The high dividend payout rate is encouraged by incentives in the Australian tax system (for example, the franking system). Companies that are not tax-resident in Australia do not always have the same incentives to pay a high dividend. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: No deduction for cost of investment Submissions (597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 578 – NZICA, 589 – KPMG, 588 – Trustee Corporation Association of NZ, 577 & 577a – 577 & 577a – ASB Group) No deduction should be given for the cost of shares in New Zealand companies and Australian-resident listed companies that are subject to the realised share gains exclusion for PIEs. To achieve this, the legislation should be amended to prevent a deduction for opening stock (which would normally be allowed under section DB 40(4) of the Income Tax Act 2004) if the opening stock was used to derive excluded income under new section CX 44C. The legislation should also be amended to prevent a realised loss incurred from the sale of New Zealand and Australian-resident listed companies from being deductible to a PIE. Comment Officials agree with submissions. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 104 Issue: Anti-avoidance rules Submissions (597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 596 – ISI, 12a – NZ Funds, 578 – NZICA, 569 & 608 – ING, 589 – KPMG, 588 – Trustee Corporation Association of NZ, 592 – Tower, 593 – Westpac NZ/BT Funds Management NZ, 594 – New Zealand Law Society, 595 – AXA, 599 – Kingfish Limited, 600 – Fisher Funds Management Limited, 582 – National Provident Fund, 586 – Promina Group Ltd, 585 – NZX, 552 – Kiwi Income Property Trust, 556 – AMP, 557 – AllianceBernstein, 567 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting, 577 & 577a – ASB Group, 479W – Walker Capital Management, 679W – Goldman Sachs JBWere, 674W – Waterfront Industry Superannuation Fund) The sale and purchase of the same New Zealand or Australian share within 30 days, or where shares are sold cum-dividend, should result in only the dividend being taxable to the PIE under a targeted anti-avoidance provision. This rule should only apply when the shares are sold after declaration of the dividends and before the dividend is paid. Such an occurrence should also not give rise to taxable income on the disposal of the underlying investment itself. Alternatively, the existing dividend- stripping rules in section GB 1(3) should apply. Alternatively, a “safe harbour” provision should be introduced allowing fund managers to sell down up to 20% of an equity that is cum-dividend before the dividend portion is taxable. New section CX 44C(c), (d) and (e) – the wash-sale anti-avoidance rules in the Australasian trading exemption – should be removed and replaced by specific anti- avoidance provisions. Alternatively, new section CX 44C(d) should be redrafted so as not to catch normal commercial shares sales where settlement is at some future date. The restrictions on the share trading exclusion in proposed section CX 44C are unworkable and should be modified. In particular, paragraph (c) operates too broadly and should be omitted. Paragraph (d) is also unworkable because it adversely affects normal commercial arrangements and, accordingly, should be omitted or substantially modified. There should be exemptions from the anti-avoidance rules applying to Australian shares for trading in the normal course of business or if the sale transaction is out of the control of the PIE. The anti-avoidance rules in section CX 44C should not apply to New Zealand shares. The rule in section CX 44C(d) should be amended to focus on the time of acquisition. The 30-day re-purchase period anti-avoidance rule in section CX 44C(e) should be removed. Structured products specifically designed to remove equity risk should be taxed on any gains. However, the use of lock-up agreements (which are commonly conditional on the success of a takeover bid) should be allowed. The anti-avoidance rules, such as the “wash sale” provision could be included in the legislation for non-PIE investors. It is not appropriate to have a “wash sale” provision for PIE investors, as there are already rules covering the sale and repurchase of investments in New Zealand equities by PIEs. 105 Comment Officials agree that the anti-avoidance rule in new section CX 44C(c) should be amended so that the dividend amount in the arrangement is taxed when New Zealand and Australian shares are sold after a dividend has been declared but before the dividend is paid. Section CX 44C(d) should be amended to focus on the time of acquisition of the relevant shares or commencement of the arrangement. Section CX 44C(e) should be removed. Recommendation That the anti-avoidance rules in section CX 44C be amended in accordance with officials’ comments. Issue: Assessable income rules should be applied to Australian capital gains Submission (1478 – Mercer Investment Consulting) Under the Australasian trading gains exemption for PIEs, the effective tax rate on Australian shares more than halves and is less than New Zealand shares. If the intent is to level the playing field, then tax should be applied to at least 25% of the capital gains of Australian shares. Comment The suggested change is complicated and is inconsistent with the policy of not taxing PIEs on their trading income from selling Australian shares. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 106 Issue: Removal of the capital/revenue distinction for PIEs Submission (613W – Phillips Fox) Where a PIE is clearly a trader in shares/ investments such PIEs should be required to recognise, at the PIE level, those share gains as being on revenue account. Failure to maintain this distinction puts the PIE at an advantage to other types of investors, and gives indirect investors an advantage over direct investors. Comment The intent of the PIE reforms is to remove the current disadvantage for individual capital account investors to invest through a managed fund that holds its investments on revenue account. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 107 LAND-HOLDING PIES Clause 85 Issue: Grouping situations Submissions (578 – NZICA, 551 – Macquarie Goodman, 590 – Property Council, 585 – NZX, 552 – Kiwi Income Property Trust, 569 & 608 – ING Property Trust) When a property fund owns property through subsidiary companies, the PIE tax should be calculated at the “parent” PIE level. This would allow a loss making PIE subsidiary to offset land losses with the income of a profit making PIE. Comment Officials are recommending a simpler PIE tax regime for listed companies. It will use existing tax principles to a greater extent and include group loss offsets for companies in the same group of companies. This should address the concern raised in submissions. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Indirect investment in land Submissions (551 – Macquarie Goodman, 590 – Property Council, 585 – NZX, 552 – Kiwi Income Property Trust, 569 & 608 – ING Property Trust, 734W – Todd Corporation) Investments in land by way of an incorporated joint venture or a 100% subsidiary that only owns land should be treated as a direct investment in that land for the purposes of the PIE rules. The loss offset rules in subpart IG of the Income Tax Act should apply to allow the offset of net losses against net income where a PIE has an investment of 66% or greater in a company that was incorporated for the purpose of owning land as a passive investment. Comment Officials agree that an interest in a company of which 90% or more of its assets constitute land should be treated as an interest in land for the PIE rules. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 108 Issue: Land losses Submission (Matter raised by officials) The bill currently restricts net land losses from offsetting other PIE income in calculating PIE tax. This was done in order to prevent PIEs holding real property being used as tax shelters. The proposed treatment of land losses in the bill is complex. Given that most managed funds either invest very little in land, or, on the other hand, invest predominantly in land, officials recommend a simpler approach. For PIEs of which less than 50% of their assets is land, there would be no special treatment of losses. Losses could effectively flow through for the benefit of PIE investors. For PIEs of which 50% or more of their value is land, no losses would be allowed to flow through for the benefit of investors. Officials consider that this is a much simpler approach to address the base maintenance concern. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 109 LISTED PIES Clause 85 Submissions (597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 596 – ISI, 578 – NZICA, 551 – Macquarie Goodman, 594 – New Zealand Law Society, 599 – Kingfish Limited, 600 – Fisher Funds Management Limited, 590 – Property Council, 585 – NZX, 584 – Smartshares Limited, 552 – Kiwi Income Property Trust, 556 – AMP, 569 & 608 – ING Property Trust) Listed PIEs should have an option of attributing income using a “last man standing” option (as per the discussion document). That is, the taxable income calculation for listed entities should be done quarterly and a distribution equal to the value of the taxable income be made after the end of the quarter. Those investors who hold shares on the dividend payment date will derive the distribution. Tax should be deducted in the share registry of the listed entity from these distributions in accordance with investors’ elected tax rates. As the minimum period between announcing dividends and payment is three weeks (under NZX listing rules), listed PIEs should have an additional month to pay the tax to Inland Revenue. The commercial reality of listed entities means that they cannot be expected to allocate their income between investors on an average daily basis. The only practical method for them is to allocate income to persons who hold shares on specified record dates. A listed company should be eligible to become a PIE if they meet criteria equivalent to that for a qualifying unit trust under the Income Tax Act 2004 (amended to include all relevant vehicles including companies, group investment funds and superannuation schemes); or be a listed vehicle and: • is resident in New Zealand; and • meets the income interest requirement; and • meets the investment-type requirement; and • meets the investment value requirement. Listed PIEs should continue to pay provisional tax on their income on a quarterly basis, with the exception that gains on New Zealand and Australian shares will not be assessable. The current dividend rules would continue to apply (that is, the PIE attribution rules would not apply to investors). Any imputation credits should be able to be used by the investor, with any excess imputation credits being refundable. Although this approach means that investors would not benefit from losses which would be retained at the PIE level and not flowed through, this is a small price to pay for inclusion in the PIE rules and lower compliance costs. For listed entities, the PIE tax should be calculated on a six-monthly basis based on the marginal tax rates of the investors in the entity on the distribution record date. A six-monthly basis should be used as that is the frequency with which listed vehicles generally distribute dividends to shareholders and prepare their accounts for public release. 110 Comment Officials consider that the attribution problems for listed companies can be addressed by giving them similar treatment to qualifying companies. Listed PIEs would be subject to 33% company tax on their taxable income. They would be allowed to exclude income from trading Australasian shares. They would be subject to provisional tax and have to maintain an imputation credit account. When a listed PIE paid a dividend it would have to impute the dividend to the extent imputation credits are available. The dividend would be excluded income to the shareholder, with any attached imputation credits not able to be used; this means that the dividend would be subject to a maximum tax rate of 33%. However, a taxpayer would be able to elect to include the dividend in their assessable income, and use any attached imputation credit, by returning the dividend in a tax return; this means that shareholders on a 19.5% rate would be able to receive the benefit of excess imputation credits. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted subject to officials’ comments. 111 SUPERANNUATION FUNDS Clause 85 Issue: Simplified method for superannuation funds Submission (Matter raised by officials) After consultation with representatives from the superannuation funds industry, officials have developed a simplified system for superannuation funds that would allow them the benefits of being a PIE – primarily the Australasian share trading exclusion – without requiring some of the complexities of the attribution requirements of the normal PIE rules. Such a simplified system is desirable for superannuation funds which do not have some of the systems which make attribution more practicable. Comment A superannuation fund which meets the PIE eligibility criteria and elects into the simplified system would: • Pay provisional tax using a weighted average tax rate of its members. • Be required to do an accurate tax calculation for its tax year based on its actual income and the weighted average tax rate of its members. • Be required to make an annual investor interest adjustment within three months of the end of the tax year to ensure that 19.5% rate taxpayers receive an additional entitlement to reflect their lower tax rate. • Would be liable for the tax on the share of the current year’s income that is paid out to investors that exit the fund during a year. This would typically be the “interim interest rate” that superannuation funds pay out to exiting investors. It is expected that superannuation funds would fund a provision for this tax liability by making a deduction from the amount paid out to their exiting members. Losses and tax credits (such as imputation credits) would not pass through to members. Instead, they would be able to be used only to offset the tax liability of the superannuation fund. The tax rate applying to superannuation funds that are defined benefit schemes would be 33%. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 112 Issue: Treatment of unvested amounts Submissions (596 – ISI, 569 & 608 – ING, 582 – National Provident Fund, 567 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting, 577 & 577a – ASB Group, 674W – Waterfront Industry Superannuation Fund) Where unvested amounts are held in an individual account in an investor’s name, taxation should be at an individual’s elected rate, as otherwise the unvested amounts will be over-taxed. To the extent a scheme does not allocate all of its income, and unallocated amounts vest in members, such amounts should be taxed at the weighted average marginal tax rate of its members. Comment Officials understand that the background to this issue relates to the complexity surrounding identification of taxable income relating to vested and unvested contributions to member accounts, as superannuation administration systems record the total vested and unvested account balance as a single record associated with each individual member. We consider that prescribed investor rates should be used to tax income arising on unvested employer contributions subject to certain conditions. The recommended conditions are: • For schemes established before the bill was introduced, the vesting period cannot be increased over its current level. • New schemes established after the bill was introduced must have vesting periods equal to or less than three years, and for schemes meeting this condition, the contributions should vest in the employee within that vesting period. Recommendation That the submission be accepted subject to officials' comments. 113 Issue: Treatment of reserves Submission (674W – Waterfront Industry Superannuation Fund) Presumably, reserves will be treated as an entity interest. In particular, if there is an attributed loss for the full year (which will happen occasionally), what is the mechanism for a scheme to obtain a refund for that loss, as carry forward of losses appears to be precluded under clause HL 14 and there is no provision for paying rebates to an entity? Comment Income that is retained by PIEs in reserve accounts should attract PIE tax at the 33% prescribed investor rate. Officials consider that the legislation should be amended to allow losses that cannot be refunded under the PIE rules to be carried forward. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 114 LIFE INSURANCE Clause 85 Issue: Inclusion of life insurance in PIE rules Submissions (597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 596 – ISI, 578 – NZICA, 589 – KPMG, 588 – Trustee Corporation Association of NZ, 592 – Tower, 595 – AXA, 586 – Promina Group Ltd, 557 – AllianceBernstein, 568 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 577 & 577a – ASB Group) Life insurance companies should not be specifically excluded from being a PIE, or should at least be allowed to treat their investment-linked products under the PIE rules. It should be possible to remove these products from the life insurance tax regime. If life insurance companies are included in the PIE rules, the policyholder tax rate should be the average tax rate of the policy holders; share gains on New Zealand and Australian companies should be excluded income to the extent they support savings products; and a rebate for excluded income (NZ and Australian share gains) should be available against policyholder income. Where it is not possible or appropriate to remove savings products from the life insurance tax regime (that is, non-unitised products), it should still be possible to provide policyholders with the benefit of the exclusion from tax on New Zealand and Australian shares gains and for the rate of tax on policyholders’ income to be a blended rate based on their marginal tax rates. The policyholder base for life insurance companies should be eligible to become a PIE but be taxed at a flat rate of 33% rather than flow through at investors’ rates. Life insurers should either be able to apply a blended tax rate to take account of their 19.5% policyholders or be only required to collect Inland Revenue numbers and return PIE attributions allocated to those Inland Revenue numbers for those policyholders who are entitled to the 19.5% marginal tax rate. Comment On 17 August 2006 the government announced that it is to carry out a comprehensive review of the life insurance tax rules. The current rules have been operating in a largely unmodified form since 1990, even though the commercial, regulatory and savings environment has changed significantly in the intervening period. 115 In particular, this review will look at whether life insurance should be included in the rules for taxing PIEs, to prevent life insurance being disadvantaged relative to other savings vehicles. The review will be conducted in full consultation with the industry. It is expected that any changes emerging from the review will be included in a tax bill to be introduced next year. Recommendation That the submission be declined. However, the government’s review of the life insurance tax rules, which will consider including life insurance savings products in the PIE tax rules, should be noted. Issue: Policyholders to get benefit of PIE and FIF reforms Submissions (596 – ISI, 592 – Tower, 586 – Promina Group Ltd, 556 – AMP, 577 & 577a – ASB Group) The life insurance tax regime should be amended to ensure that the discount available under the proposed FIF rules (taxing 85% of offshore share gains instead of 100%) is also available to investors in life insurance savings products. To the extent that assets are held on behalf of policyholders, life insurers should be permitted to derive exempt capital gains from New Zealand and listed Australian equities. The calculation of tax under the policyholder base would need to be amended to ensure that this concession was not removed in the policyholder base tax return. As only 85% of FIF income will be taxable to individuals and PIEs a measure is required to prevent over-taxation of policyholders when these gains are distributed. The life insurance tax regime should also be amended to ensure that the benefits of investing into a PIE (the exclusion from tax for PIEs on their New Zealand and Australian share gains) are made available to investors in life insurance based savings products where the life insurer invests into a PIE. Comment As noted above, the government has announced it is undertaking a review of the life insurance rules. The review will include considering whether life insurers should be able to be PIEs. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. However, the government’s review of the life insurance tax rules, which will consider including life insurance savings products in the PIE tax rules, should be noted. 116 Issue: Life insurance company allowed to hold 100% of a PIE Submissions (596 – ISI, 592 – Tower, 586 – Promina Group Ltd, 577 & 577a – ASB Group) The PIE rules should allow a life insurance company to hold up to 100% of a PIE. The qualifying unit trust rules should be replicated to allow this. Comment Officials agree that a life insurance company should be allowed to hold up to 100% of a PIE. We do not consider, however, that it is necessary to replicate the qualifying unit trust rules to achieve this. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted subject to officials’ comments above. Issue: Interaction with other tax rules Submissions (596 – ISI, 577 & 577a – ASB Group) Any PIE income attributed to life insurance companies should replace any taxable income or deduction under any other provision in the Income Tax Act 2004. Comment Officials consider it is not necessary to have a special rule for PIE income derived by life insurers. Such income should be treated like any other income derived by a life insurer. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 117 Issue: Life insurer should be able to elect part of its business to become a PIE Submissions (586 – Promina Group Ltd, 577 & 577a – ASB Group) Where a life insurer has the ability to segregate a part of its business through having both separate accounting and investment records and that business only relates to investment policies held for the benefit of policyholders, that segregated part can elect to become a PIE. This segregated part would become a notional tax entity within the life company. Comment As noted above, the government has announced it is undertaking a review of the life insurance rules. The review will include considering whether life insurers should be able to be PIEs. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. However, the government’s review of the life insurance tax rules, which will consider including life insurance savings products in the PIE tax rules, should be noted. Issue: Non-resident life insurer to own up to 20% of a PIE Submission (552 – Kiwi Income Property Trust) There is no reason for excluding non-resident life insurers from the investor interest size requirement. Section HL 6(4)(a)(iii) should be amended by removing the words: “that is a New Zealand resident”. Comment This issue has been superseded by the recommendation to raise the general investor interest size requirement to 20 percent. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 118 Issue: Allowing non-resident life insurer with a New Zealand branch to own all of a PIE Submission (Matter raised by officials) A non-resident life insurer with a branch in New Zealand should be able to own up to 100% of a PIE if it would have satisfied the foreign investment vehicle definition without its New Zealand branch. Comment The New Zealand branch business of a non-resident life insurer may be treated under section EY 48 as being carried on by a separate company resident in New Zealand. This deeming provision could restrict the level of ownership in a PIE held by a non- resident life insurer. This restriction is inappropriate if the non-resident life insurer would have satisfied the foreign investment vehicle definition in proposed section HL 6(10) in the absence of this deeming provision. A non-resident life insurer with a New Zealand branch should continue to be treated as a non-resident for the purposes of the PIE rules, despite section EY 48. A foreign investment vehicle may own up to 100% of a PIE. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Life insurers to attribute income at investors’ marginal tax rates Submission (556 – AMP) Life companies should be permitted to elect to attribute income to individual investors in respect of investment-linked products. This would enable investors on the 19.5% marginal tax rate to achieve a consistent treatment with investors in PIEs. Income attributed from PIEs should be taxed in the life company, with no withholding at the PIE level. This is necessary to ensure that the life company generates imputation credits, which it will need to meet the liability in the policyholder base tax return. Comment Officials note that a life insurance company that invests in a PIE will receive income attributed at a 0% rate. The life insurance company will be responsible for paying the tax. 119 Recommendation That the submission be declined. However, the government’s review of the life insurance tax rules, which will consider including life insurance savings products in the PIE tax rules, should be noted. 120 INTERACTION WITH REST OF INCOME TAX ACT Issue: Relationship between PIE rules and other income tax provisions Submissions (589 – KPMG, 588 – Trustee Corporation Association of NZ, 593 – Westpac NZ/BT Funds Management NZ) The bill needs to clarify which parts of the Income Tax Act are to remain operative in relation to PIEs to provide certainty regarding the tax treatment. A PIE should not have to comply with the following regimes: ASC, Supplementary ASC, ICA and loss continuity. Comment Officials consider that a number of current provisions in the bill and further amendments will clarify which parts of the Income Tax Act remain applicable to PIEs. For example, because section ME 1 will specifically provide that a PIE cannot be an imputation credit account company, the various imputation provision will not be applicable to PIEs. The general rule is that unless a general provision is specifically “switched off” in relation to a PIE it should be treated as applying to a PIE. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Relationship between PIE rules and core provisions Submission (594 – New Zealand Law Society) The determination of PIE income should be simplified and made more consistent with the core provisions approach in the Act. There is no good reason for core provisions not to be applied to the calculation of income subject to PIE taxation. If it is not, the benefits of the rewrite process of the past 15 years will be significantly weakened. Comment Various drafting changes made to the PIE provisions in the bill since its introduction have made the PIE rules more consistent with the core provisions in the Income Tax Act. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 121 Issue: Making subpart HL a code Submission (12a – NZ Funds) The PIE regime should be drafted as a legislative code. Subpart HL should be drafted as a stand-alone legislative code so there is no doubt about the possible application of other tax regimes. Comment Having the PIE rules drafted as a stand-alone legislative code would be inconsistent with the general structure of the Income Tax Act and, in particular, core provisions. The rewrite of the Income Tax Act has involved, in part, replacing stand-alone legislative codes with more integrated provisions. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Exemption from income tax for PIEs Submission (597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The legislation should specifically state that a PIE is exempt from income tax on its portfolio investment income. Comment The submission incorrectly assumes that PIE tax is not income tax and is a separate tax. This is not the case. PIE tax is income tax. It would therefore not be correct to exempt PIEs from income tax. The relationship between the PIE provisions and other Income Tax Act provisions will be made clearer, as a result of amendments made at the Committee stage of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 122 Issue: Treatment of income distributed by a former PIE Submission (597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers) If a PIE exits the PIE rules, income derived up to the time of exit should be able to be subsequently distributed without the recipient having a tax liability in respect of that income (provided it has been taxed as attributed income). Comment Under proposed section CX 44D(2), income distributed by a PIE is excluded income to the investor. This exclusion should apply only for the period the entity qualifies as a PIE. It is within the control of a PIE to make a tax free distribution at any time up to when the entity ceases to be a PIE. The submission’s proposal would also significantly increase the complexity of the PIE rules as it would require amounts earned by an entity before and after it was a PIE to be separately tracked. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Relationship between PIE tax and dividend rules Submission (569 & 608 – ING) Amend sections CD 14, CD 32 and CZ 13 of the Income Tax Act 2004 so that these rules no longer apply to unit trusts and group investment funds that have elected into the PIE rules. Comment Under the PIE tax rules, all distributions from PIEs will be excluded income of investors, meaning that investors will not be taxable on any dividends. Officials do not consider it is necessary to make any further amendments to the dividend rules as suggested by the submission. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 123 Issue: CFC rules not to apply to PIEs Submission (12a – NZ Funds) The CFC rules should not apply to PIEs. If a PIE holds an interest in a CFC and that CFC has FIF interests, then the PIE would have to return the underlying FIF income. As the intention of the PIE rules is that all investments of a PIE are portfolio investments, the new FIF rules (and not the CFC rules) should apply. Comment Officials do not consider there is a policy basis for not applying the CFC rules to PIEs. If the offshore interests of PIEs come within the current CFC rules then it is appropriate that those rules rather than the new FIF rules apply to these interests. All interests coming within the current CFC rules should be treated the same. The proposal to apply the FIF rules instead of the normal CFC rules to interests in CFCs held by PIEs would also increase the overall complexity of the offshore tax rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Relationship between PIE tax and DWP rules Submissions (596 – ISI, 578 – NZICA, 569 & 608 – ING, 589 – KPMG, 593 – Westpac NZ/BT Funds Management NZ, 914W – Dominion Funds Group) PIE tax should override the dividend withholding payment obligations under the Income Tax Act 2004. Another option is to cap the DWP liability for PIEs at 15%, which will mean less tax is overpaid in the case of non-residents. Comment Officials consider it is appropriate to replace DWP with PIE income tax as this will simplify the operation of the PIE tax rules. Consequently, clause 104 of the bill, which relates to underlying foreign tax credits and is only relevant to DWP, should be omitted. Section MG 2 should also be amended to prevent a PIE being a dividend withholding payment account company (similar to how section ME 1 is being amended to prevent a PIE being an imputation credit account company). Recommendation That the submissions be accepted subject to officials’ comments. 124 Issue: Interaction with consolidation regime Submission (578 – NZICA) The effect of the PIE tax rules on a consolidated group should be clarified. Comment Officials do not consider that an amendment is necessary to clarify the relationship between the PIE tax rules and the consolidation rules. The normal consolidation rules should apply. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application of section FC 3 Submission (578 – NZICA) Section FC 3 of the Income Tax Act 2004, an anti-avoidance rule relating to share dealing, should not apply to PIEs. Comment Officials do not consider it is necessary to amend section FC 3 to provide that it does not apply to PIEs. In certain circumstances, section FC 3 treats a dividend as consideration received on the sale of shares. Because income derived from the sale of Australasian shares will be excluded income of PIEs, it is not possible for section FC 3 to have an adverse effect on PIEs. It is therefore not necessary to expressly exclude the application of the section to PIEs. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 125 Issue: Status of imputation credit accounts Submission (578 – NZICA) Where a fund had an imputation credit account prior to electing to be a PIE, it should be allowed to retain this. However, no further entries to the account should be allowed unless it ceases to be a PIE. Comment Under the PIE tax rules all distributions from a PIE – including distributions of income earned by an entity before it becomes a PIE – will be excluded income of investors. It is therefore not necessary for PIEs to maintain imputation credit accounts, which is why the legislation prevents PIEs from maintaining them. Officials do not consider it is necessary to make any further changes to the imputation rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Relationship with double tax agreements Submissions (589 – KPMG, TCA, 591 – Duncan Cotterill) Officials need to review the position to ensure that New Zealand’s network of double tax agreements is not put at risk. Because becoming a PIE is currently limited to New Zealand-resident entities, a foreign investment vehicle that invests in New Zealand will not be able to benefit from the capital gain exemption in the PIE rules. This difference in treatment could be a breach of New Zealand’s DTAs, in particular, non- discrimination clauses. Comment Officials consider that the PIE tax rules are consistent with New Zealand’s double tax agreements. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 126 Issue: Approach to legislating avoidance concerns Submission (12a – NZ Funds) Anti-avoidance measures (such as the PIE eligibility rules and the wash-sale rules for Australasian equities) should be removed from the substantive provisions in the bill. Where necessary, anti-avoidance matters should be addressed by specific provisions that have their application limited to transactions that have the intention and effect of avoiding tax. Comment Officials consider that the suggested approach of using “intention and effect” type anti-avoidance provisions would result in more uncertainty than the current objective rules (such as the wash-sale rules for Australasian equities). We therefore do not favour this approach. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Relationship between PIE quarters and tax year Submission (594 – New Zealand Law Society) There may not be the necessary linkage between the change in the PIE taxable period from a tax year to a quarter and the other provisions in the Income Tax Act. For example, it is not clear whether the deferral of a deduction under section EA 3 (pre- payments) is taken in the first quarter of the next year or is spread on a pro-rata basis over all the quarters of the next year. Comment The proposed amendment has been superseded by the recommended restructuring of the PIE tax rules, which will now provide the necessary linkage between PIE periods and income years. PIE periods will not be treated as separate income years and instead will fit within the existing income year structure of the Income Tax Act. This means that provisions like section EA 3 (prepayments) will continue to apply as they do currently. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 127 Issue: Definition of investor in section OB 1 Submission (567 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting) Clause 126(20)(c) amended the definition of “investor” in section OB 1. The new definition includes subsections for group investment funds, PIEs that are companies and PIEs that are not companies. It may be useful to have particular definitions to cover members and trustees of registered superannuation schemes. Comment The definition of “investor” for PIEs that are not companies will apply to registered superannuation schemes. Therefore, the suggested amendment is not necessary. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Non-PIE investment income tax rate capped at 33% Submissions (568 – Corporate Taxpayers Group, 880 – First NZ Capital) The tax rate cap of 33% on income earned through PIEs should be extended to all individual taxpayers for all forms of income from investment. That is, the maximum tax rate for individuals on interest and dividends should be capped at 33%. Comment These submissions, which seek to have the tax rate of all investment income earned by individuals capped at 33%, is outside the scope of the bill. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 128 TRUST DEED/COMPANY LAW OVERRIDES Clauses 166 to 171 Issue: Trust deed/company constitution overrides for investor interest adjustment Submissions (597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 578 – NZICA, 589 – KPMG, 588 – Trustee Corporation Association of NZ, 582 – National Provident Fund, 567 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting, 577 & 577a – ASB Group, 925W – ASFONZ, 613W – Phillips Fox, 618W – The Retire Fund) Proposed sections 42E of the Trustee Act 1956 and proposed section 12A of the Unit Trusts Act 1960 should provide the ability for the manager or trustee to adjust the interests of investors as required under section HL 6(3), notwithstanding any provision in the relevant trust deed or applicable governing legislation. An additional provision along the lines of proposed section 42E of the Trustee Act 1956 should be introduced for the benefit of managers or trustees of a GIF. The Trustee Companies Act 1967 should also be amended to ensure that trustees of group investment funds that elect to be PIEs are able to adjust investors’ interests. Is it necessary to provide a similar provision to that contained in clause 168 (power to adjust interests of investors in PIE despite any provision in the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989)? That would enable trustees to adjust the interests of members of non-PIE entities to allow for implications of the deemed disposal provisions in the FIF rules. To ensure clarity and simplicity of process, where a deed amendment is required to enable the PIE legislation to be implemented, relief should be granted under all related legislation including the Superannuation Schemes Act. For superannuation schemes, any deed amendments should be approved by the Government Actuary in lieu of member consent. Comment Officials agree that a provision similar to clause 168 in the bill should be included to amend the Trustee Companies Act, to authorise the trustee or manager (in the case of an externally managed fund) of a group investment fund to adjust the interests of investors as required under proposed section HL 6(3), despite any provision in the Trustee Companies Act or the relevant trust deed. For consistency, clause 168 should also be amended to authorise adjustments, despite any provision in the relevant trust deed. 129 Given that group investment funds can also be established under the Public Trust Act 2001 or the Public Trust Office Act 1957, a similar amendment allowing the interests of investors in these funds to be adjusted despite any provision in these Acts or the relevant trust deed, should also be made. Officials do not consider it necessary to provide a provision similar to clause 168 to enable trustees to adjust the interests of members of non-PIE entities to allow for implications of the deemed disposal provisions in the FIF rules. Deemed disposal provisions have been a feature of the FIF rules for many years, and it has not been considered necessary to have a provision overriding other trustee obligations. Recommendation That the submission to include a provision similar to clause 168 in relation to the Trustee Companies Act 1967 be accepted, subject to officials’ comments, and that a similar amendment also be made to legislation governing the Public Trust. Issue: Trust deed override for imputation credits Submission (569 & 608 – ING) The changes to section 12A of the Unit Trusts Act 1960 should be extended to cover changes arising as a result of the PIE tax rules to taxation of distributions and gains from redemption and the treatment of imputation credits. Comment The bill provides that all distributions from PIEs will be excluded income to investors. It is therefore not necessary for PIEs to maintain imputation credit accounts. Given this treatment of distribution, officials do not consider it is necessary to extend the current amendment in the bill to section 12A of the Unit Trusts Act 1960. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 130 Issue: Amendments to Companies Act 1993 to allow differential treatment Submission (594 – New Zealand Law Society) To avoid the requirement for a special resolution, a company which has made an election to be a PIE should also be empowered under the Companies Act 1993 to make differential adjustments to its shareholdings or to make differential distributions. Comment The requirements to adjust the interests of investors under section HL 6(3) will not apply to PIEs that are listed companies incorporated under the Companies Act 1993. It is therefore not necessary to amend the Companies Act 1993 to provide for this requirement. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Reference to property employed in a business Submissions (578 – NZICA, 589 – KPMG, 588 – Trustee Corporation Association of NZ) The amendments in clauses 168 and 171, which allow trustees to adjust investors’ interests, should not refer to property that is employed in a business (as this could narrow the ambit of these changes). Comment Officials agree that the amount of the relevant provisions should not be limited by referring to a business. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 131 TRANSITIONAL ISSUES Clause 85 Issue: Limiting notional wind-up to assets whose tax treatment changes Submissions (597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 596 – ISI, 578 – NZICA, 589 – KPMG, 588 – Trustee Corporation Association of NZ, 592 – Tower, 551 – Macquarie Goodman, 590 – Property Council, 582 – National Provident Fund, 585 – NZX, 552 – Kiwi Income Property Trust, 574 & 574a – Staples Rodway, 573 & 573a – Guinness Peat Group (supplementary submission), 569 & 608 – ING Property Trust) The transitional rules should focus on situations where revenue account assets change their status to become capital account assets. In particular, section HL 2 should apply either only to New Zealand and Australian equity investments or where investments move from revenue to capital account as a result of entry into the PIE rules. The deemed disposal and reacquisition on notional windup (that is, entry into the PIE tax rules) should not apply to depreciable property as the tax treatment of this asset class will not change. Section HL 2(3) should exclude from its scope investments in qualifying unit trusts, superannuation funds, and GIFs. The effect of HL 2(3), if retained in its current form, would mean that managed funds would not have a five-year holiday from the new rules at all in respect of their GPG shares. Proposed section HL 2(3) should be amended to provide that assets which will retain their existing tax character after the introduction of the new rules will not be deemed to be realised at the time a managed fund elects to be a PIE. Comment Officials agree that the deemed disposal and reacquisition of the property of entities becoming PIEs, under section HL 2(3), should apply only to New Zealand and Australian shares which will be subject to the proposed exclusion in section CX 44C for PIEs from tax on realised gains on Australasian shares. This is because it is only these assets whose status changes from revenue account to capital account, and it is appropriate that only accrued change in value is brought to tax. This more limited deemed disposition and reacquisition should apply to all shares in Australasian companies referred to in section CX 44C. Recommendation That the submissions to limit the application of section HL 2(3) to Australasian shares whose proceeds of sale will be excluded income be accepted. 132 Issue: Formation loss Submissions (12a – NZ Funds, 578 – NZICA) The references to “subparts IE and IF” in section HL13 should be removed on the basis that the PIE rules under subpart HL are a legislative code. The continuity of ownership rules in “subpart IE” should not apply to PIEs or to the rules in section HL 13 as the underlying policy objective is to preserve these losses. Comment Officials consider that it is not consistent with the scheme and structure of the Income Tax Act for losses to be carried forward other than under subparts IE and IF. Subpart HL cannot be a complete code unto itself as it is part of the Income Tax Act 1994. The normal rules in subpart IE and IF for carrying forward losses, including continuity of ownership requirements, should continue to apply to PIE formation losses where applicable. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Three-year spread of transition liability Submissions (597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 596 – ISI, 578 – NZICA, 595 – AXA, 567 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting, 577 & 577a – ASB Group, 925W – ASFONZ, 674W – Waterfront Industry Superannuation Fund) The due date for payment of the transitional tax liability, under section HL 2(3), in each of the three spread years should be specified in legislation. The tax payment crystallised on movement into the new FIF rules should be payable in three equal instalments over the next three years. The ability to spread under section HL 3(2) should be made elective so that entities can settle their tax obligations arising from notional wind-up earlier than the three- year period if so wished. The three-year deferral should be extended to all tax payments incurred as result of this bill, including those faced by non-PIE entities with significant offshore portfolio investments. Tax arising at 1 April 2007 should be spread for all entities and that the spread should be over a longer period, and suggest that at least five years is required. 133 Comment Officials consider it is reasonable for tax payments owing as a result of the entry of non-Australasian shares into the FIF rules to be spread in equal instalments over the three tax years starting from 1 April 2007. (This tax could be paid sooner if the taxpayer wishes to.) This spread should be for no longer than three years. The due date for payment will be the end of each of the three tax years. Recommendation That the submissions to spread the tax payable on movement into the new FIF rules over the next three years in equal instalments be accepted. Issue: Imposition of penalties and interest upon 3-year spread Submission (597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The legislation should be amended to stipulate that no penalties or interest will arise as a result of the PIE spreading the tax liability arising upon election to the PIE regime equally over a three-year period, as allowed under new section HL 3(2). Comment Officials consider it is already the effect of current section HL 3(2) that no penalties or interest will arise solely as a result of a PIE spreading its transitional tax liability equally over a three-year period. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Double taxation issue (retail and wholesale PIEs) Submissions (569 & 608 – ING, 593 – Westpac NZ/BT Funds Management NZ, 595 – AXA) Notional windup should not be required on assets held in an underlying vehicle (such as a wholesale fund) where the underlying vehicle also converts to a PIE. Alternatively, funds should be able to credit their imputation credit accounts with a deemed amount equivalent to the deferred tax liability created on transition and undertake a distribution with those deemed credits attached on 31 March 2007. 134 Comment Officials agree that the deemed disposition and reacquisition in proposed section HL 2(3) should not apply for shares held by a PIE in another entity that becomes a PIE because this otherwise could result in double taxation. Recommendation That the primary submission be accepted. Issue: Treatment of supplementary available subscribed capital account credit balances upon election to be a PIE Submissions (597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 569 & 608 – ING) Section MD 2A of the Income Tax Act 2004 should be amended to allow overpaid income tax to be refunded to a qualifying unit trust or group investment fund upon electing to be a PIE. It should be made clear in section MJ 1 that a PIE will no longer maintain a supplementary available subscribed capital account. Comment Officials agree that amendments should be made to allow overpaid income tax for a qualifying unit trust or group investment fund to be refunded to the extent provided in section MD 2A when it elects to be a PIE. The rationale for this proposed amendment is based on the ability of qualifying unit trusts and group investment funds to liquidate and obtain a refund of pre-paid tax in the same manner under current legislation. Officials agree that amendments should be made to provide that a PIE does not maintain a supplementary available subscribed capital account. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted subject to officials’ comments. 135 Issue: Distribution of income derived prior to PIE election Submissions (597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 569 & 608 – ING, 592 – Tower, 556 – AMP, 577 & 577a – ASB Group) The bill should be amended to specifically state that section CX 44D(2) will apply to income earned by a PIE both before and after election into the PIE rules. The proportion of retained earnings (pre-PIE income) not sheltered by imputation credits should be distributed by a PIE as excluded income. Comment Officials consider that the legislation already provides that the exclusion from tax for distributions from a PIE applies to income earned both before and after the entity elects into the PIE tax rules. A statement confirming this effect will be included in the Tax Information Bulletin article on the new rules (once enacted). Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Imputation credits attributed to revenue account investors Submissions (597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 592 – Tower) Immediately prior to the entry by a company (including a unit trust) into the PIE regime there should be a deemed distribution of imputation credits to revenue account investors, including deemed imputation credits in respect of tax payable on transition into the PIE regime. Comment Given that distributions from PIEs – including income earned before an entity becomes a PIE – will be excluded income to all investors, officials do not consider there is a case for transferring imputation credits to a revenue account investor. In any event, it would be inappropriate to stream imputation credits to revenue account investors only. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 136 Issue: Amnesty for initial period Submissions (12a – NZ Funds, 578 – NZICA, 584 – Smartshares Limited) A 12-month amnesty period should be provided (for one year from the date of application) for timing errors in taxable income and breaches of the qualification criteria. The amnesty should allow any incorrect tax position to remain unadjusted provided the position taken is consistent with the allocation of income to investors and unit pricing, and the difference is a timing difference. If the preceding submission is not accepted, at the very least there should be a 100% reduction in shortfall penalties if voluntary disclosure is made before the due date for filing the first annual reconciliation statement. There should be no application of penalties during the first year of the new regime. Comment Officials consider that amnesties are generally not desirable as they can be regarded as undermining the rule of law. Officials will be monitoring the new legislation and, where appropriate, will recommend remedial amendments with retrospective effect. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Transition into the new FIF rules Submission (597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 569 & 608 – ING, 592 – Tower, 582 – National Provident Fund) Income that arises on the deemed disposal of offshore equities by PIEs, on notional windup, should be determined under the new FIF rules for offshore equities that will apply from 1 April 2007 (that is, tax 100% of share gains on Australian resident listed companies and 85% of other gains). If Inland Revenue is concerned about the revenue impact of taxing revenue account share gains of PIEs at 85%, an option could be for funds to pay tax arising on the notional wind-up (on Australasian shares) in the first year, instead of spreading this liability over three years. 137 Comment Officials consider that the deemed disposition and reacquisition (notional wind-up for PIEs) should apply only to Australian and New Zealand equities that would be subject to the trading exclusion as these are the only class of asset whose tax treatment would change. This means that offshore shares (outside Australia) would not be affected by the notional wind-up and would be subject to the transitional rules proposed under the new FIF rules. The submissions have therefore been superseded by the amendment recommended by officials. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Treatment of income arising under HL 2(3) Submission (578 – NZICA) The legislation in section HL 2(3), relating to the deemed disposition of an entity’s property prior to becoming a PIE, needs to be clear as to how the income arising upon the deemed disposition is dealt with. In particular, it needs to be made explicit that this income arises under the existing (pre-PIE) tax rules. Imputation credits arising from tax paid on the deemed disposition should be able to be used under the FITC rules and thereby generate foreign tax credits for non-resident investors. Comment Officials consider the legislation is already clear that income arising from the deemed disposition under section HL 2(3) is dealt with under the existing tax rules. We consider that allowing distributions from PIEs of pre-PIE income, such as that arising under section HL 2(3), to be excluded income to all investors is an appropriate tax treatment. Applying FITC to distributions of pre-PIE income would unnecessarily complicate the PIE tax rules. Entities would be able to utilise any imputation credits under the FITC rules up until the time they become PIEs. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 138 Issue: Correcting tax references in HL 3(2) Submissions (596 – ISI, 12a – NZ Funds, 578 – NZICA, 569 & 608 – ING, 589 – KPMG, 588 – Trustee Corporation Association of NZ, 582 – National Provident Fund) The nature of the payment of tax arising on transition should be clarified to refer to provisional tax and terminal tax liabilities. Currently, section HL 3(2) refers only to liabilities under the resident withholding tax and non-resident withholding tax rules. Comment Officials agree with the submission. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 139 TECHNICAL AND DRAFTING ISSUES Clauses 85 and 126 Issue: Ordering of PIE tax calculation provisions Submission (578 – NZICA) Section HL 8, which further refines section HL 9, should follow the rules in section HL 9 and not precede them. Section HL 8 also needs clarification. Further, the interaction between sections HL 8, HL 9 and HL 12 to HL 16 is far from clear and requires clarification. Comment The PIE tax calculation provisions will be re-ordered to improve their comprehensibility. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Market value references in subpart HL Submission (12a – NZ Funds) Where market value is not available for the purposes of complying with provisions in the PIE tax rules for becoming or ceasing to be a PIE, “fair value” adopted for accounting should be sufficient. Comment Officials note that “market value” is a general concept used in the Income Tax Act 2004 and should be sufficient for the purposes of the provisions for becoming or ceasing to be a PIE. The tax rules do not currently contain a “fair value” concept, and officials consider that introducing such a concept would create uncertainty. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 140 Issue: Correcting PIE company references Submissions (597a – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 12a – NZ Funds, 589 – KPMG, 588 – Trustee Corporation Association of NZ, 594 – New Zealand Law Society, 567 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting) A number of provisions incorrectly assume that a PIE is a company: sections HL 6(9) and HL 17(4) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section 57B(1)(b) and (2)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. These references should be changed to refer to an entity. The reference to “shareholders” in section HL 6(9) should be replaced with “investors”. Comment Officials agree. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Definition of portfolio investor class taxable income Submission (567 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting) The definition of portfolio investor class taxable income in section HL 8 seems to contain a drafting error. In particular, as currently drafted, for the amount of portfolio investor class taxable income to be other than zero the portfolio investor class must have a portfolio investor class land loss. Presumably this was not intended. Comment Officials agree that section HL 8 contains a drafting error. This error should be corrected to ensure the provision caters correctly for situations where PIEs do not have a portfolio investor class net loss. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 141 Issue: Minor drafting issues Submissions (596 – ISI, 12a – NZ Funds, 578 – NZICA, 569 – ING, 551 – Macquarie Goodman, 594 – New Zealand Law Society, 590 – Property Council, 552 – Kiwi Income Property Trust, 567 – Mercer Human Resource Consulting, 914W – Dominion Funds Group, 608 – ING Property Trust) Replace “net income” with taxable income in new section HL 18(6). Replace “liquidation and formation” with re-acquisition of equity investments and land and buildings held on revenue account in new section HL 13. In the definition of “prescribed investor rate” in section OB 1, replace “attributed investment entity income” with “portfolio investor attributed income”. The words “the income year of the entity ends before the day on which the election is effective” under new section HL 2(3)(a) should be replaced with “the income year of the entity ends immediately before the day on which the election is effective”. The words “the total of the following amounts” under new section HL 9(1) should be replaced with “either of the following amounts”. The words “class net income” under new section HL 12 (5) and (7)(b) should be replaced with “class taxable income”. The words “from a period ending before” under new section HL 13(1) should be replaced with “from a period ending immediately before”. In the definition of portfolio investor interest fraction in section OB 1, “means the fraction which the investor is entitled to an amount of proceeds from a portfolio entity investment distributed by the entity to the investors in the portfolio interest class” should be replaced with “means the fraction to which the investor is distributed an amount from the portfolio entity investment of the entity”. The drafting of section CX 44C(a)(i) and HL 5(2)(b) should be the same as section ME 1(2)(b) in clause 113 of the bill. In section HL 2, the reference to “(entity)” after “person” is not standard drafting practice in the Income Tax Act, adds nothing, and should be deleted. Section HL 2(1) talks about “choose” whereas section HL 2(2) talks about “election”. The language should be standardised. The deemed disposal rules in section Hl 2(3) and HL 4(2) should be made consistent with other deemed disposal rules in the Act. Language referring to percentages “of the total interest”, percentages “of value of the entity’s assets”, and percentages “of value of the company” should be standardised as much as possible. 142 The references to value to the term “value” in section HL 6(6) and (7) should be replaced with the term “market value”. In the definition of portfolio investor rate individuals should only be required to notify the PIE if their tax rate is not 33%. In HL 18(6), the reference to “net income” should be replaced with “taxable income”. In section HL 13, “liquidation” and “formation” should be replaced with notional disposal and reacquisition of equity investments and land and buildings held on revenue account if not held by listed entities. An amendment is needed to section NG 1(2) of the Act to clarify that a distribution from a listed PIE will not be subject to NRWT. Section CX 44D(1) should be redrafted. On the basis of the current wording, an investor who provides a portfolio investor rate at the beginning of the portfolio entity period that is lower than his or her prescribed investor rate but who amends this to the correct rate before the end of the portfolio entity period does not satisfy part (1)(b). Any portfolio investor attributed income for this investor will not be excluded income. For clarity, section HL 2(3)(a) should read “..the income year of the entity ends on the day before the election is effective” and not “...the income year of the entity ends before the day on which...” Section HL 6(9) states, “An entity is not eligible to be a portfolio investment entity if...”. This would be better stated as, “An entity will cease to be eligible to continue to be a portfolio investment entity...” The formula for calculating PIE tax contained in section HL 12 is incorrect. The definition of “class income” needs to refer to the portfolio investor class net income for the portfolio entity period. In section HL 18(4) the definition of “credit” should refer to the amount of credit received for the portfolio entity period. Comment As part of the recommended amendments to the bill, the PIE tax rules in the bill will be restructured to make them clearer and ensure that they achieve their intended effect. Officials consider that the minor remedial amendments listed above should be taken into account as part of the amendments restructuring the PIE tax rules. Recommendation That the proposed minor remedial amendments be taken into account in amending the PIE tax rules.
