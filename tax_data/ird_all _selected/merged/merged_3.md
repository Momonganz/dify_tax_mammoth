Consultative Document on Superannuation and Life Insurance Volume 1 MARCH 1988 Consultative Document on Superannuation and Life Insurance Volume 1 MARCH 1988 PREFACE Introduction In the Government’s Economic Statement of 17 December 1987, I announced that the tax treatment of superannuation and life insurance would be moved onto the same basis as other forms of savings and investment. This consultative document discusses the reasons behind that decision and presents detailed proposals for the implementation of a non-concessionary regime. The Tax Reform Programme The present reform exercise represents the final stage in a process that began in 1982 with the partial removal of tax concessions for lump sum superannuation schemes. Further changes, announced in my first Budget in 1984, moved the tax treatment of life insurance and superannuation closer to the desired neutral regime. At the same time I announced that all aspects of the taxation of life insurance, superannuation and related areas would be reviewed. Since then other major tax reform projects have taken precedence, including the introduction of GST, the associated changes to the income tax scale, Family Support, and a number of significant reforms relating to the tax treatment of capital income. Changes to the tax treatment of capital income have been aimed at achieving a consistent treatment of income from investment, irrespective of the form that investment takes and the institution through which it is made. In this way, the potential for the tax system to influence investment decisions and thus distort the allocation of resources within the economy can be minimised. The application of a consistent tax treatment for income from alternative types of investment also puts an end to a variety of tax avoidance practices which have been used for the benefit of a few at the expense of the community as a whole. ii Recently attention has been focussed on the introduction of a full imputation system for the taxation of company income and the reform of the tax treatment of income earned offshore. These measures are currently under review by the Consultative Committee on International Taxation and Full Imputation. Superannuation and Life Insurance Under the system applying before 17 December 1987, the tax treatment of savings made through superannuation (and, to a lesser extent, life insurance) was highly concessionary. These concessions provided benefits to those covered by such schemes at the expense of other taxpayers. Since such coverage is more common amongst those on higher incomes, the benefits from the concessions have not been distributed fairly. Furthermore, the concessions have distorted people's savings and investment decisions as well as impacting on employment contracts and creating numerous avenues for tax planning. The Government has of course considered the arguments in favour of concessions for these forms of saving but found them unconvincing. Our reasons for rejecting these arguments are discussed in the document. At an estimated revenue cost of $660 million in 1988/89, the tax concessions for superannuation and life insurance have been very expensive. It is important to appreciate that without their removal it would not have been possible to provide the further cuts in the company and personal rates of income tax that were announced on 10 February 1988. Transition to a Non-Concessionary Regime As can readily be seen from the present tax regime applying to superannuation, reform in the area of superannuation is inevitably complex. This complexity arises from the long-term nature of the contractual obligations involved, and the need to iii protect individuals who would be unduly disadvantaged by the immediate removal of concessions. Previous reforms have employed the "grandfathering” approach whereby those who had joined schemes or taken-out policies prior to the announcement of reforms were able to continue to benefit from concessions - in some cases, for very long periods. Piecemeal reforms, coupled with this approach to transition, have produced the present intractable system of categories of superannuation, each with its own peculiar tax regime. The objectives of the transition process considered in this document will be to protect the position of those in or near retirement, minimise disruption to the industry and the economy and, if possible, produce a regime that is less complex than the present one. The Consultative Process A committee has been formed to consider the detailed proposals set out in this document and receive submissions on the proposals from interested groups and individuals. The Committee will also be asked to prepare draft legislation to give effect to their recommendations. The Government invites public consideration of this document and welcomes suggestions on ways to improve the implementation of and transition to a neutral tax regime for life insurance and superannuation.

The Importance of Superannuation and Life Insurance Superannuation funds and life offices have played an important role as vehicles through which people have accumulated savings. The extent to which people have saved through life insurance is indicated by the fact that life offices have almost three million policies in existence with respect to their New Zealand business and have assets of over $10 billion. Non-superannuation premiums for the year ending with the September quarter 1987 totalled some $620 million. A survey commissioned by the Life Offices Association in February 1985 and conducted by the Heylen Research Centre estimated that approximately half the New Zealand population over the age of fifteen years have some form of life insurance cover. Superannuation membership is also extensive. Over 700,000 people belong to superannuation schemes which hold total funds amounting to some $11.5 billion with annual contributions of over $1.4 billion. Superannuation funds and life offices are therefore repositories of a very significant level of savings for large numbers of people. It is thus important that these institutions, and those who save through them, be taxed in a manner which is both fair and economically efficient. 1.2 Announced Policy Changes In the Economic Statement of 17 December 1987 the Minister of Finance announced major changes to the taxation of superannuation and life insurance. The announced changes were detailed in Annex 3 of the Statement. Further details were announced in the 10 February press statement of the Minister of Finance. Those statements are reproduced in Appendix Al.1 of this Document. 2 In essence, the announced changes involve: - removal of the previous tax exemption for member superannuation contributions and life insurance premia; - removal of the fringe benefit tax exemption for employer superannuation contributions and employer-paid life insurance premia; - removal of the tax exemption previously enjoyed by most superannuation funds; and - removal of the tax impost on superannuation pension benefits. 1.3 Overview of the Reasons for Reform Since taking office the Government has embarked on a major programme of taxation reform. The overall aim has been to raise taxation revenue in a way which is more efficient (in that it imposes the lowest possible economic costs on the community.) , fairer (with the tax burden being distributed equitably across different sectors of the community) and simpler than the tax system inherited in July 1984. Broadly, the means of achieving those objectives are to broaden the tax base by, for instance, removing income tax concessions and introducing GST, and by making tax rates lower and less variable. The business taxation measures announced on 17 December 1987 have advanced this process considerably. Central to those measures was a more consistent tax treatment of capital income, that is income from savings and investments of various kinds. In the past saving and investment income has been treated differently according to the type of saving or investment made and the institutional form through which that investment or 3 saving was channelled. That distorted the pattern of savings and investment, resulted in some taxpayers being favourably treated relative to other taxpayers, and added to the complexity of the income tax system. Reforms over the past few years (such as the accruals regime for debt instruments, the primary sector taxation reforms, and the phased removal of accelerated depreciation allowances) have gone a long way to reducing tax imposed distortions in saving and investment patterns. Considerable anomalies, however, remained. Savings and investments chanelled through companies were, in general, taxed penally. The so-called classical corporate tax system taxed company income twice: once when it was derived by the company and secondly when it was distributed to shareholders as dividends. That penal treatment will be removed by the implementation of the imputation system outlined in the December 1987 Consultative Document on Full Imputation. The primary stated objective of the imputation system is to ensure that, as far as possible, income earned through a company, is taxed at the marginal rates of the shareholders in the company. While savings and investments chanelled through companies were in general penally taxed, those chanelled through offshore companies and similar entities could receive significant tax advantages since the income accumulating offshore could remain free of New Zealand tax, at least until distributed back to New Zealand resident individuals. That anomaly, and policies to deal with it, are outlined in the December 1987 Consultative Document on International Tax Reform. A stated objective of those measures is thus to reduce the extent to which the tax system encourages offshore investment relative to investment in New Zealand and biases the form in which offshore investment is made. A third major distortion in the taxation of savings and investment income has been the tax exemption for certain increases in wealth which fall within the category of capital rather than income gains. It was announced in the 17 December 4 Economic Statement that the Government intended to examine intensively the scope for the introduction of capital gains and/or asset taxes. Savings channelled through superannuation schemes have also received concessionary tax treatment vis a vis savings and investments through other intermediaries. In particular, for many superannuation schemes investment income (the equivalent of interest income on the savings) was not subject to taxation as it was derived by the superannuation fund. To implement the Government's overall objective of removing differences in the tax treatment of different forms of savings and investment income it was obviously necessary to remove that exemption. As noted above, life insurance is an additional instrument through which considerable savings are channelled. Life insurance has a tax regime which is peculiar to that form of saving. A review of the taxation of life insurance is therefore appropriate at a time when the rules on the taxation of capital income in general are being brought more closely into line. There is a connection between superannuation and life insurance. Partly this is historical. Because of their experience as investment managers, a large proportion of superannuation is conducted through or mangaged by life offices. In part the connection is related to the fact that both life insurance and superannuation can be savings instruments with a return which, to some extent, is dependent on mortality and/or other human contingencies. This connection between life insurance and superannuation is not by itself a reason for including them both within the ambit of the same review process. However, since life insurance needs to be considered as part of the overall measures aligning the taxation of capital income, the connections between these two forms of saving and investment means that they can be conveniently considered together. 5 The important point to note is that the announced changes to the tax treatment of superannuation and life insurance constitute an integral part of the business taxation reforms announced on 17 December 1987 which has as one of its objectives the consistent tax treatment of income derived from savings and investment. The measures in this area should not be seen in isolation from the announced international tax reforms and corporate imputation. Moreover, the international reforms and the superannuation and life insurance reforms are both measures which reduce taxation concessions and thus should result in an increase in taxation revenue. That increase in revenue is able to be used to assist in offsetting the reduction in revenue which should result from imputation and to assist in paying for the major reductions in personal and corporate taxation rates which were announced on 10 February 1988. In turn those reduced tax rates make the international tax measures and the changes to superannuation and life insurance more feasible. The inter-dependency between the various measures announced by the Government needs to be recognised. 1.4 Objectives of the Superannuation and Life Insurance Taxation Reforms The objectives of the reforms in this area are: a to ensure that, as far as possible, income derived from savings in a superannuation fund or life office are taxed at the marginal rates of the scheme members and policyholders; b to seek to tax the income of the life office itself on the same basis as income derived by other companies; 6 c to minimise the disruption the new regime imposes on superannuation funds, scheme members, life offices and policyholders; d to apply the same principles to related areas such as friendly societies, medical insurance and annuities; and e to minimise the additional administrative and compliance costs of the new provisions. 1.5 Purpose and Scope of the Consultative Document This Document reviews the taxation of superannuation and life insurance and the regulatory regime in which it operates. it explains why changes in this area were considered desirable and why possible alternative policy responses were rejected. It also outlines a number of detailed measures to implement the announced policy so that interested parties can have an opportunity to present their views on implementation details before final decisions are made. The main areas which require detailed consideration are: - the basis on which the income of a superannuation fund is to be calculated; - the basis on which the income of a life office is to be calculated; - the taxation of annuities; - an appropriate regulatory regime for superannuation and life insurance; - appropriate guidelines to achieve a smooth transition to the new tax regime for superannuation and life 7 insurance and to facilitate, where necessary, the renegotiation of superannuation schemes; - the taxation of friendly societies; and - the taxation of medical insurance. 1.6 The Consultative Committee The Government invites the public to make submissions on the matters set out in this document. Submissions will also be sought on the Government's decision to remove the income tax exemption for charitable bodies and sporting organisations. These areas will be the subject of a separate consultative document to be released in March 1988. A Consultative Committee has been appointed to receive and consider submissions on superannuation, life insurance, related areas, charitable bodies and sporting organisations. The Committee is comprised of: - Dr Donald Brash (Chairman), Managing Director of Trust Bank Holdings Limited; - Dr Geoff Harley, a tax partner with Rudd Watts and Stone, barristers and solicitors; - Mr Robin Oliver, a manager with McLeod Lojkine Associates, chartered accountants; - Mr Neil Malley, Director, William M Mercer-Ericksen Ltd, consulting actuaries; - Mr John Drage, a partner with KPMG Peat Marwick, chartered accountants. 8 In addition, the Government Actuary, Mr Allan Archer, will act as technical adviser to the Committee. The Committee's terms of reference are: a to receive public submissions on matters concerning the implementation and operation of the measures proposed in this consultative document as well as the announced measures concerning the taxation of charitable bodies and sporting organisations; b to report to the Minster of Finance on: i matters covered in this consultative document, or raised in submissions concerning the implementation and administration of the taxation and regulatory changes to superannuation, life insurance and related areas; ii possible amendments to the detailed changes set out in this document which, while consistent with the Government's policy announcements and policy objectives, would assist their smooth introduction and administration; and iii the most effective means of implementing the announced changes to the taxation of charities and sporting bodies; and c to prepare draft legislation to give effect to the recommended means of implementing the Government's announced policy changes in the areas of superannuation, life insurance, related areas, charitable bodies and sporting organisations. The Committee is to report to the Minister of Finance by 29 April 1988 on those matters which need to be implemented in order to 9 allow the changes to the taxation treatment of superannuation to be implemented. It is to report to the Minister of Finance on the remaining items in its terms of reference relating to superannuation and life insurance by 27 May 1988. 1.7 Submissions Submissions on those matters raised in this consultative document should be lodged by 8 April 1988. A date for submissions on the tax treatment of charitable bodies and sporting organisations will be announced when the consultative document on those areas is released in March. All submissions should be on A4-size paper, typed in double space on one side of the page only and should contain a brief summary of their main points and recommendations. Please send a total of 8 copies. Submissions should be sent to: The Chairman, Consultative Committee on Superannuation, Life Insurance and Related Areas, c/- The Treasury, PO Box 3724, WELLINGTON All submissions received by the due date will be acknowledged. 1.8 Outline of the Document To allow for the earliest possible release of material relating to the Government's detailed proposals for transition to a non­ concessionary regime, the document has been split into two volumes for separate release. Volume 1 is divided into 3 parts. Part 1 canvasses the subject matter of the review. It includes this introductory chapter plus a general chapter on superannuation and life insurance. 10 Part 2 considers policy aspects behind the taxation of savings. It has chapters on the the income taxation of savings, the past concessionary tax treatment of superannuation and life insurance, the tax policy defects of that tax regime, and arguments which have been advanced for maintaining that concessionary regime. Part 3 details the announced changes to the taxation of savings accumulated through superannuation schemes and life offices. Chapters cover the tax treatment of savings in a superannuation scheme, the tax treatment of savings in a life office, transitional issues, and the regulatory regime for superannuation. Volume 2, which will be available approximately one week later than Volume 1, considers the remaining issues in this review. Chapters cover the taxation of life offices, the regulation of life offices, the taxation of annuities, friendly societies and medical/sickness insurance. 1.9 Meaning of the Terms Used A glossary of the terms used is appended at the end of this document. 11 APPENDIX Al.1 GOVERNMENT STATEMENTS PRESS STATEMENT THE MINISTER OF FINANCE HON. R 0 DOUGLAS 10 February 1988 Finance Minister Roger Douglas today announced the following detail of implementation of aspects of the 17 December 1987 economic statement. BUSINESS AND COMPANY TAX REFORM Cabinet has agreed to the following business and company tax measures: . the rate of tax for resident companies for 199/89 will be 28 percent, and for non-resident companies 33 percent. Other tax rates and rebates which are aligned with the company tax rate will be adjusted accordingly; . the rate of fringe benefit tax for employer superannuation contributions will be 24 percent; . legislation implementing the announced changes to the assessment of provisional tax and the taxation of co-operatives and producer boards will be introduced early this year; . the deductions under sections 145, 146, and 147 of the Income Tax Act relating to donations will be abolished from 1 April 1988; . the removal of the tax exemption for sporting bodies will be deferred until 31 March 1989, to allow time for interested parties to make submissions to the Brash Committee considering this and other issues; 12 . the process of consultation and implementation for the international tax and company shareholder imputation proposals will proceed as announced; . the consultative document on superannuation and life insurance will be available before the end of the month. Cabinet has now received the legal opinion from the Solicitor-General regarding the superannuation and life insurance tax changes announced in the 17 December statement. This confirms the constitutional validity of the Government's announcement to end the tax concessions for superannuation and life insurance contributions from 17 December 1987. Cabinet has agreed to the early introduction of legislation to give effect to this measure as originally announced. The rate of tax for the income of superannuation schemes will be 25 percent from 1 April 1988. The rate of tax for life offices is yet to be determined following consultation. INDIRECT TAXATION Cabinet has decided that: . the proposed $200 million cut in excise duties on fuels from 1 April 1988 will now be postponed and reconsidered; . as announced, GST will not be increased before 1 October 1988; . the one month return period for registered traders with a turnover exceeding $24 million will proceed from 1 April 1988; . GST base-broadening measures to treat business activities of non-profit bodies in a similar manner to other registered traders will be deferred until 1 October 1988. 13 PERSONAL TAX Cabinet has decided that the personal tax rates and other related tax rates for the 1988/89 income year will be based on the following measures, to take effect from 1 October 1988: . the scale of marginal personal tax rates will be 24 percent up to $30,875 p.a., and 33 percent above that level; . in addition, there will be a rebate of 9 percent of taxable income up to a maximum of $855 in a full year, abating at 4 cents in the dollar between incomes of $9,500 and $30,875. Eligibility for the rebate has yet to be finalised; . consequential adjustments will be made to the National Superannuation surcharge and Family Support. These will maintain the present net position under these schemes; . the charitable donations and school fees rebate, and dependent relative rebate will be abolished from 1 April 1988; . the deduction for most employment-related expense will be abolished from 1 April 1988; . from 1 April 1988, the present housekeeper rebate will be enhanced and expanded to bring in a wider range of childcare expenses. Details have yet to be finalised. Cabinet and the Ad Hoc Committee will continue to work on the other measures in the 17 December statement. The fiscal impact of the measures announced will be positive in 1988/89. In the medium term the continued attainment of improvements in the structural fiscal position will require further attention to be given to the quality and level of government spending and revenue. 14 These announcements confirm the tax environment for businesses for 1988/89, prior to finalising the other tax and income maintenance announcements in the 17 December economic statement. They give certainty for business and individuals to plan for the year ahead, while allowing the Government sufficient time to work through the implementation of the remainder of the 17 December statement. 15 CHAPTER 2 - SUPERANNUATION AND LIFE INSURANCE 2.1 Introduction As both repositories for savings, and as sources of loanable funds, superannuation schemes and life offices play a significant role in channelling funds from savers to borrowers. In addition, they have important roles in their specialised functions of providing retirement benefits and insuring against risk. This chapter provides a brief survey of the role of superannuation and life insurance in the New Zealand financial system, the function of superannuation schemes and life offices, and the various types of schemes and offices. More detailed information is provided on the two largest superannuation schemes (the Government Superannuation Fund and the National Provident Fund). As well as providing an overview of superannuation and life insurance, this chapter highlights the importance of an appropriate tax and regulatory treatment of superannuation and life insurance to the health of the economy. 2.2 Superannuation and Life Insurance in the New Zealand Financial System Superannuation funds and life offices constitute a substantial part of the New Zealand financial system. In 1987, superannuation schemes had total assets of almost $11.4 billion (including superannuation funds managed by life offices). In March 1987 the major New Zealand assets of life offices stood at over $10 billion. Table 2.1 outlines the growth in the assets of private superannuation schemes over recent years excluding those managed by life offices. Table 2.2 provides data on the Government Superannuation Fund and Table 2.3 data on the National Provident Fund (these funds are not included in Table 2.1). All three tables indicate a fairly rapid growth in the assets of superannuation funds in recent years.

Life offices experienced rapid growth in the 1950s and 1960s. That growth levelled off in the 1970s with a decline in the real value of assets over that decade. That has been offset by significant real increases in the value of assets over the 1980s.

It is also a means of providing a retirement income for those whose occupation requires them to retire early (examples are: airline pilots, the police, and the armed services). Most large firms administer their own superannuation schemes for employees, arrange the investment of the scheme's assets, and provide their own death, disability and pension cover. Smaller firms with less substantial superannuation schemes may prefer to arrange for one or more of these three areas to be serviced by an external agency. Firms with only a few employees are more likely to have a composite superannuation package provided totally by another organisation. Life insurance companies offer services in all three areas (administration, investment and insurance cover) whilst banks and investment companies and other financial intermediaries offer administration and investment services. Specialist superannuation companies also exist specifically to provide administration and investment services for superannuation 19 schemes. 2 .4 Coverage and Size of Superannuation Schemes As in other Western countries, widespread private superannuation coverage in New Zealand is largely a phenomenon of the period since the Second World War. While some schemes date back to the last century - the 1850s for the first New Zealand civil service scheme and 1887 for the BNZ scheme - employee superannuation schemes generally did not develop until the early years of this century. Even then employee schemes were largely only available to state servants and employees of large companies with stable workforces. Internationally this tended to be large financial institutions, railways and utilities. In the 1980s superannuation coverage still tends to be limited. Table 2.5 below shows that in 1987 employee superannuation schemes covered about 420,000 members with annual contributions of about $1.2 billion and funds of about $10.2 billion. Personal schemes covered about 210,000 members with contributions of $0.2 billion and funds totalling some $1.2 billion. The classification of superannuation schemes used in this table - employee, personal, pension, and lump sum - is explained below. 20 Table 2.5 Analysis of Superannuation Schemes in 1987 Number of Contributors (000) Contributions ($million) Funds ($million) Employee Superannuation Schemes a Pension Schemes Managed by life offices1 42 132 1,379 Managed by other financial institutions 73136 1,606 Government Superannuation Fund (GSF) 84 4694 1,686 Self-Managed3 75 275 3,848 Sub-total 274 1,012 8.569 b Lump Sum Schemes Managed by life offices 30 70 683 Managed by other financial institutions 26 31 320 Self-Managed 27 69 670 Sub-total 83 170 1,673 Total Employee Schemes 357 1,182 10,242 21 Number of Members (000) Contributions ($million) Funds ($million) Personal Superannuation Schemes a Pension Schemes Managed by life offices 37 28 108 Managed by other financial institutions2514 218 Self-Managed2 2 5 Sub-total6444 331 b Lump Sum Schemes Managed by life offices 3928 157 Managed by other financial institutions 63 46 430 Self-Managed3779 325 Sub-total 139 153 912 Total Personal Schemes203197 1,243 Total All Superannuation Schemes 5605 1,379 11,485 Number of Pensioner;s - 69,000 22 Notes 1 Schemes where a life office manages the scheme and generally provides investment services (without necessarily investing all the funds). 2 Schemes where a non-life office financial intermediary (including the NPF) manages the scheme and generally provides investment services (without necessarily investing all the funds). 3 Self-managed includes schemes where the administration is performed by an organisation which is not a financial intermediary. Many of these schemes will have appointed one or more life offices or other financial intermediaries to invest some of the funds. 4 Includes Government subsidy on an unfunded basis. 5 Double counting will exist in that some persons contribute to personal as well as employee schemes. 6 The figures are based on scheme financial years ending in 1987 (or earlier years if later figures are unavailable). 7 There are 3,600 approved employee schemes and 900 approved personal schemes. The number of employee schemes is very much lower than the number of employers involved because several organisations operate schemes which can embrace many small employers under a single master trust arrangement. Source: Government Actuary This means that only about 26 per cent of the labour force belong to an employee superannuation scheme. Even in the public service, participation is only about 60 per cent. A substantial portion of superannuation funds are held in either the Government Superannuation Fund (GSF), which offers superannuation to all state servants, or the National Provident Fund (NPF), which provides superannuation for members of local 23 bodies, farm employees, members of the public, and members of employer-subsidised schemes. Privately administered superannuation funds, however, control a significant proportion - probably around 18 per cent of the funds of all superannuation schemes in existence. 2.5 Superannuation Scheme Participants There may be up to four participants in superannuation schemes: a employers: generally, it is the employer who establishes an employee superannuation scheme. Employers usually have a liability to contribute to such a scheme which can be regarded as part of the overall remuneration paid to employees; b trustees: trustees are responsible for the legal custodianship of the scheme. Trustees must comply with trustee law and the Superannuation Schemes Act 1976; c managers: trustees may delelgate the day to day management of the scheme to another person; d members: members usually, but not always, have a liability to contribute to employee superannuation schemes. Under the Superannuation Schemes Regulations 1983, the minimum benefit payable to a member of an employee scheme cannot be less than the member's own contributions to the scheme. Often the terms of specific schemes will provide greater minimum benefits. In personal superannuation schemes (the distinction between personal and employee schemes is made below) the member is generally the sole contributor. 24 2.6 Classification of Superannuation Schemes To be approved under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1976 (approval of the Government Actuary has been required in order to obtain concessional tax treatment), a superannuation scheme has had to be classified by the Government Actuary as either: a an employee pension superannuation scheme;or b a personal pension superannuation scheme; or c an employee lump sum superannuation scheme; or d a personal lump sum superannuation scheme. A pension scheme provides most of the retirement benefit in pension form (up to 25% can be taken as a lump sum). A lump sum scheme provides all the retirement benefit in lump sum form. Personal schemes are schemes for the benefit of individuals other than as employees. Employee schemes are schemes established and operated for the benefit of the employees of a particular employer or group of employers. Employee schemes are further classified as: (i) subsidised schemes: schemes to which the employer is liable to contribute; (ii) non-subsidised schemes: schemes to which the employer does not contribute. (Employee non-subsidised schemes are quite rare.) 2.7 Types of Superannuation Scheme There are two basic types of employee superannuation schemes: a defined contribution schemes, also known as cash accumulation schemes; and 25 b defined benefit schemes, also known as benefit promise schemes. All personal superannuation schemes are defined contribution schemes. Defined Contribution Schemes The principal features of defined contribution schemes are: a contributions are defined in advance, usually in employee schemes as a fixed percentage of each member’s salary; b the retirement benefit is derived simply from the accumulation, with interest, of the contributions paid to the scheme in respect of each member; c the principle of allocated funding is employed. The contributions are invested as a common fund, but separate accounts are opened in respect of each member to which the trustees credit: - contributions paid to the scheme by the member; - contributions paid in respect of the member by the employer; and - the member's share of the fund's investment earnings, usually on an annual basis; and - (sometimes) a share of money left behind by employees who resign and do not receive the full extent of the employer's contributions. d the retirement benefit may be paid to members as a 26 pension or lump sum depending on the classification of the scheme. Defined Benefit Schemes The principal features of defined benefit schemes are: a the benefits payable are determined by formula, usually as a percentage of each member's average salary for a period before retirement multiplied by the number of years of membership of the scheme (or service with the employer). For example, a member's retirement pension for each year of membership might be 1.25 per cent of average annual salary over the last three years of service (generally such a salary is called the member's final average salary). Thus, after 40 years of membership the member would retire with a pension of 50 per cent of final average salary; b usually each each member contributes a fixed percentage of salary, with the employer's contributions varying in order to meet the cost of providing the defined benefits; c the adequacy of the employer's contributions (to provide the benefits promised) is examined regularly by an actuary, who may recommend changes in the contribution rate due to differences between the actual experience of the scheme and the initial assumptions. The Superannuation Schemes Regulations 1983 require an actuarial examination to be made at least every three years; d generally the system of unallocated funding is employed. Separate accounts are not opened in respect of each member, as the benefit of each member is defined in advance; e the trust deed usually provides a means by which the employer can reduce its contributions in the event that the 27 cost of providing the defined benefits becomes unacceptably high. Two examples are: - power for the employer to reduce employer contributions at any time, in which case the trustee, after seeking actuarial advice, would adjust the benefits of the scheme or members' contributions or both; and - power for the employer to direct the trustees to wind up the scheme, whereupon the assets of the scheme would be appropriated to the individual members, and be applied to provide for them; f the retirement benefits may be paid to members as a lump sum or as a pension depending upon the classification of the scheme. 2.8 Life Insurance The first life office was established in New Zealand in 1869. In 1883 there were five offices and the number had reached 15 by 1935. The number remained at this level until 1957. By 1984 the total number had grown to 36 offices, employing over 3,000 full- time staff. The basic nature of life insurance as marketed in New Zealand means that life offices tend to accumulate large pools of funds for investment purposes. Many policies sold incorporate a substantial savings component as well as a death-risk element - in some policies the death-risk element is minimal. Thus life offices invest large sums of money to provide a return to policyholders consistent with their obligations under their life insurance contracts, while providing liquidity to meet immediate claims. 28 2.9 Types of Life Policy The main types of life insurance policies are: a term insurance: sometimes called temporary insurance, this provides a benefit on the death of the insured in much the same way as fire insurance provides a benefit in the event that the insured property is damaged by fire. The duration of a term policy may be for one year, a specified number of years, or until a selected age. In most cases, if the insured survives the specified period, no payment will be made by the life insurance company; b whole of life insurance: this is similar to term insurance in that payment is made under the policy only on the death of the life insured. However, under a whole of life policy insurance cover is provided for the entire life of the insured and premiums remain unchanged for the duration of the policy. As a result, the annual premium for a whole of life policy is usually higher in the initial years than for a similar amount of term insurance. On the other hand, the premium as the insured grows older is lower than if a term insurance policy were to be renewed periodically over the same age range; c endowment insurance: this is similar to whole of life insurance but provides for the payment of the sum insured on a specified date (the maturity date) or on the death of the insured if that occurs earlier. In other words payment of a benefit can occur before the death of the insured. A variation on endowment insurance is 'pure endowment', a savings-only policy which provides a fixed sum on the maturity date and an amount related to premiums paid should the insured die before the policy matures. d unbundled policies: under these policies, the savings 29 component is explicitly identified and the return on savings is reported to the policyholder periodically. There can be flexibility in the death cover provided. Some policies, such as the single premium insurance bonds which have been very popular in recent years, provide minimal death cover. The popularity of these policies stems from investment performance and, in some cases, tax effectiveness. Life insurance policies may also be divided into participating and non-participating policies. A participating policy is credited (usually by way of bonuses added to the sum insured of whole of life and endowment policies) with a proportion of any surplus made by the life office ater providing for its contractual obligations. A non-participating policy does not share in surpluses. Most term insurance policies are non­ participating; most whole of life and endowment policies are participating. Unbundled policies fall into yet another group as they benefit directly from investment surpluses, but do not usually share in profits from other sources. 2.10 Life Offices and Superannuation In addition to providing life insurance, life offices undertake a large amount of superannuation fund management. On the basis of figures provided to the Reserve Bank, about 34 per cent of life office premium income in the year ended March 1985 came from superannuation fund contracts. Superannuation funds flowing to life offices may be invested in the office’s general pool of assets and earn the average rate of return on all investment, or, in some cases, the superannuation payments may be used to purchase 'units’ in an 'investment- linked’ fund. In the latter case, the trustees of the superannuation fund nominate the types of investment they want. The life office then maintains separate pools of shares, property and fixed-interest investments which are revalued regularly so 30 that a value can be placed on the 'units' held in the name of each superannuation scheme. 2.11 The Government Superannuation Fund (GSF) The GSF in its present form was established under its own Act of Parliament on 1 April 1948, amalgamating various funds which had been in existence since the 1850s. Its revenues consist of members' contributions, subsidies from the Consolidated Account, trading departments and other bodies (such as some State Owned Enterprises), and income earned on its investments. Any state employee may belong to the Fund and, until 1 May 1985, membership was compulsory for permanent employees of the Government from the age of 17 to 24 years. Contributions are generally made by employees at the rate of 6.5 per cent of salary. Certain categories of employees contribute at other rates. The principal objective of the GSF is the payment of a pension on retirement, which is usually around the age of 60. The pension is set as a percentage of average salary over the last 5 years, adjusted for inflation in salaries. The broad principal on which the GSF operates is that members' contributions are built up with investment earnings in the Fund. These are used to pay part of the cost of retiring allowances, and spouse and children's allowances. The remainder of the cost of the benefits in any year is met by a subsidy paid by the Government and other employers of members. There is no direct relationship in any year between the amount of members' contributions and the amount of subsidy. The subsidiy is fully spent in the year it is received, so that at the annual balance date the GSF consists entirely of members' contributions and investment income. Future liabilities are not met or funded each 31 year, so that the GSF is a partly-funded scheme. In this respect it is unique in New Zealand. All other schemes are funded, meaning that the expected future liability of the scheme is covered in advance by contributions from either members or employers. 2.12 The National Provident Fund (NPF) The NPF was established with its own Act of Parliament in 1910 as a public service for a wide cross section of private contributors. It was explicitly designed as a vehicle for targeting and distributing government welfare assistance to 'the poorer classes of our community'. In return for a compulsory weekly contribution, the Government undertook to provide a state- subsidised pension plan, sickness insurance, family support measures, and a maternity allowance. The relative generosity and welfare intentions of the NPF are indicated by the fact that membership was initially means-tested. The history of the NPF since its inception may be broadly characterised as a gradual movement away from its early social policy/welfare role, as its new pension schemes expanded and the non-pension and state-subsidised benefits of the initial Fund reduced. Today, the NPF is one of the largest providers of superannuation services in New Zealand. Schemes developed since 1969 have included no government subsidies (although the Fund is currently servicing government-subsidised contracts written before this time) and the present NPF resembles its 1910 precursor in name only. Presently, the NPF manages the standard range of cash accumulation and defined benefit superannuation contracts. Approximately half of its contributor group come from a wide range of local authorities. All its schemes are funded. 32 2.13 Conclusion The importance of superannuation schemes and life offices as repositories of savings, and as lenders and investors of the funds deposited with them, gives these institutions a substantial role in New Zealand's financial sector. To enable the financial sector to operate efficiently to the maximum benefit of the New Zealand economy, it is necessary that superannuation and life insurance be taxed in an appropriate way. This is becoming even more important as the traditional boundary lines between different financial institutions (such as trading banks and life offices) become more blurred. As noted by the Minister of Finance in his Preface to the Consultative Document on Full Imputation, "companies, superannuation funds and life offices are financial intermediaries which specialise in investing various forms of capital ultimately contributed by individuals. These intermediaries can, and indeed should, compete on their merits. The tax system should neither subsidise nor discriminate against them." 33 CHAPTER 3 - THE TAXATION OF SAVINGS 3.1 Introduction The Government's general policy objective is to reform the taxation of superannuation and life insurance so as to reinforce the imputation and international reforms and apply a consistent taxation regime to the return on savings and investments. Taxation considerations should not then intrude to the same extent on the relative competitiveness of different financial institutions and the choice between different forms of investment. As well as enhancing economic efficiency in that way, a more consistent tax treatment of the returns from savings and investment should produce a fairer tax system. A consistent tax treatment of the returns from savings and investments requires the general application of a single taxation method. That general method of taxation should be determined on the basis of a number of considerations including judgements on which method is: the most economically efficient, the fairest, the most compatible with overseas taxation regimes, the least costly to move towards, and the easiest to comply with and administer. The Government has decided that an income tax treatment should be applied broadly to all forms of capital income. That has underlined the Government's taxation reform programme since 1984. This chapter explains the rationale behind that decision and identifies the implications for savings in general and superannuation and life insurance in particular. 34 3.2 Flows of Funds from Savings There are three potentiallly taxable flows of funds associated with savings. These are: a contributions to savings accounts - this is the income initially received by the saver in the form of, for instance, wages or salary from employment. This income becomes a contribution when it is deposited in a savings account; b income accruing on savings - a common example being interest; and c withdrawals from the account. 3.3 Income Tax Treatment of Savings Under an income tax system all income is assessable as it is derived. Contributions are made from income which is subject to tax. In that sense contributions can be said to be taxable under an income tax regime. Income accruing is also taxable. Withdrawals, on the other hand, merely represent the conversion of an asset in the form of a positive savings account balance to an asset in the form of cash. Withdrawals do not constitute income of the taxpayer and are not taxed. In general this is the tax treatment now applied to savings in a bank account. Deposits are made from after-tax income and are therefore taxed. Only if the amount deposited could be deducted from income in calculating a taxpayer's tax liability would deposits be exempt tax. Income accruing in the form of interest is also taxed. Withdrawals from the account are not taxed. 35 This income tax treatment of savings can be described as a taxed/taxed/exempt regime. Such a tax regime is illustrated diagrammatically in Table 3.1 below. Table 3.1 Income Tax Treatment of Savings Contributions Taxed Interest income Taxed Withdrawals Exempt If applied consistently to all forms of saving, such a tax system would tax all income involved in the savings process as that income accrues and, in that way, achieve a uniform tax treatment of savings. An alternative tax treatment of savings is set out in Table 3.2 below. A deduction from other income is allowed for the amount of contributions made. Offsetting this, withdrawals are made taxable. Interest income remains taxable. Such a regime can be described as an exempt/taxed/taxed regime. Table 3.2 Alternative Tax Treatment of Savings Contributions Exempt Interest income Taxed Withdrawals Taxed An exempt/taxed/taxed regime is not an income tax regime but is equivalent to an income tax (ie a taxed/taxed/exempt) regime under certain restrictive assumptions. The individual's tax rate must be constant over time and the interest rate at which the taxpayer is prepared to lend money must be equivalent to the tax rate at which the Government is prepared to borrow money. 36 3.3 Expenditure Tax Treatment One of the criticisms which has been levelled at an income tax is that it penalises savings (and investment) by taxing both the income which is saved (ie contributions) and the interest on the savings. This causes consumers' choices to be biased towards current consumption and away from future consumption. In other words, an income tax system tends to encourage taxpayers to spend their money now rather than to save it for a later date. An expenditure tax is an alternative form of taxation which, unlike an income tax, does not impose a penalty on savings. Under an expenditure tax, only income which is spent on consumption is taxed. Income which is saved (or invested) is not taxed. As a result, an expenditure tax can be represented as an exempt/exempt/taxed regime. Contributions or savings are not taxed, interest income which is not withdrawn is not taxed, but withdrawals which are spent are taxed. This type of taxation system is outlined in Table 3.3 below. Table 3.3 Expenditure Tax Treatment of Savings Contributions Exempt Interest income Exempt Withdrawals Taxed To achieve this expenditure tax affect, tax may be levied only on goods and services which are consumed (an indirect expenditure tax). GST is an example of an indirect expenditure tax. Alternatively, an expenditure tax may be levied directly on income which is spent by allowing taxpayers to deduct from taxable income all savings and investments and by taxing in full 37 all reductions in the level of savings and all borrowings. Such a tax system is known as a direct expenditure tax. New Zealand currently raises most of its tax revenue by way of a mix between what is in general a direct income tax and an indirect expenditure tax (GST). The Government could rely almost totally on an expenditure tax for revenue purposes by placing sole reliance on GST. However, that would require a GST rate in excess of 40 per cent. Such a high GST rate would be difficult to sustain. Alternatively, the same effect could be achieved by replacing the income tax with a direct expenditure tax. However, on the basis that the level of savings is positive, a comprehensive expenditure tax base would be narrower than a comprehensive income tax base. Expenditure tax rates, therefore, would need to be higher than income tax rates if the same level of public spending were to be funded. As a result, the pre-tax income required to sustain the same level of consumption would increase. This would tend to increase tax-induced disincentives to work and effort. It is not clear whether the removal of the penalty that an income tax imposes on savings would more than offset the increased disincentives to work which would result in high expenditure tax rates. Both the United States of America and the United Kingdom have closely considered the direct expenditure tax option. However, more recent investigations (Tax Reform for Fairness Simplicity and Growth, US Treasury 1984, and How should Business be Taxed?, Paul Bevin 1985), have highlighted the serious obstacles to the implementation of a direct expenditure tax. These include: no country has a broad-based direct expenditure tax, so the 38 practicability of such a tax has not had the years of testing to which income taxes have been subject; significant problems would arise in integrating a direct expenditure tax in New Zealand with a world in which our trading partners operate what are predominantly income tax regimes; their could be a perceived unfairness in a tax which results in an increase in the tax rate on wage income while exempting income from capital; there would be major transitional problems of moving to a direct expenditure tax if existing owners of assets are not to be penally taxed; and it would be more complex for the typical wage earner to operate than an income tax since savings would need to be deducted from income, and reduced savings and borrowings added to income, to derive tax liability. These considerations have led the Government to the conclusion that New Zealand's direct tax base should be income. Reforms of the income tax system have as their aim a more comprehensive tax with lower and less variable rates. That is consistent with the reforms in a number of overseas countries including Australia and the United States of America. The tax penalty which an income tax regime imposes on savings has been mitigated by the introduction of GST and the removal of income tax concessions. Those moves have made substantial reductions in income tax rates possible. 39 3.5 Inflation and the Taxation of Savings The 1982 Task Force on Tax Reform (the McCaw Committee) argued that, under an income tax, savers are disadvantaged in times of inflation because the inflation-compensation element of interest is taxed as income together with any element of real return on investment. In inflationary conditions, a nominal income tax on savings (which taxes inflationary gains) amounts to a tax on real (non-inflationary) income plus a tax on wealth. For example, if an interest rate of 12 per cent per annum is paid when the annual inflation rate is 10 per cent, tax is levied on the full 12 per cent even though the first 10 per cent serves only to maintain the purchasing power of the taxpayer's capital. Inflation, combined with an income tax, has a number of often undesirable effects. There are two, not mutually exclusive, responses. First, the Government can maintain the monetary and fiscal policies necessary to reduce inflation on a permanent basis. Secondly, the income tax system can be moved on to a real income tax base (which does not tax inflationary gains) by appropriate methods of indexation. However, there are a number of practical difficulties in moving to a real income tax system. While the possibilities in that regard can be explored, there is general international agreement that the most efficient and fairest tax system is likely to be the one which is as comprehensive as possible. That applies whether or not it results in the taxation of inflationary gains. 3.6 Application to Superannuation Superannuation is one of a number of ways in which a person can accumulate savings. Under a typical subsidised defined-contribution employee 40 superannuation scheme, an individual makes regular contributions to a fund to which the employer also contributes. This fund is invested so as to earn income. Accumulated contributions, plus the accumulated earnings of the fund, are used to pay benefits on retirement. Benefits may be in the form of a lump sum or a pension. Non-subsidised defined-contribution employee and personal superannuation schemes are the same except there are no employer contributions. Defined-benefit schemes have the added feature that benefits are not necessarily related to the contributions of the individual scheme member. Benefits must, however, be related to the total contributions made by the employer as well as by scheme members. While two scheme members may receive different benefits despite having paid the same amount into the scheme (because of, for instance, early withdrawal by one member), the nature of the scheme as a savings vehicle remains. All that has happened is that the employer contributions are higher for the person receiving the higher benefits. As with other savings media, there are three financial flows associated with a superannuation scheme. These are: a contributions - the contributions to the scheme paid over by individuals and their employers. These are comparable to bank deposits and, under an income tax regime, should be made from taxed income with no deduction; b the annual fund accumulations - the amount earned each year by investing the pool of money representing past contributions and accumulations. These are comparable to interest earnings and, under an income tax regime, should be taxed at the marginal rate of scheme members as the earnings 41 are derived by the fund; and c the emerging benefit - the pension or lump sum paid out to scheme members. This is comparable to a withdrawal from a bank account. Under an income tax regime it should be free of tax. 3.7 Application to Life Insurance Life insurance is less obviously a form of savings. A one-year term insurance policy is mainly simply an insurance contract and involves no significant savings element. As with other forms of insurance, such as fire insurance, an annual term policy involves the pooling of risks by policyholders, all of whom are covering themselves in case in that year they suffer the loss insured against (in the case of a term life insurance policy this is death) . If they do suffer the insured loss, a claim is paid from the pool of funds made up of premium payments. If they do not suffer the loss, policyholders receive no payment; they have simply contributed to the pool of funds from which the loss sufferers draw. Most life policies are, however, not annual term insurance. Whole of life, endowment insurance and unbundled savings policies predominate. While term insurance involves a negligible savings element, this is not the case with these other policies. A feature of a typical whole of life or endowment policy is that the premium remains constant throughout the term of the policy even though the risk insured against (death) increases with the age of the insured. Whereas this increasing risk is reflected in rising premiums for annual term insurance policies, the constant premium is obtained by setting the premium initially at a higher level than is required to cover the risk of the insured's death. 42 The 'excess premium' in any year is invested by the insurance company. As the policyholder ages, the difference between the premium and the amount required to insure the full sum insured is made up by drawing from a fund consisting of past excess premiums plus the investment earnings of that fund. The situation is the same as if the insured had taken out an annual term insurance policy and established his or her own separate fund in a bank account. The insured would pay a constant annual amount but, in the early stages while the term insurance premiums are low, part of this sum would be used to build up the fund. As the term insurance premiums increased, the policyholder would draw from the fund to make up the shortfall between the constant sum and the higher premiums. There are thus two distinct elements contained in the typical whole of life and endowment policy: a a pure insurance element - representing the risk the life insurance company takes each year the policy remains in force that the death of the insured will occur that year; and b a savings element - representing the amount the life insurance company puts away (or invests) to cover the future increase in the risk of the insured's death as he or she ages. By definition, the newer unbundled contracts explicitly separate these elements. The pure insurance element is the same as a term insurance policy. The savings element is the same as a deposit in a bank account. It is the savings element in most life insurance policies which makes life insurance a form of saving whereas fire 43 insurance, for instance, is not. This analysis enables the financial flows associated with life insurance to be placed in a similar framework to that developed for saving through a bank account or a superannuation scheme. Again there are three financial flows: a personal contributions - the premiums paid by the policyholder. Under an income tax this should be paid out of after-tax income with no deduction; b annual fund accumulations - the amount earned each year by the life office from investing that part of each premium which is put aside to be drawn upon when the premiums paid by a policyholder are insufficient to cover the sum insured. Under an income tax, annual fund accumulations should be taxed at the marginal tax rates of the policyholders; and c the emerging benefit - this is the benefit paid out when a policy matures because of the death of the insured or the expiry of time. It is the equivalent of the withdrawal of bank account funds and under an income tax should be free of tax. 3.8 Conclusion The income tax is a long-term feature of the New Zealand tax system. Other options, such as replacing the income tax with total reliance on expenditure taxes are not viable in this timeframe. By accepting an income tax one must accept the economic costs which such a tax imposes, such as the penal treatment of savings. However, those economic costs can be minimised by making the income tax as comprehensive as possible and by making tax rates low and less variable. 44 Under an income tax, savings should be made out of after-tax­ income, earnings from investing the savings should be taxed as they are derived, but withdrawals or benefits should not be subject to further tax. Both superannuation and life insurance are vehicles for accumulating savings. If the income tax system is to be applied consistently to all forms of saving, this means that contributions or premiums should be made out of after-tax income, investment earnings of superannuation funds and life offices should be taxed at the marginal rates of scheme members and policyholders, but benefits (whether lump sum or pension) should be free of tax. 45 CHAPTER 4 - TAX PREFERENCES FOR SUPERANNUATION AND LIFE INSURANCE SAVINGS 4.1 Introduction In general, superannuation and life insurance have not been subject to the normal income tax treatment for savings outlined in Chapter 3. Instead, these forms of saving have benefitted from special tax preferences. This has taken the form of exemptions for income saved through a superannuation scheme or life office and exemptions for, or low tax rates on, superannuation and life office investment earnings. This chapter briefly canvasses the historical background to these concessions and, in broad terms, describes the taxation regime applying to life insurance and superannuation up to the end of 1987. The taxation regime described is that of a person who entered a superannuation scheme or took out a life insurance policy at the beginning of December 1987. Further complexity to the tax system is added by transitional measures incorporated into the law as a result of past changes to the tax system. Those special rules are described in Appendix A4.1. The tax rules described in this chapter are summarised in Appendix A4.2. 4.2 Historical Background Superannuation and life insurance preferential tax treatment has a long history. A deduction for life office savings can trace its origins back to the late nineteenth century English precursor of the income tax. This was a tax on various forms of expenditure. With the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars, the Government had to increase its revenue from taxation by increasing tax rates. To limit the level of taxation to which a person was liable, total tax liability was limited to 10 per cent 46 of a taxpayer’s income. In calculating income, life insurance premium payments were excluded. Such an exemption was valid when the tax system aimed to tax expenditure and not income. However, when William Pitt moved the tax system from a tax on expenditure to a tax on income, the then established life insurance exemption continued in place. It was then incorporated into New Zealand's tax system when the income tax was introduced here in 1891. The life insurance premium exemption was extended to superannuation contributions in 1915. The income derived by a superannuation fund was exempted tax as early as 1916. Again, New Zealand mirrored a similar exemption in the United Kingdom. It has been argued that the United Kingdom exemption was introduced because, as a result of high thresholds of income before a person became liable to income tax, most superannuation scheme members would not have had to pay tax if they had derived investment income directly rather than through a superannuation scheme. 4.3 The Taxation of Superannuation Savings For taxation purposes, there have been two main types of superannuation scheme: a lump sum schemes - where benefits are paid as a lump sum; and b pension schemes, which include the Government Superannuation Fund - where benefits are paid as a pension. Different tax rules have applied to each of these. As a general rule pension schemes have not been taxed on their net investment income but pension benefits have been taxable. For lump sum schemes, on the other hand, investment income has been taxable but lump sum benefits have been tax-free. 47 A distinction has also been drawn between employee and personal schemes. As a general rule employee schemes have received more preferential treatment than personal schemes. The end result is that whereas personal lump sum schemes have been taxed on a basis which approximates income tax treatment, employee pension schemes have received very favourable tax treatment compared to an income tax. This discussion relates to schemes approved by the Government Actuary. Non-approved schemes have not received preferential tax treatment. The taxation of non-approved schemes is outlined in Appendix A4.1. Superannuation Contributions Superannuation contributions can be paid by either the scheme member or by the member's employer. Under an income tax, member contributions to a superannuation scheme should not be deductible to that employee and thus should be made out of after-tax income. However, under our income tax system member contributions, up to set limits, have been deductible from the member's assessable income if the scheme is a pension scheme (employee or personal) or a susidised employee lump sum scheme. Contributions to other schemes (e.g. non­ subsidised employee and personal lump sum schemes) have not been deductible and thus the income from which they have been paid has been taxed. The limits on contributions which are exempt from personal income tax have been $1,400 per annum if the member did not belong to a subsidised scheme and $1,200 per annum otherwise. Those limits applied to the aggregate of qualifying superannuation contributions and life, personal accident and sickness insurance premiums. \[Section 59 of the Income Tax Act 1976 refers\] 48 Employer contributions to a superannuation scheme should, under an income tax, be deductible to the employer as they are part of labour costs and thus one of the employer's income-generating expenses. On the other hand, as part of an employee's remuneration, those contributions should be assessable to the employee. Under our income tax, employer contributions have been deductible to the employer but with restrictions which limit the amount of deductible contributions and which disadvantage the self-employed and employees who have major stakes in the employing company. In general, no tax has been levied on that part of an employee's income consisting of employer superannuation contributions on his or her behalf. For employer superannuation contributions to be deductible to the employer, the law has required those contributions to be made to an employee subsidised scheme. A deduction has not generally been permitted for contributions in respect of an employee who holds an interest in an employing company totalling 20 per cent or more. In other cases, the amount deductible has been limited to the smaller of the amount the employer was required to contribute to the scheme and 10 per cent of the total earnings of all employees who were scheme members. \[Section 150 of the Income Tax Act refers\]. Employer contributions to a superannuation scheme which does not qualify as a subsidised employee scheme have not been deductible to the employer. \[Section 106(1)(m) of the Income Tax Act refers\] Two features of this regime have disadvantaged the self-employed and those holding large interests in an employing company. The first is the denial of deductions for contributions in respect of those holding a 20 per cent or more interest in the employing company. The second is the denial of deductions for personal schemes given that a scheme to which non-employees belong has in general, been classified as a personal and not an employee scheme. 49 In general, employer superannuation contributions (whether or not deductible to the employer) , have not been regarded as assessable income of the employee. Instead, they have been regarded as income of the trust administering the scheme, and under the Income Tax Act that income has not been assessable to the trust. \[Sections 61(21) and 225(4)(b) of the Act refers\]. Such contributions have also been specifically exempted from the alternative form of taxing employee remuneration - fringe benefit tax. \[Section 336N(1) of the Income Tax Act refers\]. However, in certain circumstances it has been possible for employer contributions to give rise to an employee income tax liability. One instance where this could occur is where the employee had a 20 percent or more interest in an employer company controlled by less than five people. The employer contributions could then have been a deemed dividend assessable in the hands of the employee under section 4(2) of the Income Tax Act. In some cases, the employee could have been liable to tax for employer contributions on the basis that the contributions constituted monetary remuneration of the employee, or it is possible that section 75 of the Income Tax Act could have operated so as to deem the contributions to have been derived by the employee. Annual' Fund Accumulations This is the investment income of a superannuation fund. Under an income tax such income should be taxable as it is derived and it should be taxed at the marginal tax rates of the scheme members. Our income tax system has not operated in that manner. A distinction has been drawn between pension schemes (including the Government Superannuation Fund) and lump sum schemes. Pension schemes have not been subject to tax so that investment income derived by such schemes is tax-free. \[Section 61(21) of the Income Tax Act refers\]. 50 Lump sum schemes (pre-1982 lump sum schemes are considered in Appendix A4.1), on the other hand, have been subject to tax on their net investment income. The rate of tax has been set at 33 cents in the dollar. Tax has been levied on gross income minus expenditure. The Income Tax Act has defined gross income as investment income including any profits on the sale of investments (defined as sale price minus cost price) and to exclude contributions to the scheme. Expenditure has been defined as investment losses and expenses, including any losses on the sale of investments, and to exclude any costs incurred in developing, marketing, selling, promoting or advertising a scheme. It is to be noted that one result is that lump sum superannuation schemes are taxed on any realised capital gain which they may make. This applies even if those gains would not normally be subject to tax, in other words, even if the assets were purchased by the scheme as a long-term investment. It should be further noted that the tax rate has been set at 33 cents in the dollar, a rate which may or may not have approximated the marginal rate of individual scheme members. \[Section 225 of the Income Tax Act refers\]. Superannuation Scheme Benefits Superannuation scheme benefits can be in the form of a lump sum payment, a pension, or a combination of the two. Under an income tax all benefits should be tax-free. Under New Zealand’s tax system lump sum benefits have been payable free of tax but pension benefits have been taxable \[section 65(2)(j) of the Income Tax Act refers\]. The exemption from tax for lump sum benefits means that where it has been possible to pay benefits from a pension scheme in a lump sum form, those benefits have been payable free of tax. In that way the scheme member could take advantage of the special tax preferences provided to pensions schemes (such as tax-free annual 51 accumulations) while not being levied tax on the benefits paid out. In general, the Superannuation Schemes Act 1976 and the regulations made under that Act have required a pension scheme's trust deed to stipulate that benefits under the scheme are payable in pension form. However, there are a number of exceptions which have allowed pension scheme benefits to be paid as a lump sum. First, the law has allowed a pension scheme to provide that up to 25 per cent of a pension entitlement could, on retirement, be capitalised and paid to the recipient as a lump sum. Secondly, the trust deed of a pension scheme has been able to allow benefits to be paid in a lump sum in the event of the member's death, permanent incapacity or permanent emigration. Thirdly, the law has allowed the trust deed of an employee pension scheme to provide for lump sum benefits to members who withdraw from the scheme on ceasing employment with the existing employer. If the employee is under age 50, the trust deed has been able to allow all benefits to be paid as a lump sum. If the employee is over 50, the trust deed has been able to allow only employee contributions plus interest to be paid as a lump sum. Members of the GSF have been able to withdraw from the scheme and receive lump sum benefits without the need to change employment. Fourthly, an employee pension scheme's trust deed has been able to provide that, on termination of the scheme, benefits may be provided to members as lump sums except that, for members over age 50 that part of the benefit arising from employer contributions has had to be paid as a pension. Finally, provision has been made for the trust deed of an 52 employee lump sum scheme which has been converted to an employee pension scheme to pay out lump sum benefits as if the scheme had remained a lump sum scheme. Thus, although the general intent of the law has been to require pension scheme benefits to be paid out as taxable pensions, there are a number of exceptions enabling a considerable proportion of pension scheme benefits to be paid as tax-free lump sum benefits. Furthermore, it has been possible to split pensions between a retired member and other persons, thus generally lowering the amount of tax payable on the pension. 4.4 The Taxation of Life Insurance Savings Savings through life insurance have been taxed on a similar basis to personal superannuation schemes. Most life insurance policies offer lump sum rather than pension benefits. Thus life insurance savings have been taxed on a similar basis to personal lump sum superannuation schemes which, as noted above, approximates income tax treatment. As a result, life insurance savings generally receive a low level of tax preference. The rules which have governed the tax treatment of life insurance savings are outlined below. Premiums Just as superannuation contributions can be paid by either an employee or his/her employer, so life insurance premiums can be paid by either of these two parties. Turning first to non-employer paid premiums. If the benefits under the policy are a pension for life from age 60 or the return of premiums and bonuses in the event of earlier death, then the 53 policy is a "policy of pension insurance" and premiums amounting to up to $1,400 per annum have been deductible from assessable income. Such policies though are quite rare. For any other form of life insurance (e.g. the usual type of policy offering lump sum benefits on maturity or death), no deduction has been available and premiums have been effectively paid out of after­ tax income. \[Section 59 of the Income Tax Act refers\]. Where the premiums are paid by the employer but the benefits under the policy go to the employee, premium payments have been deductible to the employer as part of its normal cost of labour. Unlike superannuation contributions, there has been no special restriction on the amount the employer can deduct. Premium payments by the employer have generally been included in the taxable income of the employee as "expenditure on account of the employee" and thus as "monetary remuneration" which is assessable under section 65(2)(b) of the Income Tax Act. Where the premium payment is included in the employee's assessable income, there is no fringe benefit tax liability. However, certain life insurance premium payments have been explicitly excluded from the statutory definition of expenditure on account and have therefore been excluded from employee income. Broadly these are life insurance policies which constitute or are part of a superannuation scheme, and policies with benefits payable or distributable only on the death of the employee (with subsidiary sickness and accident benefits allowed). Where the premium payment is not included in the employee's assessable income, fringe benefit tax has been payable. There has also been a fringe benefit tax exemption for employer- paid premiums on personal accident or sickness insurance policies and approved funds providing benefits solely in respect of personal accident, disease, or death. \[Sections 2, 59, 65(2)(b) and 336N(1) of the Income Tax Act refer\]. 54 Where the premium is paid by the employer and the employer benefits out of the proceeds of the policy, the Inland Revenue Department has regarded the premiums as being deductible only if the policy is a temporary or term policy. Otherwise no deduction has been allowed. Annual Fund Accumulations New Zealand's income tax system has adopted the approach of considering life offices as a conduit through which income passes to policyholders. Rather than attempting to tax the policyholder on his/her share of the income of the life office, tax is levied on the conduit (the life office). Thus the life office is taxed as a proxy for the policyholder and is not taxed in its own right. That taxation approach has formed the basis for the taxation regime which has governed the business of life insurance as set out in section 204 of the Income Tax Act. The policyholder 'income' which the section has tried to tax is the income generated by accumulated premiums. That is gross investment income of the life office less the expenses incurred by the life office m earning that income. Gross investment income is the total revenue received from investments. Premiums have been excluded from assessable income since it is only income generated from premiums which has been the object of taxation. Dividends from company shareholdings have been included in taxable investment income. Normally dividends received by companies (other than life insurance companies) are not included in assessable income. However, the life office is paying tax on behalf of individual policyholders who would be taxed on such dividends if they received them directly. The life office is therefore taxed on dividends in its role as proxy for policyholders. 55 Life offices are also taxed on any profit on the sale or disposal of investments, although unrealised gains due to asset revaluations are not assessable. This means that life offices have been taxed on realised capital gains even where the asset was acquired for the purpose of long-term investment and would not have given rise to a tax liability if the policyholder had acquired the asset directly. Expenses incurred in gaining investment income, as well as realised losses on the sale or disposal of investments, have been deductible from gross investment income. Expenses involved in gaining premiums (for example the commissions of agents and advertising expenses) have not been deductible. It has been argued that in soliciting for life insurance business, life offices are, in a sense, performing the same role as other financial intermediaries in marshalling funds which are subsequently invested. It then follows that expenses such as agents' commissions are similar to the salaries of bank tellers and should be deductible. The counter argument is that life offices, unlike banks, have been taxed in substitution for taxing policyholders on their investment income. Premium expenses are not equivalent to any expense the policyholder would incur in deriving investment income directly. Thus, unless the basis for taxing life offices were changed, such expenses should remain non-deductible. A life insurance company incurs general management and indirect expenses which relate to both gaining premiums and earning investment income. A portion of these costs ave been attributed to the earning of investment income and have been deductible. The remainder have been non-deductible. Apportionment has been on the basis of the ratio of investment income to gross revenue. Life offices have, in effect, not been taxed on investment income attributed to funds held in respect of certain mortgage repayment policies, exempt superannuation funds, and annuities. This 56 apportionment has been made on the basis of the ratio of such liabilities to the total life insurance liabilities at the end of the income year. Because they have been taxed as a proxy for the policyholder, life offices have not been taxed at the company rate. Instead the rate of tax levied on life office net investment income has been 33 cents in the dollar. That rate is supposed to reflect the marginal tax rate of policyholders. Obviously it has been concessional for policyholders on higher marginal tax rates and penal for those on lower marginal tax rates. Life Insurance Benefits The general rule has been that lump sum life insurance benefits have not been taxable in the hands of the recipient, but pension benefits have been assessable. One exception has been a policy taken out by an employer on the life of an employee. The Inland Revenue Department has taken the view that if the policy is an endowment or whole of life policy then the benefits are not taxable. However, if: a the policy is taken out on the life of a "key" employee; and b the purpose of the policy was compensation for loss of profits; then the benefits, over and above premium payments made, have been considered taxable even if received as a lump sum. If the policy is a term insurance policy, the Inland Revenue Department has regarded all benefits as taxable, again even if received as a lump sum. 57 4.5 Conclusion The tax treatment of superannuation and life insurance savings is summarised in the table presented in Appendix A4.2. The taxation of these forms of saving has departed significantly from the treatment which should apply under an income tax. The rules have been complex (further complexity has been added as a result of transitional measures when the tax treatment was changed in the past - those rules are outlined in Appendix A4.1). In general, compared to the income tax norm, superannuation and life insurance savings have been taxed on a preferential basis. In that way other savings vehicles have been placed at a competitive disadvantage. However, within the taxation regime applying to superannuation and life insurance there has been considerable diversity of treatment. Savings through personal lump sum superannuation schemes and life offices would usually have been taxed on a basis which approximates an income tax. Depending on the marginal tax rate of the scheme member or policy holder and the type of investments held by the scheme or life office, the taxation regime could be penal or preferential. On the other hand, savings through an employee pension scheme have, in many cases, received very large tax preferences with contributions being exempt, fund income being exempt, and a high proportion of benefits being paid out as tax-free lump sums. A more consistent treatment of these forms of savings can be expected to give rise to a more efficient, fairer and simpler tax system. That can be achieved by moving these forms of savings on to a tax system which more closely approximates the income tax norm. 58 APPENDIX A4.1 SPECIAL TAX RULES FOR SUPERANNUATION AND LIFE INSURANCE 1 Introduction This appendix considers the special tax rules which have applied to superannuation and life insurance. These rules are a product of past changes to the tax rules in this area. This appendix also outlines the tax position of non-approved superannuation schemes, that is, those schemes which have not received Government Actuary approval under the Superannuation Schemes Act. 2 Superanuation Contributions As noted in Chapter 4, a member's superannuation contributions have been exempt income tax (up to the prescribed limits) if the scheme was an approved pension or a subsidised employee lump sum scheme. For other approved schemes (personal lump sum and non­ subsidised employee lump sum), the exemption has applied only if the taxpayer was a member of the scheme on or before Budget night (8 November) 1984.3 Annual Superanuation Fund Accumulations Lump sum superannuation schemes, whether employee or personal, have been taxed on their net investment income since 1982. Prior to that such schemes were, like pension schemes, exempt tax on their net investment income. When the law in this area was changed, it was decided to retain the tax exemption for scheme funds in respect of those who were members of lump sum superannuation schemes prior to the 1982 Budget (5 August 1982). These funds have been known as Class A superannuation funds. 59 For employee schemes these funds are limited to: a contributions made on or before 5 August 1982; b Subsequent contributions to the extent that these do not exceed the amount set out in the Superannuation Schemes Act 1976. For a defined contribution scheme, this is in general the dollar amount of contributions made, on an annual basis, in the year ending 31 March 1983. For a scheme with a defined benefit obligation entered into on or before 5 August 1982, the set amount is generally the contributions which the Government Actuary considers appropriate to provide the level of promised benefits; and c the annual accumulations of the Class A fund. In the case of personal lump sum schemes. Class A funds consist of: a contributions made on or before 31 March 1983; b subsequent contributions to the fund to the extent that these do not exceed the greater of: the dollar amount paid on an annual basis in the year ending 5 August 1982, or the dollar amount paid in the year ending 5 August 1981; and c the annual accumulations of the Class A fund. Class A funds are not taxed on net investment income. The net investment income of all other lump sum funds (Class B funds) is taxable. 4 Non-Approved Superannuation Schemes Superannuation schemes which have not received the approval of 60 the Government Actuary under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1976 have been taxed relatively penally. Member contributions have not been deductible to the member. Any employer contributions have have been non-deductible to the employer and subject to fringe benefit tax. The net investment income of such a fund has been assessable and the rate applying has been the company rate (48 cents in the dollar). Finally, the benefits of such a fund have been assessable if paid in pension form, but non-assessable if paid as a lump sum. 5 Life Insurance The only special rule which has applied to life insurance has been that premiums have been deductible to the payer if the policy was a qualifiying policy entered into before Budget night 1984. The main requirements of a qualifying policy were that it had to: - be taken out on the life of the taxpayer, or his/her spouse or children; - pay benefits to the taxpayer, or his/her spouse or children; - be a whole of life policy or have a minimum term of ten years; and - pay a death benefit ascertainable from the policy. 61 APPENDIX A4.2 SUMMARY OF TAXATION PREFERENCES FOR SUPERANNUATION AND LIFE INSURANCE This appendix summarises, in diagrammatic form, the tax preferences which have existed for superannuation and life insurance. Table A4.2.1 below presents a simplified version of those tax preferences. Contributions, annual fund accumulations and benefits are classified as either exempt or taxed. Exempt means that the financial flow is either deductible from the assessable income of the payer or not assessable in the hands of the payee. Taxed has the opposite meaning. For example, an employer's contribution to a superannuation scheme or life policy is said to be taxed if either the contribution is not allowed as a deduction from the employer's assessable income, or the contribution is taxed in the hands of employee, life insurance company or superannuation trustees. Differing marginal tax rates mean that equal income flows may not necessarily be subject to the same amount of tax even if both flows are labelled as taxed. 62 Table A4.2.1 Contributions Annual Fund IndividualEmployerAccumulation Benefits Superannuation Employee PensionExemptExempt Exempt Taxed Pre-82 lump sumExemptExempt Exempt Exempt Post-82 lump sum Exempt Exempt Taxed Exempt Personal Pension ExemptExemptExempt Taxed Pre-82 lump sumExemptExemptExempt Exempt 82-84 lump sum ExemptExemptTaxed Exempt Post-84 lump sumTaxed Taxed Taxed Exempt Non-Approved PensionTaxed TaxedTaxedTaxed Lump sum TaxedTaxed TaxedExempt Life Insurance Pension Exempt Exempt Taxed Taxed Pre-84 lump sum ExemptExempt TaxedExempt Post-84 lump sum Taxed Taxed Taxed Exempt Income Tax Norm TaxedTaxed Taxed Exempt 63 CHAPTER 5 - WHY TAX PREFERENCES ARE BEING REMOVED 5.1 Introduction As previous chapters have demonstrated, the past tax treatment of superannuation funds and life offices has been anomalous, not only as between themselves but also when compared with other savings institutions. Given the Government's decision to continue to levy direct taxation by way of income tax, any depature from normal income tax treatment needs to be justified. In general, the more comprehensive any tax system is, the more likely it will meet the Government's tax reform objectives of efficiency, fairness and simplicity. This chapter outlines in more detail the arguments for a non-preferential tax regime for this aspect of the financial sector and this form of investment income. It is argued that past tax concessions have: been expensive in terms of tax revenue lost, created distortions in investment patterns and in employment behaviour, created the need for tight regulatory control of superannuation funds, led to tax planning, and have made the tax system unfair by favouring the high over the low income earner. Arguments for retaining tax preferences - the desirability of encouraging savings and the desirability of encouraging private, as opposed to public, provision for retirement - do not, in the end, stand up to close analysis. 5.2 Tax Privileges are Expensive in Terms of Tax Revenue Forgone Tax privileges for superannuation and the premium exemption for pre-1984 life insurance policies significantly narrow the base from which income tax revenue is collected. If continued, it is estimated that the privileged tax position of superannuation funds and life insurance would (on the basis of the new tax rates announced on 10 February) cost the Government $660 million in tax reveneue forgone on a 1988/89 full year basis. Details are 64 provided in Appendix A5.1. Removing those concessions will make the tax system more comprehensive and the extra tax revenue can be used to effect improvements to other aspects of the tax system. Thus, the extra revenue will be used to help pay for the reduced marginal tax rates announced on 10 February 1988. Those lower tax rates will reduce the extent to which the tax system discourages effort and savings. 5.3 Tax Privileges Distort Investment Behaviour Taxation concessions for superannuation and life insurance are likely to have distorted investment patterns in a number of ways. First, the concessions have encouraged people to save in a manner which they might not otherwise choose. For instance, they have encouraged people to purchase more life insurance or, in the case of superannuation, higher defined benefit annuities than they would in the absence of these tax preferences. Savings through superannuation or life insurance are also usually more difficult to access than, say, savings accumulated in a bank account. That lack of liquidity reduces the value of the savings to the saver. It means, for example, that people may not easily be able to use their savings to start, buy or expand a business when previously unforseen opportunities arise. In that way, the taxation privileges for superannuation and life insurance have been a penalty on small businesses. Secondly, a more efficient financial sector should result from a 65 more even-handed tax treatment of different financial intermediaries. The concessions have diverted savings from other financial intermediaries to superannuation funds. Concessions on old insurance policies have provided incentives for people to continue these policies rather than use other financial intermediaries. Furthermore, people on high marginal tax rates have had an incentive to place funds in new life insurance policies to take advantage of the lower tax rate applying to fund income. All these tax-induced distortions have reduced the need for life offices and funds to provide services to borrowers and lenders at the lowest possible cost. In other words, because of their tax basis, the share of the financial market held by superannuation funds and life offices has not necessarily reflected their relative efficiency as financial intermediaries. The aim of having different financial intermediaries competing on an equal basis is especially important at a time when the Government has initiated a number of policy changes allowing more competition in the financial sector in order to promote efficiency and a better service to consumers. The removal of the privileges enjoyed by superannuation funds and life offices will increase competition and enhance the Government's broader policies. As well as possibly causing inefficient financial intermediation, tax preferences may have encouraged unnecessary intermediation. They are likely to have encouraged people to use superannuation funds and life offices as investment intermediaries when they might, in the absence of tax concessions, have preferred to invest directly. By channelling savings through superannuation funds and life offices, the tax preferences will have created further economic costs if funds and offices have had different investment preferences from alternative intermediaries or from the savers themselves. That will have distorted the allocation of resources within the economy. 66 There has been some evidence that investment has been distorted in that way. In a book published by the New Zealand Institute of Policy Studies in 1985, How Should Business be Taxed?. Mr Paul Bevin concluded that tax preferences in this area have probably "significantly affected the pattern of investment in New Zealand, contributing to concentration of investment in larger established businesses, rather than smaller growing firms." One reason for this is that superannuation funds and life offices, because of the long-term and certain nature of their liabilities, tend to have a preference for long-term, relatively low-risk investments. Some overseas studies have suggested that superannuation schemes and life offices investing on the share market have concentrated on relatively large companies, channelling funds away from smaller companies, so reducing the economy's flexibility and the amount of competition. These findings cannot be considered conclusive, however, because of the difficulty of determining how people would invest their savings in the absence of superannuation schemes or life offices. A less ambiguous investment distortion has been caused by the tax-exempt status of pension funds. Tax-exempt institutions (such as pension funds) lose part of their taxation advantage if they invest in companies by purchasing snares. On the other hand, they retain their tax advantage if they lend to companies or to other entities such as the Government. The tax system has thus not only encouraged savings to be placed in pension superannuation schemes, but has then encouraged those schemes to lend money rather than invest in the corporate sector as equity participants. To understand this effect more clearly, the December 1987 Consultative Document on Full Imputation demonstrated that, under the company tax system which taxes companies as they derive income and shareholders on distribution of dividends, the effective tax rate on investment depends on whether the 67 investment is financed by debt, retained earnings or new equity. Its conclusion was: a the effective tax rate on corporate investment financed by debt is the effective rate of the lender; b the effective tax rate on corporate investment financed by retained earnings is the effective company tax rate; and c the effective tax rate on corporate investment financed by new equity exceeds the effective company tax rate, but decreases towards that rate the longer the income is retained in a company. Since tax-exempt superannuation funds effectively have a zero tax rate, equity investment by such funds results in a tax penalty. Their return on debt instruments is tax-free, but earnings on equity investments are taxed at the effective company rate. That penalty may be borne by the company raising funds. In such a case the company has to generate sufficient income (after payment of company tax) to produce the rate of return required by the superannuation fund (i.e. the same return as could be received from an equivalent debt investment). The full imputation system is being introduced so as to remove such distortions between different forms of company finance. However, as in Australia, it has been found necessary to deny imputation credits to non-taxpayers. This means that income tax will be paid by the company despite the tax-exempt status of the equity owner. If pension superannuation funds were to retain their exempt status, earnings on their share investments would still be taxed at the effective company tax rate. Tax-induced investment distortions in this area would continue to arise and a significant part of the benefits of imputation would be lost. 68 A further possible investment distortion caused by superannuation tax privileges is a product of the influence company management often has over the superannuation scheme established for the benefit of employees. In many cases that scheme will build up considerable financial resources as a result of employees being induced by the tax system to save through the scheme. It is often possible for the scheme to use some of those savings for investment in the contributing firm by way of shares. That shareholding may then be used by the firm's management as a means of warding off unwelcome takeovers. Since takeovers are one of the methods by which the economy's resources are allocated to their best use, the end result can be lower overall economic performance. 5.4 Tax Privileges Distort Employment Contracts As well as distorting investment patterns, tax concessions in this area are likely to have distorted aspects of employment contracts. Employer-paid superannuation contributions and life insurance premiums form part of the remuneration packages of employees. Because of tax preferences, people are induced to receive a higher proportion of their remuneration in this form when, in the absence of tax concessions, they might prefer to receive more of their income in cash and thus be free to make their own decisions on investment and consumption. This argument for removing the concessions is the same as the argument for taxing other forms of remuneration received as fringe benefits. Employee superannuation appears to have created particular distortions in labour contracts. It is often argued that tax concessions for employee superannuation impede labour mobility. The argument is that the concessions increase superannuation contributions and therefore increase the loss to an employee on early withdrawal from a scheme with limited vesting. However the 69 effect of the present tax concessions on labour mobility is less than clear cut. While the tax concessions lead employees to weight their remuneration packages toward superannuation, they should not overly affect the type of superannuation or the degree of vesting (ie the extent to which benefits are independent of length of service). In general, the degree of vesting can be expected to be determined by the requirements of an efficient employment contract. That may involve some form of limited vesting of employer superannuation contributions to compensate employers who have provided training to a staff member who leaves for another job. This is similar to the role of severance or redundancy payments which act as a form of insurance for an employee against loss of his or her investment in learning skills specific to a particular job. However, as explained in the previous chapter, employees can receive significant tax advantages by leaving their job, withdrawing from the superannuation scheme and taking their superannuation rights as a tax-free lump sum. To offset the tax incentive for employees to change jobs, employers can be expected to have provided superannuation in a form which restricts labour mobility by limiting vesting. The end result of the tax concessions is that employees receive more of their remuneration in the form of superannuation than they would in the absence of the tax concessions. That can in turn create incentives for employees to change jobs. To prevent labour turnover increasing, employers provide superannuation in a form which limits vesting to a greater extent that the underlying employment relationship justifies. Thus laws in this area have caused remuneration to be provided in a less than optimal form with more complex remuneration packages and greater restrictions on job mobility than would otherwise be justified. Two leading British tax commentators have concluded that specific tax 70 concessions for superannuation disadvantage employees. Whereas money in the bank increases an individual's ability to disagree with his or her employer; wealth in the form of accrued pension rights reduces it. (Kay and King The British Tax System. 1983) 5.5 Tax Privileges Make Regulatory Controls Necessary The economic costs of the tax privileges are partly the product of the various statutory and regulatory controls on superannuation and life insurance. Particularly for superannuation, many of these controls are a consequence of the tax concessions. For example, a superannuation scheme member cannot easily gain access to his or her superannuation savings because this is generally prohibited by restrictions imposed by law. One of the main purposes of such restrictions is to limit the scope and cost of the tax preferences. If superannuation savings were easily accessible, bank accounts could be transformed into superannuation funds and receive their tax privileges. Similarly, existing regulations prevent superannuation schemes from using funds in a business. Again this is partly to prevent businesses from forming themselves into superannuation funds in order to access tax concessions. One consequences of the regulatory restrictions placed on the substantial funds held by superannuation schemes is that the funds are not available for a number of purposes including the financing of small businesses. For life insurance, past tax concessions made it necessary to have regulatory restrictions which distinguish life offices from other financial institutions. The present basis of taxation of life insurance makes it necessary to retain this distinction. This regulatory ring-fencing of life insurance is becoming more difficult. As the financial sector develops in a less regulated, more competitive environment, the traditional distinctions between types of financial institution and the services they 71 provide are becoming blurred. Trading banks are now offering the services once the preserve of life offices and vice versa. Not only have the lines between different institutions become blurred, but the services which are being marketed are also becoming less differentiated. An example is the incorporation of a separate savings instrument in a life insurance plan (unbundled life policies)and the sale of "savings bonds" by life offices. As the boundary lines between different financial institutions and their services fade, differences in tax treatment become sustainable only by erecting a more and more elaborate and arbitrary system of fencing. Extension of the regulatory regime in that way could further restrict the ability of those affected to provide the services consumers want and would thus be likely to lead to an increase in the efficiency costs associated with these tax concessions. 5.6 Tax Privileges Give Rise to Tax Planning The existing regulatory controls in New Zealand have failed to restrict access to the tax privileges in the way intended. Some examples of methods used to gain tax advantages under the present regime are: a the incorporation of short-term debt instruments (life bonds) and investment programmes (unbundled life policies) under the life insurance umbrella; b personal lump sum superanuation schemes aimed at the more affluent 60-plus age group who have no restrictions on tax- exempt withdrawals. The scheme can be operated in a similar manner to a bank account but interest is taxed within the scheme at the lower scheme tax rate; c employee schemes structured so as to divert most of the tax benefits to a few key employees; 72 d employee pension schemes structured so as to allow them to be wound up with benefits distributed to members as tax-free lump sums; e employee schemes used in artificial employment situations; and f employee pension schemes using borrowings from members to take greater advantage of the concessions. Another opportunity has been exploited overseas. Many defined benefit plans have moved to a position in which their existing level of funds exceed their liabilities under the plan. Overseas some companies have attempted to access this surplus by clawing back past contributions. These developments are most advanced in the United States of America where schemes (which are often solely employer-funded) have been wound up and excess funds returned to the employer company. In one case the amount recaptured in this way has been reported as amounting to $1 billion. In New Zealand an employer can recapture excess funds in a scheme which is woud up if this is provided for in the trust deed and approved by the Government Actuary. Many schemes have such a trust deed provision. Opportunities thus exist for employers to receive the tax benefits intended for employees, especially if the excess funds can be returned to employers tax-free. Another possible avenue of tax planning is the arbitrage opportunities which a tax-exempt pension fund can provide. For example, a taxpayer can sell an income earning asset to a pension fund. The pension fund then derives the income tax-free while the taxpayer derives a tax-free capital gain. The exploitation of tax preferences in order to reduce tax liabilities erodes the tax base and makes the tax system appear 73 unfair. Arbitrage opportunities are difficult to counter so long as taxpayers are on significantly different tax rates. Moves to reduce the variability of tax rates and to tax different entities and activities in a more uniform manner are the only effective means of dealing with such problems. Other tax opportunites could be reduced by implementing a more stringent regulatory regime. However, more stringent regulations would be likely to increase the economic costs of the regime and may not be successful in preventing the preferences being used in unintended ways. The level of regulatory complexity and stringency applying to United States' superannuation schemes seems indicative of the approach New Zealand would have to adopt if the preferences for this form of saving were maintained. Examples of the rules applying in the United States are: maximum contribution levels, maximum and minimum benefit levels, minimum vesting rules, strict rules as to allowable investments, and provisions which require employers to ensure that the benefits of the plan are provided across all levels of employees taking into account voluntary employee contributions as well as employer contributions. 5.7 Tax Privileges Make the Tax System Unfair As well as providing tax planning opportunities, tax privileges for superannuation and life insurance have created perceived inequities in the tax system. New Zealand and overseas (American, Canadian, and Australian) data are consistent in finding that tax concessions for this form of saving favour the following groups. a High Over Low Income Earners Higher income earners are in a better position to make the most use of these taxation concessions for a number of reasons. Firstly, they have the ability to save a larger 74 percentage of their income which is then available to be saved in a superannuation scheme. Secondly, under a progressive income tax structure, the concessions provide a greater benefit to high- as compared to low-income earners. Third, those with high marginal tax rates have been able to benefit from the relatively low rate of tax applied to life office income. Finally, high income earners are generally better able to take advantage of the various tax planning opportunities which the rules have made available. This is confirmed by data extracted from the Household Expenditure and Income Survey. On the basis of this data, it is estimated that in 1988/89 48 per cent of superannuation contributions and life insurance premiums will be paid by individuals with incomes over $31,000. The proportion of fund earnings attributable to this group is likely to be significantly higher. This is because a larger share of fund earnings are likely to be attributable to older scheme investors who can be expected to have incomes higher that the average for the fund. It is also estimated that people on or below the average income (for all those aged 15 or over) have been receiving only about 5 per cent of the tax benefits from the superannuation contribution deduction. This means that 95 per cent of the benefits of the tax concession has been going to those with above average incomes. People on twice the average income and upwards have been receiving over half the benefits the concession provides. For every dollar of concession delivered to people on the average income, $16 was being delivered to people on incomes three times higher than that average. Moreover, these figures do not take into account the likely additional skewing of the system in favour of the wealthy which could be expected to occur as a result of employer contributions also favouring the rich. 75 Further details on how the concessions have been favouring the higher income earner are provided in Appendix A5.2. b Employees Over the Self-Employed New Zealand tax rules have favoured employee schemes over personal schemes. Member contributions to a personal lump sum scheme have not been deductible, whereas contributions to an employee lump sum scheme have been. Employee schemes have also benefited from tax-exempt employer contributions, an advantage which personal schemes are not compensated for by the higher exemption level for member contributions. Thirdly, the benefits of an employee pension scheme are easier to access as a tax-free lump sum than the benefits of a personal pension scheme. These differences in treatment, together with the restrictions imposed on substantial shareholders from joining a firm's employee superannuation scheme, discriminate against the self-employed and those who have put their own money into a firm. Moreover, many self-employed provide for their retirement by investing their capital in their business or farm. Such investments do not qualify for the concessionary treatment afforded superannuation. c Those Employed by a Single or Few Employers Over those who Change Employers Relatively Frequently The design of most employee superannuation schemes provides limited vesting of employer contributions and net investment earnings. This means that those who change employers or spend periods out of regular employment can receive limited advantage from superannuation tax preferences. Instead, the main beneficiaries tend to be those who have an uninterrupted career with the one employer. This has tended to favour public servants and 76 employees of large private sector firms. d Those with a Relatively Stable Lifetime Income Over those with a Fluctuating Income Annual limits on exempt contributions disadvantage those who have irregular incomes or spend periods out of the workforce, for instance, receiving an education. Such people often cannot benefit from even the more limited preferences available to personal schemes since they may have little or no assessable income to offset with contributions. e Those in Full-time Employment over Those Working Part-time While this is not necessarily the case, occupational superannuation schemes are often limited to full-time staff. Women tend to figure disproportionately in all the above disfavoured groups and thus tend to receive minimal advantages from the tax concessions. Women tend to be lower income earners, are less likely to maintain a career outside the home, are more likely to change jobs and work part-time, and often interrupt or permanently cease income-earning activity in order to raise children. They therefore tend to be poorly covered by superannuation. Data from the Household Expenditure and Income Survey for 1985/86 suggest that only about 23 per cent of those making contributions to superannuation schemes in that year were women. 5.8 The Need to Increase Savings It has been argued that superannuation and life insurance tax privileges are justified because incentives are required to encourage savings, especially long-term savings, in order to 77 foster economic growth. This savings argument lacks substance. From an economic perspective there is nothing inherently good (or bad) about savings, any more than there is anything inherently bad (or good) about consumption. In general, people can be expected to make consumption and savings choices in a way which, given constraints which the Government imposes, maximises their welfare over time. In the absence of other considerations, no government intervention to alter the level or rate of savings is called for. The appropriate role for the government is to enable welfare to be maximised. Subject to the Government’s redistributive goals, this can best be achieved by creating an environment in which resources are efficiently allocated to maximise output. It is not necessarily achieved by instituting policies which attempt to induce people to defer consumption (ie to save). The available evidence does not suggest that New Zealand's past poor economic performance is the result of a paucity of savings. Instead it has been the result of the inefficient allocation of resources. Our savings to Gross Domestic Product ratio has been about average for OECD countries yet our growth rate has been markedly below average. There are at least two areas where government action can distort decisions which determine the economy's overall level of saving. First, by running Budget deficits which it does not finance from domestic sources, it may signficantly reduce the net overall level of savings. Secondly, as discussed in Chapter 3, the income tax system inherently imposes a tax penalty on savings. Both of these concerns have been met directly by the Government's actions to bring the deficit under control and to fund it appropriately, and by the measures it has already taken to reduce income tax rates. 78 Even if the Government did wish to increase the rate of private savings, there is no obvious reason why it should do so by favouring superannuation and life insurance over other forms of saving. Moreover, while it is clear that the penalty which income tax imposes on savings results in a significant economic cost, it is less clear that taxation concessions to increase the after-tax return on savings necessarily lead to an increased rate or level of savings. While on the one hand an increased after-tax return from savings increases the relative incentive to save, on the other hand it results in those who have some savings target (such as an adequate level of retirement income) having to save at a lower rate in order to meet that target. Where the balance lies is difficult to assess with the economic evidence being inconclusive. What is clear is that taxation concessions for particular forms of saving do influence the allocation of savings among different institutions and that this is likely to incur economic costs. The announced tax rate reductions and other taxation reforms, combined with the Government’s budgetary policy, are far more likely to produce a more appropriate savings response than the maintenance or granting of special taxation privileges to selected financial intermediaries. 5.9 The Need to Support Long-term Savings There is no particular reason why the Government should favour long-term savings over shorter-term savings. Borrowers' requirements for longer-term savings will be reflected in differences in the interest rates which are offered for various terms. There is no reason why the Government should intervene and impose its own asssessment of the relative merits of short- versus long-term savings or investment. In addition it is one of the functions of financial intermediaries to transform a flow of short-term savings into longer-term loans. Thus, there is no need for long-term investment projects to necessarily be financed 79 by long-term savings. The share market is, perhaps, the best illustration of this point. The need to provide some special encouragement for long-term finance was carefully considered by the 1981 (Campbell) Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System. It recommended the removal of the taxation exemption for superannuation fund net investment income. It concluded that should the Government choose to pursue a policy of greater neutrality between various forms of saving, this would not necessarily mean a reduced overall supply of long-term capital. It saw "no basis for concern about future shortages of long-term capital provided the financial system is not shackled by too many restrictions", and saw "no justification for government intervention on the basis of spurious or at best uncertain projections of future supply and demand for capital". The Committee's basic recommendations were that the Government should remove unnecessary restraints it had imposed on the financial sector. In the absence of those constraints the financial sector was able to meet the capital requirements of the economy without the need for special tax concessions. The New Zealand Government has freed up the financial sector in a way which should allow that sector to respond to the requirements of the rest of the economy. 5.10 The Need to Encourage Private Provision for Retirement It has also been argued that tax expenditures in the form of privileges to superannuation and life insurance meet an important social goal - the encouragement of private provision for old age. The argument that these tax concessions are necessary to help alleviate poverty amongst the aged is invalid for a number of reasons. First, there are strong private incentives to provide an acceptable standard of living during one's retirement. 80 Secondly, the Government already provides relatively generous retirement support in the form of national superannuation. Thirdly, this form of tax expenditure is an inefficient method of assisting the elderly. The tax preferences are not targeted to those who might be most in need of government assistance. Furthermore superannuation covers only a minority of the population. Of the total labour force, only some 26 per cent belong to employee superannuation schemes (20 per cent to employee pension schemes, and 6 per cent to employee lump sum schemes). Moreover, many who belong to employee pension schemes receive relatively low retirement benefits through, for example, changing jobs. (It has been estimated in Canada that fewer than 10 per cent of members of pension plans end up with a full pension). It was these sorts of reasons which led the Canadian National Council of Welfare to conclude that tax incentives for superannuation "turn logic and equity upside down, favouring those who need help least and driving an additional wedge between the incomes of the have and have-not elderly" (April 1984 Report on the Retirement Income System). Similarly, in Australia, an April 1984 Department of Social Security research paper, Government support of Retirement Incomes in Australia, concluded that, despite the considerable cost to the government of tax concessions for occupational superannuation, benefits from such schemes "are received by relatively few aged people and generally provide a modest supplement to, rather than replace, the age pension." It is commonly argued that tax concessions for superannuation are a means of reducing the government's future pension liabilities. With the introduction of the National Superannuitant Surcharge, this argument has some validity. However, this benefit has to be weighed against the present day costs the concessions incur, both in revenue and economic terms. All the available evidence suggests that in return there is minimal coverage which is 81 concentrated on those who are likely to need future retirement income support least. In short, as a welfare measure, the concessions fail any reasonable cost-benefit analysis. It should be noted that the future role of the Government in providing direct income support for the elderly is outside the scope of this tax reform exercise. This issue is being considered by the Royal Commission on Social Policy. 5.11 Conclusion Taxation privileges for superannuation and life insurance are inequitable and incur high economic costs. Any of the supposed benefits which the concessions provide in terms of increased incentives to save and higher retirement incomes are better met by more direct policies. These are likely to be far less costly in revenue and economic terms as they can be designed to target those most in need. It has therefore been decided to move superannuation and life insurance onto a normal income tax treatment. As far as possible they should be treated on the same basis as other financial investment vehicles. Broadly this involves: a taxing contributions and life insurance premiums at a rate as close as possible to the marginal tax rate of scheme members and policyholders; b taxing the net investment income of funds and life offices at a rate as close as possible to the marginal tax rate of scheme members and policyholders; and c exempting all superannuation and life insurance benefits from taxation. As far as possible, regulatory restrictions on superannuation 82 schemes and life offices, other than those which are necessary or desirable to protect investors, should be removed. The taxation and regulatory regime will, as far as possible, not discriminate between schemes and life insurance which provide lump sum benefits and those which provide pension benefits. Indeed, it would be desirable to allow schemes and policies to permit, if they so wished, switching between lump sum and pension benefits. 83 APPENDIX A5.1 TAX REVENUE FORGONE AS A RESULT OF TAX PRIVILEGES FOR SUPERANNUATION AND LIFE INSURANCE This appendix details estimates of likely tax revenue forgone if tax privileges for superannuation and life insurance were continued into 1988/89. The estimates are given assuming the new tax rates announced on 10 February 1988. The estimates are also on a full year basis. This is not an estimate of the additional tax revenue resulting from the tax changes outlined in this document. The figures are arrived at by estimating the revenue which would be raised if savings through superannuation and life insurance were taxed on a normal income tax basis. This is the same basis on which the Treasury of the United States of America calculates its published estimate of tax expenditures incurred by the Federal Government as a result of similar tax concessions. 84 Table A5.1 Tax Revenue Forgone as a Result of Tax Privileges for Superannuation and Life Insurance, in 1988/89 Terms $ million Superannuation Exemption for member contributions 130 Exemption for employer contributions 290 Exemption for net investment income 260 Gross revenue forgone 680 Minus tax on pensions (excluding surcharge) (110) Net revenue forgone 570 Life Insurance Premium exemption 105 High tax rate on net investment income (15) Net revenue forgone 90 Total Net Revenue Forgone 660 85 APPENDIX A5.2 DISTRIBUTION OF TAX BENEFITS RECEIVED FROM THE PERSONAL SUPERANNUATION CONTRIBUTION EXEMPTION The following data was extracted from the Household Expenditure and Income Survey. It reflects tax benefits for different income levels with respect to superannuation contributions in the 1986/87 financial year. The survey covers all individuals, whether or not they are members of the labour force, aged 15 years or over. It is assumed that all superannuation contributions, up to a maximum of $1,400 per annum qualify for the exemption. That may lead to average benefits being over-stated to some extent because, for a person who is a member of a subsidised employee superannuation scheme, the maximum exemption has been $1,200. On the other hand, many of the lower income earners are likely to be members of higher income households. Moreover the data probably understates the extent to which the well-off receive the benefits of the overall superannuation concessions since the well-off are more likely to receive high employer contributions and are more likely to have large sums accumlated in superannuation schemes. Column 1 shows assessable income bands. The estimated average assessable income for the surveyed population in 1986/87 was $15,131. Column 2 is the estimated average annual tax benefit received by those who contribute to a superannuation scheme within the indicated income bands. Column 3 states the percentage of the overall benefit claimed by all eligible individuals which is received by individuals within that income band. 86 Column 4 gives the ratio of the percentage of the benefit claimed to the percentage of individuals within the income band. Thus, if the percentage of the benefit received is the same as the percentage of the population, then the ratio is 1. If the percentage of the benefit received is twice the percentage of the population, the ratio is 2. Column 5 lists the cumulative percentage of the benefit received by each income group beginning with the highest income group.

Thus, the Government has decided to move the tax regime from that described in Chapter 4 to a regime which more closely approximates normal income tax treatment as outlined in Chapter 3. This chapter provides further details on how the proposed and announced measures will operate for both superannuation and life insurance. Chapter 7 considers transitonal issues and implementation dates. 6.2 Registration of Superannuation Schemes There are a number of practical difficulties with applying an income tax system to superannuation. Administrative considerations require taxation rules which are, to some extent, special. To make these rules workable it will be necessary to identify superannuation schemes to which the special tax rules apply. This can be done by requiring such schemes to be registered with the Government Actuary or the Inland Revenue Department. Such schemes will be referred to as "registered superannuation schemes". It should be noted that the requirement for registration does not, of itself, imply any particular form of regulation of such schemes. Regulation of superannuation is considered later in this chapter. In broad terms a "registered superannuation scheme" will be a scheme or fund established principally for the purpose of pooling contributions made by individuals as members and/or their employers and which uses those funds principally to provide retirement or similar benefits to those members or their dependents or survivors. 88 Unfunded superannuation schemes will not qualify for registration. Under an unfunded scheme no contributions are paid in advance to meet the scheme's future liabilities in terms of promised benefits. Examples of unfunded schemes include some overseas employee schemes where employers provide superannuation by promising retirement benefits provided certain conditions, such as length of service, are met. However, retirement benefits are paid directly to the recipient by the employer and no fund separate from the employer is established. Accordingly, there is no identifiable fund earning investment income on which tax, calculated in accordance with the superannuation tax rules, could be levied. A superannuation scheme is partly-funded when employee and/or employer contributions are sufficient to meet only part of the scheme's future benefit liabilities. Such schemes will be able to be registered (subject to meeting other registration criteria) to the extent that the scheme is funded. 6.3 Member Contributions to Superannuation Schemes The deduction which has been available for member contributions to superannuation scheme is being withdrawn. People saving in this manner will, as with bank account deposits, not receive any tax deduction for the savings they make and will thus make those savings out of after-tax income. 6.4 Deducibility of Employer Contributions to Superannuation Schemes In general, employer contributions to a superannuation scheme of any type or category will be fully deductible from the employer's assessable income provided that the normal test requiring a nexus or connection between the expenditure and the gaining of assessable income is established. Since superannuation contributions for the benefit of employees forms part of a firm's 89 labour costs, there should normally be little difficulty in establishing the required connection with an assessable income earning process. The removal of tax concessions for superannuation would result in superannuation contributions being taxed on the same basis as other forms of remuneration. There should then be no reason to impose constraints on the employer's ability to deduct this particular form of remuneration. The restrictions currently imposed by section 150 of the Income Tax Act on the deductibility of employer superannuation contributions, in respect of: a the quantum of total contributions which are deductible; and b contributions to a personal superannuation scheme; should therefore be removed. The absolute discretion vested in the Commissioner of Inland Revenue by section 150(6) of the Act allowing him to deny a deduction for any employer superannuation contribution in whole or in part should also be removed. The provision in section 150(7) of the Act which denies a deduction for employer contributions which are refunded or repaid to the employer are aimed at clawbacks of employer contributions. It has not been clear how this applied where the clawback included surplus investment earnings of the fund. Moreover, the provision could be relatively easily circumvented. Provided the contributions are taxed when initially paid, and provided earnings of the scheme are appropriately taxed, there is no need to retain this provision. 90 Section 150(4) of the Act provides the Commissioner with a discretion to deny a deduction in respect of contributions paid by any company in respect of any employee who has a 20 per cent or more interest in the employing company. As noted in Chapter 4, this provision can interact with section 4(2) of the Act so that such contributions can be deemed to be a dividend. The preferred approach is to remove this restriction on the deductibility of shareholder-employee superannuation contributions. However, this raises questions of how proprietary company dividends and major shareholder-employees are to be treated generally; an issue raised by the Consultative Document on Full Imputation which is being considered by that Consultative Committee. The Consultative Committee on Superannuation and Life Insurance will consider the need to retain section 150(4) in the light of the Government's decisions on the general tax treatment of proprietary dividends and major shareholder employees. The deductibility of superannuation contributions will be restricted to contributions to registered superannuation schemes. That is to preserve the existing position where contributions to non-approved schemes are non-deductible. It will also be neccessary to prevent firms from deducting liabilities they may incur by assuming superannuation obligations under an unfunded superannuation scheme. Where no employer payments are made, but the employer agrees to provide future superannuation benefits, there are practical difficulties in imposing a current tax liability on such promised benefits. To provide a tax deduction for the employer without an offsetting tax on the employee remuneration, would produce similar taxation advantages as are now available for actual contributions. In the absence of any ability to tax the benefits accruing to employees, employer deductions will be denied. This will result in such benefits effectively being taxed at the employer's marginal tax rate. 91 In some cases the management and administration expenses of a superannuation scheme are incurred by the scheme's trustees. Those expenses may be met out of the employer contributions. For other schemes, generally those operated for employees of larger firms, scheme management and administration expenses are met directly by the employer. Such expenses have generally been deductible under existing law. No change in this position is proposed. 6.5 Taxation of Employer Contributions to Superannuation Schemes If employer superannuation contributions are to be treated as part of an employee's remuneration package, they should be taxed at a rate as close as possible to the tax rate of the scheme members. Tax Options There are at least three possible options for meeting this obj ective: a Tax each scheme member on their share of employer contributions. There are a number of problems with this approach. First, it would result in employees incurring a tax liability on income which they have not received in cash causing possible cash-flow difficulties. It is desirable to avoid such difficulties where possible, especially with respect to individuals who usually operate on a cash basis. Secondly, taxing employees on that part of employer contributions which did not automatically vest with him or her, could result in those who lose non-vested superannuation contributions (as a result of changing jobs for example), paying tax on income which they will never receive. The contributions representing non-vested rights would instead be left in the fund and eventually distributed 92 to remaining scheme members or would be returned to the employer by way of reduced employer contributions or clawback. On the other hand, if tax were not levied until employer contributions vested, the superanuation tax privileges would be effectively replicated. This option has therefore been rejected. b Tax the scheme itself on contributions it receives. Under this option contributions would be taxed at the marginal tax rate of the scheme. c Subject contributions to fringe benefit tax. This option taxes the employer as a proxy for the scheme members. The viable options are to tax the scheme or to remove the fringe benefit tax exemption which employer superannuation contributions currently enjoy. The fringe benefit tax option has been chosen on the basis that it is likely to incur the lower administrative and compliance costs. Employee and Personal Schemes It would seem desirable to avoid having to distinguish between employee and personal superannuation schemes. Thus employer contributions to either an employee or a personal scheme will be subject to fringe benefit tax and will be excluded from employee remuneration. The position of shareholder-employees will be reviewed in the light of the Government's decision on how such taxpayers should be taxed generally once the imputation system is in place. What is to be Taxed The fringe benefit tax liability will attach to any payment made by the employer to a superannuation fund for the benefit of an employee. Thus, it will not include promises to provide future 93 benefits under an unfunded scheme. It will, however, include payments to a scheme to meet scheme management and administrative expenses. Where those expenses are met directly by the employer, that will constitute a taxable fringe benefit being a benefit consisting of a service indirectly enjoyed or received by the employee. Tax Rate Fringe benefit tax is a non-deductible expense. The fringe benefit tax rate is calculated so as to reflect this. The formula on which the present fringe benefit tax rate is set is: \[P/(l-P)\] x (1-C) where P is the personal or employee tax rate; and C is the company or employer tax rate. The value of the fringe benefit in the hands of the employee is grossed up to its pre-tax value (achieved by dividing by (1-P)). This grossed-up value is taxed at the personal tax rate. The resulting rate is then adjusted (by multiplying by (1-C)) to take account of the non-deductibility of the tax to the employer. The personal tax rate used to calculate the fringe benefit tax rate is the top personal marginal rate of tax. However, as a transitional measure, lower rates will be applied to previously exempt employer contributions made in 1987/88 and 1988/89. These rates are given in Chapter 7. 6.6 Taxation of Net Investment Income of Superannuation Schemes It was announced in the 17 December Statement that the earnings of superannuation schemes would be taxed along the same lines as 94 have applied to life offices and those superannuation schemes which have been subject to tax in the past. These are Category 2 schemes (Class B or post-1982 lump sum schemes) and Category 3 schemes (schemes not approved by the Government Actuary). As explained in Chapter 4, Class B funds and life offices are taxed as a proxy for scheme members and policyholders. It is a more practical, albeit indirect, alternative to taxing scheme members and policyholders on the income which the fund or life office earns by investing their savings. It is proposed to adopt this approach for all superannuation funds. Taxable Revenue Included in the taxable income of a superannuation scheme will be all revenue derived by the scheme from its investments, including dividends received. As with existing taxable superannuation schemes, contributions will not be assessable in the hands of the scheme. Income derived from life insurance policies held by the scheme will also be non-assessable. The proceeds of the policy would be non-assessable in the hands of an individual and will have already borne tax at the life office level. An important question is the extent to which superannuation schemes should be taxed on any gains made on investments which, if made as the result of the direct investment of the individual, would not be subject to income tax on the basis that the gain is of a capital nature. Under existing law, taxable superannuation schemes (in a similar manner to life offices) are taxed on any gain made on the realisation of an investment by way of sale. Investment losses by way of sale are deductible. A primary objective of the taxation reforms in this area is to tax, as. far as possible, investments through different intermediaries in the same manner. Tax rules which effectively favoured superannuation schemes would be contrary to this 95 objective. It is therefore proposed that superannuation schemes be taxed on investments in the same manner as banks, life offices and currently taxable superannuation schemes. This treatment is also consistent with that proposed under the imputation system for unit trusts, whereby dividends paid out of capital profits will remain assessable. Thus superannation schemes will include in assessable income any profit or loss from the disposal of any of the scheme's investments. Superannuation schemes will also be subject to the accrual rules in sections 64B to 64M of the Income Tax Act (and for the purpose of certain de minimus provisions such as that governing cash basis holders of financial arrangements, superannuation schemes will not be deemed to be natural persons). Deductible Expenditure Expenses incurred in deriving investment revenue will be deductible. No deduction will be available for benefits which the scheme pays out. Some other expenses which a scheme is likely to incur will not be deductible. This includes expenses incurred in the development, marketing, selling, promoting and advertising of the scheme. Administration and management expenses will be deductible so far as they relate to the scheme's investment activities, but non-deductible so far as they relate to the costs of obtaining and administering contributions. One justification for denying deductions for expenses incurred in raising and administering contributions is that contributions will not form part of the superannuation fund's assessable income. However, even if superannuation funds were to be taxed on contributions, as a proxy for individual members, contribution-raising and administration expenses should still be non-deductible. First, superannuation contributions can be interpreted as a form of equity investment by members. Each member is taking an ownership share in the enterprise. Equity­ raising costs are of a capital nature and therefore should be 96 non-deductible. Secondly, under the net investment income approach, superannuation funds are untaxed on any profit made from any risk-pooling or insurance activity. Contribution­ raising and administration costs can be seen as a cost of this risk-pooling activity. Since the activity will be tax-exempt, costs associated with it should be non-deductible. The existing rules for the taxation of Class B lump sum schemes provides that no deduction from investment revenue is allowed for expenditure which is recoverable from any contributor. That provision has caused interpretive problems since most costs can be said to be, directly or indirectly, met out of funds provided by contributors. There seems to be little justification in limiting deductible expenditure on the basis of whether or not contributions were specifically earmarked for particular purposes. Presumably, the restriction was inserted because of concern that otherwise participating employers could receive a deduction for their contributions, those contributions were untaxed, and the scheme could receive a further deduction when the contributions were used to meet investment costs. Since employer contributions will now be subject to taxation, in the form of fringe benefit tax, this concern no longer applies. P r o v i d e d t h a t t h e c o s t s a r e i n c u r r e d i n d e r i v i n g a s s e s a b l e income of the scheme, they should be deductible. Some costs of the scheme will be partly attributable to the deriving of investment revenue and partly attributable to scheme adminstration, promotion etc. Such costs will need to be apportioned. The method of apportioning used under the existing taxation regime for life offices is on the basis of the ratio of premium to gross revenue of the office. The premium proportion so determined is non-deductible. Using this rule, apportionment for superannuation schemes would be on the basis of the ratio of contributions to gross revenue. However, the proportion of a scheme's gross revenue consisting of contributions is likely to be a poor approximation of the proportion of its expenses which 97 are attributable to non-deductible costs. It seems preferable to apportion such costs on a basis which, in each case, is acceptable to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Rate of Tax on Net Investment Income The approach adopted in the past for taxable lump sum superannuation funds has been to levy tax on net investment income of the fund at a flat rate which has been intended to approximate the average marginal rate of scheme members. The rate applying in 1987/88 for Class B lump sum superannuation funds was 3 3 cents in the dollar. However, the use of any rate between the top and bottom marginal tax rates creates an avoidance opportunity for those on higher marginal rates and disadvantages those on lower marginal rates. Clearly, no single rate can avoid both of these problems as long as scheme members are subject to a range of personal marginal tax rates. 6.7 Superannuation Schemes and the Company Imputation System As outlined in Chapter 5, the tax exemption for superannuation schemes creates a disincentive for schemes to invest in equity and significant economic costs are incurred as a result. By bringing superannuation funds into the tax net, this problem will be avoided. For the purposes of imputation, superannuation funds will be treated along the same lines as individual shareholders. They will be subject to tax on dividends received. Where those dividends carry with them imputation credits, those credits will be able to be used to partially or fully offset any tax liability on the dividends. Where imputation credits exceed the dividend tax liability, the excess credits will be able to be utilised to offset other tax liabilites, such as tax payable on interest income. 98 Example: Assume the superannuation fund is on a 25 per cent tax rate and receives a cash dividend from a company of $720. Assume the company is on a 28 per cent tax rate and is in a position to provide full imputation credits on all its distributed income. $ Cash dividend 720 Imputation credit 280 Taxable income 1000 Tax at 25% 250 LESS Credit 280 Net tax liability -30 Effective post-tax dividend 750 The superannuation fund will itself pay no net tax on its dividend income but will instead be able to use the $30 credit to pay the tax liability on other income derived in the same year. For instance, the $30 excess credit will be able to be used to meet a tax liability on $120 of interest income. The effective post-tax dividend income is $750 (the $720 cash dividend plus the $30 excess credit) If the superannuation fund had remained tax-exempt, it would have recieved the $720 dividend tax-free. This is less than the $750 effective post-tax dividend received as a result of being a taxpayer under a tax regime in which full imputation operates. Thus, in this example, by being made a taxpayer the superannuation fund is in a better tax position with respect to its dividend income than if it had remained tax-exempt. If the superannuation scheme's tax rate remained higher than the company rate, there would be no excess imputation credit to offset other income. Imputation credits would reduce, but not entirely offset the tax liability on the dividend. 99 Example: Using the same assumptions as in the previous example, but with the superannuation scheme tax rate set at 33 per cent. $ Cash dividend 720 Imputation credit 280 Taxable income 1000 Tax at 33% 330 LESS Credit 280 Net tax liability 50 Effective post-tax dividend 670 6.8 Treatment of Superannuation Scheme Benefits Since superannuation scheme savings will be made out of after-tax income and the income earned on those savings will be taxed as they are derived, benefits paid from a registered superannuation scheme will be tax-free. This will apply equally to pension as well as to lump sum benefits. A pension benefit is equivalent to a lump sum benefit paid out over a period of time together with the additional income derived by the fund from investing the remaining capital sum from which the pension is paid. That additional income derived by the fund will be taxable in the hands of the fund. There is therefore no justification for imposing an additional tax on that income. The 17 December Economic Statement stated that National Superannuitant Surcharge would continue to be levied on pension benefits. The rationale is that the pension beneficiary continues, indirectly, to be the recipient of income derived on his/her behalf by the superannuation fund. This is the income earned on the capital sum invested by the fund (or a life office) in order to provide for the pension payments. However, since the fund is taxed at a flat rate, it is not possible to levy National 100 Superannuitant Surcharge on the fund itself. Instead the pension will be subject to the surcharge as a proxy for the surcharge which should in theory be payable on the investment earnings of the fund. A pension will be defined as any benefit from a registered superannuation scheme which is paid out in more than one installment after the date on which the beneficiary becomes entitled to National Superannuation. Anti-avoidance rules will be necessary to prevent different installments from being paid out of different superannuation schemes. Levying the surcharge on the full pension benefit would penalise pension benefits. Only that amount of the benefit which represents earnings derived by the fund after the beneficiary becomes entitled to National Superannuation should be surchargeable. To approximate this, one half of the pension will be deemed to be capital return and one half subject to the surcharge. 6.9 Non-registered Superannuation Funds Member contributions to a non-registered fund will be treated in the same manner as member contributions to a registered fund - they will be made out of after-tax income. Employer contributions will be non-deductible as well as subject to fringe benefit tax. Investment earnings of such a fund will be taxed in accordance with the normal rules applying to an entity of its type, whether that be a trust, company, or deemed company. Benefits of the fund will be taxable if paid out in income form. 6.10 Non-resident Superannuation Funds Where the income of a non-resident superannuation fund is fully liable for New Zealand tax, the fund will be deemed to be resident. 101 Other non-resident superannuation funds will not be entitled to register and will therefore be subject to the tax rules outlined in 6.9 above. Moreover, such a fund will be subject to the rules applying to non-resident entities outlined in the Consultative Document on International Tax Reform. Residency of a superannuation fund will be determined in accordance with normal laws on residency, including the revised residency rules for trusts set out in the Consultative Document on International Tax Reform. 6.11 Taxation of Annuities Annuities will be taxed on the same basis as superannation pension funds. This issue is considered further in Volume 2 of this Document. 6.12 Life Insurance Premiums Life insurance premiums other than those paid by employers are to be non-deductible, including premiums on policies of pension insurance. The position with respect to premium payments by an employer for the benefit of an employee will be standardised. All such payments will become subject to fringe benefit tax and excluded from monetary remuneration. All premiums paid by an employer for the benefit of the employer will be made non-deductible. This will include premiums on temporary or term policies which have previously been regarded as deductible. 6.13 Taxation of Life Office Net Investment Income The future taxation of life offices will be the subject of a comprehensive review. This is covered in Volume 2 of this 102 Document. Until that review is concluded, life offices will continue to be taxed on the present basis. However, some changes will be necessary as a result of the taxation of the income of superannuation funds. This section reviews those issues requiring early resolution. Life Office Income An adjustment is presently made to life office investment income to reduce it by the proportion which is attributable to: a specified mortgage repayment insurance policies; b superannuation policies; and c annuities granted. A specified mortgage repayment insurance policy is defined to mean a single premium non-profit policy of life insurance issued on or before 31 March 1983, under which the sum assured is related to the amount outstanding on a mortgage of land. To avoid creating a need for such policies to be renegotiated, that adjustment will remain. The basis of the adjustment for income attributable to superannuation policies and annuities will be changed to reflect the assessability of this income. First, an adjustment will need to be made in so far as the rate of tax on such policies differs from the life office rate of tax. A further adjustment will be required to exclude gains/losses on the sale of investments to the extent that these are attributable to superannuation policies and annuities and accrued prior to the imposition of tax on such income. The income attributable to a superannuation policy or annuity will be taxed at the appropriate rate. 103 Life Office Expenditure Subject to the comprehensive review of the taxation of life offices covered in Volume 2 of this Document, existing rules on the deductibility of life office income will be retained. Tax Rate Since both superannuation schemes and life offices are taxed as proxies for individual investors, they should, apart from transitional measures, be taxed at the same rate. 6.14 Life Offices and the Company Imputation System The Consultative Document on Full Imputation (at paragraph 4.8) stated that the tax payable by a life office will be excluded from the ICA and thus will not be available as an imputation credit to shareholders. Life offices will be treated under the imputation system in the same way as superannuation schemes and individual share investors. They will be taxable on dividends received but will be able to use imputation credits to offset this tax liability. Any excess credits will be able to be used to offset tax on other income. Life offices will not, however, be able to allocate imputation credits to policyholders or their own shareholders. As noted above, the tax treatment of life office income, which includes the treatment under imputation, will be considered further in Volume 2 of this Document. As proposed in the Consultative Document on Full Imputation, imputation credits will not be able to utilised by non-residents, including non-resident life offices. Consideration will be given to deeming a life office to be a resident to the extent that its income is fully taxable in New Zealand. 104 6.15 Treatment of Life Office Benefits All benefits under a life insurance policy will be tax-free irrespective of whether benefits are in the form of a lump sum or a pension. Pension benefits and annuities provided by a life office will be treated in the same manner as superannuation pension benefits. That is they will be tax-free but the (approximate) proportion which constitutes income, as opposed to a return of capital, will be subject to the surcharge. Benefits received by an employer under a "key" employee life policy will also become tax-free. 6.16 Non-resident Life Offices The position of non-resident life offices is being considered together with the general reforms of New Zealand’s international tax rules. However, in line with the tax treatment of non­ resident superannuation, life benefits received in income form from a non-resident life office will remain fully taxable. This would include pension benefits, annuities and the benefits under a "key" employee life policy. Consideration will be given to deeming certain non-resident life offices to be New Zealand residents. 6.17 Regulation of Superannuation Funds As previously mentioned, the current regulations governing superannuation schemes provide for: - membership of a scheme; - when benefits may/must be paid; - who may/must receive benefits; 105 - what type of benefit may/must be paid; - where and in what a scheme may invest; and - what information a scheme is required to provide its members and public authorities. With the removal of taxation concessions, most of these regulations no longer become necessary. Superannuation schemes should be free to pay the type of benefit members require and should be free to vary the type of benefit over time. Nor need benefits be 'locked-in' to any particular point in time. In other words, the scheme should, if it so choses, be allowed to permit members to access benefits at any time. Of course, a scheme may wish to restrict benefit withdrawal rights, just as some bank accounts have restricted withdrawal rights. This should also be permitted. Aside from transitional considerations, the only area where regulatory control is desirable is where it is necessary to protect the interests of consumers - i.e contributors and beneficiaries. For this purpose a minimum degree of information may be required to be given to members, the public and/or a supervisory authority. There appears to be no justification for investment restrictions to be maintained. Trustees and managers will be responsible for their actions under general legal provisions such as trustee law. The proposal is to remove all regulatory controls not required for transitional reasons. However, if submissions establish that particular regulations are required and justified in order to protect members and the general public, those regulations will be retained. 6.18 Regulation of Life Offices Life Offices are subject to two main forms of regulatory control: 106 a a requirement to provide financial and investment information to the Department of Justice; and b a requirement to deposit $500,000 with the Public Trustee. Consideration will be given to whether the present information requirements are necessary and justified. The deposit requirement is designed to ensure that life offices operating in New Zealand have substantial financial backing. On the other hand, such a requirement probably restricts the level of competition in the industry. Continuation of the requirement therefore needs to be justified. 107 CHAPTER 7 - TRANSITIONAL ISSUES 7.1 Introduction Changes to the the taxation regime always impose a degree of disruption to past decisions on investments, savings, career choice and so on. The mere fact that someone incurs a short-term cost as a result of a tax change does not, of itself, justify transitional measures. It should be remembered that costs can be incurred not only when the tax system changes but also when other policy changes are made. A recent example is the costs incurred by investors in the rural sector when necessary policy changes were made in that area. Nevertheless transitional measures can often be desirable. In considering any appropriate measures, the objectives of the measures should be clearly defined, and their ability to meet those objectives judged. This chapter identifies transitional objectives and sets out measures which aim to achieve those objectives for superannuation and life insurance. 7.2 Transitional Objectives An approach of exempting existing superannuation and life insurance investors from the effects of any tax change has been rejected. Such an approach is unjustified. Any unanticipated change in the tax system - even the most minor change in the income tax scale - alters the basis on which past investments have been made. An approach to policy formulation which does not allow for any such tax changes is clearly impractical. It would effectively cement in place for all time the existing tax system and tax rates. Moreover, policy changes in almost any area can have a similar effect as a tax change (e.g. the removal of a subsidy or a regulation can impact to the disadvantage of an 108 investor, and changes to the social security system can affect commitments which individuals have made). Superannuation is not special simply because it involves long-term promises with respect to the provision of retirement income. Superannuation is clearly not the only long-term decision or commitment which can be affected by tax or other policy changes. Nor is superannuation the only means by which people make provision for their retirement. One has only to consider the position of a farmer who intends to retire on the proceeds of the sale of his farm. Past policy changes with respect to the rural sector have contributed to the decline in some rural land prices and could therefore have led to a reduction in the expected future income of retiring farmers. However, compensation has not been provided on those grounds. Instead of exempting past investors, the objectives of transitional measures for superannuation and life insurance are: a bringing in a non-concessionary tax regime for superannuation and life insurance at the earliest possible time so as to advance the eguity and efficiency gains from such measures. In particular it is only early implementation which enables the reforms to help finance significant reductions in marginal income tax rates; b minimising administration and compliance costs of any transitional measures; c protecting, as far as possible, those in or near retirement who have limited opportunity to adjust to the change in tax regime; d providing a time frame in which employers can adjust remuneration packages and schemes can be renegotiated 109 to reflect the change in tax regime; and e limiting the extent to which there are short-term and abrupt withdrawals of superannuation and life office funds which could needlessly disrupt the financial markets and the real economy. 7.3 Member Contributions to Superannuation Schemes The exemption previously applying to member superannuation contributions will be removed with effect to payments made on or after 17 December 1987. Continuing this concession would not meet any of the objectives outlined above. In general, measures which become effective from date of announcement should be avoided. However, in this case it was felt that delaying the effective date of the measures would have enabled taxpayers to claim deductions for superannuation payments in anticipation of accessing funds within a short time. Moreover, it was desirable to remove concessions for employer and employee concessions at the same time. Continuation of the employer concession would have created even more significant opportunities for abuse. In general, the exemption for member contributions to superannuation schemes is incorporated into PAYE deductions. Even if it had been possible to pass legislation removing the incorporation of the exemption in PAYE deductions, that would not have been administratively feasible. Employers need a lead time in order to alter their payroll systems. For this reason, the PAYE adjustment will not take effect until 1 April 1988. The removal of the exemption for the remainder of 1988/89 will be taken into account by way of reduced end of year tax refunds or increased terminal tax. It should be noted that pay period taxpayers do not have to file an 110 income tax return. If they have received the superannuation­ deduction on a PAYE basis after 17 December 1987, that deduction will not be recovered should such taxpayers choose not to file a return. For the 1987/88 year a pay-period taxpayer is defined, broadly, to be an employee deriving less than $20,000 of salaries or wages over the year. Although payments made after 17 December will not be deductible, deductions can still be made for payments before that date up to the full applicable maximum of $1,200 or $1,400. Thus, a person who made nine monthly payments of $133.33 to an employee superannuation scheme will be entitled to the full $1,200 deduction. Under the present personal exemption, the maximum exemption for taxpayers joining or leaving a subsidised superanuation scheme during the income tax year is calculated as $1,200 plus $17 for each month that the taxpayer did not belong to a subsidised scheme. In recognition of the fact that the deduction is being removed from 17 December 1987, this formula will be altered for 1987/88. Taxpayers is this position will add $23 (instead of $17) for each whole month between 1 April 1987 and 17 December 1987 that they did not belong to a subsidised scheme. 7.4 Employer Contributions to Superannuation Schemes Employer superannuation contributions made on or after 17 December 1987 will be subject to fringe benefit tax. It was important to make this change effective from the date of announcement otherwise employers could be in a position to take advantage of any interim period by over-funding schemes. To provide a period in which employers could re-assess remuneration packages, to allow for the necessary time for establishing administrative systems, and to reduce any incentive for employers to defer the timing of contributions, the 17 December Statement said 111 that the first payment would not be due until the due date for fringe benefit tax payments for the March quarter (20 April 1988), and that the rate of tax on this form of fringe benefit would be set at the outset at the rate which reflects the lower income tax rates to come into effect on 1 October 1988. The date for first payment has now been deferred until the due date for fringe benefit tax payments for the June quarter (20 July 1988) . In light of the decision to retain a variable income tax scale, the appropriate rate of fringe benefit tax for employer superannuation contributions has been reviewed. Tax rates are considered in paragraph 7.8 below. 7.5 Superannuation Fund Net Investment Income Transitional measures for presently exempt superannuation schemes (Class A lump sum and pension schemes) are designed to provide a period in which funds can have an opportunity to adjust to the new tax regime as well as providing a transitional period of continued favourable tax treatment to reduce the probability of abrupt scheme closures and withdrawals. Measures announced in the Government’s Economic Statement of 17 December to achieve those objectives were: a deferring the loss of tax-exempt status to 1 April 1988. For most superannuation funds this will be the beginning of the 1988/89 income year. However, some superannuation funds, principally those within the life fund of a life insurance company, have approved balance dates other than 31 March. To avoid arbitrary penalties being imposed on those who belong to a scheme which has a balance date other than 31 March, the 1 April 1988 date will apply irrespective of the income year used by the fund. Income for an income year including 1 112 April 1988 will be pro-rated according to the proportion of the income year that falls after 1 April and only this portion will be subject to tax under the new rules for the income year incorporating 1 April 1988. Thus, a scheme balancing on 31 December 1988 will be subject to tax on 9/12 of the income for the scheme's 1988/89 income year. A scheme balancing on 31 September 1988 will be subject to tax on 6/12 of the income for the scheme's 1987/88 income year; b applying the new lower rate of tax to come into effect on 1 October 1988 to previously exempt superannuation funds. In light of the changes to the proposed general tax rate scale, the appropriate rate of tax has been reviewed. Tax rates are considered in paragraph 7.8 below; c waiving the requirement to pay provisional tax for the 1988/89 income year, with 50 per cent of terminal tax for that year being payable on the normal date for terminal tax for that year, and 50 percent of the terminal tax being payable at the date for payment of 1989/90 terminal tax. For any fund with an April to September balance date, which will have an income tax liability for the 1987/88 income year, the above rules will also apply except that no provisional tax payment will be required for 1987/88 and terminal tax for that year will be payable 50 percent at the time of normal 1987/88 terminal tax and 50 percent at normal 1988/89 terminal tax date. These measures were aimed specifically at assisting superannuation schemes which are now exempt. Thus it was stated that the measures would be limited to existing tax-exempt superanuation funds (ie Class A lump sum funds and pension funds). Since a Class A superannuation fund is, by definition, a pre-1982 fund, there should be no problem in identifying an existing fund. 113 An existing pension superannuation scheme was defined as the Government Superannuation Fund and any pension scheme which has received or receives approval or classification by the Government Actuary as a pension superannuation scheme with effect on or before 17 December 1987. The Government Actuary’s approval process is still continuing under current legislation and approval is being granted to schemes whether they were lodged before or after 17 December 1987. When approval is granted, it is made effective from a specified day. Where complete documents were lodged on or prior to 17 December 1987, and the scheme had members before that day, the approval will be effective from no later than 17 December 1987. Such a scheme will therefore qualify as an "existing scheme" for the purpose of these transitional arrangements. The approval status of an employee scheme will not be affected by the entry of a new employer. Accordingly, the addition of a new associated employer will not affect a scheme's status as an "existing pension superannuation scheme". To reduce the possibility that these transitional measures could be abused, the 17 December Statement said that a personal (but not an employee) pension scheme will lose its status as an existing pension superannuation scheme if it accepts new members after 17 December 1987. Similarly, a lump sum scheme which changes to a pension scheme after 17 December will fall outside the definition of an existing pension scheme. For the purpose of these rules any person who had made an application in writing to join a personal pension scheme on or before 17 December will be deemed to have been accepted as a member of the scheme on or before 17 December 1987. Following regulatory changes, if the trust deed of a superannuation scheme allows, an existing pension scheme will be able to pay out lump sum benefits without losing its "existing pension superannuation scheme" status. 114 New superannuation schemes will be subject to tax as from 17 December 1987 in accordance with the rules which presently hold for Class B lump sum schemes. Any changes to those rules will be made effective from the beginning of the 1988/89 income year. 7.6 Asset Valuation Questions For those schemes which are to lose their tax-exempt status, it will be necessary for some of their assets to be valued in order to apply the income tax rules. The general rule will be that assets will be valued (and deemed to be sold and repurchased) at market value as at 1 April 1988. This will apply for depreciation purposes and for the purpose of calculating any realised gain or loss on the sale or disposal of an investment. As a result, any unrealised gain on an investment accrued prior to that date will not be taxable. On the other hand, any loss on an investment accrued prior to that date will not be deductible. This should ensure that superannuation funds are not taxed on gains made prior to the date at which they become taxpayers. Not allowing a deduction for previous falls in the value of investments recognises that a deduction should not be provided where a gain would not be taxable. In addition, allowing a deduction for unrealised losses on investments accrued prior to the fund becoming a taxpayer would disadvantage funds that had realised losses over that period. Financial arrangements, as defined in section 64B(1) of the Act held by a tax-exempt superann uation fund will be subject to the same rules. Any financial arrangement held by the fund will be deemed to be acquired for market value on 1 April 1988 and income or expenditure calculated thereafter in accordance with the rules set out in sections 64B to 64M of the Act. Any financial arrangement issued by the fund will be deemed to be issued at its 115 base price on 1 April 1988. Base price will be the initial acquisition price (as defined in section 64B(1)) of the arrangement, less expenditure previously incurred under the financial arrangement according to the accrual rules set out in sections 64B to 64M of the Act, plus any amount payable to the fund under the financial arrangement. Departures from these rules will be needed to meet specific cases. First, where a fund balances on a date other than 31 March, the 1 April date will be replaced by the first day of the income year in which 1 April 1988 falls. The reason for this is that such funds will be taxed on an income year basis with an adjustment to pro-rate income between the period before and the period after 1 April 1988. Secondly, life offices create particular problems because their superannuation funds are held in an undifferentiated life fund. Investment gains are presently fully brought into income with an adjustment to reflect the proportion of liabilities represented by tax-exempt superannuation policies. To remove the adjustment as from the first day of the income year in which they become taxpayers would result in tax being levied on investment gains accruing since date of purchase. That is clearly unacceptable. Instead, when an investment gain or loss is realised, the life office will be required to value investments as at the first day of the income year in which 1 April 1988 falls. Any gain or loss will be attributed to the tax-exempt superannuation fund on the basis of the proportion of liabilities relating to exempt superannuation policies as at that date. Any gain or loss so attributable will be non-assessable/non- deductible as the case may be. Any gain or loss after that date will be fully assessable or fully deductible as the case may be. Financial arrangements held or issued by a life office will be taxed on a similar basis. Example: A life office balancing on 31 December acquires a property 116 investment in 1984 at a cost of $100,000. On 1 January 1988 it is valued at $500,000. On that date 50 per cent of office liabilities relate to exempt superannuation policies. In 1989 the property is sold for $450,000. Total realised gain is $350,000. However, there was a $400,000 unrealised gain on 1 January 1988. Of this 50 per cent or $200,000 is apportioned to superannuation and is tax-free. The remaining $200,000 is taxable. The $50,000 loss since 1 January 1988 is fully deductible. The life office’s total assessable income from the investment in the 1989/90 income year is $150,000. 7.7 Superannuation Scheme Benefits As announced in the Economic Statement of 17 December, pension superannuation scheme benefits will become tax-free (except for the National Superannuitant Surcharge) as from 1 April 1989. This exemption should, in most cases, protect the position of existing superannuation scheme pension beneficiaries and those members of a pension scheme who are near retirement. The exemption will apply only to benefits from a registered superannuation scheme. As previously noted, a registered superannuation scheme will exclude non-resident schemes (although non-resident schemes subject to New Zealand tax will be deemed to be New Zealand resident) and will exclude schemes which do not meet regulatory requirements outlined in Chapter 6. All superannuation schemes which have or do receive Government Actuary approval under existing legislation (and which are New Zealand resident or which are deemed to be New Zealand resident) will become registered schemes provided that they complete any necessary renegotiation of the scheme prior to 1 July 1989. 7.8 Superannuation Tax Rates The 10 February statement by the Minister of Finance, announced tax rates for superannuation schemes of 25 per cent, and a fringe benefit tax rate of 24 per cent. The fringe benefit tax rate was 117 set using the scheme rate for the personal tax rate and a company tax rate of 2 8 per cent. These rates are concessionary given that most taxpayers will be on rates of 28 per cent or higher, and most superannuation scheme income is probably attributable to taxpayers on the top 33 per cent rate. The 17 December Statement made it clear that concessionary tax rates were to be restricted to "existing" tax-exempt superannuation funds (Class A and pension). The concessionary rates are a transitional measure to assist funds and employers adjust to the new regime. Those concessional rates will not apply to either new pension schemes or Class B lump sum funds. Class B funds will continue to be taxed at their existing 33 per cent rate. New pension schemes will also be taxed at this rate. It is to be noted that the 33 per cent rate is still concessionary in 1988/89 when the top personal marginal rate will be 40.5 per cent. For years after 1988/89, consideration will be given to reducing this effective rate of tax. To achieve that the Committee will be asked to consider the possibility of an imputation regime for superannuation schemes. The fringe benefit tax rate for employer contributions to new pension schemes and Class B schemes is to be set at 35 per cent. This rate corresponds to the top personal rate of 33 per cent (the top personal rate to be effective from 1 October 1988) and the company rate of 28 per cent. Category 3 (non-approved) superannuation schemes will continue to be taxed at the top personal marginal rate (40.5 per cent in 1988/89) and contributions to such schemes will be taxed at the standard fringe benefit tax rate. 118 7.9 Changes to the Regulatory Regime The current regulations governing superannuation schemes are being reviewed with the aim of removing most of the regulatory restrictions. It is intended that changes stemming from this review will be effective from 1 April 1989 when the new taxation regime comes fully into effect. Similarly, it is intended to remove restrictions on employer superannuation contributions with effect from the beginning of the 1989/90 income year. However, regulatory restrictions on withdrawals, investments and the ability of members to access funds prior to retirement will need to be retained for those funds which continue to receive concessionary tax treatment (i.e. existing pension superannuation schemes and Class A lump sum schemes). Similarly, legislative restrictions on the deductibility of employer contributions to such schemes will need to be retained. Nevertheless, as noted above, this will not prevent an existing pension fund from altering its trust deed so as to allow lump sum retirement benefits. 7.10 Renegotiation of Superannuation Schemes The changes to the taxation of superannuation will require schemes to consider renegotiating their terms. This is because benefits may have been promised, or may be being provided, on the basis that the superannuation scheme is tax-exempt. The taxation of scheme net investment earnings will reduce the ability of a fund to provide the benefits which have been promised. In such cases it will be necessary to reduce the level of benefits. Existing beneficiaries, and those nearing retirement, should be compensated for the reduced benefits by the removal of taxation on those benefits. However, this will not occur automatically. It will require the scheme's terms to be renegotiated. To allow this to occur in a smooth manner which is fair to all concerned, where the change in tax regime makes changes to the terms 119 of a scheme's trust deed necessary, approved superannuation schemes will be required to secure the agreement of a majority of scheme participants to new terms. That agreement will need to be lodged with the Government Actuary by 1 July 1989. The Government Actuary will be empowered to decline to approve the new terms if the amendments are not equitable. There will be a presumption that an equitable basis will be one in which, calculated using any reasonable actuarial basis, the increased tax burden resulting from the removal of tax privileges falls on all members and beneficiaries as if their current proportion of the fund were distributed tax-free and then re-invested in the scheme under the new rules. If all informed parties agree to a different outcome, the approval of the Government Actuary to the amendments will be forthcoming. The aim here is to prevent abuses. For example, to prevent scheme members from loading an undue proportion of the incidence of the tax onto scheme beneficiaries by disproportionate reductions in pension levels. It is emphasised that the discretion to withhold approval would not be expected to be exercised except in cases of abuse. Where the Government Actuary is of the view that it is impractical or unreasonable for a scheme to secure the agreement of a majority of participants to a change to a scheme, he will be empowered to approve changes which are, in his view, equitable. Where no changes to an approved superannuation scheme's terms are desired as a result of these tax changes, a superannuation scheme is to notify the Government Actuary of this by 1 July 1989. The Government Actuary will be authorised to delegate his above approval powers to any person he considers qualified. Any approved scheme which does not comply with the above requirements by 1 July 1989 will lose its status as a registered superannuation scheme. 120 In many cases a pension superannuation scheme does not itself provide pension benefits. Instead, the amount of the fund attributable to a retiring member is withdrawn and used by the superannuation trustees to purchase from a life office a life annuity for the beneficiary. Under existing law, the life office has not been taxed on the earnings of the sum of money invested to support the annuity. It will therefore have contracted to provide the annuity on the basis that it will derive tax-free income to fund it. Withdrawal of this tax exemption could make the annuity contract unprofitable from the life office's point of view. Since the life office may have contracted to provide a set annuity, it may have no means of adjusting the level of the annuity. The end result would be a loss for the life office and a windfall gain to the annuitant since the pension would now be tax-free. To produce a fairer result, legislation will be passed enabling life offices to reduce their obligations under an annuity contract. Again Government Actuary approval will be required, but the Government Actuary will be able to delegate his approval power to any person in any manner he sees fit. For personal superannuation schemes there is an additional transition issue. Such schemes have very restrictive early which the tax changes now make unfavourable. Consideration will therefore be given to legislation deeming such schemes to have early withdrawal rights. Such legislation would not come into affect until at least the end of 1988/89. 7.11 Life Insurance Transitional Measures As announced in the 17 December Economic Statement, the exemption for premiums on pre-1984 life insurance policies will be withdrawn for payments made on or after 17 December 1987. Employer-paid premiums for the benefit of employees made after 17 December 1987 which are not presently included in 121 monetary remuneration of the employee, and which are presently excluded from fringe benefit tax, will be subject to fringe benefit tax at the rate of 35 percent. Such premium payments which are presently subject to fringe benefit tax will continue to be subject to that tax at normal rates. Such premium payments which are now included in monetary remuneration will continue to be so included until the end of 1988/89. From the beginning of the 1989/90 income year, these payments will be excluded from monetary remuneration and, instead, be subject to fringe benefit tax at normal rates. Employer-paid premiums for the benefit of the employer will all become non-deductible from the beginning of the 1988/89 income year. All benefits under such policies will become assessable from the same date. The investment income of a life office will be subject to the same tax rates as Class B and new superannuation schemes - 33 per cent in 1988/89. This rate will be reviewed, and consideration given to an imputation regime, for future years. Benefits under a policy of pension insurance will become non­ assessable from 1 April 1989. 122 GLOSSARY OF TERMS Allocated funding - in schemes operating on this basis, contributions (of both employees and employers) and investment earnings are allocated to separate accounts opened in respect of each scheme member.

It also provided further details on the tax changes for life insurance and superannuation that were announced in the Government's Economic Statement of 17 December 1987 (Annex 3). The 17 December statement also announced that the present tax treatment of life offices would be reviewed with consideration being given to taxing them in a manner more consistent with that of other corporate taxpayers. In addition, changes to the tax treatment of some related areas of business activity were announced. These included annuities, health insurance and friendly societies. All of these related areas are discussed in this volume. With the exception of changes already announced (and any specific measures considered necessary to support the international regime), the tax changes discussed in this volume will not come into effect until the beginning of the 1989/90 income year at the earliest. Chapter 2 reviews the present tax treatment of life offices and considers the feasibility of taxing the insurance as well as the savings income of a life office. It also discusses the question of whether life office taxation can be made to integrate more easily into the imputation system for companies in general. Should the changes discussed in Chapter 2 not be considered feasible or desirable, the 1 existing regime will be retained. However, some changes will be made to improve this regime and these are outlined in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 reviews the tax treatment of annuities with the aim of putting them onto a regime consistent with that developed in Volume 1 for superannuation and life insurance. The tax treatment of health insurance is discussed in Chapter 5 and the taxation of friendly societies, which conduct a large proportion of health insurance business, is discussed in Chapter 6. Since friendly societies and credit unions are closely related by their common tax treatment and similar regulatory environments, credit unions have been included in this review and are also discussed in Chapter 6. This chapter focusses on the mutual nature of these organisations and discusses the problems that arise when these organisations are taxed under the same rules as non- mutual companies. Issues relating to the taxation of mutual organisations also arise in the context of the life office taxation review of Chapter 2. Since the issues for mutual life offices are essentially the same as those discussed in Chapter 6 for friendly societies and credit unions, the discussion of mutual life offices has been left until Chapter 7. Annex 1, included at the back of this volume, contains a list of errors in Volume 1. A change to one of the measures in Volume 1 - relating to the timing of valuations of assets of superannuation funds for tax purposes - was announced in a recent press statement from the Minister of Finance. This press statement is reproduced in Annex 2. A summary of the tax rate changes proposed in this Consultative Document (some of which have now been passed into law) is given in Annex 3. 2 1.2 Submissions In Volume 1, interested parties were invited to make submissions to a consultative committee by 8 April 1988. The date for submissions on the material contained in this second volume is Friday 29 April. The Committee is to report to the Minister of Finance on the issues discussed in this volume by 27 May 1988. As for Volume 1, submissions should be on A4-size paper, typed in double space on one side of the page only and should contain a brief summary of their main points and recommendations. Please send a total of 8 copies to: The Chairman, Consultative Committee on Superannuation, Life Insurance and Related Areas, c/- The Treasury, PO Box 3724, WELLINGTON All submissions received by the due date will be acknowledged. 3 CHAPTER 2 - THE TAXATION OF LIFE OFFICES 2.1 Introduction The method of taxing life offices outlined in Chapter 6 of Volume 1 of this Document carried over the existing taxation regime for such entities for 1988/89. It is nevertheless recognised that this taxation regime, introduced in 1982, has not proved to be entirely satisfactory from either the Government's point of view or from the perspective of taxpayers - life offices and their policyholders. As part of the general review of this area, the method by which life offices are to be taxed in the future is being reconsidered. The ambit of the review of life insurance in general is wider than the taxation of savings through a life office considered in Volume 1. The focus is widened to consider the taxation of life offices in their business activity as insurance underwriter and financial intermediary whereas previously the focus was on the taxation of the investment income of the policyholder. This chapter therefore considers the feasibility of taxing the insurance as well as the savings income of a life office and how life office taxation can be made to integrate more easily into the imputation system for companies in general. It seems desirable to have superannuation funds taxed in a similar manner to life offices. Consideration will therefore be given to amending the base for taxing superannuation funds along the same lines as any changes to the taxation base for life offices. In this chapter, defects in the basis of the existing taxation regime are identified. An alternative method for taxing life offices is outlined. Should a change in tax regime not be considered feasible or desirable, the next chapter considers some aspects of the existing regime which could be improved upon. 4 As explained in Chapter 4 of Volume 1, under the present taxation regime life office taxation is limited to the net investment income derived by that company. This is unsatisfactory from the Government's point of view since it means that part of a life office's possible income earning process is not subject to taxation. It has proved equally unsatisfactory from the point of view of taxpayers since deductible expenses are limited to those which are incurred in deriving net investment income. Other expenses (such as those incurred in advertising products or in managing insurance aspects of the business) are non-deductible. It would appear to meet the concerns of both the taxpayer and the Government if life offices were taxed on a basis which replicated that of other taxpayers. The Government is committed to the objective of a non- distortionary tax system. However, it recognises the complexities involved in life office taxation and considers that any changes to the taxation regime should be developed in close consultation with industry participants and other interested parties. This chapter canvasses the issues involved in the taxation of life offices, details the Government's objectives and suggests a taxation regime which would meet those objectives. The suggested taxation regime has a number of practical problems. This could lead to the regime being modified or the problems of instituting a tax system better than the existing one might prove to be insurmountable. If such problems are insurmountable, the existing regime may be the nearest we can get to meeting the Government's obectives. In that case alterations to the details of the existing regime seem desirable in order to improve the workability, effectiveness and fairness of the regime. Alterations along these lines are suggested in Chapter 3. 5 2.2 Objectives It would be inconsistent with the Government's general reforms of the taxation of superannuation and life insurance to tax life offices in a manner which provided them with special taxation concessions. It would be equally inconsistent with those reforms to tax life insurance in a penal manner so as to encourage consumers to use substitute financial organisations. The ideal tax system for life offices would be one which taxed such entities in a manner consistent with income tax principles which apply to other business taxpayers. Just as the taxation system should not discriminate between life offices and substitute intermediaries, so it should not discriminate between mutual life companies (those companies which are owned by policyholders) and proprietary companies (those companies which are owned by independent shareholders). Mutual and proprietary companies should, as far as possible, be taxed in the same way. Modifications will need to be made to normal income tax rules so that those rules can be applied to life insurance. Such modifications should not be made because life insurance may involve long-term investments and liabilities (other long- term investments do not necessarily receive special tax treatment). Normal income tax rules will, however, need to be amended to take into account any special operating characteristics of life insurance. One such characteristic is that life insurance generally involves a mixture of insurance and savings elements. This does create some difficulties in applying normal business income tax rules. Where necessary, therefore, the life office taxation regime may need to depart from general rules so as to operate efficiently and fairly. 6 2.3 The Nature of Life Insurance In the case of a life office offering only insurance policies the claims on which are paid out at the same time as premiums are paid in, the insurance company is acting as a pure insurer - an intermediary in a risk pooling process. The life office enables unrelated individuals to join together in pooling risks so that those who bear a loss receive an insured sum. This is a service which people value and are prepared to pay for. The company is thus able to charge a management fee which is normally incorporated into the premium. In addition, it can make a profit (mortality profit) if losses suffered are below that expected when premiums are set. The total income of an insurance company operating only such policies is the difference between premiums received and payments made (including claims). In the normal case a life office will act as a savings intermediary as well as a pure insurer. It will take the premium which is not required to meet immediate claims and invest this sum. Premiums plus the investment income forms a savings fund for the benefit of the policyholder. This savings fund can be used to subsidise future premium payments (when actual premiums paid are insufficient to meet the level of risk covered) and to provide the policyholder with an endowment benefit or to increase the amount paid out on claims. A life company will derive income from both the insurance and the savings element of a policy. In the former case, it can charge a management fee for acting as a risk-pooling intermediary, and make a profit (loss) if deaths of those insured are below (above) expectations. On the savings side, it can charge a fee for managing the savings fund built up by each policyholder. In addition, it may make a profit from favourable investment performance. When setting the premium 7 so as to create an investment fund sufficient to meet future risks plus any endowment element of the policy, the life office has to estimate what return the savings fund will produce. If the company underestimates this return, the savings fund will be more than is required to cover future liabilities. The resulting 'excess savings' can be used (in the case of a participating policy) to pay bonuses to policyholders. With non-participating policies, or policies which do not participate fully in investment returns, some of the excess may be retained for distribution to company owners or to build up the "capital" of the life office. The profit of a life insurance company can, therefore, consist of the following: management fee profit derived from its savings and risk- pooling functions; mortality profit which results from deaths of those insured being below expectations (and similarly for disablement insurance); and savings profit which results from a favourable investment performance. Net management fees from the risk-pooling function together with mortality profit is underwriting profit, being derived from the life office's role as an insurer. Net management fees from the savings function together with savings profit is financial intermediation profit, being derived from the life office's role as a financial intermediary or savings institution. Similarly the premiums paid by policyholders normally consist of: 8 - a pure insurance aspect, the payment necessary to cover immediate risk;- a savings aspect, a payment which is invested by the life office and then drawn upon both to cover shortfalls in future pure insurance premium payments and to provide for future endowment payments; and - a fee aspect, which covers the life office's fee for undertaking both the underwriting and the financial intermediation functions. 2.4 Existing Taxation Regime To meet the Government's objective of a fair taxation regime under which life offices are taxed on normal income tax principles, the life office should be taxed on all its underwriting profit plus all its financial intermediation profit. That should be in addition to the tax levied on the share of net investment income attributable to policyholders and paid by the life office on their behalf. The existing taxation regime for life offices does not achieve this objective. Taxable income is limited to investment income. On the other hand, allowable deductions are limited to investment expenses. By limiting the tax base of life offices to net investment income, no tax is levied on underwriting profit and no tax is levied on that part of financial intermediation profit which consists of net management fees from the savings function. Depending on the circumstances of each life office, the existing regime may be concessionary or penal. It is concessionary where the life office is deriving net savings, management fees and an underwriting profit. This can be 9 illustrated with a simplified example. Assume a life office collects $100 in premiums for a group of pure insurance contracts. Claims under the policies total $90 at which point the policies expire. (Alternatively, the risk under the policies may have been immediately re-insured for a premium payment of $90). Expenses total $5. Assume no investment income since the policies are pure insurance with no savings element. The underwriting profit on these policies is $5 - the $100 in premiums less the $5 in expenses less the $90 in claims. Existing law allows this profit to be tax-free. Although the existing taxation regime may be concessionary in some cases, in other cases it may be penal. As noted above, the life office is taxed on that part of its financial intermediation profit which is not derived from fees - ie its share of net investment income. Unlike a bank or other financial intermediary, however, it is not allowed a deduction for the costs of attracting the deposits (by way of premiums) from which its share of net investment income is derived. In addition, a life office may incur a net loss from its underwriting activities. Such a loss cannot at present be offset against other life office assessable income, but again it may be incurred as part of the life office's costs of obtaining funds from which it will (as well as providing a return to the policyholder) make a profit as a financial intermediary. 2.5 An Appropriate Taxation Regime for Life Offices If life offices are to be taxed on a basis more closely approximating other financial entities, they should be taxed on their full underwriting and financial intermediation profit. In that case, the range of deductible expenses should be widened to include all expenses of a revenue nature necessarily incurred in carrying out the full range of life 10 insurance business activities. Any new life insurance taxation regime cannot exactly duplicate the taxation regime applied to banks and similar financial intermediaries. This is because, as stated in Volume 1 of this Document, life offices will continue to pay tax on net investment income as a proxy for the interest which policyholders have in this income. Life office net investment income attributable to policyholders is the return policyholders receive for the savings element of their premium payments. Taxing policyholders directly on their share of this income may be a purer way of determining an individual policyholder's tax liability, but there are practical problems in apportioning income between policyholders and in taxing returns not yet received by policyholders. To overcome such problems, tax is levied at the life office level as a form of final withholding tax on policyholder income. For life offices, therefore, the taxation regime needs to be modified to ensure that this withholding tax is properly collected in addition to any separate tax liability the life office itself should incur. This requires tax to be levied at the level of both the policyholder and the proprietor (ie shareholders or, in the case of a mutual life office, policyholders in their role as owners). For policyholders, the appropriate tax base is: investment income less investment expenses less any financial intermediation fee charged by the life office less any net investment income transferred to proprietors or retained as capital (savings profit). 11 This policyholder income should be taxed at a rate appropriate to policyholders - ie a rate based on personal tax rates. Since the withholding tax levied on the life office is a final tax and a complete substitute for tax which otherwise should be levied on policyholders, no further tax liability should arise when the income is distributed to policyholders in the form of benefits. For proprietors, the appropriate tax base is: underwriting profit plus financial intermediation fees less total revenue expenses plus investment expenses plus any net investment income transferred to proprietors or retained as capital (savings profit). On the basis that this proprietor income is derived via a company, it should be taxed at the company rate. As with income derived by other companies, tax should be levied at the tax rate of shareholders when the income is distributed to them, with an imputation credit for the tax levied at the company level. 2.6 Taxing Underwriting Profit In simple terms, underwriting profit is the difference between insurance premiums received and insurance claims paid out. On that basis, the life office should be assessed on premiums received or receivable and claims should be deductible. As previously noted, however, premiums (and claims) include both an insurance and a savings element. Conceptually it is inappropriate to tax the life office on the savings deposits 12 it receives from policyholders. This is a capital receipt. Thus, the premium should in principle be differentiated into its savings component and its pure insurance component. The life office should be taxed only on the latter. Such a differentiation, however, would require complex actuarial calculations. The pure insurance component of each policy written by a life office would need to be determined. This would be dependent in each case on: - the type of policy being considered (its terms and conditions); - the period the policy has been in force;- the age of the life insured; - the sex of the life insured; - whether the policy has been altered in the past;- whether the policy has been loaded for extra risks; - whether the policy has a contingent debt; and - the underlying mortality rates, future net earnings rates and future expenses. As well as determining the insurance aspect of the policy premium, it would be necessary to determine the insurance and savings components of policy claims and benefits. Since the savings component of the premium would not be included in the life office's assessable income, the savings component of claims/benefits should be non-deductible. Differentiating savings and insurance components of premiums and claims/benefits should be possible. Indeed, with many policies it is already done. Modern "unbundled" or "universal" policies do, to a large extent, differentiate between the insurance and savings components of premiums so as to allow the policyholder to determine the extent to which his or her premium is to be used to provide insurance cover and the extent to which it will be accumulated in a savings 13 fund. Nevertheless, for many other policies, such as whole- of-life and endowment policies, differentiation of premium components would be a difficult task. High compliance and administration costs would be likely. The necessary law would be complex, and the tax liability of a life office would be dependent on the actuarial assumptions made. These problems could be mitigated to some extent by differentiating savings and insurance components at an aggregate rather than at an individual policy level. Underwriting profit can be determined as U where: U = (P - L+) - (C - L-) = P - (L+ - L-) - C where P is gross premium income of the life office; L+ is increases in the office's liabilities; L- is decreases in the office's liabilities; and C is life office claims and benefits. A life office's liabilities are recognised in the policy or actuarial reserve. This is the provision which the life office makes for future policy claims. In estimating the required reserve, the amount of policy claims and benefits that are expected to be paid in future years based on the expected mortality of the life office's policyholders, and the premiums yet to be received from those policyholders less future expenses, are discounted to the present year using the expected after-tax rate of return on investments. This reserve, plus future net premiums, plus the investment income on these funds should accumulate to an amount sufficient to meet the expected claims and benefits. In determining underwriting profit, the subtraction from gross premium income of increases in liabilities would remove 14 the savings component of premium income (ie the sum set aside to cover future risks and endowments). The balance consists of an amount which covers the the company's cost of covering the current year's risk, together with a loading for expenses (if any). The subtraction from gross claims of reductions in liabilities would remove the savings element of claims and benefits. Since the savings component would be deducted at the time it is set aside by being added to the life office's liabilities, it should not be deducted a second time when the savings are drawn down. The amount of premium which is assessable to the life office should not be reduced by any expense loading. This is because all revenue expenses would be deductible at the appropriate time when they are incurred. There would, of course, be no need to separately identify increases and decreases in a life office's liabilities. Instead, a deduction would be provided for any net increase in liabilities over the year, and any net decrease would be added to assessable income. The problem with this method of calculating underwriting profit is that it requires a calculation of life office liabilities based on the actuarial reserve. This in turn would require estimates to be made of mortality risk, future expenses and future investment yields. A number of countries operate life insurance taxation regimes which are reliant on such estimates being made. Examples are Canada and the United States of America. However, because the estimates are necessarily based on judgements as to future events, there is a considerable margin for disagreement about the appropriate provision for actuarial reserve. It is very difficult to operate a tax system critically dependent on valuations arrived at within such judgemental parameters. 15 Countries which do operate a tax system based on changes in actuarial reserve have adopted a number of approaches. The estimating parameters can be set by the Government. However, mortality, investment and expense experience can vary significantly between life offices. The application of standard estimates is likely to penalise some offices and favour others. Alternatively, parameters for each life office can be agreed upon. For example, the Government Actuary may be required to agree to the valuation of each life office's liabilities. However, such an approach would be likely to involve high compliance and administrative costs and still leave tax liabilities to be determined by a number of judgemental issues. In this regard, it is to be noted that the Canadian 1966 (Carter) Royal Commission on Taxation considered that any system which allowed different life offices to use different assumptions in valuing actuarial reserves would be inequitable and administratively complex. It thus seems highly desirable to use a taxation system which avoids the need to value life office actuarial reserves. Limiting the taxation base to net investment income is one such option. However, as previously noted, this can result in either concessionary or penal taxation. Another option is to make all premiums as well as investment income taxable and all claims/benefits as well as expenses deductible. This would mean that the savings component of premiums would be taxed. However, all claims/benefits (including the savings component) would be deductible. Tax on the savings component would be payable at the time the premium is paid with the offsetting deduction being deferred until claims/benefits are paid out. As a result, there would be a high tax liability for expanding offices with an increasing premium income but few claim/benefit payouts. 16 However, in present value terms, the amount of tax paid should be approximately right. While the income is taxed earlier than the matching deduction, deductible benefits would be comprised of both the initial (post-tax) premium and the (post-tax) return derived from investing that premium. Apart from mortality gains and losses, the higher level of benefits would be adequate compensation for the deferral in the deduction. While the expanding life office would face a high tax liability, it would be accruing an offsetting high level of deductions. The point is illustrated by the following simple example. Example Assume a premium with a savings component of $100 is received by a life office. Assume a rate of return on the life office's investments of 10% after tax (paid on behalf of the policyholder), and a life office tax rate of 28%. If the life office pays out the entire benefits to policyholders, it would derive no profit and should thus not be subject to tax in its own right (tax should of course be levied on the net investment income on behalf of policyholders). After two years the policyholder would receive $121 in benefits. If the life office tax regime taxes premiums but allows a deduction for actuarial reserves, the life office would be taxable on the $100 premium, but would receive an offsetting deduction of $100 (the value of $121 in benefit payouts in two years time discounted at 10% per annum). If instead tax were payable on the premium but a deduction allowed for benefits at the time they are paid out, the life office could still offer a benefit of $121. 17 It would pay tax on the $100 premium, reducing the post- tax premium to $72. After two years that would accumulate to $87.12. It could pay out $121, and so receive a tax deduction of $33.88 (28% of $121). When added to the $87.12, this would fund the $121 benefit payout. When the premium is received the life office would have a net premium of $72 plus a present value of future tax deductions of $28 ($33.88/1.I2). The total premium value would therefore be the desired $100. The advantage of this approach over use of the actuarial reserve is that it removes the need for the tax system to be reliant on actuarial estimates of mortality, future investment yields and future expenses. It is a relatively simple approach which achieves the right result as long as the life office is able to utilise the tax deduction resulting from deductible benefits. Provision would thus need to be made to allow the office to carry any loss back into past income years. This right result is also dependent on no change in tax rates. If tax rates are increased, too little tax would be collected at the time premiums are paid. Conversely, if tax rates are reduced, too much tax would have been collected. Small variations in tax rates would not produce major distortions. However, if tax rates were changed to a significant extent, the tax liability of the life office would need to be adjusted in order to minimise any advantage or penalty. Given the distortions caused by limiting life office taxation to net investment income, and given the problems of implementing a regime based on actuarial assumptions, the preferred approach would seem to be to tax life offices on premium income as that income is derived, while allowing a deduction for benefits/claims when they are paid or become 18 payable. 2.7 Taxing Net Investment Income Net investment income would continue to be taxed along the present lines with any necessary modifications considered in the next chapter. It should be noted again that tax on net investment income is for the most part a tax on policyholders paid by the life office as a final withholding tax. It should therefore be separate from, and should not be able to be offset against, any tax liability incurred by the life office itself. 2.8 Expenses Investment expenses would continue to be deductible against gross investment income. Other revenue expenses incurred by the life office would be deductible. In general, normal income tax laws should be applied to determine whether expenses are of a revenue nature and the timing of deductibility. However, life offices do tend to incur some expenses (such as agent commission fees) which have capital characteristics in that they are incurred early in order to establish an income-generating process (the life policy). Such expenses should be deductible since they are incurred in deriving assessable income, but consideration should be given to identifying such costs with a view to having their deduction spread over the average term of a company's life policy. 19 2.9 Transfers of Net Investment Income to Proprietors The final item in the income of a life office is transfers of net investment income to proprietors. Such transfers should be deductible from the net investment income of policyholders, and assessable as income of the life office. 2.10 Summary of Suggested Tax Regime Under the suggested taxation regime, the existing tax on the net investment income of life offices would be replaced by two levels of taxation. First, taxation would continue to be levied on net investment income as a withholding tax on income which is effectively being accrued for the benefit of policyholders. In general, tax rules for personal income would apply. The tax rate would be based on personal tax rates and would reflect the tax rates of policyholders. There would be no ability to offset net investment losses against other life office income, nor to offset life office losses against such net investment income. However, transfers of net investment income to the proprietors of the life office would be deductible. Secondly, a separate tax would be levied on the life office itself. The life office would be taxed on all premium income as the premiums are received or become receivable. It would also be taxed on any other business income (such as fees) which the life office derives, as well as transfers of net investment income. All non-investment revenue expenses would be deductible as they are incurred with consideration being given to spreading rules for such expenses as agent commission fees. Claims and benefits paid to policyholders would be deductible when those payments are made. 20 The assessable income so derived would be taxed as the corporate income of the life office and be subject to normal corporate tax rules. Thus the tax rate would be the corporate tax rate and income and losses would be able to be offset against other corporate income subject to the normal rules in section 191 of the Income Tax Act. Losses would be able to be carried forward in accordance with section 188 of the Act. As noted above, special rules would allow losses to also be carried backwards. 2.11 Timing of Tax Payments Tax payments on net investment income would be payable under the normal provisional and terminal tax rules. The balance date of the life office would be used for the purpose of determining the applicable income year. For other life office income, special tax payment timing rules would need to apply. Since, under the suggested regime, claims/benefits would be deductible, a proper tax treatment of life insurance would not be achieved if the life office were able to invest and obtain a return on pre-tax rather than post-tax premiums. In the extreme case where tax is not collected until claims are met, the ability to invest pre-tax premiums would allow the life office to avoid any tax impost on the investment income which the life office derives on behalf of policyholders. That is because the life office is able to deduct all claims and benefits paid, which will implicitly include the initial premium plus the investment return on that premium. Under the method proposed, it is the post-tax premium rather than the pre-tax premium which should be invested. The point can best be illustrated by an example. 21 Example Assume that the life office is subject to the suggested taxation regime but that all tax payments are on the normal provisional and terminal basis. Further assume that a premium of $100 is paid at the beginning of the year, on which the pre-tax annual investment return is 10%. The claim at the end of the year is $110, so that the policyholder receives the full investment return tax- free. The $100 premium would be assessable, the $10 investment return would be assessable, but the $110 claim would be deductible. In calculating its taxation liability (provisional and terminal) the life office would have no assessable income. The end result would be that the policyholder would be able to receive a totally tax-free return on his or her savings. This potential problem would be partially relieved by the separate tax treatment of net investment income and life office income. However, the underlying problem would still remain and would need to be mitigated by taxing gross premiums on a withholding tax basis with payments due on the 20th of the month following the month when the premium was received or became receivable. This withholding tax payment would be credited against provisional and terminal life office tax liabilities with, where appropriate, tax refunds being made. Example Assume a premium of $100, a pre-tax rate of return on investment of 10%, tax on net investment income at the rate of 33%, and a life office corporate tax rate of 28%. When the premium is received the life office would pay withholding tax of $28. The net premium invested would 22 be $72. The pre-tax investment return on this $72 would be $7.20, on which tax at 33% would be $2.38. The benefit which the policyholder would require after personal tax is $106.70. The life office would have cash of $76.82 (the $72 premium plus the $4.82 post-personal tax investment return). The office would pay out a tax- free benefit of $106.70 which it would be able to deduct. The deduction would have a value to the life office of $29.88 ($106.70 x .28). The life office would thus be able to fund the required benefit of $106.70 out of cash of $76.82 plus the value of the tax deduction ($29.88). 2.12 Imputation The Consultative Document on Full Imputation stated (in section 4.8) that tax payable by a life insurance company will be excluded from the Imputation Credit Account (ICA) and will not be available as an imputation credit to its shareholders. The rationale is that a life office pays tax as a proxy for policyholders, not for shareholders. A life office will receive imputation credits with its dividend income. The aim is to allow it to offset its tax liability on dividend (and other) income, but not to pass credits on to its own shareholders in the same manner as non-life companies. Nor could a life office pass imputation credits resulting from its other tax liabilities down to its shareholders. This special treatment of life offices recognises their role as policyholder proxies. However, as a result, shareholders of a life company could be placed at a disadvantage relative to shareholders in other companies. This would be ameliorated by the taxation regime suggested in sections 2.6 to 2.10 above, which would enable life offices to be treated under imputation more like other companies. 23 As previously stated, proprietor income would be taxed as company income at the company tax rate. When distributed, such income would be taxed in the hands of shareholders as a dividend. Since proprietor income would be taxable separately from the tax levied on behalf of policyholders, this would enable an ICA to be established and would enable a life company to make imputation credits available to its shareholders under normal imputation rules. Dividends received by the life office as part of its net investment income would remain taxable and the life office would continue to be able to offset its investment income tax liability with any imputation credits received. This should ensure that the life office pays tax at the appropriate rate on the underlying corporate income which the dividends represent. Should the life office wish to transfer that dividend to proprietors, it will be able to do so. It will simply transfer to proprietors an amount equal to the grossed-up dividend. That amount will be deducted from net investment income and be taxed as proprietor income. Tax paid on proprietor income would then be included in the proprietary ICA, and be available for distribution to life office shareholders. The correct amount of tax should then be paid at the life office shareholder level. Example Assume that a company in which a life office holds shares derives $100 of income and pays tax on this income of $28. The net $72 is distributed to the life office as a shareholder in the company together with an imputation credit of $28. The net investment income of the life office consists of a grossed-up income of $100. At a tax rate of 33%, the life office would have a tax liability on the dividend of $33 against which it would be able to utilise the $28 imputation credit. Its net tax liability would therefore be $5, leaving the life office with the 24 net sum of $67. It could then transfer $100 (the grossed-up dividend) to its proprietors. It would not, however, transfer the associated credits of $28. These credits would continue to be held on behalf of policyholders, and would be available to offset tax on other investment income. The tax on proprietor income would be $28 and this amount would be credited to the life office's ICA. Should the life office pay the net sum of $72 as a dividend to its shareholders, they would receive a grossed-up dividend of $100, with an offsetting imputation credit of $28. The result would be the same as if the dividend had passed from the initial dividend-paying company directly to the life office shareholders, or indirectly via a non-life company. 2.13 Mutual Life Offices It has been implicitly assumed so far that the life office is a proprietary company, ie a company owned by shareholders who are separate from policyholders. Many life offices are mutual companies which are, in effect, owned by the policyholders. An objective of the life insurance taxation reforms is to tax mutual and proprietary companies, as far as possible, in the same way. However, a mutual company might effectively distribute income to its policyholders/shareholders by way of reduced premiums. This would erode the tax base and give mutual life offices a competitive advantage over non-mutual offices. This problem also arises in respect of friendly societies and credit unions. Since these organisations are discussed in Chapter 6, the subject of the taxation of mutual life offices is deferred to Chapter 7. 25 2.14 Transition A major difficulty in bringing into place a new taxation regime for life offices along the lines suggested above would be the problem of transition from the existing regime. The suggested regime should not result in any significant increase in life office taxation - it could result in a decrease. Thus, existing life contracts should not be disrupted. However, the Government would not be prepared to allow all future claims/benefits to be deducted from life office income when past premiums funding those claims/ benefits were not initially taxed. One option would be to exclude from deductibility a proportion of claims/benefits on the basis of an actuarial valuation of liabilities at the date any new regime came into place. 2.15 Life Reinsurance The income tax provisions presently governing life insurance business also govern life reinsurance. There does not appear to be any reason why any new life insurance taxation regime should not similarly apply to life reinsurance. 2.16 Non-Resident Life Offices and Life Offices Operating Offshore The current life insurance and reinsurance income tax provisions also apply to any non-resident life office with respect to its New Zealand business. The same would apply to the suggested new taxation regime. A distinction will, however, be drawn between resident and non-resident life offices with respect to: 26 a tax-free life benefits - as proposed in Volume 1 of this Document, the benefits of non-resident life offices may be subject to income tax. This is an anti-avoidance measure. Further anti-avoidance measures may be considered necessary in the light of decisions on the international taxation regime; and b imputation credits - non-resident life offices would, along with other non-resident entities, not be entitled to imputation credits. If applied strictly, these measures would be unduly harsh on some life offices, especially some non-resident mutual companies whose structure would make the establishment of a resident subsidiary difficult. Consideration should therefore be given to deeming life funds of non-resident entities to be New Zealand resident companies. The life fund would need to be approved by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and any offshore transfer of funds by that life fund would need to be deemed to be a dividend payment. The position of New Zealand resident life offices operating offshore will need to be considered in the light of decisions made on the international taxation regime. 2.17 Superannuation Funds Because many superannuation funds constitute an undifferentiated part of life office funds, there would be some administrative advantages in putting superannuation funds onto the same taxation regime. This would also allow superannuation funds to have the benefit of being able to deduct non-investment expenses. A superannuation scheme can also make an underwriting profit 27 and should, ideally, be subject to tax on this. For example, with a pension superannuation scheme, members pool the risk of living a long life. In return for the benefit of the certainty of receiving an income for as long as they live, members obtain a relatively small benefit if they die soon after retirement. Just as a life office makes a mortality profit on term insurance policies if people live longer than expected, so a pension superannuation scheme will make a mortality profit if people live for a shorter period than expected. This, together with any net fee charged for acting as risk-pooling intermediary, is the superannuation scheme's underwriting profit. Frequently, a superannuation scheme will engage a life office to carry out its underwriting function by purchasing annuities. Any underwriting profit will then be made by the life office. Any changes to the announced tax base for superannuation funds should be dependent on this not disrupting the transition of existing superannuation schemes to becoming taxpayers. 2.18 Implementation Date Any changes to the taxation regime for life offices (except for those measures already announced and any specific measures considered necessary to support the international taxation regime) will not come into effect until the beginning of the 1989/90 income year at the earliest. 28 CHAPTER 3 - AMENDMENTS TO THE EXISTING TAXATION RULES FOR LIFE OFFICES 3.1 Introduction The previous chapter concluded that there was a case for changing the basis under which life offices are taxed. Options for a new tax base were considered and an alternative regime for taxing life offices outlined. Should a satisfactory alternative taxation regime not prove possible, as a second-best option, the existing taxation regime under which the life office tax base is limited to net investment income would continue. However, there are areas of that taxation system which should be amended or clarified in order to ensure that the objectives of the legislation are properly met. Such amendments are considered in this chapter. Since life offices and superannuation schemes are to be taxed on the same basis, amendments to the existing taxation regime for life insurance would also carry across to superannuation schemes. 3.2 Principles on Which Amendments Should be Made If the existing tax base for life offices were to be retained, the principle that a life office is then largely a payer of a withholding tax levied on the life office as a proxy for its shareholders should be reinforced. The justification for possible amendments to the law should be judged on whether that principle is advanced by the amendment in question. 29 3.3 Relationship of Special Life Office Tax Provisions to Other Provisions in the Income Tax Act The special tax rules for life offices are currently contained in section 204 of the Income Tax Act. Some clarification may be desirable as to the relationship between this section and other provisions in the Act. Section 204 sets out rules for determining the assessable income of companies of life insurance and reinsurance with respect to their business of life insurance. Presumably, it has always meant to apply also to a life office's business of life reinsurance. The section would need to be amended to make this clearer. There is some obscurity as to the relationship between section 204 and the rest of the Income Tax Act. Section 204(8) states that the profits of a life office from its life insurance business shall be deemed to be its: gross revenue derived from life insurance and reinsurance; less life insurance/reinsurance premiums and annuity considerations which are received or receivable; less direct and indirect investment revenue costs. Gross revenue is not exhaustively defined. Specific items are deemed to be included in gross revenue. These are: - premiums from life insurance and reinsurance and annuity considerations which are received or receivable; - received or receivable revenue from investments; - realised capital gains/losses from investments; 30 - commissions and fees (except those that are in respect of insurance, reinsurance and annuities). Section 204(5) purports to establish the relationship between section 204 and the rest of the Income Tax Act. It states that, subject to section 204, life offices are assessed as if they were normal corporate taxpayers. It appears that the best interpretation is that life offices are subject to normal income tax rules unless those rules are in conflict with the special rules in section 204, in which case section 204 overrides the normal rules. As it is presently drafted, the section can be difficult to interpret and apply. This is because it can be difficult to determine the breadth of the section and/or whether there is a conflict between the section and other provisions which should be overriden. Turning first to the breadth of the section. The business of life insurance is not exhaustively defined by the Income Tax Act. An integral aspect of a life insurance business is the investment of premiums and the management of that investment. There can, however, be uncertainties as to what constitutes investment. Holdings of debt instruments are clearly investments, as are holdings of equities. Similarly, life offices invest in real estate even though this may also involve them in the additional business of being a rentier. The issue can become somewhat less clear where the life office uses its funds directly in other businesses such as running farms, resource extraction and so on. There seem to be two approaches to this issue. The first would involve defining the business of life insurance more precisely. This may involve restrictions on the use to which life office funds can be put. The second option would impose no such restrictions but would clarify the law so that a life 31 office would be taxed under the life office taxation regime on any other business activities it may carry out subsidiary to its life office business. Since direct investment in other businesses may be the best use of life office funds, it would seem desirable not to restrict the use to which life office funds can be put and to tax any other business activity of the life office under the life office tax regime. This emphasises the desirability of taxing life offices on a more normal basis and the need to ensure that any life office taxation regime is robust and fair. Another difficulty with the legislation as it is presently drafted is that it can sometimes be unclear whether section 204 is in conflict with other provisions of the Income Tax Act in such a way that section 204 and not the other provisions should prevail. Since section 204(8) deems life insurance assessable profits to be gross revenue less certain specified cost categories, it can be arguable whether certain income is included within the income base of a life office and whether some costs are properly deductible. On the income side, gross revenue is defined to include a number of items on a received/receivable basis. An example is income accrued under a debt instrument which is taxable under sections 64B to 64M of the Act. It may be at least arguable that such income, not being received/receivable, is not assessable income of a life office. On the cost or expenditure side, it seems to be the clear intent of the legislation to allow life offices depreciation allowances under the normal rules set out in section 108 of the Act. However, this can be difficult to justify under a literal interpretation of section 204. Similarly, it can be unclear whether a life office is free to take a deduction for unrealised losses on investments which under general law would be considered to be trading stock. 32 The law in this area should therefore be clarified. The appropriate principle to adopt is that income derived by a life office for the benefit of its policyholders should be taxed on the same basis as if that income were derived directly by the policyholder. 3.4 Identifying Investment Revenue Many of the possible problems of identifying what constitutes investment revenue were considered in the previous section. There are, however, at least two other potential problem areas. First, it may sometimes be unclear when a capital gain on an investment has been realised so as to give rise to an income tax liability. An example is a share swap associated with, say, a takeover of the company in which the life office has shares. The question presently revolves around whether, in the particular circumstances of the case, there has been a profit or gain from the sale or disposal of the investment. The same question arises with respect to a profit or gain which would be assessable under other provisions of the Act, such as section 65(2)(e). Since this issue also arises outside the life insurance area, it should be considered in a more general context. Similarly, there does not appear to be a case for constructing special life office rules for determining the cost price of investments which constitute an undifferentiated part of a wider investment portfolio, such as shares in a company or Government stock. Under existing law the life office is free to adopt a reasonable basis for determining the cost price of such an investment. A second area which may give rise to some difficulties is in determining whether a particular asset, such as a building, is 33 an investment of the life office or whether it is acquired for the business use of the company. This issue currently tends to be determined by rulings of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. It would seem desirable, where practical, for such distinctions to be embodied in the legislation. 3.5 Deductibility of Life Office Expenses Ever since the present taxation regime for life offices was enacted in 1982, industry participants have consistently argued that the range of deductible expenses should be widened to include non-investment expenses such as advertising costs and the costs of agent commissions. The arguments presented by the industry in favour of full expense deductibility can be summarised along the following lines. If the tax regime is viewed as taxing life offices as financial intermediaries, then these institutions should be able to deduct the same expenses as other financial intermediaries. A trading bank can deduct its fundraising expenses such as the costs of employing tellers and the costs of advertising. It is argued that a life office should similarly be able to deduct such costs, including the costs of agent commissions. If, on the other hand, the tax regime is viewed as a tax on the net investment income of policyholders, it has been asserted that life offices should be able to deduct all expenses from gross investment income. The policyholder deposits a capital sum with the life office (the premium). The tax regime should be structured so as to allow the policyholder to receive back this deposit in full together with the after-tax return the life office derives from 34 investing the premium. These arguments were considered and rejected when the present legislation was enacted in 1982. The arguments were also rejected when Australia's similar system of life office taxation was examined by the 1981 (Campbell) Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System. The reasons for not allowing non-investment expenses to be deductible are outlined below. First, the life office taxation regime does not impose taxation on the life office as a financial intermediary. A finance company derives income on the margin between its borrowing costs and its lending costs. All its expenses must be met out of this gross margin. Thus its profit is its gross margin less all expenses. It is this profit which is taxed. The interest return to depositors is then taxed when that interest is derived by the depositors. For a life office, on the other hand, this is not the case. To a large extent, it is not taxed on its insurance activities. The only tax it pays is a withholding tax on behalf of policyholders. It is appropriate that expenses incurred on behalf of policyholders should be deductible. These are investment expenses. Other expenses, however, are incurred as part of the life office's underwriting and other business. They are not expenses incurred on behalf of policyholders. They are expenses incurred in carrying out a tax-exempt activity. Thus related expenses should remain non-deductible. The second argument advanced for full deductibility of expenses - that the company should be taxed like its policyholders - has more force in that it appears to be more in line with the principles of the current taxation regime. However, the argument has in the past been rejected. The 35 argument presumes that the premium is equivalent to a savings deposit. In fact it is partly a savings deposit and partly a fee in return for which the life office provides insurance. It is not correct that policyholders can expect to receive back their premium payments plus after-tax interest thereon and that the tax law should make this possible. For instance, with a term insurance policy a policyholder will not receive any premium back unless the insured event occurs. More generally, the expected return to the policyholder is less than the expected return on savings because part of the premium is the underwriting fee paid to the company. The conclusion reached is that, as a first preference, life offices should be taxed on all their income under rules as close as possible to normal income tax rules. As a second preference, deductible expenses should be limited to investment expenses. 3.6 Apportionment of Expenses If deductible expenses are to continue to be restricted to investment expenses, these expenses need to be identified and general expenses need to be apportioned between investment and other activities. This would also be necessary under the wider taxation regime suggested in the previous chapter, although in that case, the apportioned expenses would be deductible to the life office either in its role as underwriter or in its role as proxy for the policyholder. Investment expenses are defined by existing law as the sum of "direct investment revenue costs" and "indirect investment revenue costs". "Direct investment revenue costs" are defined as costs incurred in carrying on the business of life insurance in the income year exclusively in deriving investment revenue and/or assessable fees and commissions which are not 36 recoverable, directly or indirectly, from any person. "Indirect investment revenue costs" are defined to be, in effect, a proportion of those costs which are not directly attributed to investment activities or to deriving premiums. It was noted in section 6.6 of Volume 1 of this Document (page 96) that the non-deductibility of expenses incurred by a Class B superannuation fund where those expenses are recoverable, directly or indirectly, from any contributor, has caused interpretive problems and is difficult to justify under a non-concessionary taxation regime. The same comments apply with respect to life office expenses. Where otherwise deductible expenses are met by premiums, no tax problems should arise since the expenses, if met directly by the policyholder, should be deductible to that policyholder. Where expenses are recoverable from other parties, that recovery should be included within the life office's investment income either explicitly or by general provisions such as section 78 of the Income Tax Act. One of the difficulties of administering this part of the life office taxation regime has been determining what is a "direct investment revenue cost". Given the statutory definition of this term, for an expense to be a direct investment revenue cost, it must be exclusively incurred in deriving investment revenue. The Inland Revenue Department appears to interpret this requirement restrictively. Thus, where a life office employee is not 100 per cent employed in investment activities, his or her salary and other costs are generally not considered to be direct costs. Similarly, where a building is not entirely used for pursuing an office's investment activities, it has been argued that even those costs associated with that building which can be apportioned to investment activities are not direct costs and thus not fully deductible. 37 Costs which, because they are not exclusively incurred in deriving investment revenue are not fully deductible, are included in general revenue costs. Such costs are apportioned between deductible investment expenses and non-deductible premium expenses on the basis of the proportion of the life office's revenue which consists of premiums and the proportion which consists of investment income. These rules for determining the deductiblity of expenses have not proved to be satisfactory. Life offices are encouraged to restructure their affairs so as to maximise the extent to which their expenses satisfy the requirements for full deductibility as a direct investment expense. For example, the tax system can advantage the life office which reduces the extent to which individual staff members divide their time between investment and non-investment related activities. This can be advantageous from a tax viewpoint, however, it may not result in the most efficient use of the life office's resources. Apportionment on the basis of the percentage of total life office revenue which consists of premium income is arbitrary and unlikely to reflect the true position of each firm. It assumes that one dollar of premium and one dollar of investment revenue both incur the same amount of general costs. In fact this would seem to be unlikely. Furthermore, it results in a high tax impost for expanding life offices deriving a high level of premium income, and a high tax impost in those years in which a life office derives low investment income because, for example, it realises substantial losses on investments. Conversely, contracting life offices and those deriving high investment income are advantaged. It would be desirable to construct an apportionment system which reduced the extent to which life offices are advantaged 38 or disadvantaged according to how they employ their staff and other resources, and which was not dependent on their relative level of premium income. While no basis for apportionment is likely to be ideal, it should be possible to apportion most expenses on the basis of their use in the investment income- generating process. For example, accommodation costs should be able to be apportioned on the basis of floor area used for investment activities. Staff costs should similarly be able to be apportioned on the basis of work studies. Those costs which could not be so apportioned may be able to apportioned using the percentage of other costs which are attributed to investment activities. 3.7 Apportionment of Income Before the recent policy change (which takes effect from 1 April 1988), the income of most superannuation funds was tax-free. A significant proportion of life office business has been from tax-exempt superannuation funds placed with life offices by trustees of superannuation schemes. Those funds are included in the life funds of life insurance companies. If the income of the life funds were to be subject to taxation in full, life offices would have been placed at a disadvantage in that tax-exempt superannuation scheme assets invested through a life office would be subject to taxation. To enable life offices to compete for superannuation business free of tax disadvantages, the legislation has attempted to adjust the net assessable income of a life office so as to leave income attributable to tax-exempt superannuation (as well as income attributable to annuities and certain mortgage repayment insurance policies) tax-free. This has been done by attributing to tax-exempt activities a 39 proportion of overall life office income on the basis of the percentage of total life office liabilities which consist of assets attributable to tax-exempt activities. The assessable income of the life office has been reduced by the income attributed to tax-exempt activities in this way. While the tax exemption for superannuation funds and annuities is being removed, there will still be a requirement to adjust life office income in a similar manner. The tax exemption for income attributable to certain mortgage repayment insurance policies is to be retained, and, more importantly, while superannuation and annuity funds are becoming taxable, for such funds in existence on 17 December 1987, a reduced rate of tax is to be applied. The present method of adjusting life office income described above is not satisfactory. First, it requires actuarial calculations of life office liabilities. Difficulties of operating a tax system which uses such calculations led to the rejection of an actuarial-based tax system in Chapter 2. Secondly, the present method is only accurate if the proportion of non-taxable/low-taxable liabilities to all liabilities is the same as the proportion of non-taxable/low- taxable income to all income. This seems to be an unrealistic assumption. The reduction in the margin between the tax rate of superannuation funds and other life office business will significantly mitigate any problems in this area. However, the establishment of separate funds for low-taxed superannuation and annuity business would still appear to be justified in the interests of a fairer and simpler tax system. Such a move was suggested in the 1983 Budget but deferred because of the decision announced in the 1984 Budget to undertake a wider review of superannuation and life insurance taxation. 40 3.8 Grouping Provisions The Income Tax Act contains provisions which, to a greater or lesser extent, permit separate companies to be taxed as the one entity. This allows the loss of one company within a group to be set off against the income of another company in the group. A related issue is the provision which restricts the ability of a company to carry forward to future income years losses incurred in prior income years. If a life office is to continue to be taxed only as a proxy for its policyholders, the validity of applying these provisions to life offices needs to be reconsidered. Section 191 of the Income Tax Act allows companies with a sufficient degree of common share ownership to offset losses of one company within the group against the income of another company within the group. This has also applied with respect to life offices. However, under the proxy taxation regime, it is policyholders who are, in effect, being taxed, not shareholders. In those circumstances, application of a grouping provision allows losses incurred by one group of individuals to be offset against income derived by other individuals. This is contrary to the intent of the present legislation. It is therefore proposed that section 191 not apply to life offices so long as the tax base of such entities remains restricted. Section 188 of the Income Tax Act allows a company to carry forward losses to future income years if certain requirements as to continuity of share ownership are maintained. Again, for a life office taxed under a proxy system, share ownership does not seem to be a relevant consideration. It is proposed that life offices be able to carry forward losses derived from the business of life insurance irrespective of any change in share ownership. 41 3.9 Imputation If the proxy system for life offices were to be retained, a life office should be taxed as if it were its individual policyholders. Individual New Zealand resident policyholders would be able to receive imputation credits and utilise them to offset their tax liability on the dividend and/or their other tax liabilties. The same rules should also apply to life offices taxed under the proxy system. 3.10 International Considerations As outlined in the previous chapter, consideration will be given to deeming approved life office funds of non-resident life offices to be New Zealand residents. The offshore activities of New Zealand resident life offices will be considered in the light of decisions made with respect to the international taxation regime. Even if the existing taxation system for life offices were retained, amendments in the law would be necessary to deal with life offices reinsuring life risks offshore. Present law provides an avoidance opportunity. A life office can reinsure its risks offshore. This could be structured so that the offshore reinsurer is not subject to New Zealand tax on the investment income derived from the reinsurance premium. The policy proceeds could then be channelled back to New Zealand tax-free. To close this opportunity, it seems desirable to levy a withholding tax on offshore reinsurance premiums. 42 CHAPTER 4 - ANNUITIES 4.1 Introduction This chapter considers the taxation of annuities. To date most annuities have been provided under superannuation schemes. Changes to the tax treatment of annuities therefore flow from the changes to the taxation of superannuation. However, in other countries, especially North America, a significant volume of annuities are written outside of superannuation arrangements. One possible explanation for the low volume of annuity business in New Zealand is that such contracts are at present, in general, penally taxed. The Government's objective is to move all annuities onto a taxation system which is consistent with the new superannuation taxation regime. That will in turn place them in the same position as other forms of saving. 4.2 Definitions An annuity consists of a series of payments made at regular intervals for a stipulated period of time. The stipulated period may be a specific number of years (an annuity certain) or payments may continue until the happening of some event, most commonly the death of the annuitant or a dependent (a life annuity). Either way, the annuity is usually purchased by the payment of a lump sum, although this payment may be made some time before annuity payments begin (a deferred annuity). The provider of the annuity will invest the lump sum received from the annuitant. Payments to the annuitant will then be a mixture of a portion of the original capital sum and the return earned on the investment of that sum. 43 4.3 Existing Tax Law This section briefly summarises the existing taxation law applying to annuities.- Financial Arrangements An annuity is prima facie a financial arrangement and taxed under the accrual rule provisions in sections 64B to 64M of the Income Tax Act. However, where the annuitant is a natural person, the annuity is an "excepted financial arrangement" and should thus, in general, be outside the ambit of the accrual rules. The following discussion is in terms of annuities which are "excepted financial arrangements". - Contributions These consist of the capital sums or lump sum payments which are used to purchase the income stream which the annuity represents. The purchase of an annuity is not generally deductible from the purchaser's assessable income. It is common for pension superannuation schemes to provide a pension by purchasing an annuity from a life office (a retirement annuity). Since the funds in such a scheme have in the past generally been contributed out of pre-tax income, and earnings have accumulated on a tax-exempt basis, such annuities can be said to be purchased out of pre-tax income. On the other hand, an annuity which is not associated with a pension superannuation scheme (purchased life annuities) may be viewed as being purchased out of after-tax income. - Investment Earnings The capital sum used to purchase the annuity will generally be invested and managed by a life office. Under section 44 204(9) of the Income Tax Act, the assessable net investment income of a life office is adjusted so as to effectively exempt from tax income derived from annuity deposits. - Benefits The benefits under an annuity consist of those payments which are made to the annuitant. By section 65(2)(j) of the Income Tax Act, annuity payments are taxable in the hands of the annuitant. The courts have, however, attempted to distinguish between a taxable annuity, which is the purchase of an annual income stream in return for the surrender of capital, and an annual repayment of capital with or without interest. In the latter case, the capital portion is tax- free and only the interest portion is taxable. This line between a taxable annuity and a capital repayment has proven difficult to draw in practice. In New Zealand, a distinction has been drawn between life annuities and annuities certain. The former have been considered to be taxable in full whereas the latter are treated as the repayment of a capital sum with interest. The capital portion is then exempt and only the interest portion is taxable. There is no statutory basis for this distinction between life annuities and annuities certain and the case law is at best equivocal. 4.4 Proposed Changes to the Law It can be seen from the above that the taxation treatment of annuities can vary considerably under existing law. Contributions may or may not be effectively tax-free, investment earnings on the capital sum from which the annuity is paid may or may not be tax-free, and the annuity benefits may be fully or only partially taxed. Taxing all annuities 45 on the same basis as superannuation will produce a more consistent treatment. As with superannuation schemes, there will be no deduction for annuity contributions. Similarly, there will be no exemption for the investment earnings on capital sums backing annuities. Where such income is presently exempt (such as annuities provided through a life office) annuity contracts in existence on or before 17 December 1987 will receive the same transitional measures as are being provided to previously exempt superannuation funds (including the low 25 per cent tax rate). An annuity fund which is subject to New Zealand tax on the basis of residency will be able to register as a superannuation scheme with the Government Actuary or the Inland Revenue Department. Benefits from such a fund will be taxed in the same manner as superannuation scheme pensions, ie tax-free from 1 April 1989 with the national superannuitant surcharge levied on one half of the annuity from that date. 46 CHAPTER 5 - HEALTH INSURANCE 5.1 Introduction There are a number of inter-relationships between life insurance, superannuation and health insurance which make it appropriate to consider all of these at the same time. For example, accident and sickness insurance premiums have been exempt from tax under the same sections of the Act that have applied to various types of superannuation and life insurance. In addition, some institutions that have been taxed on a concessionary basis may offer life insurance and superannuation as well as health insurance. It is therefore important to ensure that reform of the tax treatment of these types of business, and the institutions offering them, is coordinated. Since friendly societies conduct a large proportion of health insurance business, there will be some overlap between this chapter and the next which considers the tax treatment of friendly societies and credit unions. 5.2 Background While some general insurance companies and industrial and provident societies offer health insurance, this type of cover is primarily provided by friendly societies. The largest insurer is the Southern Cross Medical Care Society. Southern Cross was established in 1961 and has a current membership (including spouses and children) of over 1 million. Approximately 60% of Southern Cross members are covered under commercial group schemes while another 20% belong to non- commercial group schemes and the remaining 20% have individual cover. In 1986, member contributions to Southern Cross 47 totalled $62 million. Based on Southern Cross's revenue and estimated market share, total expenditure on health insurance in 1986 is estimated to have been around $75 million. Other organisations offering medical insurance include New Zealand Medicare Society, Aetna Health Society Ltd, Medic Aid Fund Society, Healthcare Fund of the Druids Friendly Society, and Union Medical Benefits Society Ltd. Health insurance offers partial (typically 80-90%) or full cover for private hospital and practitioner expenses in return for an annual premium. Benefits may also be provided in the form of income support payments, funeral benefits or through the waiving of premiums. In addition to the major insurers, many other friendly societies provide health insurance on a smaller scale. 5.3 The Present Tax Treatment a Premiums/Contributions Paid by the Individual Under section 59 of the Income Tax Act, taxpayers have been able to claim an exemption for premiums or contributions to funds providing benefits in the event of sickness, accident or death. Payments that have been claimable under the exemption include: - premiums on personal accident or sickness insurance; - payments to any insurance fund of a friendly society of which the taxpayer was a member on or before 8 November 1984; - payments to any insurance fund of a friendly society that provides benefits solely in respect of accident, disease, sickness or expenses consequent on death; - payments to any fund which provides benefits solely in respect of accident, disease, sickness or expenses 48 consequent on death and which is approved by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. The section 59 exemption, which also covered various life insurance premiums and superannuation contributions, provided a maximum annual deduction of $1,200 for those contributing to subsidised superannuation schemes and $1,400 for other taxpayers. b Premiums/Contributions Paid by the Employer An exemption from Fringe Benefit Tax (FBT) has been provided under section 336N where an employer paid premiums or made contributions on behalf of employees to funds providing benefits in the event of sickness, accident or death. Qualifying payments have been the same as those listed in (a) above for individuals (except that payments to an insurance fund of a friendly society have been exempt FBT irrespective of when the employee joined the society). c Treatment of Fund Income Income earned by the trustees of any sickness, accident or death benefit fund approved by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has been exempt from tax under section 61(41) of the Act. Further, income earned by a friendly society on business conducted within its circle of membership is exempt under section 61(23). d Treatment of Benefits Section 61(39) of the Income Tax Act exempts income derived, in respect of any incapacity for work, from a friendly society or from a sick, accident or death benefit fund to which the person was a contributor at the start of the period of incapacity. Similar benefits paid under a policy of 49 sickness or accident insurance are exempt by virtue of section 61(40), unless the payments are calculated according to loss of profits or earnings. 5.4 Who Benefits from the Concessions? Information compiled by the Health Benefits Review Committee showed that somewhere between 1.1 and 1.3 million New Zealanders held private medical insurance in 1986. A social indicators survey held in 1980/81 by the Department of Statistics provided information on the pattern of use of private medical insurance. This information provides a good indication of which groups have been gaining most benefit from the tax concessions. The survey showed that around 35% of the population aged 15 or over held full private medical insurance. However, coverage was found to vary markedly depending on factors such as age and income. Coverage was found to be most common amongst the 36-50 age group - 47% of this group held medical insurance. Despite the fact that the elderly are proportionately the heaviest users of health services, the survey found that only 13% of those in the 65+ age group were insured. Coverage for those employed in the paid labour force was estimated at 42% compared with only 24% for the rest of the adult population. The survey results also showed that coverage was below average amongst individuals experiencing recent or chronic ill-health. The distribution of private medical insurance by household income was also uneven. The survey found that coverage amongst those in the higher household income brackets (41% of adults) was 47%, while only 27% of those in the lower 50 household income brackets held private medical insurance. However, the associated distribution of tax concessions for health insurance will be more heavily weighted toward higher income households than these statistics suggest. This is because tax concessions given in the form of exemptions of income (or deductions from assessable income) are of greater value to those on higher marginal rates of tax. These results suggest that, in general, the major beneficiaries of the tax concessions have been those who are less likely to need medical insurance and those who are best able to pay for it themselves. 5.5 The Role of Health Insurance and the Effect of the Concessions Tax concessions for health insurance lower the cost of such insurance to the individual and thereby encourage its purchase. Thus, both the extent of coverage and levels of cover will be greater than otherwise. The cost of this increased cover is reflected in tax concessions for those covered and this cost must be met by taxpayers generally. In considering the arguments for these concessions, the question is not whether private health insurance is desirable, but whether its subsidisation at the expense of other taxpayers can be justified. Are Tax Concessions for Health Insurance Justified? One argument commonly advanced in favour of tax preferences for health insurance is that, by encouraging use of the private health sector, the demand for public services and thus public expenditure on health are reduced. 51 However, health insurance covers a variety of services and the use of these will not always reduce public expenditure. For example, where a visit to a doctor is covered by private health insurance, there is no reduction in the Government's contribution to the doctor's charge (ie the General Medical Services or GMS benefit). Other services covered by private insurance may not be available in the public sector. In these cases, the use of private hospitals is additional to, rather than a substitute for, the use of public health services and, therefore, there will not be any reduction in public expenditure. Furthermore, from the perspective of national welfare, it is the total level of resources devoted to health services and the effective use of those resources that are relevant. The fact that some health care costs are borne privately does not necessarily reduce the total cost of providing a given level of care. Alternatively, it may be argued that the reduction in demand for public services improves the quality of care that can be provided to those remaining in the public system. The problem with this argument is that increases in demand for private care mean that resources, especially health care personnel, are attracted away from the public sector. Thus, at least in the short term, greater use of the private health sector is not likely to reduce pressures on public services. A third argument is that use of the private health sector should be encouraged because it is considered more efficient than the public sector. However, if the private sector is indeed more efficient, this does not imply that tax concessions for private health insurance are in order. A more appropriate response would be for Government to purchase services from the private sector directly, by contracting for the provision of services to the public for example. 52 Effect on the Allocation of Resources Compared with a system where medical costs are met in full by the individual, the use of private medical insurance is likely to lead to inefficiency in the use of resources. The problem arises from the sharing of the costs of services covered by insurance between different funders. First, the individual will probably be required to meet part of the direct charge for services used, though this proportion may be quite small. Secondly, a large part of the cost of services covered by insurance will be met by the insurer. Thirdly, the Government may meet a proportion of the direct costs of insured services in the form of health benefits. When costs are shared by these three different parties, no one funder has a strong incentive to control expenditure on the services being supplied. As a result, insured individuals may use services beyond the point where the cost equals the benefit at the margin, and the level of resources allocated to the private health sector will be excessive. Effect on Access to Health Services In terms of its effect on access to health services, the 1986 Health Benefits Review Committee suggested that the growth in private health insurance has tended to increase existing inequities. Certainly health insurance improves access to a range of health services for those covered. However, as noted above, health insurance is more common amongst those less likely to need care and those less likely to experience financial difficulty in gaining access to care. It may also lead to over-use of services by this group at the expense of those who are not covered. 53 Effect of the Tax Concessions By reducing the cost of insurance to the individual, the tax concessions encourage individuals to purchase more cover than they would otherwise. This may take the form of cover for a higher proportion of costs, or cover for a wider range of services. In either case, the incentive for the individual to minimise the costs of services used will be further reduced. Inefficient use of services covered by private insurance may of course lead to higher premiums being charged and the insurer may run the risk of losing business. However, since extra premium costs are, to some extent, shared with the Government, individuals will be less sensitive than otherwise to such increases and insurers will be able to pass on extra costs more readily. Further, by encouraging private insurance, the present tax exemptions tend to exacerbate inequities between those better and less well off financially and between those with good rather than poor health. 5.6 Reform of the Tax Treatment of Health Insurance In light of the equity and efficiency arguments discussed above, the Government has decided to remove existing tax concessions for health insurance (broadly defined). Details of the measures being taken to give effect to this decision are set out below. Further measures, relating to the tax treatment of friendly societies involved in the provision of health insurance, are discussed in the next chapter. 54 a Premiums/Contributions Paid by the Individual As announced in the Government Economic Statement of 17 December 1987, the section 59 personal exemption has been removed for all payments made on or after that date. This deduction was withdrawn on the passage of the Taxation Reform Act (No 3) 1988. Thus, payments on personal accident or sickness insurance and payments into sickness, accident and death benefit funds made on or after 17 December 1987 will not now qualify for a tax exemption. b Premiums/Contributions Paid by the Employer The Fringe Benefit Tax (FBT) exemption provided under section 336N has also been removed in respect of employer-paid premiums/contributions paid on or after 17 December 1987. The rate of FBT on previously-exempt payments to approved sick, accident and death benefit funds existing on 17 December 1987 is to be 24% non-deductible. This rate is concessional and has been adopted as a transitional measure in recognition of the fact that income earned by such funds has been exempt. The reduced FBT rate will apply to amounts paid in the remainder of 1987/88 and during 1988/89. From 1 April 1989, the rate will be increased to the standard FBT rate. Other payments that were previously exempt will be subject to FBT at the rate of 35% from 17 December 1987. This includes payments to approved sick, accident or death benefit funds, insurance funds of friendly societies, and payments in respect of policies of sickness or accident insurance that do not qualify for the reduced rate of 24%. FBT on premiums and contributions paid between 17 December 1987 and 31 March 1988 will not be due until 20 July 1988. 55 c Taxation of Fund Income The section 61(41) exemption for the income of trustees of sickness, accident and death benefit funds will be phased out from 1 April 1988. To allow time for these funds to adjust premium levels, the income of approved funds existing on 17 December 1987 will be subject to tax at the concessional rate of 25% from 1 April 1988. As a further transitional measure, these funds will not be required to pay provisional tax in 1988/89. Tax for the 1988/89 year will be payable in two instalments: 50% due on the normal date for terminal tax for the 1988/89 year and 50% on the terminal tax date for 1989/90. Funds established on or after 17 December 1987 will be taxed at the rate of 33% from 1 April 1988. Since the top personal rate of tax will be 40.5 percent in 1988/89, the 33 percent rate will be concessionary in that year for many fund members. The tax base for all approved sickness, accident and death benefit funds will be investment income net of investment expenses, including net income from realised investments (eg profits from the sale of shares or property). This treatment will be reviewed for 1989/90 once the tax regime for friendly societies has been determined. d Treatment of Benefits All proceeds of policies of sickness or accident insurance and benefits paid from sick, accident or death benefit funds will be tax-free from 1 April 1989. 56 CHAPTER 6 - FRIENDLY SOCIETIES AND CREDIT UNIONS 6.1 Introduction Friendly societies and credit unions are closely related in three respects. First, both are classified as "friendly societies" under the Income Tax Act and are therefore subject to the same tax treatment. Secondly, both types of organisation are registered under the Friendly Societies and Credit Unions (FSCU) Act and are subject to very similar regulatory controls. Finally, membership of a friendly society sometimes constitutes the common bond required for membership of a credit union and, until 1982 when the FSCU Act made statutory provision for credit unions, some of these funds were held within friendly societies. Volume 1 of this document focussed on achieving a consistent tax treatment for alternative forms of saving - in particular, savings by way of life insurance and superannuation. Since friendly societies may offer life insurance and pension plans, it is important to consider their tax treatment as part of this reform exercise. In view of the close links between credit unions and friendly societies and the fact that credit unions offer an alternative means of saving, it is also appropriate to include credit unions within the present review. It is important to note that this review of the tax treatment of friendly societies and credit unions is closely associated with the concurrent review of the regulatory environment within which these organisations operate. The relationship between the two reform exercises is discussed in section 6.5 below. 57 6.2 Objectives and Scope of Tax Reform Tax reform undertaken in recent years has been aimed at achieving a consistent treatment across sectors of the economy and between different organisational forms used for conducting business. In this way, the potential for the tax system to distort business decisions and the allocation of resources within the economy can be minimised. Volume 1 of this document concluded that savings conducted through life insurance and superannuation should be subject to a normal income tax regime equivalent to that applying to savings made through bank deposits. For similar reasons, savings conducted through a friendly society, or through a credit union, should be taxed on the same non-concessionary basis. The preceding chapter discussed the equity and efficiency arguments for removing tax concessions for health insurance, and detailed measures to move health insurance onto a non- concessionary regime. Since friendly societies are the major providers of such insurance, their tax treatment needs to be reviewed in this context. The objective of tax reform of friendly societies and credit unions is therefore to tax them, as far as possible, on a non-concessionary basis and, in particular, to achieve neutrality of tax treatment between these organisations and their competitors. To this end, the Government announced in its statement of 17 December 1987 that the section 61(23) exemption for income derived by a friendly society within its circle of membership would be removed from the beginning of the 1990 income year. The present section 61(23) exemption applies to all societies registered or incorporated in New Zealand under any Act 58 relating to friendly societies, credit unions, industrial unions, industrial associations, or trade unions. The Government intends to review the tax treatment of all these organisations. Registered friendly societies and credit unions will have their present tax exemption removed and be subject to a new regime from 1 April 1989. In view of their similar nature, benevolent societies and specially authorised societies registered under Part II of the FSCU Act will be treated in the same way as friendly societies and be taxed from 1 April 1989. This chapter discusses how these organisations should be taxed from 1 April 1989. Issues relating to the tax treatment of life insurance and superannuation were addressed in Volume 1 and in earlier chapters of this volume. Those discussions also apply to friendly societies in respect of their life insurance and superannuation business. However, the taxation of friendly societies and credit unions is complicated by the mutual nature of these organisations. This chapter discusses the problems arising from the organisational form of friendly societies and credit unions and presents taxation options designed to alleviate these concerns. Once satisfactory tax regimes have been developed for these organisations, consideration will be given to extending these treatments to other bodies covered by the present section 61(23) exemption. Thus, all organisations covered by section 61(23) of the Income Tax Act are invited to consider the tax options outlined in this chapter and make submissions on the applicability of these options to their own activities. 59 6.3 Friendly Societies; Nature and Activities Friendly societies are mutual societies funded by voluntary subscriptions of members to provide benefits to members or relatives of members during sickness or in other distressed circumstances, as well as to meet surgical and medical expenses and provide insurance cover. They include traditional orders, medical care societies and friendly society dispensaries. Societies established for charitable or for recreational purposes may also be registered under the friendly societies' legislation. The traditional orders have operated in New Zealand since the mid-nineteenth century and were effectively the forerunners of the modern welfare state. Since the introduction of social security in the 1930s, the membership of traditional orders has declined though the funds of societies have continued to grow. The largest of these orders is the Manchester Unity Friendly Society with a current membership of 23,000 and funds totalling $60 million. The Society also operates a credit union with accumulated funds of approximately $22 million. Manchester Unity offers services to members including life insurance, pensions, mercantile insurance, medical insurance and mortgage finance. While the membership of traditional orders has declined, that of modern medical care friendly societies has increased rapidly in recent years. As noted in Chapter 5, the largest of these is the Southern Cross Medical Care Society with a membership (including children and spouses) of around 1 million and member contributions of $62 million in 1986. United Friendly Society (UFS) Dispensaries are pharmacies owned by groups of friendly societies whose members receive discounted goods and services. Because their registration as friendly societies was found to be inappropriate (and illegal 60 under the FSCU Act), the Government announced in 1986 that an amendment to the Pharmacy Act would be prepared to enable UFS dispensaries to register under that Act. Certain restrictions on trading are to be removed at the same time. As at 31 December 1987, there were 591 separate registrations of friendly societies although this includes separate registrations for the districts and lodges of the traditional orders. In addition, there were two registered benevolent societies (providing benefits similar to friendly societies), 26 working men's clubs and two specially authorised societies (providing fidelity insurance for officers of friendly societies). These are the various types of registration available under Part II of the FSCU Act 1982. Membership and funds of these organisations in 1986 were as follows: Table 6.1 Membership and Funds of Organisations Registered Under Friendly Societies' Legislation, 1986 61 Members Funds ($m) Friendly societies -Medical care 1,034,00076.1 -Other 60,00099.3 Benevolent societies 6000.2 Working men's clubs Specially authorised 40,000 21.3 societies 700 0.5 Total 1,135,300197.4 6.4 Credit Unions: Nature and Activities Credit unions are co-operative bodies which use and control members' savings for their mutual benefit. The members of a credit union must share some common bond such as a common occupation or employer, residence in a particular locality, or membership of a particular organisation (eg a friendly society). There were 268 registered credit unions at the end of 1987. Total assets at their respective balance dates in 1986 amounted to nearly $118 million, with a total membership of 142,000. The New Zealand Credit Union League, formed in 1961, had 203 affiliated credit unions with a combined membership of 106,000 and total savings of $88 million in 1987. 6.5 Regulatory Environment The activities of these organisations are governed by the FSCU Act 1982. This Act imposes constraints on the activities that can be undertaken, limits the amounts that can be insured or saved, and sets out rules governing the investment of funds. It also makes demands on the officers of societies with respect to providing security and specifies various information requirements. The Act is currently under review as part of the Government's programme of regulatory reform of the financial sector. The main objective of this reform programme has been to ensure competitive neutrality between financial institutions. In the case of friendly societies and credit unions, the desirable direction of reform is to relax restrictions so that friendly societies and credit unions have greater freedom with respect to services offered and are not subject 62 to unnecessary financial controls. However, the extent to which existing regulations can be relaxed hinges, to a large extent, on the development a satisfactory basis of taxation for these bodies. Clearly, the objective of competitive neutrality cannot be met unless both the tax treatment and the regulatory regime applying to these bodies is aligned with that applying to other institutions offering similar services. 6.6 Present Tax Treatment of Friendly Societies and Credit Unions Under section 59 of the Income Tax Act, payments by a taxpayer to any insurance fund of a friendly society have qualified for a personal exemption (up to specified limits) where the taxpayer was a member on or before 8 November 1984. Payments to insurance funds of friendly societies that provide benefits solely in respect of accident, disease, sickness or expenses consequent on death, have qualified for a personal exemption irrespective of the date of joining the society. In addition, employer contributions to insurance funds of friendly societies have been exempt from Fringe Benefit Tax. These exemptions have now been removed in respect of payments made on or after 17 December 1987. Under section 61(23) of the Income Tax Act, the income of friendly societies and credit unions is exempt from income tax except for income derived from business carried on beyond its circle of membership. In practice, investment income derived from non-members has not generally been regarded as "income from business" and has therefore not been subject to tax. Where such income has been judged to be business income, it has been taxable unless covered by the section 61(41) exemption for the income of a sick, accident or death 63 benefit fund approved by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Trading profits of UFS Dispensaries have been taxable to the extent that trade has been with the public, ie non-members. On amendment of the Pharmacy Act, UFS Dispensaries will (on registration under that Act) be liable to tax as for any pharmacy. As noted above, the tax treatment applying to friendly societies and credit unions also applies to societies registered or incorporated in New Zealand under any Act relating to industrial unions, industrial associations, or trade unions. Judged according to normal income tax principles, this treatment is concessionary in three respects. The first concessionary element is the exclusion from the tax base of all income generated by business conducted with members. The second concession is the exclusion of most investment income derived from non-members, and the third is the exemption relating to income received by sick, accident and death benefit funds. The Government Economic Statement of 17 December 1987 announced that the section 61(41) exemption for the income of approved sick, accident and death benefit funds would be removed from 1 April 1988. In addition, the section 61(23) exemption will be removed from 1 April 1989 for registered friendly societies, benevolent societies, specially authorised societies, and credit unions. Issues relating to the taxation of friendly societies and credit unions are discussed in the following sections. 64 6.7 The Mutual Nature of Friendly Societies and Credit Unions The mutual or co-operative nature of friendly societies and credit unions means that the development of a satisfactory tax regime is not straightforward. Friendly societies are not formed as companies. Thus, they do not have shareholders per se nor do they distribute profits by way of dividends. However, under the co-operative basis of such societies, all members can be regarded as shareholders who receive "profits" in the form of increased benefits or reduced charges. While the members of credit unions are called "shareholders", their "shareholdings" reflect the extent to which they are using the services of the credit union, as well as their share in the ownership of the business. The dividends they may receive are, to a large extent, simply interest on savings deposited with the credit union. A portion of such dividends may constitute a return on equity investment in the union. However, businesses organised on a mutual basis can distribute profits in a number of ways. For friendly societies and credit unions, these include providing increased insurance cover, reduced premiums, increased interest on savings deposits, or reduced interest charges on loans. A difficulty arises in taxing businesses operated in this way because it is not possible to differentiate between the customers and the owners of the business. Ordinarily, companies aim to maximise profits for the benefit of their owners or shareholders. However, the incentive to maximise profit, as normally defined, is lacking for co-operatives. This is because while increasing revenue and/or reducing expenditure will increase "profits", it will not necessarily benefit members (or shareholders). For example, increases in premiums (for a given level of cover) do not increase the 65 wealth of members. Yet increases in investment earnings, through improved investment management for example, will add to members' wealth. Thus, if tax were to be levied on profit as normally defined, the incentive would be for co-operatives to minimise this by distributing profits in kind. As a result, the income taxed would be only a fraction of the amount that would be taxed if the business was organised in a non-mutual form. It may be argued that, because of their non-profit nature, it is quite proper for these organisations to pay little or no tax. Such arguments rely on the "mutuality principle" which asserts that a person cannot make a profit from trading with him or herself and is sometimes argued to extend to groups of individuals trading within the group. The counter argument to the "mutuality principle" is that the form of organisation of a business activity does not affect its basic income-generating nature. Like other businesses, co-operatives produce goods and services using capital provided by shareholders (members) and thereby generate income which is properly subject to income tax. The problem inherent in applying the mutuality principle can be seen by supposing that a public company instituted a policy of trading only with its shareholders. Clearly, this would not detract from the income-generating nature of the business activity undertaken, nor should it result in the elimination of the company's tax base. While co-operatives should generally be subject to tax, the practicality of taxing the income of any particular co- operative depends, to some extent, on the size of the business undertaking. Exempting from taxation a small neighbourhood co-operative (formed to purchase groceries, for example), may be justified where the activities are on a scale and level of sophistication such that the income of 66 competing businesses is not markedly affected, and where the administrative and compliance costs of levying tax would be prohibitive. However, it will not be appropriate to exclude larger organisations where the competitive advantage derived from a concessionary tax treatment may have a more significant impact on the form or purpose for which economic resources are used. Thus the argument for exempting some co- operatives from tax is a pragmatic one - that the administrative and compliance costs of enforcement outweigh the distortion to investment activity - rather than one of principle. 6.8 Present Tax Treatment of Mutual Associations Mutual associations which are currently taxable are subject to a special tax regime set out in section 199 of the Income Tax Act. This regime effectively apportions income and expenditure between business conducted with members and business conducted outside the circle of membership. Undistributed profits derived from business with members, and profits derived outside the circle of membership, are subject to tax in the hands of the co-operative. This includes any investment income derived from non-members. Profits distributed in respect of member transactions (called rebates) are not assessable to the co-operative. Rebates are assessable in the hands of the members only insofar as the rebates relate to members' business activities. Rebates in respect of private or non-business transactions with members are presently excluded from the tax base. A change to this regime is proposed in the Consultative Document on Full Imputation released on 17 December 1987. The proposed change would bring rebates in respect of non- business transactions with members into the taxable income of the co-operative. 67 The tax treatment of mutual associations is analysed further below. a Transactions Related to the Business Activities of Members In the case of transactions conducted by business co- operatives (eg a co-operative established to buy trading stock for sale to members of a profession or trade), the present tax system does not distort commercial decisions, nor does it allow the tax base to be eroded. This is because reductions in the assessable income of the co-operative, resulting from, say, charging less for items sold to members, are reflected in increased assessable incomes for members. Thus, under the present tax system for co-operatives, the activities of the co-operative are regarded as an extension of the business activities of members. Profits earned by the co-operative are reflected in members' assessable incomes, either as rebates or as reduced expenditure on inputs purchased from the co-operative. Accordingly, there is no tax incentive for co-operatives to reduce prices charged to members in respect of the members' business activities. The new regime proposed under the company/shareholder imputation system would also leave commercial decisions in respect of these transactions largely unaffected by tax considerations. The tax base would therefore continue to be protected. b Other Transactions with Members The situation is somewhat different when the transactions are not related to the business activities of members. This is because, under the present tax system for co-operatives, distributed profits in respect of non-business transactions with members are not assessable to either members or the co- 68 operative. Under the proposed new regime non-business rebates will be assessable to the co-operative. However, the co-operative will still have some ability to effectively distribute these profits tax-free by reducing prices charged to members. 6.9 Application to Friendly Societies and Credit Unions The co-operative nature of friendly societies and credit unions means that, in the absence of the section 61(23) exemption, and assuming no other special provisions are introduced, they would be taxed under section 199 for co- operatives. Changes to that regime made as part of the company/shareholder imputation system would also apply. As noted above, under the proposed changes all rebates would become taxable irrespective of their source. However, the ability for co-operatives to reduce taxable profits on non- business transactions (by reducing prices of services provided) and thereby erode the tax base would remain. The regime would therefore still be concessionary. Clearly this problem arises for all co-operatives undertaking non-business transactions with members. However, until now, the scale of activities conducted under this concessionary regime has been relatively small. The possible inclusion of friendly societies and credit unions under this regime means that this problem could become much more significant. This is especially so in light of the proposals to relax existing controls on the activities of these organisations. The relaxation of these controls would allow friendly societies and credit unions to operate on a larger scale and undertake a greater variety of activities in competition with other non-mutual organisations. This raises concerns about the competitive advantage conferred by a concessionary tax 69 regime, and the erosion of the tax base. Accordingly, it is necessary to consider alternative means of taxing friendly societies and credit unions. The tax regime for friendly societies and credit unions will be developed in conjunction with the Consultative Committee on Full Imputation which is considering the tax treatment of co-operatives in general. Some options are considered in the following sections. 6.10 Tax Treatment of Friendly Societies - The Life Insurance and Superannuation Business of Friendly Societies In respect of their life insurance and pension business, friendly societies should be subject to the regime detailed in Volume 1 of this document. Included under this heading will be policies for the "endowment of members or nominees of members at any age or on marriage" provided for in the First Schedule to the FSCU Act 1982. The tax treatment for these types of business will therefore be as follows: a contributions/premia paid by the member on or after 17 December 1987 will be paid from after-tax income and not qualify for a personal tax deduction; b contributions/premia paid by the member's employer on or after 17 December 1987 will be subject to Fringe Benefit Tax at the non-deductible rate of 35 percent; c fund earnings will be taxable in the hands of the friendly society from 1 April 1989 (when the section 61(23) exemption is removed); and 70 d emerging benefits will be tax-free. The assessable fund earnings will include profits/losses from the realisation of investments, and expenditure incurred in earning assessable income will be deductible. If the present taxation regime for life offices is subsequently changed along the lines suggested in Chapter 2, the new regime could also apply to the life insurance business conducted by friendly societies. However, the applicability of the Chapter 2 regime to friendly societies would depend on the tax regime adopted for the other activities of these organisations, as discussed below. - Other Business Conducted by Friendly Societies The provision of sickness and accident insurance is similar to the business of a fire and general insurer. Under the present system, fire and general insurance is taxed under standard income tax rules. The basis of taxation is profit, defined as income earned less expenditure incurred in the process of earning that income. In the case of insurance business this means that: - premiums are assessable; - income earned from the investment of premiums is assessable; - claims are deductible; - expenditure incurred in gaining premiums is deductible; - expenditure incurred in gaining investment income is deductible. Profits of insurance companies (other than life insurance companies) will be taxed at the company rate under the new imputation system for companies. Tax will be levied at the company rate of 28% and then imputed to shareholders so that 71 profits can be effectively taxed at the shareholders' marginal tax rates. As far as possible, friendly societies should be taxed on their non-life insurance business in the same way as other general insurers. As part of their investment activities, friendly societies may provide mortgage finance for members, or lend money to a credit union for which membership of the friendly society is the common bond. In respect of this business, it will be important to ensure that the tax treatment of friendly societies is compatible with that for credit unions. Options for taxing the insurance and investment activities of friendly societies are discussed below. Option 1 - Tax as Non-Mutuals This approach would apply the same regime to friendly societies as applies to fire and general insurers. Because of the non-business character of the transactions involved, this treatment would have two drawbacks. First, the tax system would create an incentive for friendly societies to set premiums/contributions and interest rates on loans to members in a way that minimised taxable profit. Thus, commercial decisions would be distorted by the tax system. Secondly, because of the ability to minimise tax in this way, such organisations would have a competitive advantage over other non-mutual organisations. For these reasons, it would seem desirable to maintain at least some of the existing regulatory controls on friendly societies if this option were adopted. 72 Option 2 - Market-Related Income Tax Treatment This option is motivated by the assumption that, under the regime applying to non-mutuals, friendly societies would return profits in the form of reduced premiums for given levels of benefits or by charging reduced rates of interest on loans to members, thereby escaping tax. The option would involve applying an objective benchmark market price for services offered against which the effective discount being offered by the friendly society would be calculated. The discount would then be added to the assessable income of the friendly society. With this exception, assessable income would be as under the treatment for non-mutuals outlined above. Naturally, this treatment would not preclude friendly societies from offering reduced premiums or charging low rates of interest to members. It would, however, prevent them gaining a tax advantage from doing so. Alternatively, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue could have the discretion to deem any discount on premiums to be a dividend. This could be done along the lines of section 4(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act. The difficulty with option 2 is that, given the dominance of friendly societies in the health insurance business for example, the information available to assess a "market price" for services offered is likely to be thin. Further, prices charged by non-mutual companies will vary, making it difficult to determine an objective benchmark. However, if it were possible to overcome these difficulties, the resulting regime would be non-concessionary and thus allow for the relaxation of regulatory controls. 73 Option 3 - Taxation of Net Investment Income Another approach is to tax friendly societies on investment income net of investment expenses. Thus friendly societies would be treated as investment or savings vehicles in the same way as life insurance and superannuation funds are currently treated. This approach capitalises on the incentive for friendly societies to maximise returns from the investment of surpluses. However, to the extent that friendly societies are able to lend surpluses to members, or associated credit unions, this incentive will be undermined. To counter this, friendly societies could be required to invest a certain proportion of surplus funds with non- members. Alternatively, consideration could be given to including the discount on interest charged to members in the assessable income of the friendly society (as under the market-related option). Provided one of these measures was included, this option would have the advantage that the tax base would be less open to manipulation than under the non-mutual tax treatment (option 1). Thus the distortion of commercial decisions and the competitive advantage obtained from tax minimisation would be less. On the other hand, because this tax treatment would still be concessionary, misallocation of resources would still result. As for option 1, it would seem desirable to maintain at least some of the existing regulatory controls on friendly societies if this option were adopted and, as noted above, it may be necessary to introduce additional controls on investment activities with members. 74 6.11 Tax Treatment of Credit Unions The business activities of credit unions are essentially the same as those of banks. Banks are taxed on their profit as follows: - interest derived from borrowers is assessable; - income from other sources (eg bank fees and other investment income) is assessable; - interest costs incurred are deductible; - expenditure incurred in gaining deposits and making loans and other investments is deductible; - expenditure incurred in gaining other investment income is deductible. Deposits made by an individual are paid out of after-tax income, interest received by depositors is assessable income and withdrawals are tax-free. Interest paid to a bank by a borrower will generally only be deductible to the borrower if the loan is of a business nature. As far as possible, credit unions should be taxed on the same basis as banks. Options for taxing credit unions are discussed below. Option 1 - Tax as Non-Mutuals There are three problems with applying the tax treatment for non-mutual businesses to credit unions. The first two are the same as those for friendly societies under the non-mutual tax option discussed above. First, this treatment would create an incentive for credit unions to minimise taxable profit by charging reduced rates of interest to borrowers. Thus commercial decisions may be distorted and minimal tax would be collected at the expense of other taxpayers. Secondly, because of the ability to minimise taxable profit 75 without disadvantaging members, credit unions would have a competitive advantage over other institutions such as banks. The third problem is that, when credit unions charge and pay interest at below market rates, amounts of interest received by and assessable to members are lower than otherwise. Thus the tax base is further eroded, again at the expense of other taxpayers. It should be noted that the latter argument applies only where interest paid by members is non-deductible, as will often be the case for loans from credit unions. For these reasons, it would seem desirable to maintain some controls on the amount of business that can be conducted by credit unions if this option were adopted. Option 2 - Market-Related Income Tax Treatment The foregoing discussion suggests that the tax base for credit unions needs to differ from that applying to banks. The following possible tax base for credit unions is designed to solve the problems inherent in taxing credit unions as non-mutuals. The derivation is provided in Appendix 6.1. Under the market-related option: - interest charged to members would be assessable to the credit union; - discount on interest charged to members (based on market rates of interest) that is non-deductible to members would be assessable to the credit union; - interest paid by the credit union would be deductible to it; - net income from other investments/borrowings would be assessable; - all expenses would be deductible. Under this approach, if credit unions endeavoured to distribute 76 "profits" by way of reduced interest charges, then these would reduce the deduction that can be claimed by members if the interest is deductible, or increase the discount which would be assessable to the union. There would therefore be no tax advantage in charging lower than market interest rates. Since increased interest payments to members would be assessable to them, a credit union's interest rate policies should not be influenced by the tax system. An alternative would be to include the discount on all interest charged by the credit union in its assessable income and use an imputation system to avoid any double taxation. Under this approach, tax paid on the discount would be imputed to members and be deductible to them only where the associated interest payments are deductible. Imputed tax on discounts in respect of non-deductible interest payments would simply be disregarded by members. This would avoid the need for credit unions to differentiate between interest that is deductible and non-deductible to members. Under a further alternative, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue could have the discretion to deem any discount on non-deductible interest charged to be a dividend. This could be done along the lines of section 4(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act. The difficulty with a market-related approach is the need to determine market interest rates against which to measure the discount provided to borrowers. Such an approach would, however, result in a non-concessionary regime and therefore facilitate the relaxation of controls on credit unions. Option 3 - Taxation of Net Income Earned from Non-Members Another approach is to tax credit unions on net income earned from third parties. This would amount to maintaining the 77 present tax treatment for these organisations. To the extent that this income is passed on to members as taxable interest, some double taxation would result. However, credit unions could avoid this by passing this income on to members in the form of reduced (non-deductible) interest charges. Alternatively, a limited form of imputation system could be adopted. As for friendly societies, life insurance and superannuation, this approach capitalises on the incentive for credit unions to maximise returns from the investment of surpluses. As a result, the credit union's tax base would be less open to manipulation than under the non-mutual tax option. However, credit unions would still have a tax incentive to charge and pay lower than market rates of interest. Thus the problems inherent in option 1 will also arise under this option. Since credit unions compete with financial institutions taxed on a non-concessionary basis, the tax advantage would continue to attract business to credit unions at the expense of banks. As for option 1, it would seem desirable to maintain at least some of the existing regulatory controls on credit unions if this option were adopted. 6.12 Conclusion As noted in 6.2 above, the section 61(23) exemption for income derived within the circle of membership of registered friendly societies, benevolent societies, specially authorised societies and credit unions will be removed from 1 April 1989. In line with other tax and regulatory reform exercises undertaken in recent years, the Government's preferred outcome is a non-concessionary tax regime coupled with the relaxation of regulatory controls. However, achieving this outcome for friendly societies and credit 78 unions is not straightforward and no decisions have yet been taken by the Government as to the tax regime that will apply to these organisations from 1 April 1989. The regime to apply from that date will be developed during the consultative process with the benefit of submissions received from interested parties. As well as the options outlined above, consideration will be given to other options suggested in submissions. However, in making such suggestions, friendly societies, credit unions and other organisations covered by the present section 61(23) exemption, should bear in mind that the development of a non- concessionary tax regime is both the Government's objective and a prerequisite to the relaxation of existing regulatory controls. 79 APPENDIX A6.1 DERIVATION OF MARKET-RELATED TAX BASE FOR CREDIT UNIONS The market-related tax base is derived by first considering how a credit union would be taxed if it operated on the same basis as a trading bank, ie charging and paying market interest rates with the aim of earning profits for shareholders. In this case, the standard income tax base would be as follows: Let IC\_M\_D = interest charged by credit union at market rates and deductible to borrowers IC\_M\_ND = interest charged by credit union at market rates and not deductible to borrowers IP\_M = interest paid by credit union at market rates (assessable to lenders) OI = net income from other investments/borrowings received by the credit union E = expenses incurred by the credit union. Then the credit union's taxable profit would be: Credit Union Profit = IC\_M\_D + IC\_M\_ND + OI - IP\_M - E and borrowers/lenders would be taxed on: Members' assessable income = IP\_M - IC\_M\_D In total (disregarding the effect of differences in tax rates), the tax base would be: Total Tax Base = IC\_M\_ND + OI - E 80 81 This can now be compared with the position for a credit union operating on a mutual basis and setting interest rates at levels that differ from market rates. Let IC\_D = actual interest charged by credit union and deductible to borrowing members IC\_ND = actual interest charged by credit union and not deductible to borrowing members IP = actual interest paid to members (assessable to lending members) In this case, the credit union's taxable profit would be: Credit Union Profit = IC\_D + IC\_ND + OI - IP - E and borrowers/lenders would be taxed on: Members' assessable income = IP - IC\_D In total (disregarding the effect of differences in tax rates), the tax base would be: Total Tax Base = IC\_ND + OI - E The difference between this tax base and that derived above for a credit union charging market interest rates is given by: Difference between market-related and = IC\_M\_ND - IC\_ND mutual tax base This is the discount (compared with market interest rates) on interest charged by the credit union that is not deductible 82 to members. The discount is a benefit which results from membership of the credit union and should be taxed as profit in the hands of the credit union. The discount is therefore added to the tax base of the credit union to achieve the non- concessionary tax base as set out in 6.11 above. Using the variables defined in this appendix, the market-related tax base for credit unions is given by: Profit = (IC\_D + IC\_ND) + (IC\_M\_ND - IC\_ND) - IP + OI - E CHAPTER 7 - MUTUAL LIFE OFFICES 7.1 Introduction In Chapter 2 it is implicitly assumed that the life office is a proprietary company, ie a company owned by shareholders who are separate from policyholders. Many life offices are mutual companies which are, in effect, owned by the policyholders. An objective of the life insurance taxation reforms is to tax mutual and proprietary companies, as far as possible, in the same way. However, under the regime suggested in Chapter 2, a mutual company might effectively distribute income to its policyholders/shareholders by reducing premiums instead of paying dividends. In this way, the profits that would normally be taxable in the hands of the life office, could be distributed free of tax. To avoid this possibility, the Chapter 2 regime may require modification before it could be applied to mutual life offices. The ability of organisations formed on a mutual basis to distribute profits free of tax, and the problems arising from this ability, are discussed in some detail in Chapter 6. Accordingly, these issues are covered only briefly in this chapter. 7.2 Problems Taxing Mutual Life Offices Under the present taxation regime for life offices, there is no need to differentiate between mutual and non-mutual companies. This is because both types of company have an incentive to maximise net investment income, ie the tax base, for the benefit of policyholders and shareholders. Since premiums are not included in the tax base, mutual companies 83 would not derive a tax advantage by reducing them. However, under the regime suggested in Chapter 2, this would no longer hold. Mutual companies would be able gain a tax advantage over non-mutual companies by charging lower premiums for the same levels of cover. Consequently, the commercial decisions of mutual companies could be influenced by the tax system and mutual companies could achieve a competitive advantage over non-mutual life companies. At the same time, the tax base would be eroded at the expense of taxpayers generally. As noted above, issues relating to the taxation of mutual or co-operative organisations were discussed in the previous chapter on friendly societies and credit unions. If the life office regime outlined in Chapter 2 is adopted, then the principles underlying the discussion in Chapter 6 will also apply to mutual life offices. Thus, consideration could be given to applying the options outlined for friendly societies and credit unions to mutual life offices. These options are discussed briefly in the next section. 7.3 Options for Taxing Mutual Life Offices Option 1 - Tax as Non-Mutuals This option involves applying the same tax rules to mutual life offices that apply to non-mutual companies. In the context of a tax regime for non-mutual life offices along the lines suggested in Chapter 2, this would involve deeming policyholders of a mutual company to be shareholders. Should they so wish, mutual companies would be able to establish a proprietors' account. Transfers of net investment income to that account would be deductible from policyholder net investment income and assessable as proprietor income. Distributions from that account to policyholders would be deemed to be dividends and would be assessable as such, with 84 any available imputation credits. However, instead of distributing taxed income as deemed dividends, mutual life offices could distribute profits by way of reduced premiums, and these distributions would not be taxed. Option 1 would then fail to address the problems outlined above (and considered in more detail in Chapter 6). Unless there are compelling reasons why a mutual life office would not wish to distribute profits by way of reduced premiums, option 1 would not be satisfactory. Option 2 - Market-Related Income Tax Treatment This option would be similar to option 1 except that any discount on premiums paid to a mutual life office would be included in the assessable proprietor income of the office. Tax paid on these discounts would then be imputed to policyholders/shareholders in the usual way. Thus, policyholders would include in their assessable income the value of discounts received (as notified by the life office), and use any attached imputation credits to offset the tax liability on this (or other) income. Alternatively, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue could have the discretion to deem any discount on premiums to be a dividend. This could be done along the lines of section 4(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act. The difficulty with the market-related option is the need to determine a benchmark premium level (or set of premium levels) against which to measure the discount being offered (if any). However, if it were possible to resolve this problem, the resulting regime would be equitable as between mutual and non-mutual life offices as well as addressing the efficiency and tax base concerns discussed above. 85 Option 3 - Retain Present Investment Income Tax Base Under this option mutual life offices would remain under the present tax regime but with the modifications proposed in Chapter 3. The advantage of this option is that the tax base would not be open to manipulation in the way that would be possible under option 1 above. It would also avoid the need to measure discounts as required under option 2. The disadvantages of this option are all those discussed in Chapter 2 in respect of the present regime, except in so far as these are resolved by the changes to that regime proposed in Chapter 3. 7.4 Conclusion Among other things, the feasibility of the tax regime suggested in Chapter 2 is dependent on establishing a satisfactory companion regime for mutual life companies. Life offices and other interested parties are invited to consider the three possible approaches set out above and discuss their relative merits in submissions. Other suggestions put forward in submissions will also be considered by the consultative committee. 86 ERRORS IN VOLUME 1 1 In the Table of Contents, Chapter 6, section 6.5 should read: 6.5 Taxation of Employer Contributions to Superannuation Schemes 2 On page 103, the first paragraph should read (change underlined): Subject to the comprehensive review of the taxation of life offices covered in Volume 2 of this Document, existing rules on the deductibility of life office expenditure will be retained. 3 On page 109, the last sentence of the last (complete) paragraph should read (change underlined): The removal of the exemption for the remainder of 1987/88 will be taken into account by way of reduced end of year tax refunds or increased terminal tax. 4 On page 121, the third (complete) paragraph should read (change underlined): Employer-paid premiums for the benefit of the employer will all become non-deductible from the beginning of the 1988/89 income year. All benefits under such policies will become non-assessable from the same date. ANNEX 1 TIMING OF VALUATIONS FOR THE ASSETS OF SUPERANNUATION FUNDS On 25 March 1988, the Minister of Finance issued the following press statement: "Finance Minister Roger Douglas announced today that the date for valuations of the assets of superannuation funds for the new tax regime would be 1 April 1988, irrespective of balance date. Mr Douglas said that life offices, fire and general insurance companies, banks and superannuation funds already subject to tax, were taxed based on profits and losses realised on the sale of investments. The same treatment had now been proposed for previously exempt superannuation funds, in the Consultative Document on Superannuation and Life Insurance. For this purpose, the consultative document proposed valuation of the assets of previously exempt funds as at 1 April 1988 or the first day of the income year in which that date fell. Profits and losses calculated by reference to the initial value would have been pro-rated so that only the proportion accruing after 1 April was assessable. Mr Douglas said the Consultative Committee on Superannuation and Life Insurance had since advised him that the original proposal could create anomalies between companies with balance dates of 30 September, before the sharemarket crash, and others with balance dates of 1 January, after the crash. ANNEX 2 The consultative committee members were agreed that equitable treatment required the use of a common date for all funds, for the initial valuation of assets. They had recommended that the common date be 1 April 1988. Its use would allow income from the sale of investments to be pro-rated on the same basis as other income. The Government had accepted the Consultative Committee's recommendation. All large funds routinely valued assets on a monthly basis, and most smaller funds balanced on 31 March. They would not need any additional valuations for 1 April. Smaller funds with balance dates other than 31 march should not have any difficulty in doing such a valuation on a one- off basis. Valuations for 1 April 1988 were required to be completed only by the time the assets of the fund were realised, Mr Douglas said." 2 SUMMARY OF TAX RATES The rates of tax to apply to the income of superannuation funds, life office funds, and sick, accident and death benefit funds, as detailed in the two volumes of this Consultative Document, are summarised below. The rates of FBT to apply to payments to these funds by employers (for the benefit of employees) are also given. a Rate of tax on fund income from 1 April 1988: 25% FBT rate (non-deductible) from 17 December 1987: 24% - Category 1 superannuation schemes existing on 17 December 1987; and - Approved1 sick, accident and death benefit funds existing on 17 December 1987. b Rate of tax on fund income from 1 April 1988: 33% FBT rate (non-deductible) from 17 December 1987: 35% - New registered superannuation schemes; - Category 2 superannuation schemes2; - Approved1 sick, accident and death benefit funds established after 17 December 1987; and - Life insurance2'3. c Rate of tax on fund income from 1 April 1988: 40.5% FBT rate (non-deductible) from 17 December 1987: 48% - Category 3 superannuation schemes. ANNEX 3 d FBT rate (non-deductible) from 17 December 1987: 35% - Payment to an insurance fund of a friendly society; and- Premium on a policy of personal accident or sickness insurance4. Notes 1 Approved for the purposes of section 61(41) of the Income Tax Act. 2 The 33% rate on fund income is the existing rate. 3 The FBT rate of 35% applies to premiums previously exempt FBT. 4 Unless the insurance fund is an approved sick, accident and death benefit fund existing on 17 December 1987. 2
International Tax Reform Part 1 Report of the Consultative Committee MARCH 1988 Office of the Consultative Committee on Full Imputation and International Tax Reform PO Box 3724 WELLINGTON 23 March 1988 Hon R O Douglas M inister of Finance Parliam ent B uildings W ellington. Dear Mr Douglas, On behalf of the C onsultative Committee on Full Im putation and In tern atio n al Tax Reform, I enclose P art 1 of the Com m ittee's rep o rt on the reform proposals outlined in the C onsultative Document on In tern atio n al Tax Reform. The rep o rt o u tlin es the Com m ittee's recommendations on the main elem ents of the in te rn atio n al tax regim e. We w ill rep o rt sep arately on fu rth er d e ta ils of our recommended regime and on the proposals in the C onsultative Document on Full Im putation. The C onsultative Document proposed th a t the main taxing regim es, the branch equivalent and the com parative value regim es, take e ffe c t from 1 A pril 1988. We have th erefo re concentrated in th is rep o rt on the m atters which need to be decided before 1 A pril 1988 so th a t taxpayers w ill know w ith as much c e rta in ty as possible whether they are to be affected a fte r th a t date. We believe th a t, once you have made your decisions, taxpayers will have a considerable degree of c ertain ty . A period of uncertainty is one of the co sts of the co n su ltativ e process. The trad e o ff is th a t taxpayers have fa r more input into decision making than they had previously. We b elieve th a t the b en efits of the co n su ltativ e process outweigh the co sts and th a t i t would be im possible to implement tax reform s as complex as these w ithout such a process. If you accept our recommendations on tra n sitio n a l provisions, most ex istin g foreign investm ents owned by New Zealand resid en ts w ill not be affected by the branch equivalent regime u n til 1 A pril 1990. The need fo r le g isla tiv e c ertain ty from 1 A pril 1988 would th erefo re be reduced. This rep o rt deals w ith the major building blocks of the in tern atio n al regim e. Because of the su b s titu ta b ility of d iffe re n t leg al e n titie s , the building blocks need to be clo sely in teg rated . In addition, the in tern atio n al reform s are intim ately linked w ith the fu ll im putation proposals, the reform s to the tax atio n of superannuation funds and lif e insurance and also future tax reform s such as the introduction of a c a p ita l gains tax . We have considered our recommendations i i I would add th a t the recommendations in th is rep o rt represent the unanimous views of Committee members . The Committee has benefited from the input of o ffic ia ls of the Treasury and the Inland Revenue Department. In p a rtic u la r, we express our thanks to Messers Alex Duncan, Ken Heaton and David White of Treasury and Anthony Grace and Michael Rigby of the Inland Revenue Department. in th is context. Yours sincerely Arthur Valabh Chairman iii 25 March 1988 PRESS STATEMENT BY M inister of Finance, Hon R O Douglas M inister of Revenue, Hon T A de Cleene This document is the f ir s t p a rt of the rep o rt on the introduction of in tern atio n al tax measures by the C onsultative Committee on Full Im putation and In tern atio n al Tax Reform. The rep o rt se ts out the major building blocks of the regime recommended by the Committee follow ing its review of the regime contained in the C onsultative Document and the many public subm issions received. So as to provide taxpayers w ith as much inform ation as possible as soon as po ssib le, th is f ir s t p art of the rep o rt is being released now. The Committee broadly endorses the Government's objective of reducing the o p portunities fo r the avoidance and d efe rral of New Zealand tax by resid en ts through the use of offshore e n titie s . I t also recommends the introduction of a dom estic c a p ita l gains tax as a m atter of p rio rity . I t is p a rtly in lig h t of such future action on c a p ita l gains th a t the Committee has recommended a number of im portant changes to the in tern atio n al tax regime se t out in the C onsultative Document. iv In b rie f, the major recommendation is th a t the branch-equivalent method of tax atio n should apply only where th ere is co n tro l and, where th ere is not c o n tro l, the com parative-value method of tax atio n should apply but only to a lim ited range of investm ents (foreign investm ent funds). To stream line the operation of the branch-equivalent method and reduce compliance co sts, an exemption is recommended fo r taxpayers having in te re s ts in e n titie s which are in designated countries and which do not b en efit from sig n ific a n t tax preferences. T ran sitio n al arrangem ents are also recommended by the Committee to g eth er w ith more comprehensive disclosure provisions. The regime recommended by the Committee, although less comprehensive than th a t in the C onsultative Document, is one which su b sta n tia lly meets the o bjectives of reform which were se t by the Government. The Committee has developed the regime in accordance w ith clear p rin cip les and a t the same tim e has given due recognition to the real p ra c tic a l c o n strain ts. I t has also had regard to the Government's broader programme of tax atio n reform . A ccordingly, we agree w ith the recommendations in the Com m ittee's rep o rt which co n stitu te the basic framework of the regim e. At th is stage th ere are only th ree main areas in which the Government reserves its p o sitio n . The f ir s t concerns the foreign investm ent fund provisions (recommendation (g ), page 63). T heir e ffe c t is to exclude from the regime a ll resid en ts w ith non-controlling in te re s ts in 'a c tiv e ' tax haven e n titie s . The Committee has suggested th a t coverage of th is area should aw ait the introduction of a dom estic c ap ita l gains tax, or evidence th a t the regime is not catching the m ajority of o p portunities fo r avoidance and d e fe rra l, or evidence th a t taxpayers are abusing the exemption. This is an area the Government intends to m onitor closely in the in itia l stages of the operation of the regim e. If necessary, such provisions w ill be reviewed and strengthened p rio r to the introduction of a c ap ita l gains tax. v The second area in which the Government reserves its p o sitio n is the treatm ent of c a p ita l p ro fits earned by tru s ts su b ject to the s e ttlo r regim e, and by testam entary tru s ts , a fte r 31 March 1989, th a t is a fte r the end of the tra n sitio n a l period. The Committee has recommended th a t, on d istrib u tio n , c a p ita l p ro fits be allowed to pass through to b en eficiaries tax free (recommendation (o ), page 65 and recommendation ( t ) ( i ) , page 66). The Government wishes to consider these recommendations fu rth er in the context of the im putation and superannuation reform s. The th ird area concerns the taxation of resid en t tru s ts as defined under the new regim e, se ttle d on or before 17 December 1987, in the period from 1 A pril 1989. The Committee recommends th a t the s e ttlo r regime apply to any such tru s ts which are newly se ttle d or which have new settlem ents made to them a fte r 17 December 1987, or which have elected w ith the s e ttlo r 's agreem ent to come under th a t regim e; other tru s ts could remain outside the s e ttlo r regim e, but d istrib u tio n s of income (including accumulated income) and c ap ita l p ro fits to New Zealand resid en t b e n eficiarie s would be taxed to the ben eficiary w ith an in te re s t charge calculated from 1 A pril 1988 to recoup deferred tax (recommendations ( r ) , page 65 and (s ), pages 65-66). At th is stage, the Government considers th a t from 1 A pril 1989 re sid en t tru s ts should be taxed according to the s e ttlo r regim e, except where the s e ttlo r can dem onstrate th a t th ere is m anifest good reason fo r such an exception and i t can be shown th a t e ith e r the tru s t is subject to tax in a high tax ju risd ic tio n or the im position of the s e ttlo r regime would cause undue hardship to the s e ttlo r. For these excepted tru s ts , as for testam entary tru s ts , the b eneficiary regime recommended by the Committee would apply (recommendation (s ), pages 65-66 and recommendation (t) ( i i ) , page 66). Subject to these reserv atio n s i t is agreed th a t work on the fu rth er d etailed measures and the d ra ft le g isla tio n , to be developed for the Government's fin a l approval, proceed on the b asis of the Com mittee's rep o rt. vi A summary of the changes and the key elem ents of the new regime are to be se t out in a separate press release. Further inform ation on the d etailed tech n ical issues re la tin g to the operation of the regime w ill follow in the second p a rt of the Com mittee's rep o rt. The Committee is chaired by Mr A rthur Valabh and its members comprise Dr Robin Congreve, Mr S tu art Hutchinson, Dr Susan Lojkine, P rofessor John Prebble and Mr Tim Robinson. The Committee has faced a form idable task . I ts professionalism is refle c te d in the excellence of the rep o rt. We thank Mr Valabh and h is Committee for th e ir sig n ific a n t co ntribution to the reform of tax atio n in th is area. Our appreciation extends also to those who took the tim e to make subm issions and provide constructive comment. This has fa c ilita te d the Committee's work and w ill re s u lt in improvements to the p o lic ie s fin a lly enacted. We look forward to the second p art of the Committee' s rep o rt on the in tern atio n al tax measures and its rep o rt on fu ll im putation; both w ill be accompanied by d ra ft le g isla tio n . A fter the subsequent introduction of the B ill to Parliam ent, i t w ill be referred to a S elect Committee. In terested p a rtie s w ill th erefo re have a fu rth er opportunity to make subm issions. vii TABLE OF CONTENTS Page L etter to the M inister of Finance i Press Statem ent by the M inisters of Finance and Revenue i i i Table of Contents v ii CHAPTER 1 – INTRODUCTION 2 1.1 Purpose of This Report 2 1.2 Submissions 3 1.3 Context of the Reforms 3 1.4 C rite ria fo r Evaluation of Proposals 4 1.5 O bjectives of In tern atio n al Tax Reform 5 1.6 Regimes Proposed in the C onsultative Document 10 1.7 Summary: Main B uilding Blocks 13 CHAPTER 2 – BRANCH EQUIVALENT REGIME FOR CONTROLLED FOREIGN COMPANIES 15 2.1 Control T est 15 2.2 White L ist 18 2.3 Tax Preferences 20 2.4 Submissions 24 2.5 Dividends Received by a C ontrolled Company, Losses and Foreign Tax C redits 27 viii CHAPTER 3 – FOREIGN INVESTMENT FUNDS 31 3.1 Avoidance Problems: Need for an A lternative Regime 31 3.2 Coverage of the Regime 32 3.3 Foreign Investm ent Fund Regime 35 CHAPTER 4 – TREATMENT OF DIVIDENDS 39 4.1 Corporate R ecipient 39 4.2 Non-Corporate R ecipient 42 CHAPTER 5 – TRUSTS 43 5.1 Introduction 43 5.2 T rust Income 43 5.3 D istrib u tio n s From R esident T rusts 46 5.4 D istrib u tio n s From N on-resident T rusts 46 CHAPTER 6 – DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS AND PENALTIES 49 6.1 D isclosure Requirements and P en alties 49 CHAPTER 7 – TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS 50 7.1 BE Regime 50 7.2 R esident T rusts 51 7.3 Non-Resident T rusts 54 7.4 Foreign Investm ent Funds 55 7.5 Recommendations 55 ix CHAPTER 8 – FURTHER MEASURES 58 8.1 Role of a C apital Gains Tax 58 8.2 In te rju risd ic tio n a l A llocation Rules 59 8.3 Recommendation 60 CHAPTER 9 – SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 61 9.1 Summary of Recommendations 61 9.2 Conclusion 67 ANNEXES 1 C ontrol I n te r e s ts o f R esid en ts in C on trolled F oreign Companies 69 2 Is su e s R e la tin g to th e D eterm ination and A ttr ib u tio n o f Branch E q u ivalen t Income 80 3 F oreign Investm ent Funds 98 4 T rust regim e 104 5 An I llu s t r a t iv e T r a n sitio n a l L is t o f Low Tax J u r is d ic tio n s 112 Report on International Tax Reform Part 1 Consultative Committee on Full Imputation and International Tax Reform 2 CHAPTER 1 – INTRODUCTION 1 .1 P u rp ose o f T h is R ep ort 1.1.1 This is P art 1 of the Report of the C onsultative Committee on Full Im putation and In tern atio n al Tax Reform. I t deals w ith the Com m ittee's recommendations on the main elem ents of the in te rn atio n al tax reform s. Our aim in presenting th is rep o rt is to enable you to give taxpayers as much c e rta in ty as possible before 1 A pril 1988, the im plem entation date proposed in the C onsultative Document on In tern atio n al Tax Reform (the "CD") for the regimes to apply to un d istrib u ted income. 1.1.2 To th is end, the rep o rt concentrates on the Com m ittee's recommendations on the main building blocks of the in te rn a tio n a l tax reform s and, in p a rtic u la r, the boundaries of the regime and the tra n sitio n a l provisions. In th is way, we hope th a t, once you have considered our recommendations, taxpayers w ill know w ith as much c ertain ty as is p racticab le a t th is stage whether they are affected by the regime and, if so, when i t w ill f ir s t a ffe c t them and broadly how i t w ill do so. Where we have not fin a lise d our views, we say so or re fra in from commenting. 1.1.3 A number of d e ta ils are s t i l l to be considered. We w ill address these in P art 2 of our rep o rt which w ill accompany the d ra ft le g isla tio n . A separate rep o rt w ill also be prepared on fu ll im putation and the corresponding d ra ft le g isla tio n . 3 1.1.4 Given the Com m ittee's reporting deadline of 31 March 1988, we began m eeting on 22 December 1987 in an endeavour to id en tify the major issu es. We have met reg u larly , u sually several tim es a week, since then. Since our b rie f includes the preparation of d ra ft le g isla tio n , we have engaged th ree leg al draftsm en to a s s is t w ith th is task . As a re s u lt, the d ra ft le g isla tio n is w ell advanced, though considerable d e ta il has s t i l l to be decided. 1 .2 Subm issions 1.2.1 A to ta l of 209 subm issions were received by the Committee. Of these, 108 d e alt only w ith the in te rn atio n al tax reform s, 49 d e alt only w ith im putation and 47 commented on both. Given our reporting deadline, we have been able to hear only a sm all number of o ral subm issions. Committee members have, however, discussed the CD proposals widely w ith tax p ra c titio n e rs and business people. In addition, Committee members attended the In s titu te of Policy Studies sem inar on the reform s, which was held in W ellington on 2 February 1988, and the annual conference of the New Zealand branch of the In tern atio n al F iscal A ssociation, held a t W airakei on 26-27 February 1988, which was focussed e n tire ly on the in tern atio n al reform s and im putation. These were helpful in providing feedback on the CD proposals and a lte rn a tiv e s advocated by p ra c titio n e rs. 1 .3 C ontext o f th e Reforms 1.3.1 The in tern atio n al tax reform s are p art of a w ider package of reform s which includes su b sta n tia l reductions in sta tu to ry tax ra te s and removal of tax concessions fo r superannuation and lif e insurance. The Committee recognises th a t 4 the Government regards an e ffe ctiv e in te rn atio n al regime as p a rt of the trad e o ff fo r lower tax ra te s and, indeed, a p re re q u isite for the la tte r . In addition, the reform s should be m utually co n sisten t and should rein fo rce one another as fa r as p o ssib le. For example, the effectiv en ess of the superannuation fund tax reform s depends in p a rt on the in te rn atio n al tax regime covering offshore veh icles which could su b stitu te for dom estic superannuation funds. The Committee has kept these linkages in mind in considering the present proposals. 1.3.2 The reform s must also be seen in the context of future tax reform s, p a rtic u la rly the possible introduction of a c a p ita l gains tax and in te rju risd ic tio n a l allo catio n ru les (such as tra n sfe r p ricin g and expense allo catio n p ro v isio n s). The la tte r are necessary to ensure th a t New Zealand c o lle c ts the appropriate amount of revenue from dom estic investm ents owned by non- resid en ts. This objective is not addressed in the cu rren t in tern atio n al proposals, which are aimed a t taxing New Zealand resid en ts on income diverted from New Zealand and foreign-source income derived through offshore companies and tru s ts . 1 .4 C r ite r ia fo r E valu ation o f P rop osals 1.4.1 There are a number of c rite ria which are conventionally used to evaluate tax reform s. These have formed the b asis of the Com mittee's framework for considering the CD proposals and possible a lte rn a tiv e s. In b rie f, we believe the reform s should be: a e q u itab le. The effectiv en ess of the reform s w ill depend to a large extent on voluntary compliance by taxpayers. This is much more lik e ly to occur if they are perceived to be fair; 5 b e ffic ie n t, in the sense of m inim ising ad d itio n al adm inistrative and compliance costs and the impact of the tax system on business d ecisio n - making; and c as fa r as p ossible, sim ple to implement and c ertain in th e ir im pact. 1.4.2 We would add th a t taxpayer perceptions of the reform s w ill be enhanced if they are co n sisten t w ith ex istin g income tax p rin cip les and give adequate recognition to the need fo r tra n sitio n a l m easures. 1 .5 O b je ctiv es o f In te r n a tio n a l Tax Reform 1.5.1 The CD has two main o bjectives: to "a p ro tect the dom estic tax base from arrangem ents which seek to avoid or defer New Zealand tax by the accum ulation of income in offshore e n titie s ; and b reduce the extent to which the tax system encourages offshore investm ent re la tiv e to investm ent in New Zealand and biases the form in which offshore investm ent is made." (CD, page 1) 6 1.5.2 There is no sharp d istin c tio n between tax avoidance and tax d eferral since the la tte r amounts to a permanent reduction in the present value of the tax co llected by New Zealand. The avoidance problem which the CD id e n tifie s and which was the ta rg e t of the co n tro lled foreign company ("CFC") measures announced in Annex 4 of the 1987 Budget is e sse n tia lly the use of co ntrolled tax haven v eh icles, whether companies or tru s ts , to avoid New Zealand tax by the diversion of New Zealand-source income. There is widespread agreement amongst p a rtie s making subm issions th a t the Government is fu lly ju s tifie d in addressing th is problem. The Committee c e rta in ly endorses th is view. There is also general, though less so lid , support fo r a regime which taxes the accum ulation of foreign-source income in tax haven e n titie s . 1.5.3 The a n ti-d e fe rra l objective is much more contentious and th ere is considerable opposition in subm issions to a comprehensive a n ti-d e fe rra l regim e. The CD regards the d e fe rra l problem broadly as the absence of tax atio n on an accrual b asis of resid en ts on income they earn through non-resident companies and tru s ts . At p resen t, New Zealand tax is co llected on income derived by foreign companies owned by New Zealand resid en ts only when i t is d istrib u te d to non-corporate resid en t taxpayers. In the case of tru s ts , New Zealand tax is co llected , if a t a ll, only when d istrib u tio n s are made to resid en t b e n eficiarie s. 1.5.4 The CD proposals pursue the a n ti-d e fe rra l objectiv e prim arily by aiming to tax resid en ts on the u n d istrib u ted income of non-resident companies and tru s ts in which they have an in te re st or a connection as a s e ttlo r. This objective is also behind the introduction of a w ithholding payment to apply to foreign-source non-portfolio dividends received by resid en t companies, as announced in the Government Economic Statem ent of 17 December 1987. 7 1.5.5 Thus, the th ru st of the reform s is to tax a ll re sid e n ts, including companies, on the income th a t they actu ally receive from foreign e n titie s (i.e . non-resident companies and tru sts) and on c e rta in u n d istrib u ted income. The tax atio n of income on rec eip t is w ell w ithin the current concepts of the income tax system (though other considerations may suggest th a t dividends received by companies should be taxed d iffe re n tly from dividends received by in d iv id u a ls). As commercial tran sactio n s have become more so p h isticated , both the accounting and the income tax concepts of income have of necessity been extended in many areas to include not only income received but income which can be said w ith reasonable c e rta in ty to have accrued. I t is fu lly co n sisten t w ith th is extended d e fin itio n of income to tax resid en ts on the u n d istrib u ted income of non-resident e n titie s th a t can reasonably be assumed to have accrued to them. This does not require th a t they have legal t i t l e to the income. I t is su ffic ie n t th a t they possess the power to give them selves leg al t i t l e . We th erefo re do not regard i t as offensive to income tax p rin cip les th a t resid en ts are taxed on income over which they have power of d isp o sitio n , even if they have not received i t . We would, however, go no fu rth er than th is . I t is not reasonable to tax resid en ts on income th a t they may never receive. 1.5.6 One of the Committee's main reserv atio n s about the CD proposals is th a t they pursue the a n ti-d e fe rra l objectiv e to its extreme lim its w ithout giving enough a tten tio n to conventional income tax p rin cip les or to the adm inistration and com pliance problems which a rise . In some cases, tax atio n would be levied on amounts th a t were w ell beyond the income to which a taxpayer had any reasonable chance of access. Moreover, at some p o in t, the adm inistration and compliance costs would be excessive re la tiv e to the revenue th a t could be expected. 8 1.5.7 The CD supports the a n ti-d e fe rra l objective on the b asis th a t "a broadening of the tax base with respect to foreign income is required to perm it cuts in the ra te s of income tax applicable to both individuals and companies" (CD, page 15). This is seen as the prim ary ju s tific a tio n for the com parative value ("CV") regime (under which resid en ts would be taxed on the annual change in the market value of th e ir in te re sts in foreign com panies), though i t has also been advanced on other grounds which w ill be discussed below. The Committee strongly supports the objective of broadening the tax base and low ering income tax ra te s. We believe th a t th is objective also has widespread support amongst the business community. There is , however, strenuous opposition to pursuing i t through what is in e ffe c t an accrual nominal c a p ita l gains tax, i.e . the CV method. The CV method is not defended in the CD as a c a p ita l gains tax. There is no discussion of the fundamental design issues associated w ith such a tax, such as whether i t should tax only rea l or nominal gains and whether i t should apply on an accrual or re a lisa tio n b a sis. Given the complete novelty of the CV proposal, its lack of any in te rn atio n al precedent, its valuation problem s, its cash-flow consequences and the absence of a convincing ju s tific a tio n fo r i t in the CD, i t is not su rp risin g th a t the proposal found no support amongst those who made subm issions. 1.5.8 This ra ise s the Com mittee's other main concern. The CD gives too l i t t l e weight to the im portance, in a tax system based on voluntary com pliance, of acknowledging taxpayer perceptions of "fairn ess". If the CV regime were implemented as proposed, i t would encourage evasion and stre tc h the lim its of avoidance because taxpayers would regard i t as very u n fair. The objective of retain in g taxpayer goodwill should be kept in mind. 9 1.5.9 The second objective referred to in paragraph 1 .5 .1 , of reducing the extent to which the tax system encourages offshore investm ent, is intim ately linked w ith the f ir s t o b jectiv e. To the extent th a t tax payable on foreign investm ent is avoided or deferred re la tiv e to the tax th a t would be payable in New Zealand, the tax system w ill influence decisions to in v est in New Zealand or overseas. Most decisions to invest offshore are not tax driven though, as an im portant business co st, taxes must obviously be taken in to account and w ill influence decisions to re p a tria te or rein v est income. The CD objective re fe rs to the impact of taxes on the m arginal investm ent decision, th a t is , where other facto rs are in balance, tax considerations m ight tip the scales in favour of investing offshore rath er than in New Zealand. 1.5.10 This objective can be addressed in term s of the c rite ria of "cap ital export n e u tra lity " (which holds when foreign- and dom estic-source income are taxed in the same way so th a t resid en ts are in d iffe re n t on tax considerations between investing offshore or dom estically) and "cap ital im port n e u tra lity " (which holds when the tax treatm ent of foreign investm ents is determ ined so lely by the ru les applying in the country in which the investm ent is lo ca te d ). Many subm issions e x p lic itly or im p licitly advocated the la tte r approach in order th a t New Zealand firm s could compete w ith foreign firm s. I t was pointed out th a t no other country has a regime comparable to th a t proposed in the CD. 1.5.11 To a large ex tent, the in tern atio n al com petitiveness argument advanced in subm issions re fle c ts the immediate and p o te n tia lly adverse impact the CD proposals would have on ex istin g investm ent. The Committee considers th a t these concerns can be addressed by providing adequate tra n sitio n a l arrangem ents. As to the fu tu re, we recognise th a t tax is only one facto r 10 affectin g com petitiveness. In the long run, New Zealand as a whole is b est served by an e ffic ie n t tax system: th a t is , one which is n eu tral between dom estic and foreign investm ent. The Committee th erefo re supports the second objective of the CD, though th ere are major c o n strain ts on the extent to which i t can be achieved. We comment fu rth er on th is issue in sectio n 2.3. 1.5.12 Wherever th ere is cross-border investm ent, th ere are a t le a st two tax ju risd ic tio n s involved: the country in which the investm ent is sourced and the country in which the in v esto rs are resid en t. The in te re sts of the respective revenue a u th o ritie s are to some extent in c o n flic t because the residence country ty p ic a lly allow s a tax c re d it, w ithin lim its, fo r the tax levied by the source country. Tax tre a tie s resolve the c o n flictin g in te re s ts to some extent but u n ila te ra l tax changes can a ffe c t the balance. For example, A ustralian companies have an incentive to m inimise the New Zealand tax they pay, even if th is means increasing th e ir A ustralian tax , since the A ustralian im putation scheme allow s c re d its for A ustralian but not foreign company tax . Thus, another general objective of reform of New Z ealand's in te rn atio n al tax regime should be to ensure th a t New Zealand c o lle c ts its share of tax , esp ecially on income th a t has a New Zealand source. This is the objective of allo catio n ru les which we referred to in section 1.5. 1 .6 Regimes Proposed in th e C o n su lta tiv e Document 1.6.1 The scope and nature of the in tern atio n al tax regime should be determ ined in the lig h t of the above o bjectives and the c rite ria fo r evaluation outlined in section 1.4. The CD proposes two broad options for taxing on an accrual basis income derived by resid en ts through offshore e n titie s . The f ir s t is to tax resid en ts each year on "th e ir share" of the underlying income of 11 the offshore e n tity . This is the approach taken under the branch-equivalent ("BE") method. The second approach is to tax resid en ts on the d istrib u tio n s they receive from the offshore e n tity and the c a p ita l gain or lo ss th a t accrues to them each year. This is the all-em bracing approach of the CV method. 1.6.2 These two approaches d iffe r because taxable income may be less than comprehensive but, given a reasonably broad tax base, the prim ary d ifferen ce is th a t the BE method taxes what may be termed system atic gains (which are due prim arily to the accum ulation of assets w ithin companies as a re su lt of retain ed earn in g s), whereas the CV method taxes both system atic and non- system atic or unanticipated gains. From the point of view of the efficien cy of the tax system, i t is not necessary to tax unanticipated or w indfall gains and lo sses. Because such gains cannot be an ticip ated , they cannot influence investm ent decisions. Thus, the case fo r taxing them must re s t on some notion of fairn e ss. 1.6.3 Another way of viewing the d ifferen ce between the two methods is th a t BE income is taxable income as cu rren tly defined whereas CV income is the much less conventional economic concept of income. The Committee p refers the approach, wherever fea sib le, of taxing resid en ts on the underlying income of foreign e n titie s since th is focuses on system atic or planned gains and is co n sisten t w ith the p rin cip les of the cu rren t tax system . 1.6.4 Where th is approach (i.e . the BE method) is not fea sib le, the CD fa lls back on the CV method. Some of the Com m ittee's concerns about the CV approach were referred to above. An accrual a lte rn a tiv e to the CV method would be to tax resid en ts each year on th e ir share of the reported income of foreign companies based on the companies' audited accounts. In 12 order to avoid taxing resid en ts on the u n d istrib u ted income of foreign companies which they never receive, i t would be d esirab le to have a post facto wash up on disposal of shares. This post facto adjustm ent would determ ine the actual gain or lo ss derived by a taxpayer on a foreign investm ent by calcu latin g the d istrib u tio n s received and the c a p ita l gain or lo ss. Thus, a realisatio n -b ased c a p ita l gains tax is an inherent p a rt of th is approach. 1.6.5 The Committee do not advocate the adoption of th is approach now. We mention i t m ainly to suggest th a t th ere are a lte rn a tiv e s to the CV method th a t would meet the Government's objectives and in some respects are p referab le to the CV method. The option outlined would be best examined in the context of the current in v estig atio n of c a p ita l gains taxes and should be introduced only as p art of a general c ap ita l gains tax . 1.6.6 The CV method does, however, have a ro le as p a rt of the current reform s where th ere are system atic or expected gains resu ltin g from the accum ulation of income in an offshore e n tity , such as may be the case for some u n it tru s ts and mutual funds. We comment fu rth er on th is in chapter 3. 13 1 .7 Summary: Main B u ild in g B locks 1.7.1 The Com m ittee's proposals are developed in the follow ing chapters. The main elem ents a re : a the BE regime to apply to non-minor shareholders of co n tro lled companies which are e ith e r: i resid en t outside of the United S ta te s, the U nited Kingdom, West Germany, Canada, France, Japan or A u stralia; or i i if resid en t in one of those co u n tries, f a il the grey l i s t te s t outlined in section 7 concerning the e ffe c t of sig n ific a n t tax preferences in those countries; b a foreign investm ent fund regime to apply to resid en ts w ith in te re sts in c ertain investm ent vehicles dom iciled in low tax c o u n tries; c the s e ttlo r regime to apply to resid en t tru s ts (i.e . those w ith a resid en t s e ttlo r ) ; d tra n sitio n a l arrangem ents under which taxpayers would be exempt from: i the BE regime u n til 1 A pril 1990 in resp ect of in te re sts acquired on or before 17 December 1987 in companies which are not resid en t in low tax ju risd ic tio n s sp ecified in a tra n s itio n a l l is t; 14 i i the BE regime u n til 1 A pril 1989 in resp ect of in te re sts acquired a fte r 17 December 1987 in companies resid en t in a country lis te d in (a)(i); i i i the s e ttlo r regime in resp ect of settlem ents made on or before 17 December 1987 where the s e ttlo r so e le c ts, in which case an a lte rn a tiv e regime would apply to d istrib u tio n s to b e n e fic ia rie s and to the s e ttlo r where he or she had a debt, guarantee or other form of fin an cial assistan ce outstanding to the tru ste e ; e s tr ic t disclo su re requirem ents and p en alties fo r non- compliance; f eventually, but we would hope w ithin a re la tiv e ly sh o rt tim e, the extension of the income tax base to include c a p ita l gains on both dom estic and offshore investm ents, including offshore investm ents not covered by the present proposals; and g also as a m atter of p rio rity , the introduction of in te rj u risd ic tio n a l allo catio n ru les to ensure th a t New Zealand c o lle c ts the appropriate amount of revenue, p a rtic u la rly in re la tio n to New Zealand-source income. 15 CHAPTER 2 – BRANCH EQUIVALENT REGIME FOR CONTROLLED FOREIGN COMPANIES 2 .1 C ontrol T est 2.1.1 The BE method would tax New Zealand shareholders on th e ir proportionate shares of the und istrib u ted income of foreign companies measured according to New Zealand tax ru le s. Thus, the method req u ires taxpayers to have a ll of the inform ation necessary to recompute the taxable income of offshore companies. In p rac tic e, th is inform ation w ill generally not be av ailab le unless the resid en t(s) control the offshore company. In addition, as we have argued in section 1.5, i t is unreasonable to tax resid en ts on the und istrib u ted income of offshore companies which they may never receive, unless they a t le a st have access to i t , th a t is , they have the power to require d istrib u tio n i f they wish. For these two reasons, the Committee recommends th a t the BE regime apply only where resid en ts control an offshore company. 2.1.2 This would be in lin e w ith p ractice overseas, where BE- type regim es apply only where th ere is a controlled foreign company. Submissions were strongly in favour of a control te s t. This would not be a sig n ific a n t departure from the CD proposals since, in p rac tic e, the BE regime could be applied only where th ere is co n tro l. 2.1.3 A number of companies making subm issions noted th a t th e ir a b ility to re p a tria te p ro fits from non-resident su b sid iaries may be re s tric te d because of exchange co n tro ls, governm ental foreign investm ent requirem ents, or agreem ents made w ith co-venturers. Since businesses do not consciously make bad investm ent decisions, we would expect th a t the retu rn generated 16 from foreign su b sid iaries in these circum stances w ill be higher than otherw ise to re fle c t the co n strain ts imposed. Thus, the New Zealand parent w ill generally expect to be able to gain access to the foreign subsidiary p ro fits a t some stage, though not n ecessarily to re p a tria te them, and be compensated fo r any impediments and tim e delays. Even if th is were not the case, i t would be im practicable to give re lie f from the BE regime m erely because p ro fit access re s tric tio n s e x ist because taxpayers could v o lu n tarily en ter in to such arrangem ents to suspend the e ffe c t of the regim e. I t m ight also encourage foreign governments to impose re p a tria tio n con tro ls on New Zealand investm ent. Where such re s tric tio n s cu rren tly apply to foreign su b sid ia rie s, some r e lie f w ill be provided by the tra n sitio n a l provisions recommended by the Committee. 2.1.4 The Committee has considered the appropriate control te s t a fte r looking a t several overseas models. Any te s t must of necessity be somewhat a rb itra ry since, in p ractice, th ere are no c le arly defined c rite ria for co n tro l. We recommend defining control as the ownership of 50 percent or more of the shares (or rig h ts to income, d istrib u tio n s on wind up, votes, etc) of a company by 5 or fewer resid en ts. This is sim ilar to the Canadian te s t and th a t proposed in Annex 4 of the 1987 Budget. I t would be necessary to have a constructive ownership ru le so th a t in te re s ts held in nominees and associated p a rtie s would be aggregated. In addition, we propose an anti-avoidance provision aimed a t arrangem ents, such as voting tru s ts and understandings, which have the e ffe c t of defeating the in te n t and ap p licatio n of the control te s t. We would also add a de facto control te s t to cover situ a tio n s such as where a shareholder has a rig h t to require a d istrib u tio n or the wind up of a company. 17 2.1.5 Where a non-resident company fa lls w ithin the control te s t, a ll of its New Zealand shareholders or only the co n tro llin g ones could be subject to the regim e. The Committee favour the la tte r approach because only co n tro llin g shareholders have access to the necessary inform ation and the u n d istrib u ted income of the company. Since th ere may be more than one group of 5 resid en ts which s a tis fie s the control te s t, we recommend th a t a ll resid en t shareholders of co ntrolled companies w ith in te re s ts of 10 percent or more (h ereafter referred to as "non-minor" shareholders) be subject to the BE regim e. An exception should apply where control e x ists by v irtu e of the proposed anti-avoidance or de facto control provisions. In those cases, the resid en ts deemed to have control should be subject to the regime in accordance w ith th e ir proportionate in te re s ts . 2.1.6 Further d e ta ils of the control provisions proposed by the Committee are contained in Annex 1. Recommendation 2.1.7 The Committee th e r e fo r e recommends th a t, in r e la t io n to fo r e ig n com panies: a th e BE regim e apply on ly where New Zealand r e s id e n ts have c o n tr o l o f a company; b c o n tr o l be d efin ed as th e ownership by 5 or few er r e s id e n ts o f 50 p ercen t or more o f th e sh a res (or v o te s , r ig h ts to d iv id en d s or d is tr ib u tio n s on wind up) o f a company, su b je c t t o : 18 i a c o n str u c tiv e ow nership t e s t to in clu d e in t e r e s t s h eld through a ss o c ia te d p erso n s, nom inees and o th er c o n tr o lle d com panies; i i a de fa c to c o n tr o l p r o v isio n to in c lu d e w ith in th e regim e p erson s who have th e power t o req u ire a d is tr ib u tio n or th e wind-up o f a n o n -re sid e n t company; and i i i an a n ti-a v o id a n ce p r o v isio n to d e te r arrangem ents which have th e e f f e c t o f d e fe a tin g th e in te n t and a p p lic a tio n o f th e c o n tr o l t e s t ; and c r e s id e n t sh a reh o ld ers who d ir e c t ly or in d ir e c t ly h o ld a 10 p ercen t or g r e a te r in t e r e s t in a c o n tr o lle d company and r e s id e n ts who are deemed to have c o n tr o l by v ir tu e o f th e de fa c to c o n tr o l and a n ti-a v o id a n ce p r o v isio n s be su b je c t to th e BE regim e, but o th er r e sid e n t sh a reh o ld ers o f c o n tr o lle d com panies be exempt from i t . 2.2. W hite L is t 2.2.1 One of the critic ism s of the BE regime is th a t i t would involve heavy compliance costs fo r possibly l i t t l e revenue when i t applied to companies in "high tax" co u n tries, such as the U nited S tates and the U nited Kingdom. The compliance co sts would be most acute fo r New Z ealand's large in te rn a tio n a lly d iv e rsifie d com panies, some of which have hundreds of offshore su b sid ia rie s. In ad d itio n , the adm inistrative costs of the regime would be high. 19 2.2.2 The United Kingdom, West Germany and France address th is problem by having a so -called "white lis t" of co u n tries. I f a company is resid en t in a w hite l i s t country and the larg e bulk of its income is sourced and subject to tax in such co u n tries, i t is exempt from the CFC regim e. 2.2.3 In p rin cip le , i t is d esirab le to minimise com pliance costs where the revenue a t stake is not m aterial. The p ra c tic a l d iffic u lty in th is case is th a t the revenue lo ss re la tiv e to the compliance co st savings resu ltin g from some form of l i s t cannot read ily be q u an tified . N evertheless, the Committee recommends the adoption of a re s tric te d l i s t as a reasonable pragm atic compromise. We recognise th a t no l i s t can be w atertig h t and th a t there w ill be costs in com piling and updating i t . These problems must be weighed against the need to reduce the com pliance co sts of the regime where i t is unlikely th a t revenue would be co llected . 2.2.4 A ccordingly, the Committee favours a l i s t , q u a lifie d by tax preferences as se t out below, of countries which have comprehensive in tern atio n al tax ru les including CFC regim es. At p resent, th ere are six - the United Kingdom, the U nited S ta te s, West Germany, France, Canada and Japan. We understand th a t A u stralia is cu rren tly considering the introduction of a CFC regime and, given our proposed tra n sitio n a l provisions (discussed in chapter 7), we recommend th a t A ustralia be included on the l is t. The existence or otherw ise of a CFC regime gives the l i s t an objective b asis. 20 2.2.5 The U nited Kingdom w hite l i s t is q u alified by an income source ru le to the e ffe c t th a t, to be exempt from the CFC regime under the w hite l i s t provisions, co n tro lled companies must derive a t le a st 90 percent of th e ir income in the (white lis t) country in which they are resid en t. This ru le aims to ensure th a t, to q u alify fo r exem ption, the large bulk of the income of a co n tro lled company must be subject to tax in a w hite l i s t country. An a lte rn a tiv e approach is to "look through" companies resid en t in w hite l i s t countries to co n tro lled companies beneath them. These lower tie r controlled companies would be exempt only if they also s a tis fie d the q u alified w hite l i s t te s t. The Committee favours th is approach rath e r than an income source te st, In addition, i t would be necessary to l i s t as a sig n ific a n t preference the exemption of foreign-source income where a lis te d country excluded i t from its tax base. This is p resen tly the case w ith France. We discuss the issue of foreign tax preferences in the next subsection. 2 .3 Tax P referen ces 2.3.1 In addition to having a w hite l is t, the U nited Kingdom has a q u alified (or "grey") l i s t which provides fo r exemption from the CFC regime only if the foreign company does not b en efit from c e rta in lis te d tax preferences. Many subm issions argued th a t foreign tax preferences should be recognised under the BE regime to preserve the com petitiveness of foreign su b sid ia rie s of New Zealand companies. We commented b rie fly on the in te rn atio n al com petitiveness argument in section 1.5. The arguments against recognising foreign preferences are th a t: a i t would be in co n sisten t w ith dom estic tax p olicy, which is generally to remove tax preferences. This policy would make no sense a t a ll if foreign tax preferences 21 were recognised under the BE regime since i t would m erely encourage New Zealand resid en ts to in v est offshore. If tax incentives were to be allowed as a m atter of tax policy, i t would be b e tte r to provide them dom estically; b tax preferences are only one form of investm ent subsidy. Other types of assistan ce th a t may be provided in other countries include g ran ts, subsidised input c o sts, output bounties, ta r if f p ro tectio n , concessional loans and provision of free services such as research. A ll of these would have the e ffe c t of increasing the p ro fita b ility of foreign investm ents owned by New Zealand resid en ts but the b en efit of them would to some extent be clawed back under the BE regim e. I t would be im practical to preserve the e ffe c t of a ll types of assistan ce under the regime and we see no reason to preserve tax preferences in p a rtic u la r; and c tax preferences are sim ilar in e ffe c t to low or zero ra te s of tax. If the BE regime is to apply to co n tro lled companies in low tax countries ("tax havens”) , i t should also apply to such companies in high tax countries where e ffe ctiv e tax ra te s are low, not because of a low sta tu to ry tax ra te , but because of tax preferences. 2.3.2 In ad dition, the trend amongst OECD countries is to phase out or remove tax preferences. This is c e rta in ly the case in the U nited S tates, the United Kingdom and Canada. As tax preferences are removed, e ffe ctiv e tax ra te s in other co u n tries w ill ris e so th a t, since New Z ealand's sta tu to ry tax ra te s w ill be amongst the low est, if not the low est, in the OECD, our 22 e ffe c tiv e tax ra te s should be comparable to those in the countries where most of New Z ealand's offshore investm ent is located. The impact of the BE regime on the com petitiveness of New Zealand-owned foreign companies w ill th erefo re dim inish as the trend away from preferences continues. 2.3.3 In the Com m ittee's view, the arguments against recognising foreign tax preferences under the BE regime outweigh the counter argum ents. We th erefo re favour the q u a lific a tio n of the proposed w hite l i s t by the id e n tific a tio n of sig n ific a n t tax preferences in each country. As noted above, th is q u a lifie d l i s t is referred to as a grey l is t. Taxpayers would be required to ad ju st the taxable income of a CFC resid en t in a lis te d country, measured according to th a t country's tax ru les, fo r any id e n tifie d sig n ific a n t preferences th a t the CFC has u tilis e d . If the foreign tax paid as a proportion of the adjusted taxable income equals or exceeds the New Zealand company tax ra te , the taxpayer would be exempt from the regime in respect of th a t CFC. In our view, the reduction in the New Zealand sta tu to ry company tax ra te removes the need to base th is effectiv e tax ra te comparison on tw o-thirds of the sta tu to ry ra te , as proposed in Annex 4 of the 1987 Budget. 2.3.4 The comprehensiveness of the l i s t of preferences is larg ely a m atter of tax policy. New Zealand tax policy has been to elim inate e x p lic it preferences. This may suggest a re la tiv e ly extensive l is t, though m ateria lity and compliance co sts must be taken in to account. 2.3.5 A number of subm issions argue th a t the claw back of foreign tax preferences would be in co n sisten t w ith a number of New Z ealand's tax tre a tie s which include tax sparing prov isio n s. These provisions generally apply only to branches of New Zealand 23 companies in the tax tre a ty country and, since foreign branches are not affected by the present reform s, tax sparing would not be withdrawn or dim inished. We are sa tisfie d th a t the BE regime does not breach a tax tre a ty o b lig atio n . The tax sparing provisions were, however, entered in to before the in tro d u ctio n of the present proposals and may now appear to be in co n sisten t w ith the th ru st of the reform s. Recommendation 2.3.6 The Committee th e r e fo r e recommends th a t: a r e s id e n ts be exempt from th e BE regim e in r e sp e c t o f in t e r e s t s in com panies which are: i r e sid e n t fo r ta x purposes in c e r ta in l i s t e d c o u n tr ie s w ith com prehensive in te r n a tio n a l ta x regim es in c lu d in g CFC regim es ( i . e . t h e U n ited S ta te s , th e U nited Kingdom, West Germany, Canada, France and Japan) or A u str a lia ; and b i i do n o t b e n e fit from s p e c ifie d s ig n if ic a n t ta x p re fe re n c e s in th o se c o u n tr ie s such a s a c c e le r a te d c a p ita l w r ite - o f f s or th e exem ption o f c e r ta in fo r e ig n -so u r c e incom e.

The two main d ifferen ces between the regime proposed by the Committee and CFC regim es elsew here are th a t: a other CFC regim es generally make a d istin c tio n between so -called "active" and "passive" income. The la tte r is generally regarded as in te rn atio n ally "mobile" income such as in te re s t, dividends, ro y a ltie s and re la te d party sales and service income; b in some cases, the CFC regim es are to some ex ten t targ eted on tax haven CFCs. The United S tates and Canada do not, however, ta rg e t tax havens in th is way. 2.4.2 The a r tif ic ia lity of the d istin c tio n between activ e and passive income is b est illu s tra te d in the case of shares. A share p o rtfo lio of, say, one percent stakes in 100 companies is regarded as a passive investm ent even though each company may its e lf be an activ e business. Conversely, a 100 percent holding 25 in a sin g le company is regarded as a d ire c t or activ e investm ent. In the f ir s t case, an in te re s t is held in 100 activ e businesses. In the second case, an in te re s t is held in one activ e business. In both cases, the income of the shareholder co n sists of dividends and c a p ita l gain on the shares. Though these investm ents may d iffe r in other resp ects, both are u ltim ately investm ents in activ e businesses. Thus, th ere are boundary problems in d istin g u ish in g between activ e and passive investm ents. 2.4.3 Another problem w ith the activ e/p assiv e income d istin c tio n a rise s w ith c ertain classes of income. For example, in te re s t income is regarded as activ e business income when i t is earned by a fin an cial in s titu tio n but passive income when derived by other businesses. If the regime employed th is d istin c tio n , banks could sh e lte r in te re st income w hile other businesses would reorganise them selves in an attem pt to resem ble banks or they would e sta b lish finance su b sid iaries which were d iffic u lt to d istin g u ish from banks. This problem has forced the U nited S tates to include w ithin its d e fin itio n of CFC ( i.e , subpart F) income dividends, in te re s t and rea lised gains from the d isp o sitio n of shares and other se c u ritie s, reg ard less of the nature of the business deriving them. For sim ilar reasons, subpart F income now includes income from the insurance of risk s outside the in su re r's country of incorporation. 2.4.4 F in ally , the advantages of low tax ra te s and tax preferences are the same whether they apply to activ e or to passive income. In view of these considerations, the Committee considers th a t th ere is no m erit in d istin g u ish in g between d iffe re n t classes of income. 26 2.4.5 The argument fo r targ etin g the BE regime on tax haven CFCs is th a t these are the major avoidance v eh icles. There are, however, several problems w ith th is approach. The f ir s t is th a t th ere are d e fin itio n a l problem s. A country which is norm ally regarded as a high tax country may in p ractice be a tax haven for c ertain types of investm ent. An example was the U nited Kingdom in respect of m anufacturing a c tiv ity before i t commenced to phase out immediate c a p ita l w rite-o ffs in 1984. The e ffe c t of the c a p ita l w rite-o ffs was generally to elim inate the tax lia b ilitie s of m anufacturing businesses in the United Kingdom. I f th is had been achieved by abolishing income tax on m anufacturing, the United Kingdom would have been regarded as a tax haven fo r th is type of business. Thus, the existence of tax preferences removes any c le a r d istin c tio n between a tax haven and a non-tax haven. 2.4.6 The more general argument is th a t, from an a n ti-d e fe rra l p erspective, th ere is no difference between these two types of ju risd ic tio n . O ffshore income derived by resid en t companies th a t is u ltim ately taxable in New Zealand is foreign income net of foreign tax es. (Where foreign income is earned d ire c tly by an in d iv id u al, a c re d it is given fo r foreign tax es). I t does not m atter whether the income is sourced in a low- or high-tax ju risd ic tio n , the d e fe rral b en efit is the same. The CD does not, however, propose the complete elim ination of tax d e fe rral by perm itting companies only a deduction for foreign tax in the calcu latio n of a th e ir tax lia b ility on BE regime. Instead, a c re d it w ill be given, though th is is clawed back when the income is d istrib u te d . Thus, in the context of the CD proposals, New Zealand tax lia b ilitie s under the BE regime w ill depend on whether the foreign company is resid en t in a high- or low -tax ju risd ic tio n . For th is reason, the Committee advocates the adoption of a grey l i s t as outlined in section 2.3. 27 2.4.7 On a p ra c tic a l lev el, th ere would be obvious d iffic u ltie s w ith the a lte rn a tiv e approach of targ e tin g the regime on companies resid en t in lis te d tax havens. The l i s t would never be up to date and would probably exclude apparently high tax countries which nevertheless had sig n ific a n t tax preferences. For th is reason, no country except Japan bases its CFC regime on a form erly published tax haven l i s t . (The Committee does propose a d istin c tio n between tax havens and other countries as p a rt of its recommended tra n sitio n a l provisions but in th is case, a need fo r exhaustive coverage and updating does not a r is e .) 2 .5 D ividends R eceived by a C on tro lled Company, L o sses and F oreign Tax C red its 2.5.1 BE income w ill be calculated according to New Zealand tax law. A number of special ru les w ill, however, be required in respect of dividends received by a controlled company, BE lo sses and the calcu latio n of the amount of foreign tax to be cred ited against the New Zealand tax lia b ility on BE income. The Committee has had tim e to give only prelim inary consideration to these issues but we se t out below our current thinking. 2.5.2 The tax treatm ent of dividends received by a co n tro lled foreign company needs to m irror th e ir treatm ent in the hands of its resid en t shareholders. If th is were not the case, i t would be easy to avoid the dom estic ru les by trapping dividends in a non-resident v eh icle. There would then be l i t t l e p oint in changing the dom estic ru les. Thus, p o rtfo lio dividends received by a co n tro lled non-resident company should be assessable to both corporate and non-corporate resid en t non-minor shareholders. 28 N on-portfolio dividends received by the co ntrolled company should also be assessable to a non-corporate non-minor shareholder but a corporate non-minor shareholder would be subject to the proposed w ithholding payment system if the proposed dom estic tax ru le s applied to the calcu latio n of the BE income. In order to avoid the m ultiple levying of tax on dividends, i t would be necessary in the case of both corporate and non-corporate non-minor shareholders to exclude dividends received by a co n tro lled company from another company in re la tio n to which the taxpayer is also a non-minor shareholder. 2.5.3 This treatm ent would, however, be sim plified if a ll dividends received by a co ntrolled company, other than those received from another company in respect of which the taxpayer is a non-minor shareholder, were made assessable. I t would then not be necessary fo r a corporate shareholder to keep separate account of p o rtfo lio and non-portfolio dividends. 2.5.4 The BE regime its e lf and the proposed changes to the treatm ent of dividends received by companies have im plications for the d e d u c tib ility of in te re st on money borrowed by a company to acquire shares in non-resident companies. The d e d u c tib ility of in te re s t expense re la tin g to foreign investm ents would also be affected by in te rju risd ic tio n a l allo catio n ru les. I t would th erefo re be d esirab le to review the current provisions re la tin g to in te re s t d e d u c tib ility in the context of the consideration of a llo catio n ru les. 2.5.6 The treatm ent of BE losses was one of the most contentious issues raised in subm issions. The CD proposed th a t BE losses (which would be computed according to New Zealand tax rules) be "ring-fenced" to the BE regim e. That is , lo sses would be able to be o ffse t against any BE income of a taxpayer, but not 29 against non-BE taxable income (i.e New Zealand- and fo reig n - source income taxable under current law ). Any excess BE lo ss not able to be o ffse t against BE income in the current year would be carried forward fo r o ffse t against BE income in futu re income y ears. 2.5.7 Subm issions were opposed to any ring-fencing of BE losses and generally called fo r u n restric te d pooling of lo sses w ith a tax p ay er's other taxable income. The u n re stric te d o ffse t of BE lo sses would, however, lead to a decidedly asymmetric re su lt as fa r as the New Zealand tax base was concerned. When a taxpayer derived a BE p ro fit but the foreign tax paid by the co ntrolled company was a t le a st equal to the New Zealand tax lia b ility on the BE income, no New Zealand tax would be co llected . If, once the co ntrolled company made a lo ss, the lo ss could be o ffse t against other New Zealand taxable income, the ov erall re s u lt would be to dim inish the New Zealand tax base. Sim ilar problems a rise now w ith actual branches. There is no point in implementing a regime which would fu rth er erode the present tax base. 2.5.8 Another problem would a rise if taxpayers could acquire BE tax lo sses (by obtaining an in te re s t in non-resident companies which were in tax lo ss under New Zealand rules) to sh e lte r BE income in low tax ju risd ic tio n s. A nti-avoidance ru les could cope w ith th is to some extent but such ru les have th e ir own d eficen cies. 2.5.9 C onsiderations such as these suggest th a t the CD proposals w ill need to be tightened rath er than relaxed. At one extrem e, BE losses could be ring-fenced to the offshore e n tity fo r each taxpayer. This may, however, be im practicable sin ce, where control e x ists, taxpayers w ill generally have some 30 d isc retio n to s h ift taxable income between d iffe re n t co n tro lled companies, p a rtic u la rly where they are resid en t in the same country. Thus, a fu rth er p o ssib ility would be to allow the grouping of p ro fits and losses among e n titie s w ithin the same tax ju risd ic tio n . The Committee w ill rep o rt fu rth er on th is issu e. 2.5.10 The ru les fo r cred itin g foreign taxes need to be in teg rated w ith those applying to lo sses. The CD proposed th a t c re d its be lim ited on an e n tity by e n tity and a source of income b a sis. We have yet to discuss the appropriate ru les fo r foreign tax c re d its. 2.5.11 Some fu rth er discussion of various aspects of the BE regime is contained in Annex 2. 31 CHAPTER 3 – FOREIGN INVESTMENT FUNDS 3 .1 . Avoidance Problem s: Need fo r an A lte r n a tiv e Regime 3.1.1 I f , as recommended by the Committee, the BE regime applied only to the non-minor shareholders of co n tro lled foreign companies, the types of offshore investm ent outside the regime would be: a minor or non-controlling shareholdings in companies resid en t in high tax ju risd ic tio n s; b minor or non-controlling shareholdings in companies resid en t in low tax ju risd ic tio n s ("tax havens"); and c in te re s ts in investm ent com panies,unit tru s ts , mutual funds and sim ilar e n titie s , which c o lle c tiv e ly may be referred to as "foreign funds". 3.1.2 The CD proposes th a t the CV regime should apply to a ll of these types of investm ent. In the lig h t of the concerns about the CV regime outlined in chapter 1, the Committee considers th a t i t could be ju s tifie d now only where th ere is a serious avoidance problem th a t e x ists or can reasonably be expected to develop. O utside th a t area and CFCs, the tax atio n of the gains, other than dividends, th a t resid en ts derive from offshore investm ents should aw ait the introduction of a general c a p ita l gains tax . 3.1.3 In the Com mittee's view, minor or non-controlling shareholdings in companies resid en t outside tax havens c le a rly fa ll in the category of investm ents th a t are b est taxed under a c a p ita l gains tax . These companies cannot be used by the investor to erode the New Zealand tax base and the most im portant 32 of them, publicly lis te d companies, generally d istrib u te a su b sta n tia l proportion of th e ir income as dividends which are already taxed or w ill su ffer a sim ilar impost under the Government's new proposals. 3.1.4 Minor or non-controlling shareholdings in tax haven companies are a possible source of concern. The m ajority of problem cases w ill, however, be passive investm ent vehicles which would fa ll in to the foreign investm ent fund regime discussed in section 3.3. 3.1.5 O ffshore funds, esp ecially those located in tax havens, are c le arly the biggest avoidance problem. The Committee th erefo re favours the introduction of a foreign investm ent fund regime targ eted a t investm ent vehicles which confer sig n ific a n t tax b e n efits, such as u n it tru s ts based in tax havens. 3 .2 Coverage o f th e Regime 3.2.1 In summary, the two building blocks of the Com mittee's proposals fo r companies would be: a the BE regime to apply to co ntrolled foreign companies which do not meet the grey l i s t te s t outlined in chapter 2; and b a foreign investm ent fund regime to apply to investm ent v e h ic le s. 3.2.2 Between these two types of investm ent, no regime would apply. Three arguments have been advanced fo r a regime which applies to a ll foreign investm ents. The f ir s t is th a t complete coverage is needed to catch taxpayers who have control of an 33 foreign company but manage to avoid the control te s t. The response in other countries to vehicles which side step the control te s t has been to introduce an offshore fund regim e. We would sim ilarly expect th a t many of these non-controlled vehicles would fa ll in to the foreign investm ent fund regime proposed by the Committee. With a comprehensive d e fin itio n of control and a wide foreign investm ent fund d e fin itio n , the rem ainder of the problem does not ju s tify the adm inistration and compliance costs of a fu lly comprehensive regim e. We would also note th a t most companies find re a l m inority in te re sts disadvantagous. M inority in te re sts w ill be a ll the more u n a ttrac tiv e as a re su lt of these reform s since a su b stan tial though m inority shareholder in a non- resid en t company could be tipped in to the BE regime by the purchase of a possibly sm all in te re s t in the company by another New Zealand resid en t. 3.2.3 The second argument fo r comprehensive coverage is th a t a CV or comparable regime is needed to discourage resid en t companies from "going offshore", by penalising th e ir New Zealand resid en t shareholders. By going offshore i t is meant th a t a New Zealand company would e stab lish a non-resident holding company which would own its New Zealand and foreign su b sid ia rie s. No New Zealand company would then own foreign a sse ts. Thus, the corporate group would avoid the in tern atio n al regim e. Under the CD proposals, however, the resid en t shareholders in the foreign company would f a ll in to the re la tiv e ly draconian CV regim e, thereby discouraging such restu ctu rin g . 3.2.4 I t is obvious th a t th is restru c tu rin g does not re su lt in a s h ift of physical assets out of New Zealand. In addition, the resid en t shareholders end up in no b e tte r p o sitio n than resid en ts who own shares in what are now non-resident companies. Furtherm ore, the tax advantages are not one-sided since the restru ctu red company would lose the a b ility to pass im putation 34 c re d its fo r New Zealand tax paid through to its resid en t shareholders. In addition, non-resident dividend w ithholding tax on dividends paid out of New Zealand and dividend w ithholding payment on incoming dividends might also be incurred. Moreover, th ere are commercial co n strain ts on th is process since, a t the end of the day, New Zealand companies are dependent on New Zealand shareholders for th e ir equity base and need to m aintain good relatio n sh ip s w ith them. The Committee th erefo re considers th a t the second argument is not su ffic ie n t to w arrant a fu lly comprehensive regime a t th is stage. 3.2.5 The th ird argument is th a t a comprehensive regime would extend the tax base and perm it a fu rth er reduction in tax ra te s. If revenue were the objective, however, i t would be necessary to evaluate a lte rn a tiv e sources which might b e tte r meet the efficien cy , equity and sim p licity objectives of tax reform . As argued elsew here, the Committee considers th a t the tax atio n of foreign equity investm ents outside tax havens is b est le f t to a c a p ita l gains tax regime and could not be advanced now w ithout a rea l cost in taxpayer a ttitu d e s towards voluntary com pliance. 3.2.6 The Committee th erefo re concludes th a t there is in su ffic ie n t ju s tific a tio n for a fu lly comprehensive regime a t th is stage. If a problem emerges, ad d itio n al measures could be considered. In order to m onitor developments and encourage com pliance, i t is d esirab le to have comprehensive d isclosure requirem ents. For example, a ll taxpayers could be required to d isclo se offshore in te re sts th a t fa ll outside the BE and foreign fund investm ent regim es. This would enable the Inland Revenue Department to request fu rth er inform ation where necessary and hence keep abreast of responses to the new m easures. We consider th a t the approach of aiming to define the extent of the problem, if any, resu ltin g from incom plete coverage is p referab le to implementing an across-the-board regime now. 35 Recommendation 3.2.7 The Committee th e r e fo r e recommends th a t th e CV regim e apply o n ly t o in t e r e s t s in fo r e ig n in vestm en t fun ds, a s d isc u sse d in s e c tio n 3 .3 . 3 .3 F oreign Investm ent Fund Regime 3.3.1 The d e fin itio n of a foreign investm ent fund can p o te n tia lly be very wide. The regime should be targ eted a t non- resid en t e n titie s which provide sig n ific a n t tax advantages compared w ith comparable e n titie s in New Zealand. This is the case when the income of the e n tity is untaxed or only lig h tly taxed compared w ith the tax th a t would be levied on such income in New Zealand. For example, a u n it tru s t based in a tax haven which in v ests in debt se c u ritie s would o ffer sig n ific a n t tax advantages to New Zealand investors compared w ith an id en tica l u n it tru s t in New Zealand. A u n it tru s t investing exclusively in shares, however, o ffers tax advantages only to the extent th a t i t perm its dividend income to be converted in to c a p ita l gain. A d iv e rsifie d foreign investm ent fund w ill, however, ty p ic a lly own non-controlling in te re s ts in companies, debt instrum ents and other investm ents. 3.3.2 The other ta rg e ts of the foreign fund regime are e n titie s which s lip outside the BE regime because they provide tax b en efits which do not depend on co n tro l. This w ill generally be feasib le among non-associated persons only when th ere are w ell-defined means of purchasing and disposing of in te re sts and reg u larly quoted p rices fo r them so th a t members can m onitor fund perform ance. Thus, such funds w ill ty p ic a lly be lis te d on a stock exchange or have redem ption arrangem ents under which 36 investors can s e ll th e ir in te re sts to the fund manager a t a price based on the net assets of the fund. 3.3.3 In order to address the tax advantages offered by these types of fund, the Committee favours a regime based on the Canadian one. According to Canadian tax p ra c titio n e rs, th is has larg ely elim inated the m arketing of tax haven funds in Canada. The key c rite ria fo r the application of the regime would be th a t: a the fund (which would include any legal en tity ) derives its income or value prim arily or su b sta n tia lly from holding or trading in p o rtfo lio investm ents in shares, investm ents in debt instrum ents, re a l property, commodities, royalty agreem ents, e tc ; and b the e ffe c t of the residence of the e n tity fo r tax purposes and its d istrib u tio n policy is to reduce the tax payable on the income of the e n tity below what i t would be had the income been taxed in New Zealand as i t was derived. 3.3.4 We would define a "p o rtfo lio investm ent" as a non- co n tro llin g in te re s t where the investor has no sig n ific a n t influence over the investee. The term is incorporated in the foreign investm ent fund d e fin itio n not because we believe th a t th ere are p a rtic u la r tax advantages in holding shares in foreign funds (apart from the d eferral or avoidance of tax on dividends) but because such investm ents are c h a ra c te ristic of the type of fund we have in mind. 3.3.5 An e ffe c t te s t such as th a t outlined in (b) is to some extent subjective but i t is necessary to ta rg e t the regime on e n titie s in low tax countries. Taxpayer compliance would be encouraged by comprehensive disclosure requirem ents. 37 3.3.6 Canada taxes resid en ts on the b asis of a prescribed ra te of in te re s t applied to the amount of th e ir investm ent in such funds. Because th ere w ill usually be a quoted p rice for in te re sts in such funds which re fle c ts the underlying income they accum ulate, the Committee considers th a t the CV regime could apply to such investm ents. Thus, the inv esto r would be taxed on the d ifferen ce between the market p rice of the in te re s t a t the end of the income year and the equivalent value a t the beginning of the year, plus any d istrib u tio n s received during the year. Where a taxpayer was subject to both the BE and offshore fund regim es, the former should apply. 3.3.7 I t may be necessary to include an anti-avoidance ru le aimed a t e n titie s which are in substance foreign investm ent funds but which are stru ctu red to avoid the regim e. Further comment on the Com m ittee's recommended regime for foreign investm ent funds is provided in Annex 3. Recommendation 3 .3 .8 The Committee th e r e fo r e recommends th a t: a in a d d itio n to th e BE regim e, th e r e be a fo r e ig n in vestm en t fund regim e to apply to in t e r e s t s in e n t i t ie s which: i d e r iv e t h e ir income or v a lu e p rim a rily or s u b s ta n tia lly from h o ld in g or tra d in g p o r t f o lio in vestm en ts in sh a re s, in vestm en ts in debt in stru m en ts, r e a l p ro p erty , com m odities, e tc ; and 38 i i th e e f f e c t o f th e r e sid e n c e o f th e e n t it y fo r ta x purposes and i t s d is tr ib u tio n p o lic y i s to reduce th e ta x payable on th e income o f th e e n t it y below what i t would be had th e income been taxed in New Zealand a s i f i t were d eriv ed by th e in v e sto r ; b th e ta x a b le income d eriv ed by a r e sid e n t from an in t e r e s t in a fo r e ig n investm en t fund be c a lc u la te d as th e in c r e a se in th e market v a lu e o f th e in t e r e s t over th e income y ea r, p lu s any d is tr ib u tio n s r e c e iv a b le ; and c where an in t e r e s t in a n o n -re sid e n t e n t it y f a l l s w ith in both th e BE and fo r e ig n in vestm en t fund reg im es, th e BE regim e ap p ly. 39 CHAPTER 4 – TREATMENT OF DIVIDENDS 4 .1 Corporate R e cip ie n t 4.1.1 The CD d istin g u ish es between "p o rtfo lio " and "non- p o rtfo lio " dividends received by a resid en t company from a non- resid en t company. P o rtfo lio dividends are defined to be dividends received by a resid en t company from a non-resident company in which the resid en t owns le ss than 10 percent of the paid-up share c a p ita l. A ll other foreign dividends received by a resid en t company are defined to be non-portfolio dividends. 4.1.2 The CD proposes th a t p o rtfo lio dividends be assessab le to companies in accordance w ith general in te rn atio n al p ra c tic e . N on-portfolio dividends are to be subject to a w ithholding payment system , as outlined in the Government Economic Statem ent of 17 December 1987. The w ithholding payment system does not come d ire c tly w ithin the Committee's term s of reference but i t is necessary to consider i t in order to in te g rate the tax atio n of dividends w ith the tax atio n of u n d istrib u ted income under the BE regim e. The treatm ent of dividends received by a co n tro lled company fo r the purposes of calcu latin g BE income was discussed in section 2.5. 4.1.3 A number of subm issions called fo r the rete n tio n of the ex istin g dividend exemption for companies. Other subm issions took the view th a t dividends should be assessable to a company only if c re d it were given for both foreign w ithholding tax and the underlying foreign company tax. A number of other co u n tries have such a system in respect of non-portfolio dividends, including the United S tates, the United Kingdom and A u stralia. 40 While c re d it for foreign taxes may be allowed a t the corporate lev el, no country passes c re d its fo r foreign taxes through to non-corporate or individual shareholders. In th is resp ect, the proposal to allow c re d its for non-resident dividend w ithholding tax to pass through to individuals under the New Zealand im putation system goes fu rth er, as fa r as we are aware, than any other country. Thus, a ll countries u ltim ately claw back c re d its given to companies fo r underlying foreign company tax . This is not su rp risin g since the revenue consequences of perm itting c re d its to flow through to individual shareholders could be su b sta n tia l. 4.1.4 I f c re d its fo r foreign taxes do not pass through to individual shareholders, they are allowed to them in e ffe c t as a deduction from assessable income. Under the proposed w ithholding payment system , the conversion to a deduction system w ill be advanced from the ultim ate individual rec ip ie n t to the f ir s t corporate re c ip ie n t of a foreign dividend. This is very much the objective of the w ithholding payment system and i t would be incom patible w ith i t to allow the corporate dividend re c ip ie n t a c re d it fo r underlying foreign company tax . Foreign tax c re d it systems are also extrem ely complex, as the United S tates and Canadian system s illu s tra te , and inherently a rb itra ry because of the p ra c tic a l d iffic u lty of tracin g foreign dividends through tim e and among d iffe re n t companies. The Committee th erefo re considers th a t i t would not be feasib le from a compliance or adm inistrative point of view to introduce a foreign tax c re d it system fo r in terco rp o rate dividends, a t le a st in the cu rren t co n tex t. 4.1.5 Submissions also questioned the need for a separate w ithholding payment system for non-portfolio dividends. I t would undoubtedly be sim pler to make a ll foreign dividends assessable 41 to a corporate rec ip ie n t but th is would not be co n sisten t w ith a number of New Z ealand's tax tre a ty o b lig atio n s. 4.1.6 One of the d ifferen ces between taxing such dividends and the proposed w ithholding payment system is th a t a company in tax lo ss receiving foreign dividends would not incur any tax lia b ility if the dividends were assessable but would incur the w ithholding payment. This problem could be overcome by allow ing a company in tax lo ss to o ffse t the dividend against its lo ss. Thus, the lo ss would reduce by the amount of the gross dividend (i.e . the dividend received plus any foreign w ithholding ta x ), thereby extinguishing the w ithholding payment lia b ility . 4.1.7 In order to avoid taxing foreign-source income tw ice, once as BE income and again on rec eip t, the CD proposes th a t, in calcu latin g BE income, taxpayers be able to deduct any dividends received from the foreign company concerned. We consider th a t th ere are serious problems w ith th is deduction system . For example, a company which had a BE loss in the year i t received a dividend would obtain no re lie f from double tax atio n . There are p o te n tia lly many tim ing differences between New Z ealand's and other co u n tries' tax ru les which could lead to th is re s u lt. 4.1.8 In order to avoid these problem s, in p rin cip le a separate account needs to be kept of tax paid on BE income. When a resid en t receives a dividend from a controlled company, the tax (or w ithholding payment) lia b ility on the dividend would be o ffse t in whole or in p a rt according to the balance of the tax paid in the sp ecial account. In p ractice, for resid en t companies, the Im putation C redit Account ("ICA") proposed fo r the im putation system can perform ju st th is function so th a t a separate account is not necessary. 42 4.1.9 The Committee propose to d e ta il its recommendations on the in teg ratio n of the in te rn a tio n a l, im putation and w ithholding payment regim es in P art 2 of th is rep o rt and in our rep o rt on the im putation proposals. 4 .2 Non-Corporate R ecip ien t 4.2.1 For the same purpose of avoiding the double tax atio n of offshore income, i t would be necessary to require in dividual and other non-corporate non-minor shareholders to keep the equivalent of an ICA. We w ill also rep o rt fu rth er on th is aspect in P art 2 of th is rep o rt and our rep o rt on full im putation. 43 CHAPTER 5 – TRUSTS 5 .1 In tro d u ctio n 5.1.1 In th is chapter we comment on the future regime fo r tru s ts (which also has im plications for ex istin g tr u s ts ) . By ex istin g tru s ts , we mean settlem ents made before 17 December 1987. The treatm ent of these tru s ts , and the tra n s itio n to the proposed new regim e, is d e alt w ith in chapter 7. 5 .2 . T rust Income 5.2.1 The in tern atio n al tax reform s cannot be fu lly e ffe c tiv e unless th ere is a regime to apply to tru s ts since, in many cases, a tru s t can su b stitu te for a company. The CD tre a ts "foreign tru sts" (i.e . those w ith non-resident tru stee s) in a sim ilar manner to foreign companies. Since th ere is no resid en t tru ste e and the b e n eficiarie s may not be id e n tifie d , the CD proposes th a t resid en t s e ttlo rs be lia b le fo r tax on tru s te e 's income. This approach ignores the leg al relatio n sh ip s between a s e ttlo r and a tru ste e since the former has no rig h t to the income of the tru s t. Indeed, the whole point of a tru s t is to ensure th a t property and the income i t produces is leg ally divested by a s e ttlo r. In re a lity , however, a s e ttlo r often has su b sta n tia l influence over the tru ste e , usually on an inform al b asis though th ere may be sp ecific provision in the tru s t deed and, in p ractice if not in law, may be able to wind up the tru s t and take back the property. Thus, the economic substance of a tru s t may d iffe r from its leg al appearance. 44 5.2.2 In order to meet the objectives of the in te rn atio n al reform s, tru s t income derived by non-resident tru ste e s of tru s ts se ttle d by New Zealand resid en ts must be taxed each year as i t is earned. Ignoring enforcem ent problem s, the b est course would be to tax the income in the hands of the tru ste e as i f he or she were a resid en t. Where the tru ste e did not comply, th ere would be l i t t l e a lte rn a tiv e but to tax the resid en t s e ttlo r since th ere may be no id e n tifia b le resid en t b e n e fic ia rie s. In the f ir s t instance, however, the legal lia b ility fo r the tax should be placed on the tru ste e . This could be achieved by defining tru s ts w ith resid en t s e ttlo rs to be New Zealand resid en ts fo r tax purposes. The tru s t would then be lia b le fo r New Zealand tax on its foreign- and New Zealand- source income in the same way as other resid en ts. Where a non-resident tru ste e defaulted on the lia b ility , the resid en t s e ttlo r would be lia b le as the agent of the tru ste e . I t would be necessary to define a tru s t settlem ent w idely to include settlem ents made in d ire c tly through nominees or asso ciates and a ll d isp o sitio n s of property to a tru s t made fo r le ss than fu ll consideration. 5.2.3 The Committee th erefo re supports the basic approach of the CD. This clo sely follow s the grantor tru s t provisions in the United S tates. This regime would, however, be u n ju stifia b ly severe if i t applied to a ll ex istin g tru s ts since s e ttlo rs w ill usually be unable to a lte r th e ir s e ttlo r sta tu s and, furtherm ore, d istrib u tio n requirem ents and tru s te e s ' powers are com paratively in fle x ib le . Hence, we recommend more generous tra n s itio n a l provisions fo r tru s ts than for companies. 5.2.4 The concept of the residence of a tru s t could also apply to ex istin g tru s ts . As w ith future tru s ts , residence would be determ ined by the residence of the s e ttlo r. Where th ere was: 45 a a resid en t s e ttlo r and a resid en t tru s te e , the tru ste e would be lia b le fo r tax on tru s t income, w hether sourced in New Zealand or elsew here, as a t presen t; b a resid en t s e ttlo r and a non-resident tru s te e , the tru ste e would be lia b le for tax on tru s t income, as in (a ), but in the event of d efau lt, the s e ttlo r would be lia b le ; c no resid en t s e ttlo r but a resid en t tru s te e , the tru ste e would be lia b le for tax on the tr u s t's New Zealand- source income as would be the case w ith any o th er non- resid en t. If, however, the tru s t had no New Zealand- source income, the tru ste e would have no New Zealand tax lia b ility . 5.2.5 One consequence of th is approach would be th a t New Zealand would not tax the foreign-source tru s t income of a resid en t who was the tru ste e of a tru s t w ith a non-resident s e ttlo r. In our view, th is is the appropriate treatm ent since such income has no d e fin ite connection w ith New Zealand ap art from the existence here of the tru s t adm inistrator (who w ill, however, have no b en eficial in te re s t in the incom e). B en eficiaries may be resid en t here, but th e ir in te re s ts do not m aterialise u n til th ere is a d istrib u tio n or v estin g . This makes i t in fea sib le to tax b en eficiarie s on tru s t income. R esident b e n eficiarie s should, however, be taxed on any tru s t income which is d istrib u te d to or vested in them, as discussed in the next subsection. This leaves only the resid en t tru ste e to tax but, if th a t were done, he or she would of course resign in favour of a non-resident tru ste e . Thus, we believe there is l i t t l e to be gained from attem pting to tax foreign-source income derived by resid en t tru ste e s of non-resident tru s ts . 46 5.2.6 The adoption of th is tru s t residence ru le would remove some am biguities in the tax atio n of ex istin g tru s ts . There may be other consequential changes to the current treatm ent of tru s ts th a t w ill need to be addressed when the Committee considers the d ra ft le g isla tio n dealing w ith tru s ts . 5 .3 D istr ib u tio n s From R esid en t T ru sts 5.3.1 D istrib u tio n s to b en eficiarie s from resid en t tru s ts (as defined in the previous section) made out of tru s t income (i.e . income which has been taxed as assessable income in the hands of the tru ste e or the resid en t se ttlo r) should be exempt from tax since they w ill have already borne the appropriate amount of New Zealand tax. 5.3.2 Where a d istrib u tio n from a resid en t tru s t is not made out of tru s t income, i t should continue to be assessable or exempt to the b eneficiary as under the present ru le s, except in the situ a tio n d e alt w ith in paragraph 7.2.4. 5 .4 D istr ib u tio n s From N on-R esident T ru sts 5.4.1 There are d eficien cies in the present tax treatm ent of tru s t d istrib u tio n s received by resid en t b e n eficiarie s from non- resid en t tru s ts (i.e those w ith no resid en t s e ttlo r ) . Case law supports the view th a t if tru s t income has been taxed in the hands of the non-resident tru ste e , i t is not assessable a second tim e in the hands of the beneficiary. If, however, the tru ste e has not paid tax on th a t income, the treatm ent of the d istrib u tio n in the hands of the b eneficiary is unclear. 47 5.4.2 This u n satisfacto ry am biguity should be resolved by amending the law to make i t c le a r th a t resid en t b e n eficiarie s w ill be assessable on a ll income d istrib u tio n s received from non- resid en t tru s ts . A c re d it should be given fo r any foreign or New Zealand tax paid by the tru ste e on the income out of which the d istrib u tio n is made. This would n ecessitate the tru ste e keeping records of the income of the tru s t and the tax paid, but the onus for estab lish in g th a t a c re d it should be given can be placed on the b en eficiary . 5.4.3 The tru s t regime should m irror the tax atio n of individuals since individuals are u ltim ately the b e n e fic ia rie s of tru s t income. Since c a p ita l gains w ill norm ally be exempt in the hands of resid en t in d iv id u als, c ap ita l p ro fits , as defined in New Zealand tax term s, d istrib u te d to b e n eficiarie s should also be exempt in th e ir hands. S im ilarly, a d istrib u tio n of the corpus (i.e . the o rig in al c ap ita l se ttle d plus a ll ad d itio n al settlem ents) of the tru s t should not be assessable to a beneficiary. 5.4.4 Further elaboration of the Com m ittee's views on tru s ts is contained in Annex 4. Our recommendations on tra n sitio n a l provisions re la tin g to ex istin g tru s ts are outlined in chapter 7. Recommendation 5.4.5 The Committee recommends t h a t , in r e sp e c t o f fu tu re t r u s t se ttle m e n ts: a a s e t t lo r be w id ely d efin ed a s any person who d ir e c t ly or in d ir e c t ly p ro v id es money, goods, s e r v ic e s or o th er b e n e f it s to a t r u s t fo r inadequate c o n sid e r a tio n ; 48 b a t r u s t be tr e a te d a s a r e s id e n t o f New Zealand fo r income ta x purposes i f th e s e t t lo r o f th e t r u s t i s a New Zealand r e sid e n t; c th e tr u s te e o f a r e sid e n t t r u s t be p rim a rily l i a b l e fo r ta x on t r u s t income b u t, in th e ev en t o f th e tr u s te e d e fa u ltin g on such a l i a b i l i t y , th e s e t t lo r be l i a b l e a s agen t o f th e tr u s te e ; d d is tr ib u tio n s o f t r u s t income ( i . e . income w hich has been ta x ed in th e hands o f th e tr u s te e or th e r e s id e n t s e t t lo r ) t o a b e n e fic ia r y from a r e s id e n t t r u s t be exempt from ta x in th e b e n e fic ia r y 's hands; e a l l d is tr ib u tio n s o f income to a b e n e fic ia r y from a non- r e s id e n t t r u s t be ta x a b le in th e hands o f th e b e n e fic ia r y , but th e b e n e fic ia r y be allow ed a c r e d it fo r any fo r e ig n or New Zealand ta x p aid by th e tr u s t e e ; and f d is tr ib u tio n s o f c a p ita l p r o f it s a s d e fin e d in New Zealand ta x term s or th e corpus to a r e sid e n t b e n e fic ia r y from a n o n -re sid e n t t r u s t be exempt from ta x in th e hands o f th e b e n e fic ia r y . 49 CHAPTER 6 – DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS AND PENALTIES 6 .1 D isc lo su r e Requirem ents and P e n a ltie s 6.1.1 The objective of inform ation d isclo su re is tw ofold. F irst, i t provides the Inland Revenue Department w ith the base data necessary to adm inister the tax system . Secondly, i t encourages taxpayers to comply w ith the law since they commit an offence if they f a il to provide the inform ation requested. New Zealand req u ires a much lower level of d isclo su re than co u n tries such as A u stralia, the United S tates and the U nited Kingdom. Furtherm ore, our p en alties fo r non-com pliance are g enerally lig h te r than those applying in these co u n tries. A com bination of minimal d isclo su re and low p en alties reduces compliance and makes enforcem ent more d iffic u lt. 6.1.2 Both of these m atters need to be addressed in the context of the in te rn atio n al tax reform s. The Department w ill be dependent in the f ir s t instance on the inform ation provided by taxpayers. The objective of disclosure is not to obtain exhaustive inform ation from every taxpayer. That would m erely swamp the Department and impose unnecessary compliance co sts on taxpayers. R ather, a t the f ir s t level of d isclo su re, a sm all number of key questions should be asked of a ll taxpayers. This enables the Department to id en tify those taxpayers who should then be required to provide fu lle r d isclo su re. 6.1.3 The Committee w ill comment fu rth er on disclo su re requirem ents and p en alties in the context of the present reform s in P art 2 of its rep o rt. 50 CHAPTER 7 – TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS 7 .1 Branch E q u ivalen t Regime 7.1.1 The CD proposes no tra n s itio n a l arrangem ents ap art from the d efe rral of the im plem entation date of the BE and CV regim es u n til 1 A pril 1988. A number of subm issions argue fo r com plete exemption of investm ents entered in to before the announcement of the regime and you w ill be aware of the general argum ents made against retro sp ectiv e tax changes. The Committee considers th a t complete "grandfathering" can seldom be ju s tifie d since commercial decisions do not assume th a t the tax system applying when they are made w ill continue in d e fin ite ly . N evertheless, we consider th a t a reasonable period of adjustm ent is necessary in order to give taxpayers tim e to restru c tu re th e ir a ffa irs and gear up to comply w ith the regim e. There has, however, been fa ir warning of the Government's in ten tio n to address tax haven avoidance. 7.1.2 To th is end, we recommend th a t resid en ts be exempt from the BE regime u n til 1 A pril 1990 in respect of in te re s ts acquired on or before 17 December 1987 in companies th a t are not resid en t in low tax ju risd ic tio n s sp ecified in a tra n sitio n a l l i s t . An illu s tra tiv e tra n sitio n a l l i s t is shown in Annex 5. Shareholders w ith co n tro llin g in te re sts in tax haven companies w ill generally have known since a t le a st the date of the 1987 Budget th a t they were to be subject to a CFC regim e. We th erefo re consider th a t a 1 A pril 1988 im plem entation date is appropriate in these cases. 7.1.3 We also recommend th a t resid en ts be exempt from the BE regime u n til 1 A pril 1989 in respect of in te re sts acquired a fte r 17 December 1987 in companies which are resid en t in the lis te d 51 countries (though the exemption of any underlying co n tro lled companies would depend on whether they also were resid en t in a lis te d country). A fter th a t date, a continued exemption would apply only if the company met the grey l i s t te s t outlined in section 2.3. Taxpayers in th is p o sitio n would th erefo re not have to ad ju st the taxable income of the co n tro lled company for sig n ific a n t preferences in the f ir s t year. I t would in any case be d iffic u lt to compile lis ts of sig n ific a n t preferences in tim e for a 1 A pril 1988 s ta r t date. 7.1.4 For the purposes of determ ining whether a non-resident company is co n tro lled , a re sid e n t's to ta l in te re s t in the company, whether acquired before or a fte r 17 December 1987, would be considered. S im ilarly, a re sid e n t's to ta l shareholding would be considered for the purposes of determ ining whether the 10 percent in te re s t threshold fo r a ttrib u tio n of income was trig g ered . A ttrib u tio n of income during the tra n s itio n a l period would, however, be based on th a t p art of a re s id e n t's to ta l in te re s t th a t was acquired a fte r 17 December 1987. An example illu s tra tin g these tra n sitio n a l provisions is shown in Annex 2. 7 .2 R esid en t T ru sts 7.2.1 As mentioned above, we consider th a t a more generous tra n sitio n is ju s tifie d fo r ex istin g resid en t tru s ts (as defined in chapter 5) w ith non-resident tru ste e s. In some cases, s e ttlo rs w ill be able to wind up a tru s t and remove them selves from the new regime but th is w ill often not be p o ssib le. Thus, some s e ttlo rs of such resid en t tru s ts would be unable to a lte r th e ir s e ttlo r sta tu s and could su ffer a considerable ad d itio n al tax lia b ility th a t could not have been an ticip ated . The regime 52 should not, however, p ro tect ex istin g s e ttlo rs forever where they are able, through th e ir influence over the tru ste e , to e ffe c t a wind up of a tru s t since a decision not to do so rep resen ts in e ffe c t a new settlem ent. Where a wind up is not fe a sib le , the s e ttlo r should not be subject to the new regim e. Since the tru ste e is offshore, the only other p arty , if any, w ith a connection w ith New Zealand w ill be resid en t b e n e fic ia rie s. We do not consider th a t i t is feasib le to tax b e n eficiarie s on u n d istrib u ted tru s t income each year, but the b en efit of d e fe rra l of tax th a t they enjoy can to some extent be addressed once a d istrib u tio n (or vesting) is made. 7.2.2 The Committee th erefo re favours a tru s t tra n s itio n which encourages s e ttlo rs and tru ste e s to wind up ex istin g resid en t tru s ts w ith non-resident tru ste e s if they can. I f they are not able to , an in te re s t elem ent should be incorporated in to the determ ination of the assessable income of a b en eficiary re su ltin g from a tru s t d istrib u tio n . The la tte r approach is adopted in the United S tates in respect of d istrib u tio n s to United S tates b e n eficiarie s from tru s ts se ttle d by non-residents. 7.2.3 In order to encourage d isso lu tio n of a tru s t where i t is fea sib le, we propose th a t d istrib u tio n s of income made on or before 31 March 1989 from ex istin g tru s ts w ith non-resident tru ste e s be su b ject to a fin a l tax levied a t a ra te of 10 percent, provided th a t e ith e r the tru s t is wound up before 1 A pril 1989 or the s e ttlo r e le c ts to be subject to the new s e ttlo r regime from th a t date. D istrib u tio n s of c ap ita l p ro fits and the corpus of such a tru s t made on or before 31 March 1989 should be exempt from tax in b e n e fic ia rie s' hands. Our proposed ra te of 10 percent re fle c ts a compromise between the ra te of tax which would have been payable had the d istrib u tio n been unambiguously taxable under cu rren t law and the ra te needed to encourage d isso lu tio n . 53 7.2.4 Where these a lte rn a tiv e s are not availed of, we recommend th a t the non-resident tru ste e and the resid en t s e ttlo r not be subject to the s e ttlo r regim e, but th a t a ll d istrib u tio n s, whether of income or c a p ita l (other than of the corpus of the tr u s t) , should be assessable in the hands of a resid en t ben eficiary w ith an in te re st charge to reduce the advantage of d e fe rra l. The in te re s t should be calcu lated from 1 A pril 1988, the im plem entation date of the s e ttlo r regim e. A c re d it should be given fo r any foreign tax paid by the tru ste e . In ad d itio n , where a s e ttlo r has a loan, guarantee or other form of fin an cial assistan ce outstanding to the tru ste e , he or she should be assessed on imputed in te re st a t a prescribed ra te (less any in te re s t actu ally received by the s e ttlo r or paid by the tru ste e , as the case may be) computed on the amount of the loan, guarantee or other assistan ce. 7.2.5 A le ss strin g en t tra n sitio n is ju s tifie d fo r resid en t testam entary tru s ts w ith non-resident tru ste e s since these are not used for avoidance purposes. Where such tru s ts are wound up on or before 31 March 1989, the provisions o u tlin ed in paragraph 7.2.3 should apply. We propose th a t d istrib u tio n s of c a p ita l p ro fits from th is category of testam entary tru s ts made a fte r 31 March 1989 be exempt in the hands of b e n e fic ia rie s. D istrib u tio n s of income should, however, be assessable w ith the in te re s t charge since the b en eficiaries of testam entary tru s ts may enjoy the advantages of tax d eferral to the same ex ten t as b e n eficiarie s of other tru s ts . 7.2.6 Where a settlem ent is made a fte r 17 December 1987 to an ex istin g resid en t tru s t, the whole of the tru s t income could be subject to the new regime or only th a t p a rt a ttrib u ta b le to post- 17 December 1987 settlem ents. I t would, however, be d iffic u lt to arriv e a t workable apportionm ent ru les because of the need to 54 trace and compare settlem ents made a t d iffe re n t tim es in the p ast and in various forms. We th erefo re favour the approach of bringing a ll tru s t income w ithin the regime where a new settlem ent is made to an ex istin g tru s t. This would have l i t t l e p ra c tic a l im pact, since future settlem ents could be made to a new tru s t on the same term s as an ex istin g tru s t, but would avoid the need for apportionm ent ru les. 7.2.7 In order to implement th is tra n sitio n , resid en t s e ttlo rs should be required to d isclo se a ll settlem ents, as w idely defined, on non-resident tru ste e s ex istin g on 1 A pril 1988. S e ttlo rs should also n o tify the Inland Revenue Department of the tra n sitio n they have elected . 7.2.8 Settlem ents of tru s ts made by resid en ts a fte r 17 December 1987 and d istrib u tio n s of income or c a p ita l from such tru sts would be subject to the new regime proposed in chapter 5. 7 .3 N on-R esident T ru sts 7.3.1 N on-resident tru s ts (i.e those which are not s e ttle d by a New Zealand resident) are not affected by the s e ttlo r regim e, irresp ectiv e of when they were se ttle d . The treatm ent of d istrib u tio n s from such tru s ts to resid en t b e n eficiarie s is , however, to be c la rifie d as p a rt of the present reform s. The Committee's recommended treatm ent was outlined in chapter 5. The Government's in ten tio n to c la rify the law in th is area was included in the CD. We th erefo re propose th a t our recommended regime apply to d istrib u tio n s from non-resident tru s ts made a fte r 17 December 1987. 55 7 .4 F oreign Investm ent Funds 7.4.1 The foreign investm ent fund regime is targ eted a t tax haven e n titie s . The Government sig n alled its concern about the use of tax havens in 1986 and again in the 1987 Budget. In addition, taxpayers w ill usually be read ily able to dispose of the in te re sts th a t would be affected by the regime. Thus, the Committee supports the im plem entation of the foreign investm ent fund regime from 1 A pril 1988. 7 .5 Recommendations 7 .5 .1 The Committee recommends t h a t : a taxp a y ers be exempt from th e BE regim e fo r a two year p erio d ( i . e . u n t il 1 A p ril 1990) in r e sp e c t o f in t e r e s t s acquired on or b efo re 17 December 1987 in com panies which are n ot r e sid e n t in a tr a n s itio n a l l i s t o f s p e c if ie d ta x havens; b taxp a y ers be exempt from th e BE regim e fo r a one year p erio d ( i . e . u n t il 1 A p ril 1989) w ith r e sp e c t to in t e r e s t s which were acquired a f t e r 17 December 1987 in com panies which are r e sid e n t in th e l i s t o f c o u n tr ie s s p e c if ie d in recommendation (a) o f paragraph 7 .1 7 ; c d is tr ib u tio n s o f income made on or b efo re 31 March 1989 from e x is t in g t r u s t s w ith n o n -re sid e n t t r u s t e e s , be su b je c t to a f in a l ta x le v ie d a t a r a te o f 10 p e r ce n t, provided th a t e ith e r th e tr u s t i s wound up by 1 A p ril 1989 or th e s e t t lo r e le c t s to be su b je c t to th e new s e t t lo r regim e from th a t d a te .

In many cases, the income th a t resid en ts derive through offshore investm ents (apart from d istrib u tio n s) is b est ch aracterised as c ap ital gain and, short of v io latin g accepted income tax p rin cip les, is most appropriately taxed under a c a p ita l gains tax. 8.1.2 The lack of the comprehensive tax atio n of c a p ita l gains in New Zealand is the la s t outstanding gap in our tax system . The reform s th a t the Government has implemented over the la s t few years have gone a long way to broadening the tax base and addressing sources of avoidance. The f ir s t major base broadening measure was the introduction of GST. W ithin the income tax system, the next step was the removal of e x p lic it tax concessions such as export incentives and accelerated depreciation provisions. The removal of such incentives in return fo r a reduction in tax ra te s is very much the cen tral theme of cu rren t tax reform programmes in OECD countries. 8.1.3 The th ird se t of reform s was the adoption of comprehensive accrual ru les. These were aimed a t countering tax planning based on the d eferral of fin an cial arrangem ent income or the advancing of tax deductions. The fourth and present se t of reform s address the avoidance and d eferral o p portunities which 59 a rise in the in tern atio n al context. The Government has also moved sim ultaneously to reduce the avoidance problems which a rise w ith the exemption of the superannuation funds and other e n titie s . 8.1.4 The la s t major tax base problem is the general exclusion of c a p ita l gains from the d e fin itio n of assessable income. There is widespread support amongst tax p ra c titio n e rs for the tax atio n of c a p ita l gains. The Committee endorses th is view. Many of the rem aining d eficien cies in the tax system have th e ir o rig in in or are compounded by the lack of a c ap ita l gains tax. The next step in the Government's tax reform programme should be to extend the tax base to include c ap ita l gains as soon as i t is fea sib le to do so w ith the objective of fa c ilita tin g a fu rth er reduction in tax ra te s . 8.1.5 New Zealand is the only country in the OECD which s t i l l has no general c a p ita l gains tax. C ountries such as the U nited S tates, the United Kingdom, West Germany, France and Japan have a ll taxed c a p ita l gains for some tim e, w hile A ustralia introduced a c a p ita l gains tax in 1985. 8 .2 In te r j u r is d ic tio n a l A llo c a tio n R ules 8.2.1 In addition, we reaffirm our view th a t p rio rity should also be given to the introduction of in te rju risd ic tio n a l allo catio n ru les to ensure th a t New Zealand c o lle c ts its share of tax. Along w ith the tax atio n of c ap ita l gains, such ru les form one of the basic building blocks of the tax systems of countries such as the U nited S tates and the United Kingdom. 60 8 .3 Recommendation 8.3.1 The Committee th e r e fo r e recommends th a t, in a d d itio n to g iv in g p r io r ity to th e e x te n sio n o f th e income ta x b ase to in clu d e c a p ita l g a in s , th e Government g iv e p r io r it y to th e in tro d u ctio n o f in t e r j u r is d ic t io n a l a llo c a tio n r u le s , such as expense a llo c a tio n r u le s and more e f f e c t iv e tr a n s fe r p r ic in g p r o v is io n s . 61 CHAPTER 9 – SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 9 .1 Summary o f Recommendations 9.1.1 In summary, the Committee's recommendations are th a t: BE Method a the BE regime apply only where New Zealand resid en ts have control of a company; b control be defined as the ownership by 5 or fewer resid en ts of 50 percent or more of the shares (or votes, rig h ts to dividends or d istrib u tio n s on wind up) of a company, subject to : i a constructive ownership te s t to include in te re sts held through associated persons, nominees and other co ntrolled companies; i i a de facto control provision to include w ithin the regime persons who have the power to require a d istrib u tio n or the wind-up of a non-resident company; and i i i an anti-avoidance provision to d eter arrangem ents which have the e ffe c t of defeating the in te n t and app licatio n of the control te s t; and 62 c resid en t shareholders who d ire c tly or in d ire c tly hold a 10 percent or g reater in te re st in a co n tro lled company and resid en ts who are deemed to have control by v irtu e of the de facto control and anti-avoidance provisions be subject to the BE regim e, but other resid en t shareholders of co ntrolled companies be exempt from i t; d resid en ts be exempt from the BE regime in resp ect of in te re sts in companies which are: i resid en t for tax purposes in c e rta in lis te d countries w ith comprehensive in te rn atio n al tax regimes including CFC regim es (i.e .th e U nited S tates, the United Kingdom, West Germany, Canada, France and Japan) or A u stralia; and i i do not b en efit from sp ecified sig n ific a n t tax preferences in those countries such as accelerated c ap ita l w rite-o ffs or the exemption of c ertain foreign-source income. Where a company did u tilis e a sp ecified preference, i t would be required to ad ju st its taxable income, determ ined according to the country of residence tax ru les, for the e ffe c t of the tax p referen ce(s). If its foreign tax paid as a ra tio of its adjusted taxable income equals or exceeds the New Zealand company tax ra te , the BE regime would not apply; e non-minor shareholders (and other shareholders deemed to have control) in a controlled company who have in te re sts which are held in d ire c tly through other foreign 63 companies be subject to the regime unless the co n tro lled company s a tis fie s the exemption outlined in recommendation (d); CV Method f the CV regime apply only to in te re sts in foreign investm ent funds, as outlined in recommendation g; Foreign Fund Regime g in addition to the BE regim e, th ere be a foreign investm ent fund regime to apply to in te re sts in e n titie s which: i derive th e ir income or value prim arily or su b sta n tia lly from holding or trad in g p o rtfo lio investm ents in shares, investm ents in debt instrum ents, rea l property, commodities, e tc ; and i i the e ffe c t of the residence of the e n tity fo r tax purposes and its d istrib u tio n policy is to reduce the tax payable on the income of the e n tity below what i t would be had the income been taxed in New Zealand as if i t were derived by the investor; h the taxable income derived by a resid en t from an in te re st in a foreign investm ent fund be calcu lated as the increase in the market value of the in te re s t over the income year, plus any d istrib u tio n s receiv ab le; 64 i where an in te re st in a non-resident e n tity fa lls w ithin both the BE and foreign investm ent fund regim es, the BE regime apply; T rusts j a s e ttlo r be w idely defined as any person who d ire c tly or in d ire c tly provides money, goods, services or other b en efits to a tru s t for inadequate consideration; k a tru s t be trea te d as a resid en t of New Zealand fo r income tax purposes i f the s e ttlo r of the tru s t is a New Zealand resid en t; l the tru ste e of a resid en t tru s t be prim arily lia b le fo r tax on tru s t income but, in the event of the tru ste e defau ltin g on such a lia b ility , the s e ttlo r be lia b le as agent of the tru ste e ; m d istrib u tio n s of tru s t income (i.e . income which has been taxed in the hands of the tru ste e or the resid en t se ttlo r) to a beneficiary from a resid en t tru s t be exempt from tax in the b e n eficiary 's hands; n a ll d istrib u tio n s of income to a b eneficiary from a non- resid en t tru s t be taxable in the hands of the b en eficiary , but the b eneficiary be allowed a c re d it fo r any foreign or New Zealand tax paid by the tru ste e ; 65 o d istrib u tio n s of c ap ita l p ro fits or the corpus to a resid en t beneficiary from a non-resident tru s t be exempt from tax in the hands of the beneficiary; T ransition p taxpayers be exempt from the BE regime for a two year period (i.e . u n til 1 A pril 1990) in respect of in te re s ts acquired on or before 17 December 1987 in companies which are not resid en t in a tra n sitio n a l l i s t of sp ecified low tax ju risd ic tio n s; q taxpayers be exempt from the BE regime for a one year period (i.e . u n til 1 A pril 1989) w ith respect to in te re s ts which were acquired a fte r 17 December 1987 in companies which are resid en t in the l i s t of countries sp ecified in recommendation (d)(i); r d istrib u tio n s of income made on or before 31 March 1989 from settlem ents by resid en ts, on non-resident tru ste e s, in existence on 17 December 1987 be subject to a fin a l tax levied a t a ra te of 10 percent, provided th a t e ith e r the tru s t is wound up on or before th a t date or the s e ttlo r e le c ts to be subject to the new s e ttlo r regime from th a t date. Where e ith e r of these options ap p lies, d istrib u tio n s of c a p ita l p ro fits and the corpus of the tru s t made on or before 31 March 1989 should be exempt from tax in b e n e fic ia rie s' hands; s where n eith er option outlined in (r) applies in respect of settlem ents in existence on 17 December 1987 made by resid en ts, other than testam entary settlem ents: 66 i a ll d istrib u tio n s, whether of income or c a p ita l (other than of the corpus of the tr u s t) , should be assessable in the hands of a resid en t b en eficiary subject to an in te re st charge calcu lated from 1 A pril 1988, w ith the ben eficiary receiving a c re d it fo r any foreign tax paid by the tru ste e ; and i i where a s e ttlo r has a loan, guarantee or other form of fin an cial assistan ce outstanding to the tru ste e , he or she should be assessed on imputed in te re s t a t a prescribed ra te (less any in te re s t actu ally received by the s e ttlo r or paid by the tru ste e , as the case may be) computed on the amount of the loan, guarantee or other assistan ce outstanding; t in the case of testam entary tru s ts in existence on 17 December 1987 where the deceased person was a resid en t and which do not wind up pursuant to recommendation ( r ) : i d istrib u tio n s of c a p ita l p ro fits made a fte r 31 March 1989 continue to be exempt in the hands of b e n e fic ia rie s; and i i d istrib u tio n s of income be assessable subject to an in te re s t charge calcu lated from 1 A pril 1988; 67 u where a resid en t makes a settlem ent a fte r 17 December 1987 to a tru s t in existence on th a t date, a ll of the tru s t settlem ents be deemed to have been made a fte r 17 December 1987; v taxpayers be required to make fu ll d isclosure of a ll settlem ents to tru s ts w ith non-resident tru ste e s ex istin g on 1 A pril 1988; w the im plem entation date fo r the proposed changes to the treatm ent of d istrib u tio n s from non-resident tru s ts be 17 December 1987; x the im plem entation date for the foreign investm ent fund regime be 1 A pril 1988; Other Reforms y in addition to giving p rio rity to the extension of the income tax base to include c ap ita l gains, the Government give p rio rity to the introduction of in te rju risd ic tio n a l allo catio n ru les, such as expense allo catio n ru les and more effe ctiv e tra n sfe r p ricing provisions. 9.2 C onclusion 9.2.1 We believe th a t the regime we have outlined goes as far as is p racticab le towards achieving the Government's objectives w ithin the boundaries of ex istin g income tax p rin cip le s, given the c o n strain ts imposed by compliance and adm inistrative co sts. I t d iffe rs from the CD proposals prim arily by introducing a control te s t and a grey l i s t exemption to the BE regim e, 68 c u rta ilin g the scope of the CV regime and giving more tra n sitio n a l re lie f. While our regime is more lim ited in scope than th a t in the CD, we have sought to make i t e ffe c tiv e in its area of ap p licatio n . 9.2.2 Once we have your response to our recommendations, we w ill consider the more d etailed design issues and advance the d ra ft le g isla tio n . There are many subsidiary issues to consider. We w ill rep o rt fu rth er on these, along w ith our proposed d ra ft le g isla tio n . 69 ANNEX 1 CONTROL INTERESTS OF RESIDENTS IN CONTROLLED FOREIGN COMPANIES. 1 I n tr o d u c tio n 1.1 Under the branch equivalent ("BE") regim e, the income of co n tro lled foreign companies would be assessed to th e ir New Zealand resid en t shareholders in proportion to the in te re s t held by each shareholder. 1.2 In order to determ ine whether income w ill be assessed in New Zealand on the basis of an in te re st held in a foreign company, a taxpayer w ill be required to e stab lish : a f ir s t, whether the in te re st held is w ithin the am bit of the regim e; and b second, if so, whether the in te re s t held d ire c tly or in d ire c tly , by the taxpayer, e ith e r ind iv id u ally or combined w ith the in te re sts held by other resid en ts, is su ffic ie n t fo r the ru les fo r a ttrib u tin g the income of the foreign company to apply. 70 2 I n t e r e s t s to which th e Regime A p p lies 2.1 As outlined in the C onsultative Document ("CD"), the regime w ill apply to in te re sts in companies th a t are not resid en t in New Zealand or th a t are resid en t in New Zealand but, by v irtu e of the provisions of a double tax agreem ent, are not subject to tax in respect of foreign source income. The d e fin itio n of a company w ill include e n titie s th a t have a leg al p erso n ality and existence d is tin c t from th a t of th e ir members. 2.2 The BE regime should apply to resid en ts in resp ect of th e ir in te re sts in foreign companies. The control te s t advocated by the Committee would determ ine th a t a foreign company would be a co ntrolled foreign company if five or fewer New Zealand resid en ts owned 50 percent or more of its equity. This te s t requires taxpayers to determ ine th e ir resp ectiv e proportions of the equity of a foreign company. 2.4 The proportion so calculated fo r each resid en t is term ed the re sid e n t's c o n tr o l in t e r e s t. For th is purpose, the Committee favours no minimum shareholding threshold fo r a re sid e n t's control in te re st to be taken into account when determ ining whether a company is a controlled foreign company. However, as explained in Chapter 2, taxpayers w ith in te re s ts in a co n tro lled foreign company below a minimum threshold would not be required to include any p a rt of th a t controlled foreign company's income in th e ir assessable income. 2.5 A foreign company would be a co ntrolled foreign company if , a t any tim e in the foreign company's accounting year, the sum of the control in te re sts held by fiv e or fewer New Zealand resid en ts is g reater than or equal to 50 percent. The Committee favours applying the te s t to determ ine control a t any tim e in 71 the year to prevent taxpayers 'd e -co n tro llin g ' by disposing of in te re s ts in co ntrolled foreign companies through permanent sale to non-residents before the end of each accounting year of a foreign company. By disposing of in te re s ts in th is manner taxpayers could accum ulate income in the non-resident company and s e ll th e ir in te re s t for a tax free c a p ita l gain. Other countries w ith CFC regim es tend to apply the control te s t to in te re s ts held a t the end of a foreign company's accounting year. However, th is te s t does not provide an avoidance opportunity because, unlike the p o sitio n in New Zealand, c ap ita l gains taxes in these countries ensure th a t a taxpayer is taxed on any gains re a lise d on the disposal of in te re sts in foreign companies during an accounting year. 3 Measurement o f a C ontrol I n te r e s t 3.1 A control in te re s t measures the proportion of a foreign company's equ ity or p ro fits over which a resid en t is considered to have co n tro l. This includes control in te re sts held through nominees of the taxpayer and control in te re s ts held in d ire c tly by the resid en t through other controlled foreign companies. Taxpayers could avoid the 50 percent control by fiv e or fewer resid en ts te s t by fragm enting shareholding or by exercising de facto control of a foreign company. The control te s t would th erefo re need to be supported by constructive ownership ru les to include, in the control in te re st of a resid en t, control in te re sts held by persons associated w ith the resid en t. In addition, de facto control ru les w ill be needed to deal w ith situ a tio n s where taxpayers can exercise control over the d istrib u tio n of a foreign company's income or c ap ita l but do not fa ll w ithin the formal control te s ts . 72 3.2 To prevent avoidance of the control te s t, determ ination of a control in te re s t in a foreign company needs to take account of in te re sts held by a taxpayer in a number of ways. For the purpose of determ ining whether a company is a co n tro lled foreign company, the Committee considers th a t the control in te re s t a ttrib u ta b le to a taxpayer should include: a any in te re s t in the foreign company held d ire c tly by the taxpayer; b any in te re s t in the foreign company held in d ire c tly by way of another foreign company in which the taxpayer has an in te re s t; c an in te re s t held d ire c tly or in d ire c tly by a nominee of the taxpayer; and d an in te re s t in the foreign company held d ire c tly or in d ire c tly by associated persons of the taxpayer. 3.3 The Committee favours an approach fo r m easuring a control in te re st based on th a t se t out in section 191 of the Income Tax Act 1976 fo r m easuring a "prescribed proportion" of the equity of two or more companies. We propose th a t the control in te re s t in a company held by a resid en t be the proportion of: a paid-up c a p ita l; b nominal value of the a llo tte d shares; c e n titl ement to p ro fits (including the entitlem ent to d istrib u tio n s on winding-up, whether from the c a p ita l or from the p ro fits of the company); or d the voting power; 73 e where appropriate, com binations of the above whichever is the highest. 3.4 The taxpayer would be required to take into account a ll classes of shares held when determ ining a control in te re s t as w ell as rig h ts to acquire equity in the foreign company whether in the form of options, convertible debt or other contingent in te re s ts . 4 Nominees and T ru stees 4.1 In te re sts in companies in the names of tru ste e s and nominees are a p a rtic u la r form of b en eficial ownership. In te re sts held by nominees or by bare tru ste e s would th erefo re be a ttrib u ta b le to th e ir b en eficial owners. Nominee ru les would also a ttrib u te a control in te re st to a shareholder who has an arrangem ent w ith another person to resume ownership of shares a t a subsequent date (through so called "warehousing" of sh a res). 4.2 The Committee' s general approach to the tax atio n of tru s ts is th a t th e ir tax treatm ent should be determ ined by reference to the residence of s e ttlo rs (see Annex 4). In accordance w ith th is p referred approach, the Committee considers th a t a control in te re s t in a controlled foreign company held by tru ste e s of d iscretio n ary tru s ts should be a ttrib u te d to any New Zealand resid en t who has se ttle d property on the tru s t. In th is context, the tru ste e s of the d iscretio n ary tru s t se ttle d by the resid en t would be considered to be nominees of the resid en t. A settlem ent of a tru s t is defined in Annex 4. 74 5 I n d ir e c t C ontrol R ules 5.1 To determ ine accurately the level of a tax p ay er's control in te re st in a foreign company, control in te re sts held in the foreign company in d ire c tly by a taxpayer through another controlled foreign company would need to be combined w ith control in te re sts held d ire c tly by the taxpayer. 5.2 In d irect control in te re sts held through a chain of controlled foreign companies would be determ ined by m ultiplying the tax p ay er's control in te re st in the top tie r co n tro lled foreign company by the top tie r company's control in te re s t in the second tie r controlled foreign company and so on. The in d ire ct control te s t would 'look through' each co n tro lled foreign company in a corporate tie r in th is manner u n til the combined control in te re st of the taxpayer and four other resid en ts in the foreign company is less than 50 percent (i.e . the lowest tie r foreign company is not a co ntrolled foreign company). 5.3 For the purposes of tracin g control down a corporate tie r , a resid en t w ith a d ire c t control in te re s t in a f i r s t tie r controlled foreign company of more than 50 percent would be deemed to hold a 100 percent control in te re s t in the foreign company. S im ilarly, where a higher tie r co ntrolled foreign company in which a taxpayer has an in te re st controls a lower tie r foreign company (i.e . its control in te re st is 50% or more) the higher tie r company would be deemed to hold a 100 percent control in te re s t in the lower tie r company. This ru le is necessary to prevent taxpayers avoiding the 50 percent control threshold in respect of an in te re st in a p a rtic u la r foreign company by interposing between them selves and the company in question a se rie s of controlled foreign companies in which the control in te re s t held by the taxpayers is less than 100 percent. 75 5.4 The e ffe c t of the procedure for tracin g control down a corporate tie r described in paragraph 5.3 is th a t, where a co n tro lled foreign company holds a control in te re s t of le ss than 50 percent in a foreign company, the control in te re s t held by the co n tro lled foreign company would be considered to be held by its New Zealand resid en t shareholders. 5.5 The follow ing example illu s tra te s the operation of the in d ire c t control ru les. 76 NZCO, a company resid en t in New Zealand has a 40 percent control in te re s t in SUBCO1, a non-resident company in which another resid en t holds a control in te re s t of 30 percent, making SUBCO1 a co n tro lled foreign company. NZCO also holds a d ire c t control in te re s t of 40 percent in CFC, another non-resident company. SUBCO1 holds a 60 percent control in te re s t in SUBCO2, which in turn holds a 25 percent control in te re st in CFC. NZCO would determ ine its in d ire ct control in te re s t in CFC by m ultiplying its control in te re s t in SUBCO1 by SUBCO1 's control in te re st in SUBCO2, and SUBCO2 's control in te re s t in CFC. As SUBCO1's control in te re st in SUBCO2 is 60 percent, SUBCO1 would be deemed to hold a 100 percent control in te re s t in SUBCO2 fo r the purposes of computing NZCO's in d ire ct control in te re s t in CFC. NZCO's control in te re st in CFC held in d ire c tly would th erefo re be 10 percent (i.e . 40% x 100% x 25%). NZCO's aggregate control in te re s t in CFC would be 50 percent, being the sum of its d ire c t control in te re st (40 percent) and its in d ire ct control in te re st (10 p ercen t). 5.6 In the example se t out in paragraph 5.5, if SUBCO1 was not a CFC, NZCO would not be required to m ultiply its control in te re st in SUBCO1 by any of SUBCO1's control in te re s ts . S im ilarly, if SUBCO2 was not a co ntrolled foreign company, NZCO would not be required to m ultiply its control in te re s t in SUBCO2 by any of SUBCO2 's control in te re sts. However, where fiv e or fewer New Zealand resid en ts have an in d ire c t income in te re s t in a foreign company of 50 percent or more, a ru le described in paragraph 2.13 of Annex 2 w ill apply to make the company a controlled foreign company. 77 6 C o n stru ctiv e Ownership R ules 6.1 The Committee considers th a t constructive ownership and control ru les are necessary in order to prevent avoidance of the regime by spreading ownership of foreign companies among a number of associated persons. For the purpose of determ ining the control in te re st in a foreign company held by a New Zealand resid en t, constructive ownership ru les would a ttrib u te to the resid en t ownership and control rig h ts th a t in fact or in law belong to h is or her asso ciates or re la tiv e s. 6.2 C onstructive ownership ru les should only apply fo r the purposes of the control te s t and to determ ine the minimum lev el of in te re st before income is a ttrib u te d to a taxpayer (described in Annex 2). C onstructive ownership ru les would not apply fo r the purpose of determ ining the b asis on which income would be a ttrib u te d . 6.3 Persons considered to be associated for the purposes of the controlled foreign company ru les would include, as a minimum: a any two persons w ith shared in te re sts; b any two companies which co n sist of su b sta n tia lly the same shareholders; c any two persons who are re la tiv e s connected w ithin the second degree of relatio n sh ip ; 78 d any company and any person (other than a company) who are associated persons w ithin the meaning of section 8 (1 )(b) of the Income Tax Act; e a partnership and any person who is a partn er in the partnership. 6.4 The associated persons ru le in conjunction w ith the constructive ownership ru le may be illu s tra te d by way of example. Suppose four New Zealand resid en ts together own 40 percent of Nonresco, a non-resident company. A fifth New Zealand resid en t owns a fu rth er 2 percent. However, the f if th resid en t has four children, each of whom also owns 2 percent. In these circum stances, the shareholding of the children w ill be a ttrib u te d to the fifth resid en t whether the children are resid en t in New Zealand or abroad. Nonresco would thereby be considered to be a controlled foreign company. 6.5 A fu rth er example of the operation of the associated persons ru le in the context of constructive ownership provisions is a large New Zealand company w ith many shareholders th a t estab lish es a foreign associated company, with the same shareholders as the New Zealand company, holding in te re sts in the same proportion. If the shares of the two companies are 'sta p le d ' (th at is , they may be tran sfe rred only if kept together) the companies have a relatio n sh ip th a t is somewhat sim ilar to a holding company and subsidiary. The subsidiary would be a controlled foreign company, but, in the absence of special ru les, the stapled associated company would not, unless by chance i t was controlled by five or fewer New Zealand resid en ts. However, the associated persons ru le tre a t the two companies as one person as they have shared in te re s ts . 79 6.6 The Committee is review ing the d e fin itio n s of associated persons and nominees in the Income Tax Act to make the d e fin itio n s more co n sisten t and e ffe c tiv e , where necessary. 7 D e-fa cto C ontrol and A n ti-avoid an ce R ules 7.1 The Committee favours an anti-avoidance rule as p a rt of the control te s t th a t would apply to taxpayers who exercise de facto control of a foreign company. R esidents who are e n title d to c a ll fo r or prevent the d istrib u tio n of the p ro fits of a foreign company, or who have the power to c a ll for the wind-up of a foreign company would be deemed to have a 50 percent control in te re s t and the company would th erefo re be a co n tro lled foreign company, irresp ectiv e of the proportion of the equity of the company held by New Zealand resid en ts. The anti-avoidance ru le would also be aimed a t arrangem ents, such as voting tru s ts and understandings, which have the e ffe c t of defeating the in te n t and application of the control te s t. The Committee considers th a t these anti-avoidance ru les w ill support the nominee ru les. 7.2 Taxpayers w ill include a ll the in te re sts they hold in a foreign company to compute a control in te re s t, irre sp e c tiv e of whether these were acquired before or a fte r 17 December 1987. However, in respect of investm ents in countries th a t are not on the tra n sitio n a l l i s t of specified low tax ju risd ic tio n s, income would be a ttrib u te d during the tra n sitio n a l period only in respect of in te re s ts acquired a fte r 17 December (see Annex 2) . 80 ANNEX 2 ISSUES RELATING TO THE DETERMINATION AND ATTRIBUTION OF BRANCH- EQUIVALENT INCOME 1 I n tr o d u c tio n 1.1 As noted in the Com mittee's rep o rt, we favour a tax atio n regime th a t only requires taxpayers w ith in te re s ts in excess of a minimum lev el in co ntrolled foreign companies to rep o rt income on a branch-equivalent b asis. The amount of income to be reported would be determ ined by applying the a ttrib u tio n ru les to the to ta l annual income of the company, computed on the b asis of New Zealand tax ru les. 1.2 Income a ttrib u te d under th is regime would be included in a taxpayer' s assessable income and taxed a t personal or corporate rates applicable to income derived by the taxpayer. The Committee is s t i l l considering appropriate ru les fo r the treatm ent of lo sses. 1.3 The two aspects of the in tern atio n al tax regime addressed in th is annex w ill be d e ta ils of the a ttrib u tio n ru les and guidance fo r taxpayers on procedures for computing the income of a co n tro lled foreign company on a branch-equivalent b a sis. 81 2 A ttr ib u tio n o f Branch-equiv a le n t Income D eterm ination of an Annual Income In te re st. 2.1 The annual branch-equivalent income of a co n tro lled foreign company would be a ttrib u te d to a taxpayer on the b asis of the income in t e r e s t held by the taxpayer. A tax p ay er's income in te re s t in a controlled foreign company is the b asis upon which income is a ttrib u te d under the proposed regim e. I t is computed by reference to the control in te re s t held by the taxpayer and the nominee of the taxpayer as described in Annex 1. 2.2 The Committee considers th a t a taxpayer should be required to include in assessable income only income to which he or she can reasonably be considered to have access. C onsistent w ith th is view, control in te re sts in a foreign company held by associated persons of the taxpayer and a ttrib u te d to the taxpayer fo r the purpose of determ ining h is or her control in te re st should be excluded when determ ining the income in te re s t held by the taxpayer. 2.3 As would be the case in determ ining a control in te re s t, in d ire ct in te re s ts held by a taxpayer would be taken in to account when determ ining an income in te re st held by a taxpayer. However, an income in te re st would be computed by reference to the actual in te re s ts held a t each tie r in a chain of co n tro lled foreign companies rath er than deemed in te re sts as would be the case when determ ining a control in te re s t. The calcu latio n of an income in te re s t held in d ire c tly is explained below in paragraphs 2.11 to 2.14. 82 2.4 In addition to the im portant d ifferen ces between an income in te re s t and a control in te re s t described above an income in te re s t d iffe rs from a control in te re s t in the follow ing respects: a i t excludes rig h ts held by the taxpayer to acqu ire a future in te re st in a foreign company in circum stances described in paragraph 2.5 below; and b i t takes account of the varying lev els of in te re s t in a controlled foreign company the taxpayer may have held during the course of the company's accounting year. 2.5 To avoid a ttrib u tio n of the u n d istrib u ted income of a co ntrolled foreign company, taxpayers may hold rig h ts to acquire in te re sts in a foreign company in the form of o p tio ns or other contingent in te re s ts . R ights held by a taxpayer th a t e n title the taxpayer to acquire a future in te re st in the company are taken into account when determ ining a control in te re s t (as explained in Annex 1). I t is the Com m ittee's view th a t such rig h ts are also to be taken in to account when determ ining an income in te re st in re la tio n to any accounting year of a foreign company in which the company derives a taxable p ro fit. For th is purpose, however, a taxpayer may exclude any rig h ts to acquire in te re sts in the company pursuant to normal commercial tran sactio n s where the rig h ts, such as options or convertible debt, are acquired or are exerciseable by the taxpayer a t fa ir market value. 2.6 Taking account of the varying lev els of in te re st held during the accounting year of a controlled foreign company is considered to be more equitable than a ttrib u tin g income on the b asis of the income in te re st held a t the end of its accounting 83 year. The form er approach w ill re fle c t more accurately an in te re st b u ilt up by a taxpayer during the course of a co ntrolled foreign company's accounting year. 2.7 The f ir s t step in estab lish in g the lev el of a tax p ay er's income in te re s t would be to calcu late the in te re s t in the company fo r each period during its accounting year in which the control in te re s t remained unchanged. The income in te re s t in each period would be determ ined according to the ru les fo r determ ining an ownership in te re st se t out in Annex 1 su b ject to the m odifications se t out in paragraphs 2.1 to 2.5 above. 2.8 The next step would be to p ro -rate the income in te re s t determ ined fo r each period by the proportion of the year (or p art-y ear where the non-resident e n tity has an accounting period of le ss than a year) the in te re st remained unchanged. A tax p ay er's o v erall income in te re st w ill be the sum of the pro- rated in te re s ts computed fo r each period in the non-resident e n tity 's accounting year. In respect of any accounting year of a co n tro lled foreign company, income a ttrib u ta b le to a resid en t is derived by m ultiplying the income in te re st computed fo r th a t year by the annual branch-equivalent income for th a t accounting year (or p art-y ear as appropriate). 2.9 The p ro -ratin g of in te re sts for any relev an t period during the accounting year of the controlled foreign company would be on the basis of the number of days in th a t period as a proportion of 365, or the number of days in the controlled foreign company's accounting period if th is is less than a year. 84 2.10 The method for determ ining the lev el of a tax p ay er's in te re st in a non-resident e n tity fo r the purpose of a ttrib u tin g income is illu s tra te d in the example se t out below: Example Taxpayer X holds an in te re s t in Nonresco, a co n tro lled foreign company. A summary of X 's control in te re s t during N onresco's accounting year, m odified to conform w ith the adjustm ents se t out in paragraphs 2.1 to 2.5 above, is: - 33 percent fo r the f ir s t th ree months; - 50 percent fo r the next six months; - 66 percent fo r the la s t th ree months. X's in te re s t is computed as follow s: P ro-rated in te re s t for the f ir s t 3 months = 33% x 25% = 8.3% P ro-rated in te re s t for next 6 months = 50% x 50% = 25.0% P ro-rated in te re s t fo r la s t 3 months = 66% x 25% = 16.5% T otal Income In te re st = 49.8% If N onresco's branch-equivalent income fo r its relev an t accounting year was (say) $100, $49.80 would be a ttrib u te d to X on the b asis of X 's in te re s t. Income In te re sts where there is In d irect Ownership. 2.11 I f a controlled foreign company is a second or lower tie r company, its income w ill be a ttrib u te d d ire c tly to New Zealand resid en ts in accordance w ith th e ir d ire c t and in d ire c t in te re s t in the co ntrolled foreign company. For th is purpose, an income in te re s t is determ ined by m ultiplying the tax p ay er's income in te re st in the top tie r controlled foreign company by the top tie r company's income in te re st in the second tie r co n tro lled 85 foreign company company and so on. A taxpayer would m ultiply income in te re s ts in co ntrolled foreign companies a t each tie r u n til the lower tie r company e ith e r was not a co ntrolled company, or the tax p ay er's income in te re st fe ll below the minimum lev el of in te re st fo r income a ttrib u tio n . 2.12 The procedure for determ ining an in d ire c t income in te re s t in a co n tro lled foreign company held through a se rie s of higher tie r co n tro lled foreign companies co n trasts w ith th a t fo r determ ining a control in te re st down a corporate tie r described in Annex 1. Under the la tte r approach, a higher tie r co n tro lled foreign company is considered to hold a 100 percent control in te re st in any lower tie r foreign companies i t co n tro ls. 2.13 O rdinarily, a taxpayer should not be required to m ultiply an income in te re s t held in a company th a t is not a co n tro lled foreign company by income in te re sts th a t the foreign company has in other foreign companies. This is because i t is im possible, in normal commercial circum stances, for a taxpayer to 'look through' a company th a t is not a controlled foreign company to trace in d ire c t in te re s ts . However, the Committee is considering a ru le aimed a t situ a tio n s where five or fewer taxpayers stru ctu re th e ir in d ire ct in te re sts in order to c o lle c tiv e ly hold more than 50 percent of an income in te re st in a foreign company but hold a control in te re st of less than 50 percent. Such a ru le might require a taxpayer to m ultiply an in te re st in a top tie r foreign company th a t is not a controlled foreign company by an income in te re s t the top tie r company holds in a lower tie r foreign company where there was such an arrangement and its app licatio n resu lted in the lower tie r e n tity becoming a controlled foreign company. 86 2.14 The follow ing example illu s tra te s the operation of these ru les: X, a resid en t company, holds a 60 percent income in te re s t in Nonresco1, a controlled foreign company. Nonresco1 has a 60 percent income in te re st in Nonresco2 which in tu rn , has an income in te re s t of 25 percent in CFC. X also holds d ire c tly an income in te re st of 35 percent in CFC. X 's income in te re s t in CFC held in d ire c tly through Nonresco1 and Nonresco2 would be 9 percent (i.e . 60% x 60% x 25%) which, when combined w ith X 's d ire c t in te re st of 35 percent, gives an o verall income in te re s t held by X of 44 percent. 87 Minimum In te re st fo r the A ttrib u tio n of Income 2.15 The Committee considers th a t where an income in te re s t of a taxpayer in a controlled foreign company is below 10 percent, branch-equivalent income of the company should not be a ttrib u te d to the taxpayer. 2.16 To prevent fragm entation of shareholding in order to f a ll below th is threshold, constructive ownership ru les th a t combine the in te re sts of associated persons of any taxpayer w ith those of the taxpayer, w ill be used to determ ine w hether a tax p ay er's in te re s t is above the minimum threshold. This means, fo r example, th a t if a taxpayer held a fiv e percent income in te re s t in a controlled foreign company and associated persons of the taxpayer held income in te re sts of another five percent, the income in te re s t of the taxpayer for the purpose of applying th is te s t w ill be ten percent. As the in te re s t of the taxpayer is above the minimum threshold, branch-equivalent income of the co n tro lled foreign company would be a ttrib u te d to the taxpayer and persons associated w ith the taxpayer. 2.17 While the in te re st held by a taxpayer and associated persons of the taxpayer would be combined when applying the minimum in te re s t te s t, income would be a ttrib u te d to the taxpayer, and persons associated w ith the taxpayer, on the basis of the in te re sts held by each in d iv id u ally . T ransition Rule 2.18 Whether an income in te re st is above the minimum threshold for a ttrib u tio n needs to be determ ined having regard to the proposed tra n sitio n a l m easures. To determ ine whether income in te re sts are above the minimum threshold, a taxpayer would 88 take in to account a ll income in te re sts held irresp e ctiv e of whether they were acquired before or a fte r 17 December 1987. However, during the tra n sitio n a l period, should i t apply, income would be a ttrib u te d to the taxpayer only on the b asis of income in te re sts acquired a fte r 17 December 1987. 2.19 For example, a taxpayer may have an income in te re s t of 15 percent in a co ntrolled company resid en t in a country th a t is not on the tra n sitio n a l l i s t of designated low tax ju risd ic tio n s. The tra n sitio n a l provisions would th erefo re apply. The tax p ay er's income in te re st in the company as a t 17 December was 8 percent and the taxpayer acquired a 7 percent income in te re s t in the company a fte r 17 December. Income of the controlled foreign company would be a ttrib u te d to the taxpayer on the b asis of the 7 percent income in te re s t acquired a fte r 17 December during the tra n sitio n a l period. Changes of Residence 2.20 The CD proposed on page 20 th a t a person would not be a resid en t of New Zealand for the purposes of income a ttrib u tio n where the person had been a resid en t of New Zealand fo r a cum ulative period of less than 24 months in the im m ediately preceding 15 years. 2.21 The Committee w ill review th is proposal together w ith the appropriate treatm ent under the regime of persons who become, or cease to be New Zealand resid en ts. The ru les for determ ining residence in the Income Tax Act, p a rtic u la rly as they re la te to in d ividuals, w ill also be reviewed to ensure th a t they do not provide scope for unacceptable avoidance of the regime by taxpayers. 89 3 C a lc u la tio n o f th e Income o f a C on tro lled F oreign Company on a B ran ch -eq u ivalen t B a sis. 3.1 Opening Balance Sheets 3.1.1 In order fo r taxpayers to compute the income of co n tro lled foreign companies on a branch-equivalent b a sis, some of the opening balance sheet item s w ill need to be re sta te d , in the foreign currency, but as if New Zealand tax ru les applied. The proposals se t out below are designed to reduce compliance costs where th ere is l i t t l e , if any, revenue consequence. 3.1.2 The ru les which follow in re la tio n to the opening values of fixed assets and trading stock give the taxpayer the option of choosing opening values in accordance w ith e ith e r New Zealand tax ru les or the tax ru les of the country of residence or income source of the foreign company. Whichever option a taxpayer e le c ts to use, he or she would be required to use the same b asis fo r determ ining the opening values of both fixed assets and trading stock to ensure the co n sisten t ap p licatio n of whichever option is chosen. Fixed A ssets 3.1.3 The opening tax value of fixed assets for the year in which the taxpayer commences reporting on a branch-equivalent basis should be, a t the tax p ay er's option e ith e r: a the depreciated tax value determ ined in accordance w ith the tax ru les of the country of residence of the company, provided th a t the value does not exceed current m arket value; or 90 b the depreciated tax value determ ined in accordance w ith New Zealand tax ru les. Trading Stock, including Livestock 3.1.4 The opening tax value of trad in g stock should be, a t the tax p ay er's option e ith e r: a the tax value determ ined in accordance w ith the tax ru les of the country of residence of the company; or b the tax value determ ined in accordance w ith New Zealand tax ru le s . This opening value of trading stock should be deemed to be cost for the purpose of subsequent value fo r branch-equivalent income determ ination. Financial Arrangements 3.1.5 The opening tax value of fin an cial arrangem ents should be, a t the tax p ay er's option e ith e r: a m arket value; or b adjusted base p rice, being acq u isitio n p rice plus accrued expenses less payments in the case of issu e rs, and acq u isitio n price plus accrued income less payments received in the case of holders. 91 Prepayments 3.1.6 If under New Zealand income tax ru les a resid en t incurs a deductible expense in the accounting year of the foreign co n tro lled company preceding the accounting year in which income is assessed to the resid en t on a branch-equivalent b asis, the taxpayer should not be perm itted to include an adjustm ent fo r prepayments in respect of the expense in the opening balance sheet. However, if a deduction would not have been perm itted in respect of the previous accounting year under New Zealand tax ru les, an opening adjustm ent to the balance sheet fo r prepayments in respect of the deduction should be perm itted. Specified Leases 3.1.7 S pecified leases entered into by a co ntrolled foreign company a fte r 1 A pril 1988 would be brought into the balance sheet fo r the purpose of computing branch-equivalent income as if New Zealand tax ru les had applied from the commencement of the lease. S pecified leases entered in to before th a t date should be disregarded. 3.2 C alculation of Annual Income 3.2.1 There are two basic approaches to the calcu latio n of annual income on a branch-equivalent b asis. One is to apply New Zealand tax ru les and conversion to New Zealand currency on a tran sactio n -b y -tran sactio n b asis. The other is to apply New Zealand tax ru les to item s in the p ro fit and loss account in the foreign currency, and convert the net annual income to New 92 Zealand currency as a second step . The la tte r method is im p licit in the CD, and the Committee considers th a t i t is preferable on the grounds of m inim ising compliance c o sts. 3.2.2 In general, the application of New Zealand tax ru les w ithin the branch-equivalent regime as recommended should not impose undue compliance costs on New Zealand taxpayers. There are a t le a st two types of provision, however, which may need amendment. 3.2.3 S pecific references to "New Zealand" in the Income Tax Act w ill need to be reviewed to determ ine whether the relev an t provision: o ffers a b en efit or concession intended to be confined to New Zealand; contains a d e fin itio n of New Zealand source income; or lim its the scope of the tax n et. Such provisions may need to be m odified in the context of the branch-equivalent regim e. As a general ru le, provisions of the Income Tax Act th a t provide a sp ecific tax concession fo r income sourced in New Zealand should not be taken in to account when computing income on a branch-equivalent b asis. 3.2.4 A review w ill also be undertaken by the Committee of the ap p licatio n of the associated persons provisions of the Income Tax Act. There does not, for example, seem to be any ju s tific a tio n for determ ining the a sse ssa b ility of the income of controlled foreign companies to resid en ts by reference to the a c tiv itie s of associated persons who are non-resident shareholders. 93 3.3 Conversion Rules 3.3.1 I t is proposed th a t branch-equivalent income, expressed as a sin g le figure in foreign currency, be converted in to New Zealand currency a t the average of the mid-monthly exchange ra te s fo r the relev an t year. Exchange ra te movements in resp ect of balance sheet item s would not be taken into account in determ ining annual branch-equivalent income. 3.4 D iffering Balance Dates 3.4.1 A tax p ay er's share of the income of co ntrolled foreign companies should be assessable in h is or her income year in accordance w ith section 15(1) of the Income Tax Act. That is , a taxpayer would include the branch-equivalent income of a co n tro lled foreign company in income for the income year ending w ith the 31st day of March nearest to the end of the foreign company's accounting year. 3.4.2 For in te re sts in controlled foreign companies taxable from A pril 1 1988, or from the date when the regime may otherw ise apply pursuant to the tra n sitio n a l provisions se t out in the Com m ittee's rep o rt, annual branch-equivalent income would be p ro -rated to apply to th a t proportion of the foreign company' s accounting year subsequent to the commencement date of the regim e. 3.4.3 This means th a t a taxpayer would be required to compute income according to New Zealand income tax ru les (including adjustm ents to the opening balance sheet se t out in paragraphs 3.1.2 to 3.1.7) for the accounting year of the foreign company th a t strad d les the date from which the regime applies. 94 3.5 Losses 3.5.1 Ju st as past p ro fits would not be subject to the new regim e, the Committee considers th a t th ere should also be no re lie f fo r p ast lo sses, except to the extent th a t the tra n sitio n a l measures recommended by the Committee w ill provide a period of adjustm ent and p o ten tial lo ss recoupment fo r taxpayers covered by them. With th is lim ited exception, p ast losses should not be able to be brought forward in to the f ir s t year of the branch-equivalent regim e. 3.5.2 Q uite ap art from m aintaining p a rity of treatm ent w ith past p ro fits , another reason for not perm itting p ast lo sses to be brought forward is th a t they w ill not have been computed according to New Zealand tax ru les, and may w ell be the re s u lt of tax preferences in the foreign country which should not be brought through in to the New Zealand tax base. 3.5.3 There should, however, be a lim ited amount of r e lie f fo r current year lo sses. The CD (page 7) proposed th a t lo sses from in te re sts in non-resident companies could be carried forward or o ffse t against other branch-equivalent income, but not ag ain st other assessable income, w hile losses from in te re sts in tru s ts could only be carried forward. As noted in our rep o rt, the Committee considers th a t these proposals could lead to a sig n ific a n t erosion of New Zealand tax revenue. Taxpayers could defer New Zealand tax by, for example, o ffse ttin g lo sses in high tax ju risd ic tio n s against p ro fits in low tax ju risd ic tio n s, w hile at the same tim e carrying forward the losses to be o ffse t against subsequent y ears' p ro fits in the high tax ju risd ic tio n s. 95 3.5.4 One p o ssib ility being considered by the Committee would be to allow losses in respect of a tax p ay er's income in te re s t in a co n tro lled foreign company to be e ith e r carried forw ard, or o ffse t against the income in respect of income in te re s ts held by the taxpayer in a group of co ntrolled foreign companies resid en t in the same ju risd ic tio n , under the grouping provisions of sections 188 and 191. The Committee w ill rep o rt fu rth er on th is issue. 3.6 Dividends Received by a C ontrolled Foreign Company 3.6.1 As noted in our rep o rt, i t is necessary fo r non- p o rtfo lio dividends received by controlled foreign companies to be e ith e r subject to the w ithholding payment system or to be made assessable. This is necessary to prevent co ntrolled foreign companies being used as dividend trap s to avoid the dom estic ru les th a t apply to non-portfolio dividends. The Committee has yet to consider th is issue in d e ta il but considers th a t the treatm ent of dividends received by co ntrolled foreign companies would be sim plified if they were made assessable. However, to avoid the m ultiple levying of New Zealand tax on dividends, taxpayers would exclude dividends received by a controlled foreign company from another co ntrolled foreign company in re la tio n to which the taxpayer rep o rts income on a branch-equivalent b asis. 3.7 Foreign Tax C redits 3.7.1 The CD proposed th a t foreign tax c re d its be lim ited on an e n tity by e n tity and a source of income basis and be a ttrib u te d on the same basis as the branch-equivalent income of a foreign company. I t is immediately apparent th a t foreign tax should be cred itab le to a taxpayer on the same basis th a t the 96 income of a co n tro lled foreign company is a ttrib u te d (i.e . on the basis of income in te re sts held by taxpayers in co n tro lled foreign com panies). However, issues th a t the Committee has yet to discuss include: a the character of foreign taxes th a t should be c re d ita b le ; b any adjustm ents to foreign tax c re d its over tim e (such as the recognition of tim ing d iffe re n c e s); c the nature and extent of any lim itatio n s for c re d itin g foreign taxes. The Committee w ill rep o rt on these issues in its next rep o rt. 3.8 Treatm ent of Dividends from Tax Paid Income 3.8.1 The Committee o u tlin es in its report problems th a t may re su lt from the adoption of the proposal in the CD th a t taxpayers should be able to deduct dividends they receive from accumulated income of a foreign company for the purposes of computing branch-equivalent income. We consider th a t the proposed im putation system may provide an appropriate means of affording re lie f for dividends received by taxpayers from the accumulated income of a foreign company th a t has been subject to New Zealand income tax. The Im putation C redit Account (ICA) records amounts of New Zealand tax paid by resid en t companies including th a t on the a ttrib u te d income of controlled foreign companies. A ppropriate balances in the ICA could, fo r example, be used to reduce or o ffse t New Zealand tax a t the shareholder level on dividends received by resid en t companies from controlled foreign companies in which they have income in te re s ts . 97 3.8.2 As an a lte rn a tiv e to meeting a w ithholding payment lia b ility in cash, consideration is being given to allow ing resid en t companies the option of meeting w ithholding payment requirem ents in respect of dividends received from co n tro lled foreign companies by: a making appropriate reductions to ICA c re d it balances; or b making an appropriate reduction in any carried forward lo ss of the rec ip ie n t company. In e ith e r case the reduction in tax b en efit a risin g from the reduction in carried forward loss or the ICA balance w ill match the w ithholding payment lia b ility . 3.8.3 In order to avoid m ultiple levying of New Zealand tax on income derived by an individual through a controlled foreign company, i t would be necessary to require the individual to keep the equivalent of an ICA in respect of income a ttrib u te d d ire c tly to him or her under th is regime. 3.8.4 The Committee w ill report fu rth er on th is aspect of the regime in P art 2 of its rep o rt. 98 ANNEX 3 FOREIGN INVESTMENT FUNDS 1 C h a r a c te r is tic s o f F oreign Investm ent Funds 1.1 Foreign investm ent funds are usually e n titie s re sid en t in tax havens which hold p o rtfo lio in te re sts in shares, or which invest in fin an cial arrangem ents, re a l e sta te , comm odities, currencies or a range of such investm ents. The funds often re - invest th e ir income to increase th e ir value, or they may d istrib u te the income to investors in non-taxabl e form s. 1.2 A ty p ical foreign investm ent fund is one which in v ests the savings of its members in order to provide them w ith retirem ent b en efits, such as pension or lump sum superannuation. I ts co n stitu tio n is often not a m aterial consideration. I t may be organised in a form th a t has a fisc a l p erso n ality ap art from its members, such as a company or u n it tru s t. Such a fund is 'fo re ig n ' if i t is not a New Zealand resid en t for tax purposes. 1.3 The shares or u n its of some funds are lis te d on public stock exchanges. Other funds are not lis te d but o ffe r to re - purchase the shares of members, usually a t a price th a t is published from tim e to tim e. Sometimes the price is guaranteed not to fa ll below a certain minimum, perhaps related to the value of the investm ents of the fund v e rifie d by an independent v alu er. 99 2 Need to Counter T axation Advantages o f F oreign Funds 2.1 Where a foreign investm ent fund is based in a ju risd ic tio n th a t lev ies l i t t l e or no income tax, or where the investm ents of the fund are taxed a t a lower ra te than comparable investm ents in New Zealand, resid en ts who invest in the fund enjoy a fisc a l advantage over other New Zealanders who invest dom estically. Some funds d istrib u te dividends to th e ir members. O thers, however, may 'r o ll up' th e ir p ro fits each year into more investm ents so th a t members must s e ll th e ir shares or u n its in order to re a lis e a retu rn . Where a fund ro lls up its income, the fisc a l advantage may be enhanced since the in v e sto r's proceeds on re a lisa tio n are generally tre a te d as a c ap ita l receip t not subject to income tax . 2.2 If the in tern atio n al tax regime did not embrace foreign investm ent funds, they would provide resid en ts w ith an easy opportunity to sh e lte r income from New Zealand tax atio n and thus defeat the in te n t of the regim e. Other countries have found i t necessary to deal w ith such funds, which were being used to circum vent th e ir own in tern atio n al tax regim es. New Zealand must also address foreign investm ents funds, esp ecially in the lig h t of current proposals to reform the tax treatm ent of lif e insurance and superannuation. Domestic superannuation funds are to lose th e ir tax exempt sta tu s whereas many foreign investm ent funds, which provide superannuation b en efits, may enjoy sig n ific a n t tax advantages. If, for tax reasons, resid en ts were induced to invest in these foreign funds, a considerable sw itching of investm ent would occur to the detrim ent of both the New Zealand tax base and dom estic savings in stitu tio n s . 100 3 B a sis fo r Taxing Funds 3.1 Investors may obtain tax b en efits through foreign investm ent funds w ithout co n tro llin g them. They w ill th erefo re slip outside the controlled foreign company regim e. R esidents should nonetheless be taxed on fund income accruing to th e ir b en efit. However, since they do not have control and are unlikely to be able to rep o rt income measured according to New Zealand ru les, an a lte rn a tiv e basis of tax atio n is necessary. I t is considered th a t, as a proxy or surrogate measure fo r the d ire c t tax atio n of income as conventionally defined, the com parative-value b asis of tax atio n (see section 5 below) is appropriate in the follow ing circum stances: – where an investor has straightforw ard access to the underlying income of the fund. This w ill be the case where th ere are w ell-defined means of buying and se llin g in te re s ts ; – where the value of the in te re st is lik e ly to reasonably re fle c t the underlying income. This w ill be the case where the investm ents are e sse n tia lly of a passive nature and producing system atic gains; – where i t is apparent th a t the investor is obtaining a tax advantage. This w ill be the case where the foreign tax levied is lower than the comparable tax in New Zealand. 3.2 I t is considered th a t the regime should apply to any in te re st held by a New Zealand resid en t in a foreign investm ent fund (as defined in section 4 below) where the e ffe c t of making the investm ent is to reduce the tax th a t is levied on the income earned through the fund to a level below th a t which would be paid had the income been taxed in New Zealand as i t accrued. However, 101 as those subject to the regime w ill generally have non-controlling in te re s ts , and th erefo re lim ited access to inform ation, the e ffe c t te s t w ill often involve an elem ent of su b je ctiv ity . Comprehensive d isclosure is th erefo re e sse n tia l to ensure its effectiv en ess. Moreover, other facto rs such as the dom icile or residence of the fund and its d istrib u tio n policy should be taken in to account. 4 D e fin itio n o f F oreign Investm ent Fund 4.1 A foreign investm ent fund w ill be defined by reference to its investm ents. A fund is any leg al e n tity which derives its income or value prim arily or su b sta n tia lly from p o rtfo lio (or non-controlling) investm ents in shares, or from investm ents of a passive nature. 4.2 Thus, investm ents ch aracterisin g an e n tity as a foreign investm ent fund include non-controlling investm ents in companies, tru s ts , p artn ersh ip s and other business and investm ent e n titie s , and investm ents in land held for ren t or other investm ent retu rn , fin an cial arrangem ents, an n u ities, b u llio n , commodities, foreign currency, rig h ts to ro y a ltie s, and rig h ts or options to acquire any of these. Fund investm ents would generally not include co n tro llin g in te re s ts in active businesses or in companies th a t carry on activ e businesses. 4.3 Funds subject to the regime include e n titie s whose prim ary investm ents are in other foreign funds, even where those investm ents represent co n tro llin g in te re sts. Hence, a non- resid en t holding company th a t controlled a number of trading su b sid iaries would not be a fund for purposes of the regim e, but i t would be if i t controlled several investm ent funds. 102 4.4 The ch aracterisatio n of investm ents is c ritic a l because an e n tity earning m ainly activ e rath er than passive income would not be a fund and would fa ll outside the regim e. The d istin c tio n between activ e and passive income is hot p recise, so a t the margin th ere w ill be pressure on the d e fin itio n of a fund. In order to prevent passive income being disguised as activ e income, the need fo r a special anti-avoidance ru le is being considered. 5 Measurement o f A sse ssa b le Income 5.1 A New Zealand resid en t subject to tax on an in te re s t in a foreign investm ent fund w ill be taxed on d istrib u tio n s received plus or minus the change in value of the in te re st from the beginning to the end of the tax p ay er's income year. If th ere is a market for in te re s ts in the fund, eg by way of stock exchange lis tin g , market p rices w ill be employed. Otherwise quoted redem ption p rices offered by fund organisers w ill be used. 5.2 In the absence of such data, taxpayers w ill be required to value th e ir in te re sts in offshore funds by some com m ercially acceptable means. For example, a fund may provide members w ith market valuations of investm ents from tim e to tim e. 5.3 Where re lia b le valuation is unavailable, i t w ill be necessary to impute a ra te of retu rn on the tax p ay er's o rig in a l investm ent in the fund and tax the notional income derived. 103 6 O verlap w ith C o n tro lled F oreign Company Regime 6.1 The d e fin itio n s of 'co n tro lled foreign company' and 'fo reig n investm ent fund' may overlap. Consider a holding company co n tro lled by five or fewer New Zealand resid en ts th a t invests prim arily in p o rtfo lio shares. I t would be a co n tro lled foreign company as w ell as an offshore fund. R esidents holding more than a 10 percent in te re st could be subject to tax tw ice. Hence, a resid en t in th is p o sitio n w ill be required to rep o rt on a branch-equivalent b asis. 104 ANNEX 4 TRUST REGIME 1 In tro d u ctio n 1.1 A tru s t is created whenever a s e ttlo r tra n sfe rs property to tru ste e s to be held for the b en efit of b e n e fic ia rie s. S tric tly speaking, a fu rth er settlem ent on the same tru ste e s for the same b en eficiaries upon the same tru s t provisions creates a new tru s t. For the sake of c la rity , however, the individual tra n sfe rs w ill be referred to in th is annex as "settlem ents" and the c o llectio n of settlem ents made on the same term s as a " tru s t" . 1.2 T rust income which vests in or is d istrib u te d to b e n eficiarie s is termed "b en e ficiaries' income". By " tru st income" we mean income which is not vested or d istrib u te d and th erefo re belongs to b e n eficiarie s, defined or undefined, whose in te re sts w ill c ry s ta llise only in the future. 1.3 Though there is no present beneficiary in whose hands tru s t income can feasib ly be taxed, the objective of the in tern atio n al tax reform s require th a t the income be taxed on an annual b asis. The issues are th erefo re: a when should tru s t income be subject to New Zealand tax ; and b who should bear the lia b ility for the tax? 105 2 R esidence and Taxpayer 2.1 For individuals and companies, the f ir s t question is answered in term s of residence and source. The in te rn atio n al regime extends th is basic stru ctu re by a ttrib u tin g to New Zealand resid en t shareholders a share of the taxable income (including non-New Zealand source income) derived by non-resident companies. 2.2 In the Com mittee's view, the tax atio n of tru s ts should follow th a t of individuals and companies by developing ru les for the residence of tru s ts . 2.3 D eterm ination of residence defines the income to be taxed (worldwide income or source incom e). A closely re la te d but separate issue is the id e n tific a tio n of the taxpayer. I t is d esirab le fo r p ra c tic a l and philosophical reasons th a t, wherever po ssib le, the rec ip ie n t of the income should be the taxpayer. If th is is not p o ssib le, the residence of the taxpayer and the income rec ip ie n t should be the same, since residence is a key c rite rio n fo r determ ining the amount of income which is taxable. F ailing th a t, for enforcem ent reasons, the taxpayer must be a person who is resid en t. 2.4 The only candidates for payers of tax on tru s t income are the tru ste e s and the s e ttlo r. There is a good case fo r levying tax on the tru ste e s: they are the leg al owners of the income, they have the power of d isp o sitio n over i t and th erefo re the a b ility to pay tax from tru s t funds. The s e ttlo r has none of these and o rd in arily could not oblige the tru stee s to meet what would be h is or her own tax lia b ility . In fact, the tru ste e s would be in breach of tru s t if they did so. The best source of tax on tru s t income is therefore the tru ste e s. 106 2.5 There are obvious d iffic u ltie s in determ ining the residence of tru s ts by reference to the residence of the tru ste e s. Individual tru ste e s may be resid en t in a number of countries and i t is easy to change the tru ste e s of a tru s t. This would make residence ephem eral. 2.6 I t would be p ossible, by analogy w ith companies, to determ ine residence by a concept such as "centre of adm inistration and co n tro l". Where more than one such centre ex isted , a tie -b rea k er te s t or dual/m ultiple residence ru les would be required. Such provisions would, however, be d iffic u lt for New Zealand to implement u n ila te ra lly in respect of tru s ts w ith centres of adm inistration and control outside New Zealand. In addition, th is approach would not sa tisfy the requirem ent of the in te rn atio n al regime to tax foreign-source tru s t income where the o rig in of the tru s t and/or its corpus goes back to New Zealand. 2.7 An a lte rn a tiv e approach would be to look fo r an ownership analogy w ith companies. Corporate stru c tu re s provide a nexus of ownership between the offshore corporate income and New Zealand resid en t shareholders su ffic ie n t to ju s tify taxing those shareholders on such income, provided th a t they have a power of d isp o sitio n over the income or over system atic gains which are a reasonable surrogate for i t . 2.8 The point of tru s ts , however, is th a t the ownership nexus is severed, except to the extent th a t the s e ttlo r re ta in s a claim over the se ttle d property in the form of outstanding debt. A nexus does, however, e x ist in the form of the influence or control which the s e ttlo r exercises through the establishm ent of the tru s t term s and, in some cases, through the power of the s e ttlo r to appoint or replace tru ste e s. In the context of a n ti- 107 avoidance le g isla tio n , th is more tenuous nexus could be regarded as su ffic ie n t to ju s tify determ ining the residence of a tr u s t by the residence of the s e ttlo r. 2.9 Since no other d e fin itio n of residence is fea sib le as a basis fo r taxing tru s t income, including foreign-source income, we propose th a t tru ste e s should be lia b le fo r tax on tr u s t income on the b asis of residence as determ ined by the residence of the s e ttlo r. 3 Future S ettlem en ts 3.1 There are considerable legal d iffic u ltie s in applying new ru les to ex istin g settlem ents. These are d ealt w ith in section 4 below. New ru les can, however, be applied imm ediately to settlem ents made on or a fte r 17 December 1987, the date of release of the CD. 3.2 T rustees in a foreign ju risd ic tio n may or may not accept th a t th e ir tru s t is a New Zealand resid en t. I t is expected th a t the m ajority w ill do so, and w ill th erefo re pay tax on tru s t income a t the g reater of the foreign or the New Zealand ra te . Should any d efau lt occur, i t is necessary to provide th a t any New Zealand s e ttlo r w ill be deemed to be the agent of the tru ste e s and be assessable and lia b le for tax accordingly. This is not unduly harsh given the fa c t th a t the s e ttlo r w ill know the ru les at the tim e of making the settlem ent and could require an indem nity from the tru ste e s for tax lia b ilitie s . 3.3 For these purposes, "se ttlo r" w ill need to be w idely defined as any person who has, d ire c tly or in d ire ctly , caused an increm ent in w ealth of the tru s t by the tra n sfe r to i t of money, 108 goods, serv ices of other b en efits a t less than arm s-length p rices. Where th ere is more than one resid en t s e ttlo r, the s e ttlo rs should be jo in tly and sev erally lia b le . Where resid en ts and non-residents make settlem ents on the same tru s t, resid en ts w ill be tre a te d as having made a ll settlem ents on the tru s t. This ru le is necessary to avoid the need for com plicated apportionm ent ru les. I t is not disadvantageous because resid en ts and non-residents can make settlem ents on separate tru s ts . 3.4 In summary, we propose th a t the ru les fo r fu tu re settlem ents be as follow s: a " se ttlo r" be defined as any person who provides money, goods, services or other b en efit to a tru s t fo r inadequate consideration, and "settlem ent" be defined accordingly; b a tru s t, being a ll settlem ents made on or a fte r 17 December 1987 by a resid en t s e ttlo r subject to the same tru s t provisions, be resid en t in New Zealand if and as long as any s e ttlo r of the tru s t is resid en t in New Zealand; c s e ttlo rs be required to make d isclo su re, w ithin a se t period, of any settlem ents as defined; d New Zealand resid en t tru s ts be taxable in New Zealand on worldwide tru s t income; e the tru ste e s of a resid en t tru s t be lia b le fo r tax a t the dom estic tru ste e ra te as if the tru ste e s were one individual b en eficially e n title d to the income and be e n title d to a c re d it for any foreign tax paid, but not 109 e n title d to tax rebates or income support m easures; f to the extent th a t any resid en t tru s t fa ils to meet its tax lia b ilitie s , the New Zealand s e ttlo r be lia b le fo r the tax as agent of the tru ste e or, where th ere is more than one resid en t s e ttlo r, they be jo in tly and sev erally lia b le . 4 E x istin g S ettlem en ts 4.1 If the above ru les were applied to ex istin g settlem en ts, they could be unduly harsh because in many ju risd ic tio n s a s e ttlo r has no way of changing h is or her sta tu s as a s e ttlo r and has no legal access to tru s t funds from which to pay the tax . R esident shareholders disadvantaged by the new in te rn atio n al regime fo r companies a t le a st have the option of se llin g th e ir shares. The only way out for a disadvantaged s e ttlo r would be to em igrate from New Zealand. The Committee has th erefo re proposed a tra n sitio n for tru s ts which recognises these leg al c o n strain ts. 5 D istr ib u tio n s 5.1 Under the proposed ru les for future settlem ents, tru ste e s and s e ttlo rs w ill taxed on income which w ill eventually accrue to b e n eficiarie s. At present, individuals who derive foreign income are e n title d to c re d its for foreign tax paid on the income and, in the absence of the general taxation of c a p ita l gains in New Zealand, they are not taxed on cap ital gains. I t is proposed to carry these p rin cip les through to the tax treatm ent of d istrib u tio n s from tru s ts se ttle d a fte r 17 December 1987. 110 5.2 D istrib u tio n s to New Zealand resid en t b e n e fic ia rie s, excluding c a p ita l, c a p ita l gains, and d istrib u tio n s from assessable income which has already borne New Zealand income tax would be taxed in the hands of those b e n eficiarie s, w ith a c re d it for foreign tax paid on the income. For tax purposes, such d istrib u tio n s should be deemed to be made p ro -rata from a ll sources w ithin each income year, and on a la s t in f ir s t out ("LIFO") b asis from year to year. 6 E xtinguishm ent o f a S e ttlo r 6.1 As the tru s t regime proposed by the Committee has as its basis the residence of the s e ttlo r, i t is necessary to have ru les to determ ine the residence of the tru s t on the extinguishm ent of the s e ttlo r. The Committee proposes th a t, on the death of an individual s e ttlo r of a tru s t, whether in te r vivos or testam entary, the future residence of the tru s t should be determ ined by the residence of the s e ttlo r a t death. 6.2 Where a tru s t is a su b -tru st th a t has its e lf been s e ttle d by a tru s t, or where a tru s t has been se ttle d by a company, the s e ttlo r of the tru s t which se ttle d the su b -tru st, or the shareholders of the company, as the case may be, w ill be deemed to be s e ttlo rs of the first-m entioned tru s t. Thus, in the Com mittee's view: : a on the winding up or extinguishm ent of a tru s t which has se ttle d a su b -tru st, the residence of the s e ttlo r of the tru s t should determ ine the future residence of the sub- tru s t; 111 b on the winding up, liq u id atio n , or extinguishm ent of a company s e ttlo r, the residence of the shareholders of the company a t the date of settlem ent should determ ine the future residence of the tru s t. 6.3 These ru les follow the p rin cip le th a t the residence of a tru s t should be traced back to the residence of the o rig in al s e ttlo r. With respect to ru les (a) and (b) above, the s e ttlin g of a tru s t through another tru s t or through a company should be tre a te d as being equivalent to an in d ire ct settlem ent by the s e ttlo r of the f ir s t tru s t or by the shareholders of the company. 6.4 The Committee are considering whether, for these purposes, the b est te s t of the residence of a tru s t is the dom icile ra th e r than the residence of the extinguished s e ttlo r. 7. R e la tio n sh ip Between Proposed Regime and E x istin g Law 7.1 The Committee intends to review the relatio n sh ip between th is proposed tru s t regime and the present law governing ex istin g tru s ts and w ill comment fu rth er in its next report. 112 ANNEX 5 : AN ILLUSTRATIVE TRANSITIONAL LIST OF LOW TAX JURISDICTIONS ANDORRA MACAU ANGUILLA MALAYSIA ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA MARSHALL ISLANDS BAHAMAS MONACO BAHRAIN MONTSERRAT BARBADOS NAURU BERMUDA NETHERLANDS ANTILLES BRITISH CHANNEL ISLANDS NETHERLANDS BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS NEVIS BRUNEI NEW CALEDONIA CAMPIONE NORFOLK ISLAND CAYMAN ISLANDS OMAN COOK ISLANDS PANAMA COSTA RICA PHILIPPINES CYPRUS SAINT HELENA DJIBOUTI SAINT KITTS DOMINICA SAINT LUCIA FRENCH POLYNESIA SAINT VINCENT GIBRALTAR SEYCHELLES GRENADA SINGAPORE HONG KONG SRI LANKA ISLE OF MAN SWITZERLAND JAMAICA TONGA JORDAN TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS KUWAIT UNITED ARAB EMIRATES LIBERIA URUGUAY LIECHTENSTEIN VANUATU LUXEMBOURG VENEZUELA (Some of the above ju risd ic tio n s are lis te d as they tax on a te r r ito r ia l b asis.)

I t co n tain s the recommendations of th e Committee on th e fu rth e r d e ta ile d measures req u ire d fo r th e o p eratio n of th e im putation and in te rn a tio n a l ta x regim es. The d r a f t le g is la tio n fo r th ese regim es is s e t out in a sep ara te annex to th e Com m ittee's re p o rt. As noted by Mr Valabh in h is covering l e t t e r , th e re p o rt involves a number of changes to th e regim es developed by th e Committee and p resen ted in i t s f i r s t re p o rts but nothing which could be d escrib ed as fundam ental. These changes r e f le c t th e d e ta il req u ire d to implement th e regim es in accordance w ith th e s tru c tu re and p rin c ip le s alread y approved. iv The Government supports th e Com m ittee's recommendations su b je c t to some minor changes and re se rv a tio n s on d e fin itio n a l m atters as h ig h lig h ted fu rth e r below. An enormous amount of d e ta il has had to be developed in a r e la tiv e ly sh o rt space of tim e. We concur w ith th e Committee th a t th e o v e ra ll regime is now a t a s u f f ic ie n tly advanced stag e fo r th e le g is la tio n to be c irc u la te d . A fter being introduced to th e House, th e B ill w ill be re fe rre d to a S e lec t Committee. There w ill then be a fin a l o p portunity fo r subm issions. Im putation The Government endorsed th e Committee' s recommendations on im putation s e t out in i t s e a r lie r re p o rt. There were r e la tiv e ly few issu e s th a t req u ired fu rth e r work. The Committee now makes a d d itio n a l recommendations on th e ru le s governing th e a llo c a tio n of im putation c re d its , th e in clu sio n of co -o p erativ e companies and producer boards w ith in th e im putation regim e, the treatm en t of re tu rn s of c a p ita l, th e carry forward of u n u tilis e d im putation c re d its , th e o p eratio n of th e dividend w ithholding payment system, and on consequential changes to the d e fin itio n of a dividend and to th e excess re te n tio n tax and deemed dividend p ro v isio n s. A ll th ese recommendations are supported su b je c t to th e follow ing changes. F ir s t, th e Committee recommends th a t d is trib u tio n s su b je c t to the winding up d is tr ib u tio n tax of 10 p ercen t should not a lso be su b je ct to n o n -resid e n t w ithholding ta x . I t had been envisaged th a t th e winding up d is trib u tio n ta x would be enacted along with th e im putation and in te rn a tio n a l ta x reform s l a t e r in th e year. The Government co n sid ers th a t i t would in stead be p re fe ra b le to enact th is measure as soon as p o ssib le to f a c i l i t a t e th e winding up p rocess. A ccordingly, th e Government has decided th a t th e measure w ill be enacted through th e Taxation Reform (No.4) B ill. v Secondly, th e Committee has recommended th a t frin g e b e n e fits receiv ed by a m ajor shareholder/em ployee be su b je c t to th e FBT regim e ra th e r than th e c u rre n t deemed dividend p ro v isio n s, in re s p e c t of frin g e b e n e fits o th er than loans w ith e ffe c t from 1 A p ril 1988, and in re sp e c t of loans w ith e ff e c t from 1 October 1988. The Government agrees w ith th e extension of th e FBT regime b u t has decided th a t th e change apply to frin g e b e n e fits in clu d in g loans w ith e ff e c t from 1 A pril 1988. I t w ill give fu rth e r co n sid era tio n to th e d e ta ils of th e change to tak e account of an ti-av o id an ce ru le s which are being developed to stre n g th e n th e p ro v isio n al tax regim e. C onsideration also needs to be given to th e im p licatio n s fo r companies which wind up b e fo re th e le g is la tio n extending th e FBT is passed. In i t s e a r l ie r re p o rt th e Committee recommended th a t th e d ate fo r th e f i r s t w ithholding payment by companies, in resp ec t of fo reig n - source dividends received a f te r 1 A pril 1988, be th e 20th of the month follow ing the month in which th e necessary le g is la tio n is passed. Given the scheduled enactm ent of th e le g is la tio n la t e r t h is year, th e Government has decided th a t, in o rder to provide g re a te r c e rta in ty fo r tax p ay ers, th e date fo r th e f i r s t w ithholding payment w ill be 20 January 1989. In te rn a tio n a l Tax The in te rn a tio n a l tax regime recommended by th e Committee in i t s f i r s t re p o rt com prises a b ran ch -eq u iv alen t (BE) regim e, a fo reig n investm ent fund (FIF) regime, and a rev ised t r u s t regim e. The regim es are designed to reduce th e myriad o p p o rtu n itie s fo r re s id e n ts to avoid or d e fe r New Zealand tax where they in terp o se fo re ig n e n ti t ie s between them selves and incom e-producing a s s e ts . The le g is la tio n has been d ra fte d to ensure th a t th e th re e regim es su p p o rt one another and o th er rec en t tax reform . The p ro v isio n s a re n e c e ssa rily d e ta ile d and are supported by a number of a n ti - avoidance p ro v isio n s. These should not be read down given th e c le a r o b je c tiv e of th e reform s. The purpose of th e BE regime is to ta x on a c u rre n t b a sis New Zealand re s id e n ts having economic o r fin a n c ia l in te r e s ts , including co n tin g en t in te r e s ts , in the v i income of any fo reig n company where fiv e or few er re s id e n ts in any manner w hatsoever have a 50 p ercen t or more in te r e s t in th e company. The purpose of th e FIF regime is a lso to tax re s id e n ts on a c u rre n t b a sis where they have in te r e s ts in , but do not c o n tro l, fo reig n e n ti t ie s in which they are ab le to accum ulate income and o b tain ta x a tio n advantages. Such in te r e s ts include p o lic ie s w ith fo reig n l i f e o ffic e s and superannuation funds. The rev ised t r u s t regime supports th e BE and FIF regim es by g e n erally tax in g on a c u rre n t b a sis th e fo reig n -so u rce tr u s te e income of tr u s t s having a New Zealand s e t t l o r , and tax in g to New Zealand re s id e n t b e n e fic ia rie s d is tr ib u tio n s from n o n -resid en t tr u s te e s . We h ig h lig h t th e follow ing fe a tu re s: - A spects of BE Regime Two im portant asp ects here include th e measurement of in te r e s ts and an a d d itio n a l tr a n s itio n a l measure. The Committee o rig in a lly considered th a t a r e s id e n t's c o n tro l and income in te r e s ts be measured on each day of th e fo reig n company's accounting y ear. A fter fu rth e r c o n sid e ra tio n , in lig h t of th e high compliance c o sts of d a ily measurement, th e Committee now recommends th a t a r e s id e n t's c o n tro l and income in te r e s ts be measured a t th e end of each q u a rte r in a year and th a t a n ti-av o id an ce measures be adopted. In our view, th is lin e s tr ik e s th e r ig h t balance between m inim ising compliance c o sts and co u n terin g avoidance. The Committee recommends th a t in re sp e c t of e x is tin g investm ents taxpayers should have th e option of applying th e BE regime before th e end of th e tr a n s itio n a l p erio d so th a t lo sse s during th a t p erio d may be accounted fo r in determ ining fu tu re BE income. In e x e rc isin g t h is optio n , however, tax p ay ers cannot bring in lo sse s and not p r o f its . A ccordingly, tax p ay ers w ill be e n title d to e le c t, in re sp e c t of a l l of t h e ir income in te r e s ts held on 17 December 1987 in a l l CFCs re s id e n t in c o u n trie s not on th e tr a n s itio n a l l i s t , to apply th e BE regime fo r th e accounting y ears of such CFCs f a llin g in whole or in p a rt during th e p erio d 1 A pril 1988 to 31 March 1990. v i i The Government has also decided th e com position o f, and th e n a tu re of th e q u a lific a tio n s to , th e permanent and tr a n s itio n a l cou n try l i s t s as discussed below. - Grey L ist The c o sts of complying w ith th e BE regime should not exceed th e revenue to be gained. For th is reason, taxpayers w ith in te r e s ts in CFCs re s id e n t in c e rta in lis te d c o u n tries w ill not be su b je ct to th e regim e. However, i f s ta te d p referen ces are u tilis e d th e BE regim e w ill apply and income w ill be computed on a sim p lifie d b a s is .

A u s tra lia , Canada, France, Japan, th e Federal Republic of Germany, th e U nited Kingdom, and th e United S ta te s of America w ill be on th e grey l i s t (see Attachment A ). The re le v a n t c o n sid e ra tio n s in deciding th e l i s t included: th e d e fin itio n of ta x a b le income, th e e x te n t of any tax p referen ces, th e le v e l of income tax r a te s , th e e ffic ie n c y of tax a d m in istratio n , and th e e x te n t of p ro te c tio n of th e dom estic tax base (including a com prehensive in te rn a tio n a l tax regime) in each country. I t m ight be argued in c e rta in circum stances th a t a taxpayer w ith an in te r e s t in a CFC in a g r e y - lis t country w ill be tre a te d more favourably than a taxpayer w ith a sim ila r in te r e s t in a non- l i s t e d country. However, favourable treatm en t in th is context means only th a t some taxpayers are freed from a d d itio n a l income c a lc u la tio n s ; i t does not n e c e ssa rily mean th a t th e re is any anomaly in term s of tax l i a b i l i t y . R ather than make a l l taxpayers c a lc u la te t h e ir BE income, i t is p re fe ra b le to re lie v e a t le a s t some from compliance c o sts where th e re is l i t t l e r is k to revenue. - Q u a lific a tio n of Grey L ist The g en eral q u a lific a tio n to th e grey l i s t r e la te s to business income derived by a CFC from o u tsid e th e lis te d country in which i t i s re s id e n t which is not su b je ct to ta x in th a t country.

With re sp e c t to th e recommended ta x a tio n of d is trib u tio n s from t r u s t s , e ffe c tiv e from 1 A pril 1988, th e Government has decided to modify th e treatm en t recommended by th e Committee fo r fo reig n t r u s t s ( tr u s ts which a t no tim e sin ce 17 December 1987 have had a s e t t l o r who is a New Zealand r e s id e n t) .

The second change r e l a t e s to th e r a t e o f ta x a tio n o f t r u s t e e incom e. The Com m ittee h as recommended a co m p lete u p g ra d in g o f th e ta x a tio n o f t r u s t s in c lu d in g th e rem oval o f th e d i s t i n c t i o n betw een s p e c if ie d and n o n -s p e c ifie d t r u s t s from 1 A p ril 1988. The u n ifo rm tre a tm e n t o f t r u s t e e income i s an in te g r a l p a r t o f th e t r u s t regim e and hence o f th e o v e r a ll in te r n a tio n a l regim e sin c e th e BE, t r u s t , and FIF reg im es a re m u tu a lly in te r lo c k in g . - R esid en ce R ules x i A ccordingly, th e tru s te e income of a l l t r u s ts w ill be taxed a t a r a te of 35 p ercen t or a t th e m arginal composite r a te sc a le fo r in d iv id u a ls (whichever is th e higher) in th e c u rre n t y ear. From th e 1989 income y ear, tru s te e income w ill be taxed a t th e top m arginal ra te fo r in d iv id u a ls (33 p ercen t in th a t y e a r ) . T his change w ill mean th a t some tr u s te e income w ill be su b je c t to a h ig h er ra te of tax than i t would otherw ise have been in th e c u rre n t y ear. This move towards a more uniform ta x a tio n of tr u s te e income has been foreshadowed both in term s of th e ra te s as o rig in a lly s e t out in th e No.4 B ill and th e Government's acceptance of th e Com mittee's e a r lie r recommendations on th e reform of th e ta x a tio n of tr u s ts . - E a rlie r R eservations There were th re e issu es on which Government expressed re s e rv a tio n s in response to th e Com m ittee's f i r s t re p o rt on in te rn a tio n a l ta x reform: a th e exclusion from th e fund regime of th e in te r e s ts of re s id e n ts in a c tiv e b usinesses in low tax c o u n trie s; b th e treatm en t of c a p ita l p r o f its from c e rta in tr u s t s ; and c th e tr a n s itio n a l p ro v isio n s in re sp e c t of tr u s t s s e ttle d by re s id e n ts b efore 17 December 1987. The Government m aintains i t s re se rv a tio n in (a) and w ill be c lo s e ly m onitoring th e FIF regime and stren g th en in g i t i f n ecessary . As mentioned below, th e re se rv a tio n s in (b) and (c) a re removed in th e lig h t of changes to th e Com m ittee's recommendations on tr u s ts . The Committee recommends th a t where a t r u s t s e ttle d on or before 17 December 1987 does not wind up before 1 A pril 1988 or th e s e t t l o r , tr u s te e or a b e n e fic ia ry does not pay a tax of 10 p e rc e n t on the n et a sse ts of th e t r u s t a t 31 March 1988, d is tr ib u tio n s from the t r u s t would be tre a te d as n o n -q u alify in g xii d is tr ib u tio n s . This means th a t a l l such d is tr ib u tio n s (o th er than of corpus) would be tax a b le to b e n e fic ia rie s a t a tax r a te of 45 p ercen t. The Government co n sid ers th a t t h is measure p rovides a s u f f ic ie n t in cen tiv e fo r s e t tl o r s in a p o s itio n to do so to wind up such t r u s ts or su b je c t th e ir fo reig n -so u rce tr u s te e income to tax in New Zealand. Under th e n o n -q u alify in g d is tr ib u tio n p ro v isio n s, d is tr ib u tio n s of c a p ita l p r o f its would be taxed to a b e n e fic ia ry . D istrib u tio n s of c a p ita l p r o f its which are not n o n -q u alify in g d is tr ib u tio n s would be n o n -assessab le. C ap ital p r o f its would of course, in some cases, continue to be tax ab le as tru s te e o r b e n e fic ia ry income. C ap ital p r o f its of tr u s t s th a t a re fo reig n investm ent funds would also be tax ab le to re s id e n ts . The recommended ta x a tio n of d is trib u tio n s of c a p ita l p r o f its from t r u s t s i s broadly in lin e w ith e x is tin g trea tm e n t. However, i t w ill need to be reviewed in co n sid erin g th e in tro d u c tio n of a c a p ita l g a in s ta x . Conclusion The Government supports th e recommendations of th e C o n su ltativ e Committee su b je ct to some r e la tiv e ly minor changes and re se rv a tio n s. The changes, as d iscu ssed , r e l a te to : . th e tim ing of th e im plem entation of th e winding up tax on d is tr ib u tio n s ; . th e tim ing of th e exten sio n of th e frin g e b e n e fit regime to major shareholders/em ployees fo r concessionary loans;. th e ta x a tio n of th e fo reig n -so u rce tr u s te e income of c e rta in tr u s t s which have a re s id e n t tr u s te e but no re s id e n t s e t tl o r ; and . th e ta x a tio n of c e rta in d is tr ib u tio n s from fo reig n t r u s t s . As d iscu ssed , th e only p o in ts on which th e Government reserv es i t s p o sitio n a t th is stag e concern: x i i i . th e d e fin itio n of a fo reig n investm ent fund. The Government m aintains i t s e a r lie r re se rv a tio n and w ill stren g th en th e fund regime i f necessary; . th e need fo r an ti-av o id an ce ru le s to support th e extension of th e frin g e b e n e fit ta x ; and . th e d e fin itio n of b e n e fic ia ry income under th e new t r u s t regim e. The Government has also decided th a t in o rd er to provide g re a te r c e rta in ty fo r taxpayers th e d ate fo r the f i r s t w ithholding payment by companies, in re sp e c t of fo reig n -so u rce d ividends received a f te r 1 A pril 1988, w ill be 20 January 1989. In a d d itio n to th e le g is la tio n to implement th e measures recommended by th e Committee, two o th er consequential le g is la tiv e changes are req u ired . One is th e a d d itio n of b e n e fic ia ry income to th e l i s t of income which does not q u a lify fo r th e low income earn er re b a te . This is designed to counter income s p littin g . The o th er change req u ired is th e r a tio n a lis a tio n of th e ra te of ta x a tio n of tr u s te e income. This is n ecessary given th e removal of th e d is tin c tio n between s p e c ifie d and n o n -sp ecified tr u s ts under th e new t r u s t regim e. These changes to g e th e r w ith th e d is tr ib u tio n winding up tax w ill be implemented through th e T axation Reform (No.4) B ill. The Government has decided th e com position o f, and th e n atu re of th e q u a lific a tio n s to , th e permanent and tr a n s itio n a l cou n try l i s t s fo r th e purposes of th e BE regim e. The l i s t s are s e t out in Attachments A and B to th is statem ent. Once again we record our thanks to th e Committee. I t is to be commended fo r i t s re p o rt and fo r i t s p ro fe ssio n a l commitment to seein g through an extrem ely d i f f ic u lt job. Chaired by Mr A rthur V alabh, th e Committee com prises Dr Robin Congreve, Mr S tu a rt H utchinson, Dr Susan Lojkine, P ro fesso r John Prebble and Mr Tim Robinson. x iv After being introduced to the House, the B ill giving effect to the imputation and international tax reforms will be referred to a Select Committee. There w ill then be a final opportunity for submissions. We commend a close examination of the Committee's report and the draft legislation to a ll interested p arties.

The l i s t is re fe rre d to as "grey" because i t may be q u a lifie d by th e l is ti n g of c e rta in s ig n ific a n t tax p refe ren c es. 1 .3 .2 Since by fa r th e bulk of e x is tin g New Zealand investm ent o verseas is in th ese c o u n trie s, i t is not su rp risin g th a t fu rth e r e la b o ra tio n of th e exact d e ta ils of th e o p eratio n of th e grey l i s t exemption have been sought by tax p r a c titio n e r s and b u sin e sse s. In a d d itio n , a number of c ritic is m s have been made: th a t th e l i s t should be expanded, perhaps to include a l l of th e c o u n trie s w ith which New Zealand has a ta x tr e a ty ; th a t i t should not be q u a lifie d by th e lis ti n g of p referen ces; th a t no c r i t e r i a have been given fo r deciding what p referen ces would be lis te d ; th a t th e re should be no "look through" of a CFC re s id e n t in a grey l i s t country to CFCs underneath i t ; and th a t th e compliance c o sts of th e regime would be unmanageable i f i t freq u e n tly ap p lied to CFCs in grey l i s t c o u n trie s. 1 .3 .3 These concerns to some ex te n t r e f le c t th e u n c e rta in ty th a t a r is e s when tax reform s are developed during a c o n su lta tiv e p ro cess. Though everyone would wish to see u n c e rta in ty minimised to th e g re a te s t e x te n t p o ssib le , some co n sid erab le u n c e rta in ty is in e v ita b le i f th e Government's reform proposals are to be the su b je c t of p riv a te se c to r input and c o n su lta tio n . The tra d e o ff is th a t a b e tte r r e s u lt w ill u su ally emerge. I t is not p o ssib le to have c o n su lta tio n and c e rta in ty . 1 .3 .4 In P art 1 of our Report on In te rn a tio n a l Tax Reform, we sa id th e l i s t should include c o u n tries "which have comprehensive 4 in te rn a tio n a l tax ru le s in clu d in g CFC regim es" (page 19 of our r e p o r t) . The governing p rin c ip le fo r l i s t i n g a country is th a t, i f th e BE regime were ap p lied in re sp e c t o f CFCs re s id e n t in th a t country, i t would be probable th a t the ta x c r e d it allow ed fo r tax paid by a CFC re s id e n t th e re would be s u f f ic ie n t to o ffs e t th e New Zealand tax l i a b i l i t y on th a t income. In o th er words, th e compliance c o sts of th e regime would be ex cessiv e in r e la tio n to any revenue lik e ly to be ra is e d . 1 .3 .5 Whether or not th e income tax paid by a CFC is lik e ly to be comparable to th e tax th a t would be le v ie d on i t s income under the BE regime w ill depend on th e d e fin itio n of tax a b le income in i t s country of resid en ce (such as whether th e re are s ig n if ic a n t tax p re fe re n c e s ), income tax r a te s , th e e ffic ie n c y of th e tax a d m in istratio n and th e e x te n t to which th e dom estic ta x base is p ro tec te d from avoidance. The ex isten ce of comprehensive in te rn a tio n a l tax ru le s is re le v a n t to th e l a s t fa c to r, in p a r tic u la r . The ta x le g is la tio n by i t s e l f may suggest th a t nom inally high ra te s of ta x w ill be payable, but i f th e re are in te rn a tio n a l planning o p p o rtu n itie s e ff e c tiv e ra te s may be very d if f e r e n t. 1 .3 .6 We co n sid er th a t th e ex isten ce of a CFC regime is in d ic a tiv e of an income ta x system and a d m in istra tio n in re sp e c t of which i t can reasonably be assumed th a t th e e ffe c tiv e tax ra te s on business income in th o se c o u n trie s do not d ep art s u b s ta n tia lly from th e s ta tu to ry r a te s .

With resp ec t to r e la tiv e s , given th a t th e ta x consequences fo r a person of having someone e ls e deemed to be h is or h er nominee may be s u b s ta n tia l, we propose th a t only c h ild re n under 18 y ears of age be deemed to be nominees of a person u n less th e person can e s ta b lis h oth erw ise. In a d d itio n , we propose th a t a bare tru s te e ( i .e . a tr u s te e who holds p ro p erty to th e o rd er of a b e n eficiary ) be included in th e d e fin itio n . (A broader in clu sio n of r e la tiv e s and tru s te e s is proposed fo r th e d e fin itio n of a sso c iated p erso n s.) 2 .6 .4 To support th e d e fin itio n , we propose th a t th e d e fin itio n of a nominee include a person who has e n te red in to an arrangem ent or understanding w ith another person w ith resp ec t to th e holding or ex ercisin g of r ig h ts or powers in r e la tio n to fo reig n companies. Recommendation 2 .6 .5 The Committee therefore recommends th a t, for the purposes of the BE regime, a nominee o f a person be defined to include: a a child of the person under 18 years of age, unless the person can esta b lish otherwise; b a bare tru stee; and 21 c a person who has entered into an arrangement or understanding with that person with respect to the holding or exercising of righ ts or powers. 2.7 D efinition of "Associated Persons" 2 .7 .1 A nominee of a person is in e ffe c t th a t p e rso n 's agent. The d e fin itio n of asso c iated persons aims to embrace persons who are not re la te d as p rin c ip a l and agent but who, because of th e ir perso n al or economic re la tio n s h ip , can reasonably be assumed to have s im ila r economic in te r e s ts . For example, two companies owned by th e same sh areh o ld ers may not be re la te d as p rin c ip a l and nominee but w ill n e v erth eless have s u b s ta n tia lly s im ila r i f not id e n tic a l economic in te r e s ts . They should th e re fo re be tre a te d as a sso c ia te d persons. 2 .7 .2 In th e context of th e BE regim e, we propose th a t in te r e s ts in fo reig n companies held by a sso c iated persons be aggregated fo r th e purposes of th e co n tro l t e s t , but not fo r the purposes of income a ttr ib u tio n . The income a ttr ib u te d to any person would depend only on th e in te r e s ts th a t th e person holds d ir e c tly , through nominees, or through o th er c o n tro lle d fo reig n companies. (In te re s ts held by th e nominees of a person should be aggregated w ith th a t p e rso n 's own d ir e c t and in d ire c t in te r e s ts fo r th e purposes of determ ining both th e c o n tro l and income in te r e s ts of th e person.) 2 .7 .3 The p resen t Act co n tain s a general d e fin itio n of a sso c ia te d persons in se ctio n 8. In b r ie f , th is se c tio n d efin es a sso c ia te d persons as any two companies which c o n sist of s u b s ta n tia lly the same sh areh o ld ers or th a t are under th e co n tro l of th e same persons; a person and a company where th a t person owns 25 p ercen t or more of th e sh ares in th e company; two persons who a re r e la tiv e s ; and a person and a p a rtn e rsh ip where th a t 22 p e rso n i s a s s o c ia te d w ith a p a r tn e r .

Depending on whether in te r e s ts a re held d ir e c tly or in d ire c tly through companies or a sso c iated persons, a p e rso n 's c o n tro l in te r e s t may be d if f e r e n t from h is or her income in te r e s t. 3.1.2 The o b je c tiv e of th is ch ap ter is to s e t out th e Com m ittee's recommendations on th e d eterm in atio n of c o n tro l and income in te r e s ts .

In g en eral, th e se rig h ts or powers a tta c h to sh ares and a re held by th e sh areh o ld ers of th e company. D iffe re n t c la ss e s of sh ares may, however, have a wide v a rie ty of r ig h ts a ttac h ed to them so th a t i t is not s u f f ic ie n t to focus on th e percentage of th e sh ares held by a person. Thus, co n tro l and income in te r e s ts in a fo reig n 27 company need to be defined in term s of: a paid-up c a p ita l; b nominal c a p i ta l ; c r ig h ts to vote or p a rtic ip a te in any d e c isio n - making concerning d is tr ib u tio n s , th e c o n s titu tio n of th e company or v a ria tio n s in i t s c a p ita l (e.g . th e issu in g , redem ption, a c q u isitio n o r c a n c e lla tio n of any s h a re s ); d income of th e company which th e person would be b e n e fic ia lly e n title d to receiv e o r to have d e a lt w ith in h is or her in te r e s t or b eh alf i f i t were d is trib u te d ; and e n et a ss e ts of the company (or th e proceeds from th e r e a lis a tio n th ereo f) which th e person would be b e n e fic ia lly e n title d to receiv e or to have d e a lt w ith in h is or her in te r e s t or b eh alf i f they were d is trib u te d . 3.2.2 The ownership of or an e n title m e n t to acq u ire any one of th ese th in g s in r e la tio n to a fo reig n company w ill be re fe rre d to as an " in te re s t" in th e company. Thus, th e l i s t above sp e c ifie s five c a te g o rie s of in te r e s t. A fo reig n company should be deemed to be a c o n tro lle d fo reig n company (CFC) when fiv e or fewer re s id e n ts , d ir e c tly or in d ire c tly , own or are e n title d to acquire 50 p e rc en t or more of any category of in te r e s t. The meaning of " d ir e c tly or in d ire c tly " is o u tlin e d in th e next se c tio n . For example, i f fiv e or fewer re s id e n ts own 50 p ercen t of th e v o tin g r ig h ts in r e la tio n to the d is trib u tio n s of a fo reig n company, i t should be a CFC. 3.2.3 The income a ttr ib u te d to any re s id e n t having an in te r e s t 28 in a CFC w i l l, how ever, depend on t h a t p e r s o n 's income i n t e r e s t in th e CFC.

I f no in te r e s t were h eld on a measurement day, th e re s id e n t would be deemed not to have held a c o n tro l or income in te r e s t a t any tim e during th a t p revious q u a rte r. 3 .3 .5 As noted above, a tra d e o ff fo r le s s than d a ily measurement is th e n e c e ssity to have p ro v isio n s to c o u n te rac t bed and b re a k fa st tra n s a c tio n s and tem porary changes in th e aggregate in te r e s ts in a fo reig n company. In essence, th e bed and b re a k fa st p ro v isio n would deem a person who had disposed of an in te r e s t in a CFC b efo re a measurement day which had th e e f f e c t of reducing h is or h er a ttr ib u te d income not to have disposed of i t to th e ex te n t th a t an in te r e s t in th e CFC was acquired w ith in a c e rta in p erio d , which we propose be 183 days, a f te r th e d ate of th e d isp o sa l. A p a r a lle l ru le would apply where a person tem p o rarily in creased an in te r e s t b efo re a measurement day which had th e e ff e c t of in creasin g an a ttr ib u te d lo ss. 3 .3 .6 A p e rs o n 's a ttr ib u te d income w ill depend, f i r s t , on w hether a fo reig n company in which he or she holds an in te r e s t is a CFC and, secondly, on h is o r her income in te r e s ts in th e foreign company i f i t is a CFC. As d iscu ssed fu rth e r below, w hether a fo reig n company is a CFC w ill depend on th e in te r e s ts held by re s id e n ts , t h e i r a sso c iated persons and CFCs in which they have a d ir e c t or in d ire c t in te r e s t. Thus, a d isp o sa l and a c q u isitio n around a measurement day by any of th ese p a rtie s w ill a ff e c t th e c o n tro l in te r e s t of th e person. This means th a t i t is necessary to draw th e bed and b re a k fa st p ro v isio n w idely, so th a t i t a p p lie s not ju s t where one person reduces and subsequently in cre ases an in te r e s t in a fo reig n company, but a lso where such a red u ctio n occurs and any o th e r p a rty connected w ith th e person whose in te r e s ts a ffe c t th a t p e rso n 's c o n tro l in te r e s t subsequently acq u ires an in te r e s t. The p ro v isio n should n o t, however, apply where a d isp o sa l or a c q u is itio n is made by one person and an o pposite tra n s a c tio n is made by an o th er person whose c o n tro l in te r e s ts do not a ff e c t th e o th e r 's c o n tro l 33 i n t e r e s t s . 3 .3 .7 The ru le to rev erse th e e ffe c t of tem porary changes in th e ag g reg ate in te r e s ts in a CFC would deem th e change not to have o ccurred to th e ex te n t to which i t is rev ersed w ith in a c e r ta in p erio d , which we propose be 365 days. Where th e p ro v isio n a p p lie s, i t would re q u ire re s id e n ts to determ ine th e ir in te r e s ts on each measurement day in th e p erio d on th e b a sis of the deemed aggregate in te r e s ts . 3 .3 .8 The e ff e c t of th ese ru le s is to ignore fo r in te r e s t measurement purposes changes in in te r e s ts in fo reig n companies which have th e e ff e c t of d e fe atin g th e in te n t and a p p lic a tio n of th e BE regim e. A rem aining problem is th e a c q u isitio n and d isp o sa l of in te r e s ts w ithin a p erio d between successive measurement days. This would have th e e ff e c t of co n v ertin g what would be income under th e BE regime to a g ain . The p rin c ip a l p ro v isio n d ealin g w ith th e ta x a tio n of such gains is se c tio n 65(2)(e ).

The income tax system w ill always be v u ln erab le i f tax a b le income can be converted, in one way or another, in to an exempt c a p ita l gain. A ccordingly, we commented on th e need fo r th e in clu sio n of c a p ita l g ain s w ith in th e income ta x base in our two previous re p o rts. Recommendations 3.3.12 The Committee therefore recommends that: a for the purposes of determining control and income in te re sts in a foreign company, resid en ts be required to measure th e ir in terests in the company in each category of in terest lis te d in 35 paragraph 3 .2.7 on the la s t day of each calendar quarter; b an in terest held on a measurement day be deemed to have been held on every day of the previous quarter; c provisions be included to reverse the e ffe c t of short term transactions and changes in the aggregate in terests in foreign companies which have the e ffe c t of reducing the income attributed to residents or increasing an attributed lo s s ; and d residents who have a control in terest in a foreign company at any time during it s accounting year equal to or higher than 10 percent be required to d isclo se the in terests they hold in the company on it s balance date and any disposals of such in terests made during it s accounting year and where a resident has a control in terest of 10 percent or more in a CFC at any time during it s accounting year, the taxpayer be required to d isclo se the equivalent information in respect of the CFC. 3.4 Calculation of Control In terests 3 .4 .1 We re fe rre d in ch ap ter 2 to th e need to aggregate in te r e s ts held by re s id e n ts through nominees, a sso c ia te d persons and o th er c o n tro lle d companies in order to co u n teract th e in c e n tiv e fo r the d isp e rsio n of in te r e s ts aimed a t avoiding th e c o n tro l t e s t . I n te r e s ts held by a person d ir e c tly w ill be re fe rre d to as " d ire c t co n tro l in te r e s ts " . Those held in d ire c tly through CFCs w ill be re fe rre d to as " in d ire c t c o n tro l in te r e s ts " . 36 A p e rs o n 's t o ta l or aggregate c o n tro l in te r e s t in each category of in te r e s t l is te d in paragraph 3 .2 .1 should be c a lc u la te d by aggregating th e p e rso n 's d ir e c t and in d ire c t c o n tro l in te r e s ts in th a t category and those of a sso c ia te d persons. Any p e rso n 's in te r e s t in any category should include in te r e s ts h e ld by nom inees. 3 .4 .2 The c a lc u la tio n of in d ire c t in te r e s ts re q u ire s th e a ttr ib u tio n to New Zealand re s id e n ts of th e d ir e c t c o n tro l in te r e s ts of CFCs and th e ir a sso c ia te d persons (h e re a fte r to g e th e r re fe rre d to as " q u a lifie d c o n tro l in te r e s ts " ) . We propose th a t, where one CFC is c o n tro lle d by a second CFC, th e q u a lifie d c o n tro l in te r e s ts of th e f i r s t CFC be a ttr ib u te d to the second CFC. The re s u ltin g q u a lifie d c o n tro l in te r e s ts deemed to be held by th e second CFC should then be deemed to be held by the persons who c o n tro l th a t CFC. This t i e r by t i e r or ste p by step a ttr ib u tio n p rocess means th a t th e in te r e s ts being a ttr ib u te d a t each stag e are d ir e c t co n tro l in te r e s ts only. 3 .4 .3 As a general p rin c ip le , we propose th a t such in te r e s ts be a ttr ib u te d to th e sm a llest group of re s id e n ts who have a c o n tro l in te r e s t of 50 p ercen t or g re a te r and, where th e re is more than one such group, to th e group w ith th e h ig h e st aggregate c o n tro l in te r e s t. In p a r tic u la r , we propose th a t: a q u a lifie d c o n tro l in te r e s ts held by a CFC in another fo reig n company be a ttr ib u te d to the group of re s id e n ts who c o n tro l th e CFC ( i .e . who to g e th e r have c o n tro l in te r e s ts t o t a l li n g 50 p ercen t or m ore); b i f th e re is more than one such group, th e q u a lifie d c o n tro l in te r e s ts held by th e CFC be a ttrib u te d to th e sm a lle st group; c i f th ere is more than one such sm a lle st group, 37 th e q u a lifie d co n tro l in te r e s ts held by th e CFC be a ttrib u te d to th e group w ith th e h ig h est aggregate co n tro l in te r e s t in th e CFC; d i f th e re is more than one group which s a t is f ie s ru le c, th e q u a lifie d co n tro l in te r e s ts held by th e CFC be divided eq u ally among them; and e i f th e re is more than one person in any group se le c te d by ru le s a to d, th e q u a lifie d co n tro l in te r e s ts held by th e CFC be apportioned among them according to th e ir income in te r e s ts in th e CFC. 3 .4 .4 In summary, a r e s id e n t's co n tro l in te r e s t in any category of in te r e s t would be th e sum of th e d ir e c t and in d ire c t in te r e s ts of th e person and asso c iated persons. A fo reig n company would be deemed to be a CFC i f th e re is any category of in te r e s t in which th e aggregate co n tro l in te r e s ts of fiv e or fewer re s id e n ts equals or exceeds 50 p ercen t. 3 .4 .5 The co n tro l in te r e s ts of two persons who are a sso c ia te d would each be included in the co n tro l in te r e s t of th e o th e r so th a t, when in te r e s ts are aggregated fo r th e purposes of determ ining whether a fo reig n company is a CFC, m u ltip le counting of co n tro l in te r e s ts may a ris e . I t is th e re fo re necessary to have a general proviso to th e e ffe c t th a t any p e rso n 's (in clu d in g a CFC's) d ir e c t co n tro l in te r e s ts s h a ll be counted only once fo r th e purpose of determ ining whether a fo reig n company is a CFC. 3 .4 .6 Another source of p o te n tia l double counting is th e in c lu sio n , fo r th e purposes of determ ining c o n tro l in te r e s ts , of in te r e s ts which a person holds and those which another person is e n title d to acq u ire. Where one person holds an in te r e s t in a fo reig n company and another person is e n title d to acquire th a t in te r e s t and both are in th e same group of 5 or fewer persons 38 fo r th e purposes of determ ining w hether th e fo reig n company is a CFC, th e in te r e s t would be double counted. We have th e re fo re included in th e d r a f t le g is la tio n a p ro v isio n which would avoid th is type of double counting. 3 .4 .7 I t is necessary to base th e c o n tro l t e s t on th e aggregate in te r e s ts of a sm all number of persons, though th e p a rtic u la r number is a rb itra ry , because th e la rg e r th e group, th e sm aller each p e rso n 's re sp e c tiv e in te r e s t w ill be and th e le s s lik e ly i t is th a t they w ill have s u f f ic ie n t in ce n tiv e or o p portunity to co n cert t h e ir a ctio n s in order to c o n tro l a company. Where, however, th e d ire c to rs of a company c o n tro l i t , th e siz e of th e group is irre le v a n t. We th e re fo re propose th a t a fo reig n company in which th e New Zealand re s id e n t d ire c to rs (or th e ir nominees) have an aggregate c o n tro l in te r e s t of 50 p e rc en t or more be included in th e d e fin itio n of a CFC, irre s p e c tiv e of th e number of such d ire c to rs . 3 .4 .8 I t is im portant to note th a t th e c a lc u la tio n of a p e rso n 's c o n tro l in te r e s t in a fo reig n company re q u ire s th e person to include in te r e s ts which he o r she is c o n tin g en tly or a b so lu te ly e n title d to acquire in th e fu tu re . Thus, in te r e s ts which a person could acq u ire under an option to buy sh ares o r an option to acq u ire such an option must be taken in to account. S im ila rly , in te r e s ts which a person would acq u ire i f another person ex ercised an o p tio n to s e l l such in te r e s ts to them need to be taken in to account where th e term s of th e agreem ent a re such th a t th e ex ercise of the option is a m atter of course. Hence, so -c a lle d "shot-gun p ro v isio n s" in a b u y -se ll agreem ent re q u irin g a p urchaser to buy sh ares in c e rta in circum stances must be taken in to account. In a d d itio n , a rig h t or e n title m e n t to acquire sh ares or v o tin g rig h ts given to a c re d ito r in term s of a debt instrum ent needs to be taken in to account. 3 .4 .9 In stan ces have a rise n in o th e r ju r is d ic tio n s where a p aren t company has tr ie d to avoid having d ir e c t c o n tro l of a 39 fo reig n su b sid ia ry by issu in g shares in th e su b sid ia ry to th e p a r e n t's own sh areh o ld ers. In order th a t th e s u b s id ia ry 's shares are not trad ed se p a ra te ly from those of th e p a re n t, they are "sta p le d " to th e form er. To accommodate th is p o s s ib ility , we propose th a t, where sh ares in a fo reig n company (the "stap led " company) can o rd in a rily be tra n s fe rre d only in conjunction w ith th e sh ares of a New Zealand re s id e n t company or a c o n tro lle d fo reig n company, shares in th e sta p le d company should be deemed to be held by th e New Zealand re sid e n t company or th e c o n tro lle d fo reig n company. This is sim pler than th e a lte r n a tiv e p ro v isio n , d iscu ssed in our previous re p o rt, of tr e a tin g th e sta p le d company as an asso c iated person of th e p aren t company. Recommendations 3.4.10 Accordingly the Committee recommends that: a the control in terest of a resident in a foreign company in any category of in terest be defined as the aggregate of the person's d irect and ind irect control in terests in that category and those of associated persons; b as a general p rin cip le, in terests in a foreign company held by a CFC or associated persons of the CFC be attributed to the group of residents with the highest aggregate control in terest in the CFC and, where there is more than one such group, to the sm allest one and, where there is more than one person in any such group, the in terests of the CFC be apportioned among them according to th eir income in terests in the CFC; c any in terests held by a nominee of a person be deemed to be held by that person; 40 d a foreign company be defined as a CFC in respect of any accounting year of the company i f , on any of the measurement days that f a ll within that accounting year, there are fiv e or fewer residents whose aggregate control in terest in the company in any category of in terest is 50 percent or more; e where residents are directors of a foreign company and in aggregate have a control in terest in the company in any category of in te re st of 50 percent or more, the company be deemed to be a CFC irresp ective of the number of such d irecto rs; and f where shares in a foreign company (the "stapled" company) can be transferred only in conjunction with the shares of a New Zealand resident company or a controlled foreign company, shares in the stapled company be deemed to be held by the New Zealand resid en t company or the controlled foreign company. 3.5 C alculation of Income In terests 3 .5 .1 As noted above, th e in te r e s ts in a fo reig n company to be taken in to account in determ ining th e income to be a ttr ib u te d to a person under th e BE regime can be re fe rre d to as h is or her "income in te r e s t" in th e fo reig n company. We propose th re e d iffe re n c e s between th e d eterm in atio n of c o n tro l and income i n t e r e s t s . 3.5.2 F ir s t, w hile i t is necessary fo r th e purposes of the co n tro l t e s t to tak e in to account in te r e s ts held by a sso c ia te d persons, th is should not be th e case fo r income a ttr ib u tio n 41 purposes. The income in te r e s t of a re s id e n t should depend only on h is or her d ir e c t and in d ire c t in te r e s ts , in clu d in g th o se of nominees, and not those of asso c iated persons. Where both p a r tie s are re s id e n ts , income a ttr ib u ta b le to any in te r e s ts they hold w ill be tax ab le in th e ir hands. Thus, th e re is an im portant d is tin c tio n between nominees and a sso c ia te d persons. 3 .5 .3 Secondly, we propose th a t th e circum stances in which an e n title m e n t to acquire an in te r e s t in a fo reig n company gives r i s e to an income in te r e s t be more circum scribed than we propose fo r co n tro l purposes. A person who is e n title d to acq u ire an in te r e s t in a fo reig n company w ill have a co n tro l in te r e s t in th a t company, but i t w ill not always be ap p ro p ria te to a ttr ib u te income to th a t person. For example, th e in te r e s t to be acquired may be held by another re s id e n t and income would be a ttr ib u te d to th a t re s id e n t. In a d d itio n , e n title m e n ts may not be e x e rc ise d . This w ill g e n erally be th e case i f th e c o n sid era tio n payable to e x ercise th e e n title m e n t exceeds th e m arket value of th e in te r e s t to be acquired. C onversely, where a re s id e n t is e n title d to acq u ire an in te r e s t in a fo reig n company a t le s s th an i t s m arket value, i t is reasonable to assume th a t th e e n title m e n t w ill be ex ercised . The re s id e n t should then have an income in te r e s t in th a t company. S im ila rly , an income in te r e s t should a ris e i f a re s id e n t is e n title d to acquire an in te r e s t h e ld by another person who has receiv ed fin a n c ia l a ssista n c e from th e re s id e n t to acquire th a t in te r e s t. 3 .5 .4 In view of th ese c o n sid era tio n s, we propose th a t an e n title m e n t to acq u ire an in te r e s t in a fo reig n company give r i s e to an income in te r e s t whenever th e c o n sid era tio n payable to e x e rc ise th e e n title m e n t is le s s than th e m arket value of th e in te r e s t to be acquired or when a person who is e n title d to a cq u ire an in te r e s t has given any form of fin a n c ia l a ss is ta n c e , such as a loan, c a n c e lla tio n or red u ctio n of a d eb t, guarantee or o th e r form of indem nity, to the person who holds th e in te r e s t fo r th e purposes of acq u irin g or holding th a t in te r e s t. 42 3 .5.5 In a d d itio n , i t is necessary to support th ese p ro v isio n s by a general an ti-av o id an ce measure th e e f f e c t of which would be to deem a person to hold an in te r e s t which he or she is e n title d to acquire i f th e holding of th a t e n title m e n t has th e e ffe c t of d efeatin g th e in te n t and a p p lic a tio n of these p ro v isio n s. Such a p ro v isio n c le a rly needs to be supported by f u ll d isc lo s u re . E n titlem en ts to acq u ire in te r e s ts in fo reig n companies are to be taken in to account fo r c o n tro l purposes and th e re fo re must be d isc lo sed . Where a p e rso n 's income in te r e s t in a fo reig n company is s ig n if ic a n tly le s s than h is o r her co n tro l in te r e s t, th e Commissioner should re q u ire a re c o n c ilia tio n of th e two. 3 .5 .6 T h ird ly , in d ire c t income in te r e s ts ( i .e . th o se held through CFCs) need to be c a lc u la te d d if f e r e n tly from in d ire c t co n tro l in te r e s ts . As explained in th e previous se c tio n , fo r co n tro l purposes i t is necessary to deem a l l of th e in te r e s ts held by a CFC in a fo reig n company to be in te r e s ts of th e c o n tro llin g sh areh o ld ers of th e CFC. The income of th e underlying company would, however, norm ally be d is tr ib u te d to i t s sh areh o ld ers in p ro p o rtio n to th e ir in te r e s ts in i t . Thus, a 51 p ercen t sh areh o ld er, even though c o n tro llin g a company, would norm ally expect to receiv e only 51 p ercen t of th e income of the company, not 100 p ercen t (although, as noted in se c tio n 3 .2 .6 , in some circum stances, sh areh o ld ers should have 100 p e rc en t of th e income a ttr ib u te d to them ). I t is th e re fo re necessary to compute a p e rso n 's income in te r e s t in a CFC held through another CFC by m u ltip ly in g th e p e rso n 's d ir e c t income in te r e s t (and th a t of any nominees) in th e f i r s t CFC by th a t CFC's d ir e c t income in te r e s t in th e second CFC, and so on. 3 .5 .7 The d ir e c t and in d ire c t in te r e s ts of a person in a CFC w ill be measured on each of th e measurement days f a llin g w ithin th e accounting year of th e CFC. I t w ill be n ecessary fo r th e person to determ ine, fo r each of those measurement days, h is or 43 her d ir e c t and in d ire c t income in te r e s ts in each category of in te r e s t. The p e rso n 's income in te r e s t fo r any q u a rte r should then be taken as th e h ig h est of th e fiv e c a te g o rie s of income in te r e s t of th e person on th e l a s t day of th e q u a rte r. In o th er words, th e person would be deemed to have held th a t h ig h est in te r e s t on each day of th e preceding q u a rte r. 3 .5 .8 The c a lc u la tio n of income in te r e s ts w ill in most cases be a good deal sim pler than th e previous paragraph might suggest. In most companies, th e rig h ts of members by v ir tu e of share ownership to v o te, to share in dividends, to p a r tic ip a te in winding up and so on do not vary from share to sh are, except where th e re are sh ares carry in g a fixed dividend e n title m e n t only. Thus, g e n erally speaking, a sh areh o ld er w ill not need to examine h is or her sh ares category by category to determ ine what percentage of r ig h ts he or she has in each case. In c lo se ly held companies, on th e o th er hand, where a v a rie ty of share c a te g o rie s is more common, th e re is r e la tiv e ly l i t t l e change in shareholding from year to y ear. Moreover, where a company is c lo se ly h eld , a New Zealand sh areh o ld er should not fin d th e ta sk of checking h is or h er income in te r e s t ex cessiv ely onerous. 3 .5 .9 In order to determ ine a p e rso n 's income in te r e s t w ith re sp e c t to a CFC and an accounting year, h is or h er income in te r e s ts in each q u a rte r, c a lc u la te d as o u tlin e d in the previous paragraphs, should be averaged over th e y ear. The r e s u ltin g income in te r e s t re p re se n ts an average in te r e s t of th e person in th e CFC fo r th a t year. This in te r e s t would be th e b a s is of c a lc u la tin g th e income to be a ttr ib u te d to th e person in re s p e c t of th a t CFC and th a t accounting y ear. An e q u iv alen t ru le is needed fo r sh o rt or long accounting p erio d s a ris in g from changes in balance d ates or resid en ce. 3 .5.10 On page 85 of out f i r s t re p o rt, we in d ic ate d th a t we were co n sid erin g an an ti-av o id an ce ru le aimed a t s itu a tio n s where fiv e or fewer taxpayers stru c tu re d th e ir a f f a ir s to achieve an 44 income in te r e s t in a fo reig n company of more than 50 p ercen t but a co n tro l in te r e s t of le s s than a 50 p e rc e n t. On fu rth e r exam ination, we con sid er th a t such an arrangem ent is p o ssib le only where th e taxpayers hold in te r e s ts in th e company through a n o n -co n tro lled company. This would mean th a t th e group may not e x ercise c o n tro l over th e d isp o sitio n of th e underlying company's income and a s s e ts . We th e re fo re co n sid er th a t sp e c ia l p ro v isio n fo r th is s itu a tio n is not needed. The d e fin itio n of a sso c ia te d persons and of a nominee should be s u f f ic ie n t to deal w ith circum stances where th e re is any understanding or arrangem ent between th e group and th e non-control l ed fo reig n company to a c t in co n cert. Recommendations 3.5.11 Accordingly, the Committee recommends that: a the income in terest of a resident in a CFC for any calendar quarter be the highest of the sum of the resid en t's d irect and in d irect income in terests in the CFC on the la s t day of that quarter in the fiv e categories of in terest defined in paragraph 3 .2 .7 ; b an entitlem ent to acquire an in terest in a foreign company give r is e to an income in terest where: i the consideration payable to exercise the entitlem ent is le s s than the market value of the in terest to be acquired; or i i the person holding the entitlem ent has given any form o f finan cial assistan ce to the person holding the in te re st for 45 the purpose of acquiring or holding that in te r e st; or i i i the holding of the entitlem ent has the e ffe c t of defeating the intent and application of the BE regime; c the income in terest of a resident in a foreign company held through a CFC be calculated by m ultiplying the resid en t's d irect income in terest in the CFC by the CFC's d irect income in te re st in the other company, and so on where the in te re st is held through more than one CFC; and d the income in terest of a person in a CFC for any accounting period of the CFC be calculated as the average of the person's income in terests for the quarters which f a ll in that accounting period. 46 CHAPTER 4 – BRANCH EQUIVALENT REGIME: PART 3 – ATTRIBUTION AND COMPUTATION OF BRANCH EQUIVALENT INCOME, LOSSES AND FOREIGN TAX CREDITS 4.1 Introduction 4 .1 .1 R esidents w ith an income in te r e s t of 10 p ercen t or more in a CFC w ill be req u ired to compute th e income or lo ss to be a ttr ib u te d to them in re sp e c t of th a t CFC. This w ill depend on t h e ir income in te r e s t in th e CFC and th e BE income or lo ss of th e CFC. BE income and lo sse s w ill g e n e ra lly be c a lc u la te d according to New Zealand tax law though, as o u tlin e d in se c tio n 4.4 below, a number of d ep artu res from dom estic law are req u ired . Where th e CFC is re s id e n t in a grey l i s t country, i t s re s id e n t sh areh o ld ers w ill be exempt from th e regime u n less th e company u t i l i s e s one or more of what th e Committee co n sid ers, as discu ssed in ch ap ter 1, should be a very lim ite d l i s t of s ig n ific a n t tax p refe ren c es. Where such a CFC does u t i l i s e a lis te d p referen ce, we propose th a t a much sim p lifie d b a sis of computing th e BE income or lo ss of th e company should apply. 4 .1 .2 Where re s id e n ts have an amount of a ttr ib u te d income or lo ss in resp ec t of any accounting y ear of a CFC, they w ill be able to claim a c re d it fo r t h e ir p ro p o rtio n a te share of th e fo reig n tax paid by th e CFC in th a t y ear. We propose th a t p ro v isio n be made fo r th e carry forward of excess fo reig n tax c re d its . We also propose th a t BE lo sse s be "rin g -fen ced " on a ju r is d ic tio n a l b a sis. 4 .1 .3 The broad o u tlin e of th ese p ro v isio n s was decided in response to th e Com m ittee's f i r s t re p o rt. This ch ap ter o u tlin e s our recommendations on th e rem aining d e ta ils of th e a ttr ib u tio n and com putation of BE income and lo s s e s , th e o p eratio n of th e 47 grey l i s t exemption, th e c a lc u la tio n of fo reig n ta x c re d its and a number of r e la te d issu e s. The corresponding p a rts of th e d ra ft le g is la tio n are se c tio n s 245E to 245N. 4.2 A ttribution of Income and Losses 4 .2 .1 In Annex 2 of our e a r lie r re p o rt, we in d ic a te d th a t we favoured an exemption fo r persons w ith income in te r e s ts in a CFC of le s s than 10 p ercen t. Though such re s id e n ts would need to compute t h e ir co n tro l and income in te r e s ts on each of th e four measurement days during a year in order to determ ine th a t th e ir income in te r e s ts f e l l below th e 10 p ercen t th resh o ld , they would not have to in cu r th e p o ssib ly much more s u b s ta n tia l c o sts of computing th e BE income of th e CFC and th e ir p ro p o rtio n a te share of th e fo reig n tax paid by i t . An a lte rn a tiv e would be to have an exem ption fo r re s id e n ts w ith BE income below a c e rta in th resh o ld b u t t h is would be s e lf-d e fe a tin g from th e p o in t of view of m inim ising compliance c o sts sin ce th e re s id e n ts would f i r s t have to compute BE income b efore determ ining whether they were exempt. Hence, th e Committee continues to favour an exemption fo r re s id e n ts who have an income in te r e s t of le s s than 10 p e rc e n t. In o rder to prevent re s id e n ts from fragm enting th e ir income in te r e s ts among asso c iated persons, fo r th e purposes of t h is exemption only, a p e rso n 's income in te r e s ts should include th o se of a sso c ia te d persons. 4 .2 .2 Where a re s id e n t, to g e th e r w ith a sso c iated persons, has an income in te r e s t in a CFC which is above th e 10 p ercen t th re s h o ld , an amount of income or lo ss w ill be a ttr ib u te d to the p erso n . The a ttr ib u te d income or lo ss in re sp e c t of any accounting y ear of th e CFC should be c a lc u la te d by m u ltip ly in g th e r e s id e n t's income in te r e s t in th e CFC fo r th a t year by the BE income or lo ss of th e CFC fo r th a t y ear. 4 .2 .3 As explained in ch ap ter 3, th e d e fin itio n of an 48 in te r e s t in a fo reig n company needs to be wide in o rd er to cover th e v a rie ty of instrum ents or arrangem ents which a re s id e n t could use to c o n tro l and accum ulate income in such a company. The consequence of such a wide d e fin itio n is , however, th a t an a ttr ib u te d lo ss may a ris e where a person has no economic or fin a n c ia l lo s s . For example, a person may have an o p tio n to acquire sh ares in a fo reig n company which, because i t makes a lo ss, is not ex ercised . The economic or fin a n c ia l lo s s of the person is lim ite d to th e amount he or she paid fo r th e option. No p a rt of th e lo ss of th e company should be a ttr ib u te d to th e person. S im ila rly , where a person owns sh ares in a company which makes a lo s s , but th e person has an option to re q u ire another person to purchase th e shares a t a c e rta in p ric e , th e economic or fin a n c ia l lo ss of th e person i s r e s tr ic te d by th e o p tio n . 4 .2 .4 A general response to t h is issu e would be to have a wash-up on d isp o sal of an in te r e s t to the e f f e c t th a t th e cum ulative a ttr ib u te d income or lo ss of a person in re la tio n to any income in te r e s t would be lim ite d to th e o v e ra ll gain or lo ss he or she r e a lis e s on th e d isp o sa l of th e in te r e s t. T his type of p ro v isio n could be considered as a complement to th e general ta x a tio n of c a p ita l g ain s. 4 .2 .5 For th e p re se n t, we propose th a t an a ttr ib u te d lo ss of a re s id e n t not be recognised where th e person s u ffe rs l i t t l e or no economic or fin a n c ia l lo s s . In applying th is p ro v isio n , i t would be necessary to have reg ard to such th in g s as th e ex ten t to which an a ttr ib u te d lo ss i s due to a r ig h t to acq u ire an in te r e s t in a CFC w ith a BE lo s s and to th e e x te n t to which in te r e s ts in a CFC w ith a BE lo s s could be disposed of under an option to re q u ire another person to purchase them. 4 .2 .6 A fu rth e r consequence of th e way in which we have defined an in te r e s t is th a t i t is p o ssib le th a t th e aggregate income in te r e s ts of re s id e n ts may exceed 100 p e rc e n t. For example, one re s id e n t may own 100 p ercen t of th e v o tin g rig h ts of 49 a fo reig n company w hile another holds 100 p ercen t of the dividend r ig h ts , though such an outcome would be unusual. Where i t does occur, more than 100 p ercen t of th e BE income or lo ss of a CFC could be a ttr ib u te d to re s id e n ts . To avoid th is p o s s ib ility , we propose th a t, where th e income in te r e s ts of 10 p ercen t or more of re s id e n ts in a CFC in any accounting year when aggregated would otherw ise exceed 100 p ercen t, th e income in te r e s t of each re s id e n t be apportioned downward so th a t th e aggregate income in te r e s t does not exceed 100 p ercen t. Recommendations 4 .2 .7 The Committee therefore recommends that: a residents be exempt from the BE regime in respect of a CFC and an accounting year of the CFC where th eir income in terest in the CFC for that year and that of any associated persons is le s s than 10 percent; b the attributed income or lo ss of a resident with respect to a CFC and any accounting year of the CFC be calculated by m ultiplying the resid en t's income in terest in the CFC for that year by the BE income or lo ss of the CFC for that year c an attributed lo ss of a resident not be recognised where the resident su ffers l i t t l e or no economic or finan cial lo ss; and d where the aggregate income in terests of 10 percent or more of residents in a CFC in any accounting year would otherwise exceed 100 percent, the income in terest of each resident be apportioned downward so that the aggregate income in terest equals 100 percent. 50 4.3 Adoption of CFC's Accounting Year 4 .3 .1 In Annex 2 of our p rev io u s re p o rt, we considered th a t re s id e n ts should b rin g to account any a ttr ib u te d income or lo ss of a CFC in th e income year corresponding to th e accounting year of th e CFC pursuant to se c tio n 15 of th e Act. Thus, fo r example, i f a CFC had a balance d ate between 1 A p ril and 30 September, any a ttr ib u te d income of re s id e n ts in re sp e c t of th a t CFC would be brought to account in th e income y ear ending on th e preceding 31 March. The advantage of th is ru le is th a t i t is th e same as th a t applying d o m estically . A problem w ith th is approach, however, is th a t where a CFC's balance d ate f a l l s a f te r th a t of th e re s id e n t taxpayer ( i t could be up to one y ear l a t e r ) , th e tax p ay er would have obvious d if f ic u lty c a lc u la tin g th e BE income or lo ss of th e CFC in th e tim e req u ired to f i l e a ta x re tu rn fo r th e y ear and l i t t l e i f any inform ation on which to base h is or h er p ro v isio n a l tax payments. 4 .3 .2 The a lte r n a tiv e ru le would be to re q u ire a ttr ib u te d income and lo sse s to be a llo c a te d to th e income y ear in which the balance d ate of th e CFC f a l l s . This would mean th a t th e balance d ate of th e CFC could never be l a t e r than th a t of i t s re s id e n t sh areh o ld ers, thus reducing th e compliance problem of computing BE income or lo sse s. For t h is reason, we now favour th is approach. 4 .3 .3 As a g en eral ru le , we propose th a t re s id e n ts be req u ired to compute t h e ir c o n tro l and income in te r e s ts in a CFC and i t s BE income or lo ss based on th e accounting year of th e CFC. Where th e accounting year of th e CFC changes, th e Com m issioner's approval of th e use of th e new accounting y ear fo r th e purposes of th e BE regime should be re q u ire d . Since New Zealand has no ju r is d ic tio n over n o n -re sid e n ts, i t is not p ra c tic a b le to req u ire th e CFC i t s e l f to o b tain th e Com m issioner's consent to th e change. 51 4 .3 .4 In determ ining whether to give h is consent to th e use of a new balance d ate by re s id e n ts , th e Commissioner could c o n sid er such fa c to rs as a change of ownership of th e CFC, the requirem ents of th e tax law of th e country of resid en ce of the CFC and th e balance d ates of any o th er companies in th e same group as th e fo reig n company. Where the Commissioner d e clin e s to give h is consent, re s id e n ts would be req u ired to continue to compute th e i r co n tro l in te r e s ts , income in te r e s ts and th e BE income or lo ss of th e CFC on th e b a sis of i t s old accounting y ear. To avoid unnecessary com plexity, th e Com m issioner's d e c isio n should apply to a ll re s id e n ts w ith an in te r e s t in th e fo reig n company. 4 .3 .5 Where a CFC changes i t s balance d ate to a l a t e r d ate and the Commissioner consents to re s id e n ts using th e new accounting y ear, re s id e n ts would compute th e BE income of th e company fo r the long accounting period b u t, to avoid in ce n tiv e s fo r balance d ate changes in order to d efer a ttrib u te d income, the corresponding a ttrib u te d income should be brought to account in th e income year in which the old balance d ate f a l l s . 4 .3 .6 Since i t would be p o ssib le to avoid seeking th e Com m issioner's consent to a balance date change by in stead acq u irin g a new company w ith th e d esired balance d ate, c o n sid e ra tio n may need to be given to stren g th en in g th e Com m issioner's powers such th a t he could re q u ire taxpayers to compute th e BE income of a CFC on th e b a sis of an accounting year d if f e r e n t from th a t of the CFC. 52 Recommendations: 4 .3 .7 Accordingly, the Committee recommends that: a residents be required to report attrib uted income in respect o f a CFC in any accounting year in the income year in which the balance date of the CFC f a l l s ; b where a foreign company changes i t s balance date, resid en ts be required to obtain the Commissioner's consent to compute th e ir control in te re sts, income in te r e sts and attributed income or lo ss in respect of that company on the basis of i t s new accounting year and the Commissioner's decision apply to a ll resid en ts with in te re sts in the company; c where a CFC changes i t s balance date to a la te r date and the Commissioner consents to the residents using the new accounting year, any attributed income of a resident for the resu ltin g long accounting period be brought to account in the income year in which the old balance date f a lls . 4.4 BE Income Calculation 4 .4 .1 In Annex 2 of our f i r s t re p o rt, we o u tlin e d our views on th e general approach th a t should be adopted fo r th e c a lc u la tio n of BE income or lo sse s. As a general r u le , th e BE income or lo ss of a CFC should be c a lc u la te d as i f i t were a New Zealand re s id e n t. A number of d ep artu res from dom estic law a re , however, req u ired : 53 a ru le s are needed to determ ine th e opening value of th e d ep reciab le a s s e ts and tra d in g sto ck of a CFC in th e y ear i t f i r s t comes w ith in th e regim e. As d iscu ssed p rev io u sly , we propose th a t re s id e n ts have th e option of using th e v alu es used by th e CFC fo r ta x purposes in i t s own ju r is d ic tio n (provided th a t they a re not h ig h er than m arket value or th e v alu es th a t would apply had th e CFC been a t a l l tim es a New Zealand r e s id e n t) . Having e le c te d e ith e r o p tio n , th e taxpayer should be req u ired to value a l l of th e d ep reciab le a ss e ts and tra d in g stock of th e CFC on th a t b a sis; b th e a c q u isitio n p ric e of fin a n c ia l arrangem ents in th e i n i t i a l year should be, a t th e o p tio n of th e taxpayer, th e m arket value of th e arrangem ent or i t s ad ju sted base p ric e (being i t s o rig in a l a c q u isitio n p ric e , p lu s th e amount of in te r e s t which has accrued sin ce a c q u isitio n or issu e , le s s th e th e sum of a l l co n sid era tio n p aid , in th e case of an is s u e r, or receiv ed in th e case of a h o ld e r); c th e BE income or lo ss of a CFC should be computed in th e currency which th e CFC uses fo r fin a n c ia l rep o rtin g purposes o r, i f th e re is no such re p o rtin g , th e currency of th e country in which th e CFC is re s id e n t. We propose th a t th e fo reig n currency annual income or lo ss then be converted in to New Zealand d o lla rs a t an average of th e mid-month New Zealand d o lla r/fo re ig n currency spot exchange ra te s fo r th e months f a llin g w ith in th e re p o rtin g p erio d ; 54 d a number of se c tio n s co n tain in c e n tiv e s re la tin g to th e encouragement of investm ent in New Zealand, most of which are now being phased out, which should not apply fo r th e purposes of computing BE income o r lo sse s; e o th er se c tio n s have refe ren c es to th e carry in g on of a b u sin ess in New Zealand. In o rd er th a t they can apply to th e com putation of BE income or lo sse s, where a p p lic a b le , th e b u sin ess c a rrie d on by a CFC needs to be deemed to be c a rrie d on in New Zealand; f dividends receiv ed by re s id e n t companies from n o n -resid en t companies a f te r 1 A p ril 1988 are to be su b je ct to th e w ithholding payment regime. I t is th e re fo re necessary to tax or su b je ct to th e w ithholding payment dividends received by a CFC. Dividends receiv ed by one CFC from another should, however, be exempt in order to avoid m u ltip le ta x a tio n . We th e re fo re propose th a t, in determ ining th e BE income or lo ss of a CFC w ith re sp e c t to any re s id e n t taxpayer, dividends receiv ed by th e CFC be tax a b le , o th e r than dividends which are received from another CFC in re s p e c t of which the taxpayer has an income in te r e s t of 10 p ercen t or more. One consequence of th is p ro v isio n is th a t th e BE income o r lo ss of a CFC may d if f e r fo r d if f e r e n t tax p ay ers according to whether th e CFC has receiv ed dividends from another CFC in which some but not a l l of i t s re s id e n t c o n tro lle rs a lso have an income in te r e s t; 55 g se c tio n 67, th e se c tio n d ealin g w ith p r o f its on land tra n s a c tio n s , gives r is e to an a sse ssab le p r o f it where a taxpayer d isp o ses of land and, a t th e tim e of acq u irin g th e land, th e taxpayer or an asso c iated person was a d e a le r in land, a land developer or a b u ild e r. We co n sid er th a t, fo r th e purposes of th e BE regim e, th e asse ssab le income of a CFC should not be a ffe c te d by th e a c t iv i t ie s of a sso c ia te d persons who are not New Zealand re s id e n ts . A sim ila r p ro v isio n e x is ts in se c tio n 191(4A). I f th is se c tio n ap p lied to a CFC, i t could b rin g w ith in th e BE income of th e CFC p r o f its or gains derived by o th er companies in th e same group. We co n sid er th a t n e ith e r se ctio n should apply to th e ex te n t th a t th e a c t iv i t ie s of a sso c ia te d persons of a CFC who are not New Zealand re s id e n ts would give r is e to income which would be asse ssab le to th e CFC; h a number of se c tio n s r e fe r to o th e r New Zealand s ta tu te s (e.g . th e Bankruptcy Act 1908 and th e Companies Act 1955). These se c tio n s should apply as i f such referen ces were re fe ren c es to eq u iv alen t le g is la tio n in th e country of resid en ce of th e CFC; i se c tio n 117 of th e Act d eals w ith th e recovery of excess d e p re cia tio n on th e d isp o sa l of an a s s e t. The amount of d e p re c ia tio n recovered is equal to th e le s s e r of th e sum of th e d e p re cia tio n deductions allow ed over th e l i f e of th e a s s e t and th e d iffe re n c e between i t s w ritte n down value and i t s c o st p ric e . For th e purposes of applying th is ru le , th e w ritte n down value of an a s s e t should be deemed to be 56 i t s c o st le s s th e sum of th e d e p re c ia tio n deductions allowed under th e BE regim e. The maximum amount of d e p re c ia tio n recovered would then be th e aggregate of th e d e p re c ia tio n deductions allow ed in computing BE income; j se c tio n 129 is th e se c tio n d ealin g w ith th e recovery of in te r e s t on money borrowed to acquire or develop land which is sold w ith in 10 y e ars of i t s purchase. The se c tio n now a p p lie s only to land not used in th e prim ary se c to r. In o rd er th a t th e se ctio n a p p lie s to in te r e s t on money borrowed by a CFC, i t is necessary th a t th e in te r e s t expense of a CFC which is deducted in computing th e BE income of th e CFC be tr e a te d as i f i t were a deduction allowed to th e CFC; k any value added ta x in an overseas country should be accounted fo r in th e same way as GST in New Zealand, as determ ined by se c tio n 140B; l where a taxpayer fin an ces expenditure by way of a Government g ran t o r subsidy, a deduction fo r th e expenditure is not p erm itted . Where th e expenditure r e la te s to a d ep reciab le a s s e t, the d ep reciab le value of th e a s s e t fo r tax purposes is reduced by th e amount of th e g ran t or subsidy. We propose th a t a comparable treatm en t apply to g ran ts o r su b sid ie s receiv ed by a CFC from o th er governm ents. Where a subsidy o r g ran t does not r e la te to d ed u ctib le o r d e p reciab le expenditure, we propose th a t i t should be tre a te d as a sse ssa b le income fo r th e purposes of computing BE income; m th e lo ss carry forward and grouping ru le s in 57 s e c tio n s 188 and 191 sh o u ld n o t a p p ly s in c e , as e x p la in e d in s e c tio n 4 .6 , r e s id e n ts w ill be a b le , s u b je c t to c e r t a i n r e s t r i c t i o n s , to c a rry forw ard and group a t t r i b u t e d lo s s e s .

An investm ent fund in th e form of a u n it t r u s t dom iciled in a tax haven is a ty p ic a l example of such an e n tity . By accum ulating ra th e r than d is trib u tin g most of i t s income, the fund can convert income such as in te r e s t and dividends in to a c a p ita l gain to th e in v e sto r, which can be re a lis e d e ith e r by sa le through a stock exchange or by repurchase by th e fund or i t s m anagers. 5 .1 .2 We defined a fo reig n investm ent fund in our previous re p o rt as any e n tity : a which d eriv es i t s income or value p rim a rily or s u b s ta n tia lly from holding or tra d in g p o rtfo lio investm ents in sh ares, investm ents in debt instrum ents, re a l p ro p erty , commodities, e tc ; and where b th e e ffe c t of the f is c a l resid en ce and th e d is tr ib u tio n p o licy of th e e n tity is to reduce th e ta x payable on th e income of th e e n tity below what i t would have been had th e income been taxed in New Zealand as i t was d erived. 5 .1 .3 The tax ab le income derived by a New Zealand re s id e n t from an in te r e s t in a fo reig n investm ent fund in any income year i s to be c a lc u la te d as th e in crease in th e m arket value of th e 72 in te r e s t over th e income y ear, p lu s any d is tr ib u tio n s rec eiv a b le by th e re s id e n t. 5 .1 .4 This ch ap ter o u tlin e s th e Com m ittee's recommendations on th e rem aining issu es which need to be decided in order to implement th e fo reig n investm ent fund ("FIF") regim e. The re le v a n t se c tio n in th e d r a f t le g is la tio n is se c tio n 245O. 5.2 D efinitions 5 .2 .1 The d e fin itio n of a FIF in th e d ra ft le g is la tio n follow s c lo se ly th e one o u tlin e d above w ith th e follow ing changes. In stead of re fe rrin g to an " e n tity " , th e d e fin itio n l i s t s th e types of e n titie s which could be FIFs, namely, a fo reig n company, a fo reig n u n it t r u s t and a fo reig n superannuation fund ( which to g e th e r can be re fe rre d to as "fo reig n e n t i t i e s " ) . Although a u n it t r u s t is deemed to be a company by se c tio n 211 of th e Income Tax Act, we have ex p ressly re fe rre d to u n it t r u s t s to emphasise th e i r in c lu sio n in th e FIF d e fin itio n . We propose th a t th e new d e fin itio n of "superannuation fund" to be added to se ctio n 2 as a r e s u lt of th e c u rre n t review of th e ta x trea tm e n t of superannuation also apply fo r th e purposes of th e FIF d e fin itio n . 5.2.2 The e x p lic it in c lu sio n of u n it t r u s t s and superannuation funds in th e d e fin itio n reco g n ises th a t some c o u n trie s give favourable ta x treatm en t to such e n ti t ie s . A p a r a lle l change is th e re fo re needed to th e second leg of th e d e fin itio n , which re q u ire s a person to have regard to th e ju r is d ic tio n in which the e n tity is re s id e n t, re q u irin g a person to a lso have regard to be concessionary tax regim es applying w ith in th a t ju r is d ic tio n . 5.2.3 An in te r e s t in a FIF is defined in th e same way as a d ir e c t income in te r e s t in a fo reig n company fo r th e purposes of th e BE regim e. As explained in ch ap ter 3, income in te r e s ts are defined in term s of th e th in g s th a t a sh areh o ld er of a company, or a person e n title d to acq u ire sh ares, would hold. A person 73 may, however, have rig h ts to th e income of a fo reig n e n tity by holding a l i f e insurance or superannuation p o lic y issued by th a t e n tity . Consequently, l i f e insurance or superannuation p o lic ie s must be added to th e d e fin itio n of an in te r e s t in a fo reig n e n tity fo r th e purposes of th e FIF regim e. Such an in te r e s t w ill, however, be tax a b le under th e regime only i f th e fo reig n e n tity th a t issued th e p o licy f a l l s w ithin th e d e fin itio n of a FIF. 5 .2 .4 C onstructive ownership ru le s are not needed in th is regim e sin ce th e re is no co n tro l t e s t , nor do we propose a minimum in te r e s t th resh o ld before th e regime a p p lie s . Given th a t th e m arket value of an in te r e s t in a FIF w ill r e f l e c t th e value of th e F IF 's d ir e c t and in d ire c t in te r e s ts , i t i s necessary to focus on d ir e c t in te r e s ts only. Recommendation 5 .2 .5 Accordingly, the Committee recommends that the foreign investment fund regime apply to in terests in foreign companies, foreign unit tru sts and foreign superannuation funds that f a ll w ithin the d efin itio n of a foreign investment fund and that the d efin itio n of an in terest in a foreign investment fund include p o lic ie s of l i f e insurance or superannuation issued by a foreign investment fund. 5.3 Calculation of FIF Income or Loss 5 .3 .1 The income or lo ss in any income y ear th a t a person d e riv e s from an in te r e s t in a FIF is to be measured by th e change in value of th e in te r e s t over th e y ear. Taking in to account purchases and sa le s w ith in a y ear, th e tax ab le income or lo ss of a person holding an in te r e s t in a FIF in any income year can be d efin ed as: 74 (a + b) − (c + d) where a = th e m arket value of th e in te r e s t held a t th e end of th e income y ear; b = th e m arket value of a l l d is trib u tio n s and any o th er c o n sid era tio n rec eiv a b le by th e person in th a t income year w ith re sp e c t to th a t FIF, in clu d in g any c o n sid e ra tio n re s u ltin g from any d isp o sal of an in te r e s t during th e income year; c = th e m arket value of th e in te r e s t held a t th e end of th e previous income y ear; and d = th e market value of any c o n sid era tio n paid by th e person fo r th e a c q u isitio n of an in te r e s t during th e year. This d e fin itio n is e s s e n tia lly th e same as th e one th a t you approved in response to our recommendation in P a rt 1 of our Report on In te rn a tio n a l Tax Reform. 5 .3 .2 The term "b" in th e above form ula is defined to include w ith in FIF income a l l d is trib u tio n s of a FIF. A ll such d is tr ib u tio n s , whether of income or c a p ita l, need to be included w ith in th e d e fin itio n since any d is tr ib u tio n w ill reduce th e end of year m arket value of a FIF in te r e s t. Furtherm ore, d is tr ib u tio n s should be taxed in th e year they become re c e iv a b le , ra th e r than th e year th a t they are receiv ed , since th e corresponding red u ctio n in th e m arket value of a FIF in te r e s t re s u ltin g from a d is tr ib u tio n w ill be taken in to account on an accru al b a sis. F in a lly , a l l d is tr ib u tio n s must be included, w hether they are in cash o r otherw ise and w hether or not they are receiv ed d ir e c tly or a re c re d ite d in account or are otherw ise d e a lt w ith in th e in te r e s t or on b e h a lf of th e person. 75 5 .4 Treatment o f L osses 5 .4 .1 FIF s have been d e fin e d so t h a t i t can be re a so n a b ly assum ed t h a t th e change in th e m arket v a lu e o f an i n t e r e s t in a FIF o v er an income y e a r w ill r e f l e c t th e change in th e m arket v a lu e o f i t s n e t a s s e ts o v er th e y e a r.

Recommendations 5 .4 .5 A ccordingly, th e Committee recommends th a t: a r e sid e n ts be ab le to aggregate th e ir FIF income and lo s s e s derived in any income year from a l l FIFs in which th ey have an in te r e s t; b where a FIF lo s s derived by a r esid en t in any income year exceed s h is or her FIF income fo r th a t yea r, th e ex cess lo s s be ab le to be deducted from oth er income o f th e r e sid e n t d erived in th a t year to th e ex ten t th a t th e ex cess lo s s i s le s s than an amount equal to th e cum ulative FIF income o f th e r esid e n t d erived in 77 e a rlie r income years, le s s the sum of any excess lo sse s se t o ff against other income in those e a rlie r years pursuant to th is provision; c to the extent that a FIF lo ss cannot be se t o ff against FIF or other income derived in the same income year, i t be carried forward for o ffse t against FIF income derived in future income years; d the carry forward of a FIF lo ss by a company be subject to a 40 percent shareholding continuity te s t sim ilar to that in section 188; and e a FIF lo ss incurred by one company in a sp ecified group of companies be able to be o ffse t against FIF income derived by another company in the sp ecified group subject to provisions equivalent to those in section 191. 5.5 Entry and Exit Provisions 5 .5 .1 Occasions w ill a ris e when an in te r e s t in a FIF w ill f a l l w ith in or cease to be w ith in th e regime w ithout an a c q u isitio n or d isp o sa l a t m arket value occurring a t th e same tim e. This w ill happen when: a a person becomes or ceases to be a re s id e n t; b a person disp o ses of an in te r e s t by way of g i f t or fo r a c o n sid era tio n which is le s s than i t s m arket v alue; c a person d ie s; or d an in te r e s t in a FIF becomes an income 78 in te r e s t in a CFC of not le s s than 10 p ercen t, or v ice v e rsa. In such cases, th e in te r e s t should be deemed to be acquired or disposed o f, as th e case may be, fo r i t s m arket value on the re le v a n t day. Recommendations 5.5.2 Accordingly, the Committee recommends that a deemed acq u isition or disposal at market value occur when: a a person becomes or ceases to be a resident; b a person disposes of an in te re st by way of g if t or for a consideration which is le s s than it s market value; c a person d ies; d an in terest in a FIF becomes an income in terest in a CFC of not le s s than 10 percent; or e an income in te re st in a CFC o f not le s s than 10 percent ceases to be such an in terest but is an in te re st in a FIF. 5.6 C onflict Provisions 5 .6 .1 As decided p rev io u sly , where an in te r e s t in a fo reign company would give r is e to a ttr ib u te d income under both the BE and FIF regim es, th e BE regim e w ill apply. This is provided fo r in se c tio n 245P of th e d r a f t le g is la tio n . The exemption from th e BE regime fo r income in te r e s ts of le s s than 10 p ercen t does n o t, however, apply to th e FIF regime. Thus, persons holding income in te r e s ts in a CFC of le s s than 10 p ercen t may f a l l w ith in th e FIF regime i f th e CFC is a FIF. 79 CHAPTER 6 – TRUSTS 6.1 Introduction 6 .1 .1 In many circum stances, tr u s t s can s u b s titu te fo r CFCs or FIFs. Hence, i t is necessary to support th e BE and FIF regim es w ith a regime applying to t r u s t s . We re fe rre d to th e t r u s t regime in our f i r s t re p o rt as "the s e t t l o r regime" because i t w ill b rin g w ith in th e tax n et th e fo reig n -so u rce tr u s te e income of t r u s ts which have one or more New Zealand re s id e n t s e t tl o r s . This tr u s te e income is now not su b je c t to ta x in New Zealand where th e t r u s t has n o n -resid en t tru s te e s . 6 .1 .2 A fu rth e r d eficien cy w ith th e c u rre n t ru le s i s th e am biguity about th e tax treatm en t of d is trib u tio n s from non- re s id e n t tr u s te e s to New Zealand b e n e fic ia rie s .

With th e re c e n t co n sid erab le f la tte n in g of perso n al income ta x ra te s , th e need fo r such p ro v isio n s has lessen ed .

Where, however, th e superannuation fund is re s id e n t in New Zealand, a sep arate tax regime is to apply to th e ta x a tio n of the tr u s te e income of th e fund.

Deemed dividends would, however, cause com plications in th e a p p lic a tio n of th e a llo c a tio n ru le s .

Thus, a payment or b e n e fit given to a sh areh o ld er of a company may not be deemed to be a dividend u n til some tim e a f te r the end of th e income year in which i t is p aid or co n ferred . Since th e deemed dividend would not have been c re d ite d , i t would tr ig g e r an a d d itio n a l a llo c a tio n d e b it to th e ICA of the company in a previous income year.

As d iscu ssed in c h a p te r 10, b e n e fits p rev io u sly deemed as dividends provided to "m ajor shareholders" who are employees are to be brought w ith in th e frin g e b e n e fit regim e.

The regime w ill apply when fiv e or fewer New Zealand re s id e n ts hold in te r e s ts , e ith e r d ir e c tly or in d ire c tly , or through nominees or asso c iated persons, which add up to 50 p ercen t or more of th e rig h ts or powers of ownership of a foreign company. The ru le s fo r determ ining whether a company is c o n tro lle d are n e c e ssa rily wide in scope. The ru le s fo r a ttr ib u tin g th e income of a c o n tro lle d fo reig n company (CFC) to in d iv id u a l re s id e n ts are more circum scribed. Income or lo ss w ill be c a lc u la te d according to New Zealand tax ru le s , w ith some necessary m o d ificatio n s. 11.2.2 R esidents w ith an income in te r e s t of 10 p ercen t or more in a CFC w ill be req u ired to compute th e ir share of i t s income or lo s s , which is then a ttrib u te d to them w ith a c re d it fo r th e corresponding share of the fo reig n tax paid by th e CFC.

We propose th a t excess tax c re d its should be ab le to be c a rrie d forward.
