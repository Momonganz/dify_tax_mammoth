It was also noted that, under the Business Transformation programme, the Tax Administration Act, in addition to prescribing and supporting the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s care and management role, needs to continue to ensure that the right incentives are in place to maximise compliance with the tax laws. One objective of this discussion document is to firm up the Government’s proposals in Towards a New Tax Administration Act having regard to the submissions received. In doing this, the framework for considering the issues continues to be based on the five dimensions for the new Tax Administration Act: the role of the Commissioner, the role of taxpayers, the role of tax intermediaries, information collection and confidentiality. Two common themes emerged from the submissions: • There is a need for the Commissioner to have some greater flexibility in the application of the law but this should not be at the expense of transparency in her decision-making. • The need for greater information- sharing within government was understood, but this should not be detrimental to taxpayers’ rights to privacy and confidentiality. This document details the Government’s legislative proposals for a wider application of the Commissioner’s care and management function, and more relevant information-sharing and confidentiality rules. The proposal to extend care and management reflects the need for the Commissioner to be more responsive to the needs of taxpayers as suggested by the new compliance model. The information- sharing proposals are predominantly about clarifying Inland Revenue’s role in cross-government sharing, given the vast amount of information Inland Revenue holds – both taxpayer­ 6 specific and non-specific – in the context of the Government’s Better Public Services objective. Towards a new Tax Administration Act also highlighted the important but changing role of tax agents or intermediaries in ensuring taxpayers’ ongoing compliance with our tax laws. This document proposes specific law changes that would better enable a wider group of intermediaries than at present to access the new service offerings provided by Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation, while protecting the integrity of the tax system. The Tax Administration Act 1994 (“TAA”) centres on the rights and obligations of taxpayers, including the records that need to be kept, providing information, interpreting the law and reconciling any different interpretation by Inland Revenue, assessing and amending liabilities, paying and filing on time, and penalties arising from default. All of these rights and obligations, many of which are highly interconnected, need to be considered against the administrative framework provided by the compliance model, the opportunities offered by Inland Revenue’s new system and third-party business software providers, and Inland Revenue’s future organisational design. Chapter 4 of this document considers this very broad topic and related policy questions. Specific proposals are set out in the key areas of amending assessments and binding advice. SUMMARY OF PROPOSALS Tax information and confidentiality • Narrow the coverage of the confidentiality rule to information that would identify a taxpayer. • Retain an ability for the Commissioner to withhold certain non-taxpayer-specific information in order to protect revenue collection. • Clearly set out the broad categories of exceptions to the new taxpayer confidentiality rule. • Provide a legislative framework for sharing Inland Revenue information with other agencies for the provision of public services that: • offers greater flexibility through the use of regulations to authorise sharing • sets out a cohesive set of principles governing when sharing regulations will be appropriate • provides greater, and more consistent, transparency regarding how Inland Revenue information is shared. • Allow information to be shared for public services without 7 need for regulations when the taxpayer concerned has consented. • Retain the obligation on Inland Revenue officers to keep information confidential. • Clarify how the confidentiality rule applies to people who receive Inland Revenue information. • Clarify the penalty for improper disclosure. Information collection • Include a new provision in the TAA that empowers the making of regulations governing the repeat collection of external datasets and provides transparency regarding such collection. • Clarify that information collected for one particular function can be used for any other function of Inland Revenue. Getting it right from the start • Move to a situation where more of Inland Revenue’s resources are focused on helping taxpayers get it right from the start. The proposal is aimed at giving the right level of certainty for a taxpayer at the best stage, subject to Inland Revenue’s resource constraints. The specific proposals being considered include: • significantly reducing the fees for obtaining a binding ruling, at least for small and medium-sized enterprises • allowing post-assessment binding rulings • expanding the scope of the rulings regime. • Expand the current approach to minor errors. The role of tax intermediaries in the transformed administration • Amend the statutory tax agent definition to include those who are in the business of acting on behalf of taxpayers in relation to their tax affairs for a fee or who prepare tax returns on behalf of their employer. This would extend to PAYE and GST filers. • Clarify in the TAA the persons who are eligible for an extension of time, based on whether they prepare income tax returns for 10 or more taxpayers. • Provide a new discretion for the Commissioner to choose not to recognise a person as another taxpayer’s nominated person if doing so would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system. 8 Role of the Commissioner and design of a new Tax Administration Act • Extend the care and management provision to allow the Commissioner some greater administrative flexibility in limited circumstances. • Allow a greater use of regulations for tax administration, including for: • a more tailored approach to different types of taxpayers • trials of tax administration processes. • Amend the structure of the TAA to reflect the modernised tax administration, including basing the Act around core provisions. • Move to a more hierarchical approach to drafting the TAA, including a greater use of broader principles when appropriate.

To do so, agencies need to develop new business models, work more closely with others and harness new technologies to meet emerging challenges. A critical aspect of Better Public Services is improving the use of information within and across agencies. Better use of information is also central to Inland Revenue’s future direction as an intelligence-led agency. Many Better Public Services initiatives are driven by, or are driving, better use of government data. The Government is focused on agencies achieving better outcomes for New Zealanders through wider and smarter use of data held by government.¹ Information is critical to Inland Revenue’s ability to perform its functions. Much of that information is provided by taxpayers. This may be information about themselves (such as in an individual or business income tax return) or about other taxpayers they deal with (such as in an employer monthly schedule). Inland Revenue can enforce the provision of information that is not received through regular channels and has significant powers to do so, but the use of these powers is the exception rather than the rule. For taxpayers to be comfortable providing their information, they need to feel the information requested is reasonable and is treated appropriately by Inland Revenue. Currently, surety is given by what is often referred to as the “tax secrecy” rule – which essentially requires that information provided to Inland Revenue is for tax purposes and will only be used for such purposes.2 Rules about the confidentiality of tax (and taxpayer) information are common across tax agencies internationally. “Tax secrecy”, or at least the component that relates to the confidentiality of a taxpayer’s individual affairs, is seen as a critical component of the integrity of the tax system, as reflected in the definition of integrity in section 6 of the TAA. However, the current rules can lead to tensions – in particular tensions between: • confidentiality and wider government objectives, including the more efficient operation of government and the provision of services that can be achieved through increased cross- government information sharing • confidentiality and the Official Information Act principle of open access to information held by government. Inland Revenue already shares a significant amount of information with other agencies – so this is not a new concept. Rather, the proposals in this document seek to modernise and clarify the rules to better provide for confidentiality and sharing in the future, and balance the trade-offs 11 inherent in decisions about whether to share. Chapter 4 of Towards a new Tax Administration Act began to explore these issues, resulting in a range of submissions. In this chapter the Government sets out its further thinking and proposals for the future tax information confidentiality and disclosure framework. Discussion on the feedback received on Towards a new Tax Administration Act is incorporated into these proposals. ENVIRONMENT The Data Futures Forum, a working group set up by Ministers³ to consider how New Zealand can get the best value from data, has set out the rapidly changing information environment and the possible impacts and opportunities of the ever- increasing digitisation of everyday life. In its first discussion paper, the Forum focused on linking and sharing all that information and the benefits, risks and challenges that arise.4 An example of some of the benefits is the Ministry of Social Development’s use of integrated data from various sources to better understand which services get better outcomes. This enables more efficient and effective targeting of public funds and better service provision to those in need, and is known as the “social investment approach”.5 Data plays a key role in the social investment approach and is a core focus of the newly established Social Investment Unit tasked with implementing this approach. The Social Investment Unit is currently establishing a data exchange, the Data Access Service, which will provide access to identified information under a federated data model, subject to the informed consent of individuals and standards that comply with all relevant legislation. The Government is currently reviewing the Privacy Act and the Statistics Act in this context. Other agencies are also considering their information settings, including the New Zealand Customs Service, which consulted in 2015 on its legislative review, including proposals for a new information sharing framework. Cabinet has recently approved a proposed new framework for inclusion in a new Customs and Excise Bill.6 Previous New Zealand research has indicated that individuals think that more information is shared across government than is in fact the case.7 Further research in 2013 found that small business owners were generally in favour of Inland Revenue sharing information about individual businesses with other government departments; however, the context was important.8 The Privacy Commissioner’s Privacy Concerns and Sharing Data survey for 2016 also found that public concern regarding data sharing within government has decreased from previous years.9 Recent research carried out with businesses on behalf of Inland Revenue has come to similar conclusions for business-related information – namely that context 12 and safeguards are important, and that there is much greater comfort with sharing for government or public good purposes, but little support for sharing if there is exclusively private benefit.1 0 Although the environment is complex and changing, in the proposals contained in this discussion document, the Government is seeking to best address the issues within the tax context, while remaining consistent with the wider government landscape. The proposals seek to future-proof the rules as far as possible, balancing flexibility against a need to ensure New Zealanders trust that the information they provide to Inland Revenue is appropriately used and protected. CURRENT LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK For most public sector agencies the primary rules governing collection and disclosure of information are found in the Privacy Act 1993 and the Official Information Act 1982. For Inland Revenue, however, the primary rules are contained in Part 4 of the TA A . Inland Revenue’s tax secrecy rule is set out in section 81 of the TAA. The term “tax secrecy” does not appear in the TAA, rather section 81 requires all Inland Revenue officers to “maintain, and assist in maintaining, the secrecy of all matters relating to” the Inland Revenue Acts. The confidentiality of tax information is important for three key reasons. First, it is seen as a balance for Inland Revenue’s information- gathering powers. Revenue agencies are traditionally granted wide information-gathering powers so they can ensure that taxpayers are meeting their obligations. Second, confidentiality has also traditionally been considered necessary to promote compliance. The rationale is that taxpayers will be more comfortable providing information to Inland Revenue if they are assured it will go no further. Third, the courts have recently referred to the principle of taxpayer privacy. The right of taxpayers to have their information kept confidential is now also recognised in section 6 of the TAA in defining the integrity of the tax system. While tax (or taxpayer) confidentiality provisions are common across the world, it is important to consider whether these key reasons still apply, or still apply in the same way in modern tax administration, particularly given the greater moves to cross-agency cooperation both domestically and internationally. Many other New Zealand agencies have information-gathering or search powers.11 Inland Revenue’s powers to access information are generally broader than those of other agencies. This is necessary to enable the Commissioner to ensure that taxpayers are meeting their obligations. While many other agencies have various search and seizure powers, these often require a warrant to exercise, whereas this is not the case for Inland Revenue. However, 13 some other agencies with similar broad powers to Inland Revenue are not subject to the same strict rules of confidentiality or secrecy. A transparency reporting trial undertaken by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner in 2015 notes that the majority of government agency information requests do not require a court order, but most are made under statutory compulsion.12 Appendix B to the report summarises the “three tiers” of information gathering: by court order, by statutory compulsion and under the exceptions to the privacy principles set out in the Privacy Act 1993. Another reason given for confidentiality is that it promotes voluntary compliance. Whether this is actually the case has generated some debate, particularly following revelations or allegations of fraud or tax evasion.13 The answer, however, remains unclear.1 4 In the United States, the debate over whether tax privacy promotes individual compliance has been described as “as old as the income tax itself”.15 A further consideration is changing public expectations. In the international, revenue-specific context, there is a significant increase in the information shared, and increasing public expectation that information is available. There also appears to be greater acceptance of information sharing domestically, provided that appropriate safeguards are in place. The Government will be continuing to explore the social licence for data sharing through the work of the Data Futures Partnership. The Partnership is engaging with New Zealanders through a participatory process to inform the development of guidelines designed to support organisations seeking to secure the trust and confidence of the people whose data they are using. A NEW APPROACH FOR TAX INFORMATION What should be confidential In order to administer the tax system and associated social policy products such as Working for Families, child support, student loans and KiwiSaver, Inland Revenue collects and holds information on virtually all New Zealanders, as well as most corporate and other entities, such as trusts and partnerships. This is information that taxpayers are compelled to provide to Inland Revenue, and therefore it must be treated with care. While the Privacy Act provides a framework for the collection, use and disclosure of personal information, much of the information held by Inland Revenue is non-personal, and no equivalent legislative framework exists. Given the breadth of information Inland Revenue holds, and the sensitivity of some of this information, rules about confidentiality are still considered necessar y. A key issue with the current rules about tax information is the difference between Inland Revenue and other government agencies in relation to official information. The 14 i l i Commercial information Debt collection policies Information technology Publicly available information KiwiSaver information Analysis & statistics EXAMPLES OF THE TYPES OF INFORMATION HELD BY INLAND REVENUE Subject to section 81 of the Tax Administration Act Not subject to section 81 of the Tax Administration Act Procurement information Student loan information Inland Revenue employee information Taxpayer-specifc information New proposed policies Informat on obtained & held by In and Revenue but not n relation with the Acts Inland Revenue employee training information Finance & planning information Official Information Act 1982, which The breadth of the rule means that a defines “official information” as wide range of information, relating to including any information held by a procurement, analysis and statistics, department, provides a presumption information technology, finance and of availability of information – that planning, policy development and official information will be available even publicly available information is to requestors unless there is a good subject to the rule in section 81 unless reason for it to be withheld. Reasons a subsequent exception applies. Much for withholding include protecting of this information would not be the privacy of natural persons and not confidential in the hands of any other unreasonably prejudicing commercial government agency. positions or disclosing trade secrets. In Towards a new Tax Administration Act In contrast, the starting point of the the Government proposed narrowing rule relating to tax information is that the coverage of tax secrecy from all Inland Revenue officers must maintain information relating to the Revenue the secrecy of “all matters relating” Acts, to protecting information to the Inland Revenue Acts. While the that identifies, or could identify a precise limits of this rule are not clear, taxpayer. This is the approach taken it is clear that the section is not limited in Australia and Canada, and a similar to information about taxpayers. limitation applies in the United States 15 where the legislation protects “return information”. Submissions received on this proposal were mixed. Some submitters were in support, while others thought that the current broader rule should be retained due to the small size of the New Zealand economy and an associated risk that it would be too easy to identify taxpayers from aggregated information. Those submitters in support of narrowing the coverage of the rule were clear that adequate safeguards for taxpayer information were a necessary precursor. Information that might not identify a taxpayer but that was still commercially sensitive was also a significant concern for several submitters. The key reasons cited for confidentiality of tax information have, at their core, the protection of information about the taxpayers or entities that provide information to Inland Revenue. Each of these concerns – the impact on voluntary compliance, balancing information collection powers or the protection of privacy – is focused on the harm that would result from the disclosure of taxpayer (or entity) information. There does not, therefore, appear to be a clear rationale for the breadth of the current rule, and the inconsistency this creates for Inland Revenue as compared to other agencies with respect to the Official Information Act, as well as the inconsistency with the Government’s Better Public Services objectives. Proposal – taxpayer confidentiality The Government therefore proposes, consistent with the direction indicated in Towards a new Tax Administration Act, to replace the current “tax secrecy” rule with a rule that Inland Revenue must keep confidential information that relates to the affairs of, or identifies (or could identify), a taxpayer. This new rule will better reflect the various policy rationales for protecting certain tax information, and continue to protect sensitive taxpayer information, while allowing the release of more generic, non- taxpayer-specific information. The proposed approach would be similar to the Australian legislation which protects information relating to the affairs of an entity. A key concern submitters raised about the proposal was how the new rule would apply, particularly given the small size of the New Zealand population and markets, and whether it would lead to the release of information that could reasonably identify a taxpayer. The new confidentiality rule would apply not only to information that clearly identifies an entity, but also to information that could be used to identify an entity by a process of deduction. Below are both hypothetical and actual examples demonstrating the boundaries of the rule. 16 Example — the “haysnorkel industry” The Australian Tax Office (ATO) collects information on the volume of production of haysnorkels in Australia. Because haysnorkel production is a very specialised industry, only three firms manufacture haysnorkels in Australia. One major producer meets the needs of most of the Australian market, and two much smaller boutique producers manufacture only a small number of haysnorkels each year. If the ATO were to disclose information on the aggregate production of haysnorkels in Australia, then it would be possible for anyone with a general knowledge of the haysnorkel market to deduce (with a fair degree of accuracy) how many haysnorkels were being manufactured by each producer. In this case, the disclosure of aggregate production information would allow a particular haysnorkel producer to be identified, despite not explicitly doing so. Such aggregate information would therefore be protected information.16 Example — minerals resource rent tax Following the introduction of the minerals resource rent tax (MRRT) in Australia, information was sought from the ATO about the amount of MRRT revenue collected. The ATO refused the requests initially as information from only one quarter was available and there was considered to be a significant risk that particular taxpayers and the amounts they had paid would be identifiable without much difficulty. Following the receipt of a second quarter of revenue the information was disclosed. The decision to release the information was based on a range of factors, including: • that the second quarter income was substantially larger than the first • the total number of MRRT payers • the degree of uncertainty with which such information could be used to deduce what a particular payer had paid advice from the Australian Government Solicitor 17. Example — sharing non- identifying data A New Zealand NGO wants access to de-identified social sector data (from several social sector agencies and Inland Revenue) to support their service delivery. This will enable the NGO to assess which of their services are most effective and therefore better target services in the future. The NGO does not hold individual authorisations to access identified data. It is seeking access to quarterly data that covers their customers and a comparable set of non-customers. Exact data point needs are expected to change over time. 17 Provided the data is aggregated or depersonalised to the extent that individuals cannot be identified, this information would no longer be subject to the confidentiality rule. Access to such data might be directly from Inland Revenue or via a centralised data platform such as the Integrated Data Infrastructure managed by Statistics New Zealand, which contains data from a range of agencies including Inland Revenue. Development of guidance will be important to help Inland Revenue staff and taxpayers understand the new ambit of the rules. Information that identifies a taxpayer will clearly be covered by the rule. Information that does not at first glance identify a taxpayer will also remain protected, if that information could be used to identify a particular taxpayer. While in general the application of the rule will be clear, in some cases the release or withholding of information will need careful consideration. Sensitive information that does not identify a taxpayer Current exceptions allow various types of non-taxpayer-specific information to be released to other government departments or more widely. Some of these exceptions require the application of difficult balancing tests. In some cases this applies to information that would not generally be withheld by other government agencies – for example information for the purposes of understanding or developing policy decisions.18 Under the Official Information Act such information would usually be released (subject to timing if the policy is still under development). Inland Revenue does hold very sensitive information besides that relating to specific taxpayers, and the release of this could damage the integrity of the tax system. This would include information regarding audit or investigative techniques or strategies, compliance information, thresholds, analytical approaches and so on. The release of such information could affect the Crown’s ability to collect revenue, for example by enabling taxpayers to “game” or defraud the system. The Official Information Act allows information to be withheld if the release would prejudice the maintenance of the law, but there is no specific provision allowing information to be withheld if it is required to protect the public revenue19. In contrast, the Australian Freedom of Information Act 1982 contains a number of protections that are used as grounds by the Australian Tax Office to withhold sensitive information that might, if released, damage the tax system or affect revenue collection 20. United Kingdom freedom of information legislation also contains a broader protection for non-taxpayer-specific, sensitive revenue information.21 While Inland Revenue’s sensitive information may be covered by the “maintenance of the law” exception from disclosure in the Official Information Act, that may not always 18 be the case. The protection of public revenue is considered of sufficient importance that a residual protection should be retained in the TAA. This will allow the Commissioner to withhold such information if it is considered likely to affect the integrity of the tax system. When information that identifies a taxpayer could be shared Historically, taxpayer information has been protected because such protection is considered necessary to promote compliance and to act as a balance for broad information- gathering powers. While the commercial environment and society in general have changed significantly, confidentiality of taxpayer information remains important. However, that protection is far from absolute, with more and more exceptions being added to the “tax secrecy” rule. This has led to a legislative framework that could be seen to lack cohesion, transparency and clear unifying principles. The diagram on the following page gives an overview of the information currently able to be shared. The Government proposes to create a new legislative framework for the protection and disclosure of taxpayer information. The new framework aims to provide greater transparency and cohesion when it is considered appropriate to disclose taxpayer information. It also aims to give greater flexibility to disclose information across government, if considered appropriate, in a transparent and controlled way. This is consistent with recent initiatives, such as the approved information-sharing agreement (AISA) framework within the Privacy Act. The information-sharing principles and proposals discussed here are intended to apply regardless of the technology used. Current information sharing occurs using a range of technological solutions, but is generally the transfer of information to others. In the future, information sharing might also include access to Inland Revenue’s systems, controlled with appropriate permissions and monitoring. The four key exceptions to confidentiality cover disclosures: • for purposes related to the tax system • to the taxpayer or their agent • relating to international agreements • to other government agencies for non-tax-related purposes. EXCEPTION 1: DISCLOSURES FOR PURPOSES RELATED TO THE TAX SYSTEM The primary reason for disclosing taxpayer information is for purposes relating to the tax system – in order to administer the laws for which Inland Revenue is responsible. This is why Inland Revenue collects information and will remain the primary exception to the new taxpayer confidentiality rule. 19 ACC Residual claims & levies match MINISTRY OF JUSTICE Employers & fine defaulters match Child support enforcement STATISTICS Tax returns & registrations Student loans repayment & incomes LEED dataset Student loans dataset DEPARTMENT OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS Problem gambling levy Language interpreting services IRD numbers at birth Student loans overseas borrowers Charity registration Deceased person match TREASURY Policy development Taxation revenue forecasting OVERSEAS GOVERNMENTS Double tax agreements FATC A CUSTOMS NEW ZEALAND Child support match Student loans interest match Passenger movement Revenue collection MINISTRY OF EDUCATION Student loan debt for validation of student loan NEW ZEALAND POLICE Criminal proceeds Targeting serious crime AISA MINISTRY OF BUSINESS & INNOVATION Paid parental leave Companies’ IRD & GST numbers Issuing IRD numbers Companies & limited partnership removals Services to new migrants KiwiSaver evaluation dataset NZBN Strengening employment standards R&D Tax credit applications MINISTRY OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT Community Services Card match Start/finish benefits/student match Working for Families tax credits double payment match Working for Families tax credits administration match Proof of identity verification Child support collection Administration of Child support Family tax & benefit research Proactive sharing to reduce benefit debt Enrolling children into KiwiSaver SERIOUS FRAUD OFFICE Detection & prosecution of serious fraud LAND INFORMATION NEW ZEALAND Land transfer transaction tax information WORK SAFE Strengthening workplace standards TWO WAY FLOW OF INFORMATION INFORMATION GOING OUT INFORMATION GOING IN 20 STATISTICS Tax returns & registrations Student loans repayment & incomes LEED dataset Student loans dataset This will be a broad exception, and will consolidate specific exceptions that currently exist throughout the legislation. For example there are current specific exceptions relating to child support, KiwiSaver and student loans disclosures;22 publication of product rulings23 and approved organisations;24 and prosecution of revenue-related offences (when the prosecution is under the Crimes Act or by the Serious Fraud Office).25 Most, if not all, of these specific exceptions could be encapsulated within the exception for purposes relating to the tax system. EXCEPTION 2: DISCLOSURES TO TAXPAYERS AND THEIR AGENTS Disclosures to taxpayers and their agents is another area where significant change is not anticipated. A rule similar to that in the current Act will remain. Administrative processes to enable family members to access information (through a form of agent or nominated persons approach) similar to those used in Canada would be of benefit, particularly in relation to products such as Working for Families tax credits.26 This could be managed as an extension of the existing nominated persons process, through which taxpayers are able to nominate someone to act on their behalf.27 The Canadian approach has tiers of authorisation, so a taxpayer can authorise a nominated person to either view their information, or view and amend the information. A key part of the modernisation of the tax system is enabling taxpayers to interact more easily with Inland Revenue. In many cases this will be through business software – such as the recent enabling of GST return filing directly from accounting software.28 Inland Revenue in turn will be able to send information, confirmation and messages directly to taxpayers’ business software. The TAA was recently amended to clarify that the transmission of customer- specific information via business software provided and maintained by a software intermediary does not breach the secrecy provision.29 This approach will be carried forward into the new rules. EXCEPTION 3: INTERNATIONAL DISCLOSURES Exceptions permitting international information sharing have appeared in the tax legislation since 1946, with the introduction of a provision permitting the disclosure of information under double taxation agreements (DTAs).30 In order for DTAs to operate effectively, information needs to be exchanged between the tax jurisdictions concerned. Such use of information is usually regarded as consistent with the purpose for which it was collected: to correctly determine a taxpayer’s tax obligations. The sharing of tax information across revenue agencies internationally is not a new concept. However, recent initiatives such as the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Assistance in Tax Matters, the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act and the OECD-led Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) have significantly increased the volume and automation of sharing, and will continue to do so in the future. 21 Sharing information under the DTA and Tax Information Exchange Agreement network will remain part of the core legislative framework, and no substantive change is proposed in this discussion document. Inland Revenue consulted earlier in 2016 on the implementation of AEOI,31 and the Government has recently introduced legislation regarding foreign trusts, including disclosure of information about these trusts.32 EXCEPTION 4: DISCLOSURES TO OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES FOR NON-TAX-RELATED PURPOSES The Government is committed to improving the public services available to New Zealanders. A key enabler of better public services is better use of data held by government. In considering the broader use of data, government is essentially balancing private rights (in the privacy or confidentiality of information) against the wider public good of efficient government, upholding the law and ensuring the right people receive the correct entitlements at the appropriate time. Legislation already permits a considerable amount of cross-agency information sharing. However, there is no readily apparent consistent principle to these exceptions. Some are narrow, others broader, and in many cases legislative change has been made for the avoidance of doubt, even for minor changes to information exchanges. The newer exceptions under sections 81A and 81BA are broader and allow sharing that meets certain criteria to be authorised by order in council. • Section 81BA, introduced in 2011, is a specific Inland Revenue provision allowing Inland Revenue to share information with other government agencies. Such agreements can be entered into when the other agency is lawfully able to collect the information itself, but it is more efficient to obtain or verify the information from Inland Revenue.33 • Section 81A, introduced in 2013, allows Inland Revenue to use the approved information-sharing agreement framework set out in Part 9A of the Privacy Act. Such agreements can be entered into for the purpose of the provision of public services by government departments and may also include non-government organisations.34 These exceptions offer a greater degree of transparency, as the order in council and the underlying memorandum of understanding are often published. Such arrangements can also provide for public reporting on the information transfers. This is not the case for much of the information sharing authorised by specific legislative exceptions in section 81(4) of the TAA.35 Taxpayers are compelled to provide their information to Inland Revenue for reasons of public good – the administration of the tax system and other social policy provisions. The Government’s view is that it is appropriate to consider other “public 22 good” uses of the information, particularly when these are consistent with or complementary to the direct reason the information was collected. This discussion document focuses on this type of information sharing. Greater care should be taken in considering uses of the information that move away from the public good, and the Data Futures Partnership will continue to explore these boundaries. In many cases the purpose of proposed information sharing will be clearly within the public good criteria – for example, protecting public safety or ensuring people receive their correct entitlements from the government. In some cases the line between public good and private good may be less clear, or a proposal may contain elements of both. Information sharing agreements – non-consented sharing The Government proposes to modernise the information protection and disclosure framework in the TAA by moving to a regulatory model permitting information sharing (that meets certain legislated criteria) to be authorised by order in council. A regulatory model would provide greater flexibility and timeliness to the implementation and amendment of information-sharing arrangements. The historical legislative model, involving specific exceptions for specific agencies, limited in many cases by purpose and even specific data points, is cumbersome and inflexible. Consideration was given to whether the new rules should require an order in council, or simply be managed through agreements between agencies. Given the importance of taxpayer confidentiality, the Government considers that the regulatory model is more appropriate, as it will retain Cabinet and Regulations Review Committee oversight of proposed agreements. The aim of more flexible information sharing is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of government, while not compromising the ability of Inland Revenue to perform its functions. It also aims to ensure information sharing is safe, proportionate and impacts on the confidentiality of information no more than is considered necessary to achieve the purpose of the sharing. To that end, the proposed model would permit sharing of Inland Revenue information for the provision of public services when: • providing the information would improve the ability of the government to efficiently and effectively deliver services or enforce laws • the information cannot easily or efficiently be obtained or verified from other sources • the amount and type of information provided is proportionate given the purpose for which it is being shared • the information will be adequately protected by the receiving agency 23 • sharing the information will not unduly inhibit the provision of information to Inland Revenue in the future. When these tests are met, the Minister of Revenue may recommend an order in council be made to authorise the sharing. The order in council would set out the agency receiving the information and the broad purpose of the sharing. An underlying memorandum of understanding would then set out the details of: • the classes or types of information to be shared • how the information will be used • how the information will be provided or accessed • requirements for security, storage and disposal • whether and how information can be further disclosed • any review requirements, including disclosure of any breaches. An important concern raised by several submitters on Towards a new Tax Administration Act was that any new cross-government information sharing should not enable other agencies to obtain information they would not otherwise be entitled to. The current section 81BA restricts information-sharing agreements to situations where the requesting agency is “lawfully able to collect” the information. A similar limitation will remain in the new rules. The intention is to ensure that an agency only obtains information necessary to carry out its functions. In a similar way to the Privacy Act AISA model, and as with the proposal for consent-based sharing detailed below, the new framework proposes sharing “for the provision of public services” as opposed to specifying particular classes of organisation that can access the information. The Privacy Act defines a public service as “a public function or duty that is conferred or imposed on a public sector agency by or under law, or by a policy of the Government”.36 24 Example: areas where the new information that is used for levy framework might be used setting for businesses The proposed rules are targeted • sharing information with the at the more efficient and effective Ministry of Business, Innovation operation of government. Broadly and Employment to assist with this would encompass information their responsibilities under sharing to assist: workplace legislation • more efficient delivery (or • sharing information with reduced cost) of a government-the Department of Internal provided service or intervention Affairs that relates to the administration of the Charities • reduced customer compliance Act 2005. burden for a government service or intervention • increased accuracy of financial entitlements or obligations • protection of the public revenue • improved detection of serious illegal activities • improved prevention of harm to citizens • dealing with serious threat to public health or public safety. A primary focus of the new rules would be areas where an AISA under the Privacy Act is not appropriate given the volume of non-personal (company or other entity) information that is to be shared. Examples of current legislated information sharing that could in future be moved within the new framework include: • sharing with ACC, in particular 25 Consent-based sharing In many cases information sharing is undertaken to improve the services offered to New Zealanders, and those affected would consent to their information being shared. Under the Privacy Act, individuals may authorise their information being shared, as privacy is theirs to waive. In contrast, confidentiality of tax information is an obligation imposed on Inland Revenue officers and the consent of the person to whom the information relates is no defence to breaching confidentiality. In Towards a new Tax Administration Act the Government proposed that taxpayers be able to consent to the release of their information to other government agencies. This was considered a way to better enable taxpayers to participate in optional cross-government services, such as initiatives to simplify updating contact details across government agencies. A majority of submitters favoured this proposal, so long as it was limited to within government. The Government intends to proceed with this proposal. The Government has recently announced the development of the “data highway” or Data Access Service as a key part of the social investment approach. Exchange of information is based on the informed consent of the individuals concerned. Allowing information to be shared by consent would enable Inland Revenue to become a part of the data exchange. Inland Revenue holds a significant amount of information, and this will be important to the successful functioning of the data exchange. Enabling consent-based sharing will not affect Inland Revenue’s ability to share information without consent if the authority to do so exists. As these cases will involve taxpayer consent, the Government proposes that Inland Revenue be able to share information with other agencies for the provision of public services if a formal agreement for such sharing is in place. Such agreements would need to specify appropriate conditions for security and handling of information, and include processes to ensure that each taxpayer’s consent is properly obtained and recorded. As with the AISA model in the Privacy Act, it is proposed that sharing be “for the provision of public services” rather than being strictly confined to being within government departments. This will enable, for example, Non- Government Organisations (NGOs) delivering public services on contract to a government department to also have access to the information if appropriate. 26 A family need help finding a new home. They get in contact with a regional housing NGO. The family give the NGO consent to get up-to-date personalised information about them from the government. MSD As consent is obtained from the family, an agreement could be entered into between Inland Revenue, the Ministry of Social Development and the NGO Customer income & NGO other agreed data points Housing This regional housing NGO assists people to find affordable housing and negotiate their housing-related government entitlements. This NGO has a service agreement with Ministry of Social Development (MSD). Once they get consent from the family they require information from Inland Revenue about the family’s social policy entitlements and obligations. Example – consent-based sharing for social service provision A regional NGO assists people to find affordable housing and negotiate their housing-related government entitlements. The NGO has a service agreement with the Ministry of Social Development to provide these services. Customers can be referred by the Ministry or approach the NGO directly. In order to provide the best service to customers the NGO needs access to up-to-date personalised information. This includes income and other information (for example relating to other social policy entitlements and obligations) held by Inland Revenue. The NGO obtains the informed consent of its customers to access this information. Inland Revenue, the Ministry of Social Development and the NGO (and potentially other NGOs offering the same service elsewhere) would sign an agreement. Inland Revenue could then provide information to the Ministry and/or the NGO on the customer’s income and any other agreed data points. The agreement would include provision for information security and proof that customers had properly given informed consent. (This type of data exchange might be facilitated by the Data Access Service discussed above.) 27 Transparency The Inland Revenue website contains limited information about the use and disclosure of personal information as part of the privacy policy.37 However, the information regarding information sharing is very high level and lists only some of the agencies that Inland Revenue shares with. Consistent with the greater transparency that forms part of the AISA model, and that discussed in Chapter 3 regarding certain information collection, the Government proposes that information sharing agreements under the new framework would be made public. The Government also considers there is a benefit in making available to the public more consistent information about Inland Revenue’s information- sharing activity. This might best be done in Inland Revenue’s annual report and on the website. It could outline the agencies information is shared with and the reasons for sharing. Some indication of the volumes of information shared might also be included. Transitional rules Expanding the regulatory model to cover all cross-government information sharing will require an ongoing review of the existing provisions and the agreements sitting under those provisions. If possible, arrangements should shift to the new model; however, this is unlikely to happen seamlessly at the time of the enactment of the new provisions. In some cases, review and renegotiation of the agreements will be appropriate. It will be important to ensure that existing sharing is not inadvertently affected and therefore transitional provisions will be required to move from the old to the new rules. ENFORCEMENT OF TAXPAYER CONFIDENTIALITY The TAA contains offence provisions for both Inland Revenue officers and certain other persons who fail to maintain secrecy.38 The Government proposes to retain a similar penalty for Inland Revenue officers who knowingly breach the proposed confidentiality rule. The retention of a penalty will confirm the ongoing importance of confidentiality. The current rules are less clear in relation to other persons who have access to, or receive, Inland Revenue information. In many circumstances people with access to Inland Revenue information are required to sign secrecy certificates; however, this does not apply in all cases. Moreover, in a world of ever-expanding information sharing, the administration of secrecy certificates for every person who will come into contact with Inland Revenue information may be logistically difficult. Agreements between Inland Revenue and agencies that information is shared with contain clauses regulating the use of information. For example, the agreement between Inland Revenue and New Zealand Police contains provisions regarding the security, use and disclosure of information shared. It also provides 28 for processes in the event of a breach, including permitting the suspension of information sharing while breaches are investigated. These are important provisions and will continue to feature in such agreements. The Government recognises that tax information can be very sensitive, and its receipt should come with particular obligations. In Australia the comparable legislation provides that confidentiality follows the information, and therefore anyone who obtains protected information and then discloses it otherwise than in accordance with the legislation, commits an offence. This is, in effect, a clearer and more consistent application of the current rule in section 143D of the TAA. The Government proposes the rule in the TAA be simplified to state that anyone with access to information subject to the confidentiality rule who knowingly improperly discloses the information, be subject to a penalty. The current penalty for both Inland Revenue officers and others with access to Inland Revenue information is imprisonment for a maximum of six months, a maximum fine of $15,000, or both. 1 See for example the recent speech to IPANZ given by the Secretary to the Treasury, Gabriel Makhlouf “Trust, Transparency and the Facts – Driving Forces Behind Modern Government” (14 March 2016) and to the Third Data Hui by the Minister of Finance, Hon Bill English (19 April 2016). 2 Knight v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1991\] NZLR 30 (CA). 3 The Forum comprises academic, private and public sector expertise, chaired by John Whitehead, former Secretary to Treasury and World Bank Executive Director.

However, for confidentiality rule purposes, some provision is required and this fits best within the general area of exceptions relating to the transfer of information to the taxpayer. 29 Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Act 2016 section 122(5), inserting new section 81(4)(ld) in the Tax Administration Act 1994. 30 Land and Income Tax Assessment Amendment Act 1946, section 5(5). 31 See http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/topical-issues/ implementing-aeoi 32 See http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/news/2016-08-08-simpler­ business-taxes-tighter-foreign-trust-rules-new-tax-bill 33 Two orders in council are in place under this provision – the first provides for sharing information with the Ministry of Social Development and the second with the Accident Compensation Corporation. 34 Inland Revenue is party to two approved information sharing agreements. The first allows Inland Revenue to obtain address information from the Department of Internal Affairs (being information received in the course of passport applications) for the purpose of contacting overseas-based student loan borrowers. The second agreement is to enable Inland Revenue to share information with the New Zealand Police, for the purpose of combating serious crime. 35 The exception is sharing done under “information matching agreements” under Part 9 of the Privacy Act. These arrangements are subject to monitoring and reporting by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner. 36 Privacy Act 1993 section 96C. 37 See http://www.ird.govt.nz/about-this-site/privacy/privacy­ policy.html 38 Tax Administration Act 1994, sections 143C and 143D. 30 CHAPTER 3 INFORMATION COLLECTION SUMMARY OF PROPOSALS Include a new provision in the Act that empowers the making of regulations governing the repeat collection of external datasets and provides transparency regarding such collection. Clarify that information collected for one particular function can be used for any other function of Inland Revenue. In Chapter 3 of Towards a new Tax Administration Act the Government set out some areas where it considered Inland Revenue’s information collection powers might require updating. Broadly, the Government considers Inland Revenue’s information-collection powers are working well; however, some areas need modernisation: • clarifying Inland Revenue’s powers for access to large third-party datasets • clarifying Inland Revenue’s access to remotely stored information. The Government considers that the current standard for collection of information is appropriate and should remain. This gives the continued assurance that Inland Revenue will only use its information-gathering powers to obtain information that is needed. The main focus of this chapter is on access to large third-party datasets, in particular a proposed framework for situations where repeated access to the same data is considered necessary or relevant. This chapter also clarifies 31 that information collected for one particular function can be used for any other function of Inland Revenue. Clarifying the rules regarding remote access is being explored in conjunction with the statutory review of the Search and Surveillance Act 2012 .39 E X T E R NAL DATA S E T S The Data Futures Forum opened their first discussion paper with an observation that the world is changing significantly in how we use and share data about ourselves.40 Digital technology has become a ubiquitous part of daily life, and more and more of our lives and activities are being stored digitally. In addition, New Zealand already has one of the more advanced systems of digital government in the world, and this is a trend that is expected to continue. The collection and use of information is an integral part of the tax administration system. Information is critical to the efficient and effective collection of revenue and disbursement of payments. The future tax administration will involve more automated and streamlined information flows from customers and third parties, and a broader approach to compliance based on better use and understanding of data. Prepopulating returns with information already held by Inland Revenue will also play an increased role. Inland Revenue’s information collection powers are long established and generally work well. The change proposed in this chapter focuses on situations where the regular, repeated collection of datasets is considered necessary or relevant. The current rules work well for one-off and ad hoc collection of both individual taxpayer data and wider datasets. In this context, the collection of large external datasets is not new, and the courts have made it clear that Inland Revenue’s current information collection power does enable the collection of such datasets. However, the Government considers that when such information is required on a regular, repeating basis, more specific rules are required. The proposal is a clarification for specific circumstances and therefore does not affect the existing information collection powers set out in the TAA. As the digitisation of the economy is increasing so is the availability and usefulness of large datasets. Data matching is becoming increasingly common in both the public and private sector. In New Zealand the Privacy Commissioner has recognised both the inevitability of wider use and re-use of information, and the benefits that can be obtained from this. The Privacy Commissioner noted that the potential ability of data use in the public sector to design better policies and more efficiently target resources made re-use of data in some sense a responsibility as much as an opportunity.41 Turning specifically to the tax context, the use of large datasets for compliance and educative work has been part of the toolkit for revenue 32 agencies around the world for some time. The international exchange of tax information has moved to focus on regular automated exchange of large quantities of information. Many revenue agencies are also routinely using large datasets in domestic compliance, education and service improvement work. The ATO undertakes a number of large data matching exercises using external datasets. This matching is used to assist with prepopulating returns and for education and compliance purposes. The ATO outlines on its website the types of datasets it obtains and the work done using this information. This website states that the ATO collects information from a wide range of sources, with over 600 million transactions a year reported to the ATO. A number of data matching protocols are also published, including protocols dealing with information collection from specialised payment systems, credit and debit cards, and motor vehicle registries. More recently, new legislation has been passed in Australia to introduce third-party reporting of real property, shares and units, business transactions made through payment systems, and government grants and payments data. This legislation received royal assent on 30 November 2015 and creates an obligation for formal regular reporting of these classes of information. Previously, much of this information was obtained via data matching programmes using the Australian equivalent of section 17 of the TAA. As the ATO was seeking to have the information in a more regular and timely way, including for use in prepopulating returns, formalised third-party reporting rules were considered appropriate. The United Kingdom has extensive and very prescriptive rules about the collection of information from “relevant data holders”. “Relevant data holders” are identified in primary legislation, and Her Majesty’s Treasury is then empowered to make regulations specifying what “relevant data” is for each type of data holder. Data collected under these rules is stated to be for risk analysis purposes; however, nothing in the rules restricts its use so it can be used for any revenue function, subject to the ordinary rules about wider use. Use of bulk data is stated to be essential to Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs’ (HMRC) compliance function and is primarily used to understand the risk of the amount of tax paid by any given taxpayer or group of taxpayers being incorrect. • It allows HMRC to target publicity and support if there is a risk tax has been overpaid. • It is used to target HMRC’s compliance checks on cases with a risk that tax has been underpaid, so that compliant people see fewer checks overall. • It helps to make sure that HMRC takes the right approach when checking, indicating whether the check should start with a quick phone call or an in-depth investigation. 33 Towards a new Tax Administration Act suggested that a general rule could be applied in the case of data collected for compliance or education reasons, and that if the focus was on information for prepopulating returns, formal third-party reporting rules would be appropriate. However, the proposal now is that the Act should contain a single provision for the repeated collection of external datasets. Information collected will be used in a range of ways, and rather than trying to set different rules based on use, one overarching provision will cover all scenarios. Submitters on Towards a new Tax Administration Act expressed conditional support for a more explicit collection power for large datasets. Some submitters noted that Inland Revenue already has extensive information collection powers and, while supportive of more explicit powers, were not necessarily supportive of expanded powers. The Government notes these comments and emphasises that what is being considered is consistent with the existing powers and more in the nature of clarification than expansion. The courts have made clear in the past that large datasets do fall within the existing general collection powers. The proposed framework would be additional to the existing collection mechanisms, which would still apply for one-off collection or occasional repeat collection of data. The Government considers that for regular, repeated data collection, greater transparency is needed. The Government considers that a regulatory framework will provide a degree of flexibility to work in an environment where the availability of datasets and the capacity to analyse and use these datasets for a range of purposes is continuing to evolve rapidly. It will also provide greater transparency for these types of regular collection than using the existing general collection powers. Consistent with the approach proposed in Chapter 2 for information sharing, and with the proposals in Chapter 6 for a more hierarchical drafting approach, the Government proposes these changes: • A new provision will be included in the TAA to empower regulations authorising repeat collection of external datasets. • Regulations will be made by order in council, be disallowable instruments, and be subject to scrutiny by Cabinet and the Regulations Review Committee. • Regulations will specify the type of data, the class of data holder (or if there is only one data holder, that entity), the frequency of reporting required and any specifications as to how the data is to be reported. • A recommendation for regulations must outline why the information sought under the proposed regulations is considered “necessary or relevant” and the proposed use of the data.42 34 As a general rule, Inland Revenue would have previously trialled the collection of data (or data of a similar type) using the general collection power before seeking a regulation. Such previous collection and analysis of the dataset would help demonstrate that it was considered “necessary or relevant” to collect the data regularly. There may be situations when the exact use of the collected data is not made public, as it could, for example, reveal information about compliance activity that assists taxpayers to “game the system”. However, in general, and following the Australian and United Kingdom examples, the Government considers that transparency about the general parameters and use of this form of data collection is appropriate and will assist with public understanding and trust in government, as well as assisting with compliance. Transparency reporting Internationally, companies such as Vodafone, Google and Microsoft have begun to publish their own transparency reports. Although still relatively limited, in New Zealand there has also been a more recent trend towards transparency reporting as it relates to information requests received by companies. According to the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, “transparency reporting” is when companies report publicly about the information requested by and disclosed to government agencies, usually for law enforcement or national security purposes. Such reporting is said to provide insight into how government agencies are using their powers and reveal the extent to which companies cooperate with such requests. In 2015 the Office of the Privacy Commissioner undertook a three month transparency reporting trial with reporting from 10 companies in the financial services, telecommunications and utilities sectors. In addition, Trade Me recently published its fourth annual transparency report, outlining requests the company has received for personal information, and its responses. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner has noted an apparent paradox for transparency reporting in New Zealand, by reference to a 2015 Horizon Research survey. The survey indicated a possible lack of public understanding about information request powers, and concern about organisations that provided information to government agencies without (and in some cases even with) a warrant. In fact, as the Office of the Privacy Commissioner observes, significant numbers of information requests are made and answered without requirement for a warrant. The paradox referred to was that organisations are required to respond to legitimate requests by government agencies for information. However, the negative reaction by the public to such disclosures acts as a disincentive to report such disclosures – particularly if other organisations in the sector do not report. 35 Another issue that arises around transparency reporting is whether organisations should notify their customers when their information has been provided under an information request. In Australia, the ATO complies with voluntary guidelines issued by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner in respect of their large data matching programmes. Under these guidelines, data matching protocols are published outlining the data sought, the intended use, and other details about the programme. The protocols include a section detailing any publicity about the programme, and whether data providers have been advised that they can inform their customers that their data has been shared. In New Zealand, there is no requirement to notify someone when their information has been released under a government agency request. Trade Me, in its 2016 transparency report, stated it does not have a blanket policy of notifying individual members when their information is released (although in certain circumstances it did, for example in relation to Disputes Tribunal and insurance investigators). However, in relation to law enforcement, Trade Me stated it had considered whether the risk of compromising legitimate investigations outweighed the desire to notify, and that given the obvious sensitivities and the difficulty in knowing when notification could jeopardise an investigation, a notification policy was impractical. To assist with transparency, the Government proposes that when Inland Revenue is seeking regular, repeating access to a particular dataset (or datasets), an order in council will be required. Inland Revenue should also be required to publish summary information about large data acquisition and matching programmes undertaken under these regulations. This is consistent with the approach taken in the United Kingdom and Australia. Submissions on Towards a New Tax Administration Act also suggested that a more open approach like that of Australia could be considered if the data collection power was made more explicit. Using the power to obtain repeated large datasets Inland Revenue already undertakes the collection of many large datasets for a range of purposes. With improved systems, analytical capability and a greater focus on prepopulated returns, the case for regularly obtaining data increases. On the other hand, the impact of such data collection on data holders must also be considered, hence the Government proposes retaining the long-established “necessary or relevant” test. Some third-party reporting regimes are already covered in the tax legislation – for example, employer monthly schedules and information about investment income. As part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation process both these sets of third-party reporting rules are being examined. Given the significance of these forms of information, the breadth 36 of data providers they affect, and their established nature as specific regimes, it is not proposed to move this information within the new framework at this time. Some examples of possible uses of the new rules are set out below. These illustrate areas the Government might examine for regular collection of data once the proposed framework is in place, and are not firm proposals that this particular data be collected regularly. Government agency data about businesses Other government agencies hold information that could be used to establish payments to, or activity undertaken by, taxpayers, or assist in establishing the existence and/or identity of entities that are engaged in activity affecting the tax system. If this is primarily “personal information” Inland Revenue may be able to obtain it through approved information- sharing agreements. However, if it is not personal information but relates to businesses or entities, the approved information-sharing agreement mechanism in the Privacy Act would not apply. In such situations, to ensure both clear authority for the collection of the information, and to provide a greater degree of transparency regarding its collection, regulations under the proposed new provision could be used. Wider state sector information about social policy customers and outcomes Analysing information about customers can provide Inland Revenue with the ability to better tailor services and to understand what can lead to customers’ compliance or non-compliance. This is true not just for tax, but across the different product types that Inland Revenue administers. For example, managing the student loan debt book is an important aspect of Inland Revenue’s functions. Information that enhances understanding of why student loan borrowers default on their debt would be of significant use in tailoring services and managing debt. Such information could also be of benefit to the government more broadly in understanding outcomes and the drivers of value in tertiary education. Payments information Another area where the power might be considered is in obtaining data about payments to businesses. Both the United Kingdom and Australian legislation include a requirement for reporting from electronic payment systems. In Australia, information is collected from banks and, more recently, alternative payments systems providers. The credit/debit card aspect of the programme has been running since the 2008–09 financial year. The ATO states this allows it to obtain external data to cross-reference with internal data, and identify relevant cases for compliance and educational action. These are the stated objectives.43 37 Objectives of the credit and debit data matching program are to: • promote voluntary compliance with taxation obligations and increase awareness in the community of the ways the ATO uses data matching to address non-compliance, by publishing this program protocol • identify liquidated or de-registered businesses that are continuing to trade • assist in identifying ‘cash only’ businesses, by exception • assist the ATO in building intelligence about businesses including broader risk, trend and strategic analysis • ensure compliance with registration, lodgement, correct reporting and payment of taxation obligations. The Australian programme is not focused on individuals’ transaction data, but rather collects monthly transaction totals for businesses, enabling a picture to be established of trading activity. INFORMATION GATHERED FOR ONE PURPOSE BEING USED FOR OTHER PURPOSES WITHIN INLAND REVENUE Inland Revenue has a very broad range of functions. In many cases interactions with a customer may be for a particular purpose, or in relation to a particular product type, for example personal income tax or Working for Families tax credits. However, the information obtained may also be relevant for other purposes, for example the customer’s student loan or child support accounts. In many cases customers, both personal and business, have a range of different interaction needs with Inland Revenue and therefore information can be relevant for a range of purposes linked to Inland Revenue’s various functions. The TAA charges the Commissioner of Inland Revenue with the care and management of the taxes and with other functions conferred. The care and management responsibility encompasses the requirement that the Commissioner carry out her various functions in a way that makes the most efficient use of her resources. This requirement, coupled with the overarching responsibility to protect the integrity of the tax system, suggests that the Commissioner should be able to make the most efficient use of information at her disposal in order to fulfil her various functions and responsibilities. Inland Revenue’s view is that information gathered for the purpose of one of its functions is also able to be used for any of its other functions. However, to make this clear, the Government proposes to include this principle in legislation. A similar approach is taken in the equivalent UK legislation which expressly provides “information acquired by the Revenue and Customs in connection with a function may be used by them in connection with any other function”.44 38 In proposing this clarification, the Government notes that the Privacy Act contains exceptions to the privacy principles regarding collection, use and disclosure if non-compliance with those principles is for the protection of the public revenue. 39 Section 357 requires that the operation of the Act be reviewed by the Law Commission and Ministry of Justice. This review is currently underway. 40 https://www.nzdatafutures.org.nz/sites/default/files/first­ discussion-paper\_0.pdf. 41 New Zealand’s data future: A view from the Privacy Commissioner, available at https://www.privacy.org.nz/ assets/Files/Reports-to-ParlGovt/New-Zealands-data-future­ submission-by-the-Privacy-Commissioner.pdf 42 Note that this differs from the requirements of section 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 where the Commissioner needs only to be of the view that the information requested is necessary or relevant and is not required to provide reasons why this is the case.

The aim is to provide the right level of certainty for a taxpayer at the best stage, subject to Inland Revenue’s resource constraints. Some of the specific proposals include: • significantly reducing the fees for obtaining a binding ruling, at least for small and medium-sized enterprises; • allowing post-assessment binding rulings; • extending the scope of the rulings regime. • Expanding the current approach to minor errors. While there are numerous ways in which tax is, or could be, efficiently assessed, the Government has not yet moved away from the regular reconciliation process involving a periodic (such as annual) assessment. An assessment, which determines the final amount of tax payable, is a critical part of the tax collection function and underpins the role taxpayers and tax agents have in tax administration. The assessment is also the trigger point for a wide range of compliance and administrative actions by Inland Revenue. The transformed tax administration will see significant changes to the assessment process, including better use of withholding payments, more pre-populated income tax returns and better use of a business’s existing systems to simplify interactions with Inland Revenue. This chapter, while outlining the direction of other areas, outlines proposals for two key aspects of the assessment process: • the provision of advice by Inland Revenue • the process by which taxpayers can amend their self-assessment. 40 The Business Transformation process does not suggest moving to a Commissioner-based assessment model in place of a self-assessment one. The legislative definition of an assessment recognises that assessments can be made either by the taxpayer or the Commissioner. Under the existing structure, if a taxpayer must file a return they must also make a self-assessment. No decision has been taken on whether this will change under Inland Revenue’s business transformation. THE ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK – RIGHT FROM THE START A key objective in modernising the tax administration system is to make tax compliance simpler. In the context of the assessment process this means helping taxpayers to “get it right from the start”. The “Right from the Start” approach is defined in terms of four dimensions that are considered central to the compliance environment:45 • Acting in real time and up-front, so that problems are prevented or addressed when they occur • Focusing on end-to-end processes rather than only on the revenue body processes and trying to make taxpayers’ processes fit into them • Making it easy to comply (and difficult not to comply) • Actively involving and engaging taxpayers, their representatives and other stakeholders, in order to achieve a better understanding of taxpayers’ perspectives and to cooperate with third parties. A “right from the start” approach supports compliant behaviour, drives out error and reduces the possibilities of non-compliant behaviour.46 The purpose is not just to reduce unintentional mistakes, but also to reduce evasion and to strengthen the overall willingness to comply.47 The framework suggests the goal should be first time accuracy and a reduction in subsequent adjustments. This enhances taxpayer certainty and reduces the resources taxpayers and the Commissioner need to commit to the process. The different aspects of the tax assessment process, and the elements of tax administration that support the assessment process such as the provision of advice, need to be aligned with the overall framework. The right from the start framework involves many elements of the assessment process as indicated in the diagram on the next page. 41 ASSESSMENT AMENDMENT PROCESS ADVICE RETURNS PAYMENT OF TAX DISPUTES PENALTIES REFUNDS, TRANSFERS & RECOVERIES REMISSIONS & HARDSHIP RECORD KEEPING COMMISSIONER TA XPAY ER TAX INTERMEDIARY While this chapter outlines proposals in relation to Inland Revenue advice and taxpayer amendments to assessments, the Government is aware that these two areas are only parts of the tax administration system and that the proposals in this chapter will need to work effectively with other aspects of the assessment process. ADVICE New Zealand’s system of assessment relies heavily on voluntary compliance, which requires taxpayers and their advisors to have a good understanding of the tax law to meet their obligations. Due to the complexity of the tax legislation, and the significant increase in the complexity of business and personal affairs, many taxpayers and agents will seek the advice of the Commissioner. A key reason for Inland Revenue to provide advice is that it will improve voluntary compliance as taxpayers will be more likely to understand and follow the tax rules. The private sector (including tax intermediaries) will continue to play a significant role in providing advice to taxpayers. The Commissioner’s advice will continue to assist the private sector to in turn provide advice to their clients. The private sector will also help shape the advice offered by Inland Revenue. Professional advisors offer a service to taxpayers which can be generally assumed to be a value 42 for money proposition given the expertise required in providing the service. Professional advisors undeniably provide a valuable role in engendering greater taxpayer compliance. However, professional services can be expensive and, given Inland Revenue’s responsibility to manage the tax system, it is arguable that there is an onus on Inland Revenue to provide services that not only focus on compliance but also reduce compliance costs. This is consistent with the Commissioner’s obligation to protect the integrity of the tax system. The role of intermediaries is discussed in Chapter 5. Advice and certainty The current assessment system is focused on post-assessment amendments and audits. The Government proposes moving to a situation where more of Inland Revenue’s resources are focused on helping taxpayers to get it right from the start, reducing the need for post- assessment amendments.48 One of the key aspects to support taxpayers will be the advice the Commissioner provides to them and their intermediaries. Clearer and better- timed advice should help taxpayers better ensure that their assessments are right first time. The Commissioner currently provides a wide range of advice, from guidance over the phone to binding rulings. The range includes general advice and taxpayer-specific advice, and provides different levels of certainty for taxpayers. One problem with the current range of advice provided by Inland Revenue is that it is focused on providing a set of advice products, such as booklets, public rulings, binding rulings and newsletters. It is not as focused on the specific needs of taxpayers as it could be and may be more weighted to some taxpayer groups than others. This means it may not align as effectively as it could with the taxpayer-focused model that is central to the Business Transformation process. Ideally, the advice Inland Revenue provides should provide the right level of certainty for all taxpayers at the best stage, without being fixed on a particular advice product. At a minimum, this suggests that the current range of advice products needs to be more flexible and adaptive. It may involve extending the current range of products to more taxpayers. Over time it could evolve into more of a spectrum of advice, that is better focused on the specific needs of the taxpayer. The key constraint in providing more individualised advice for taxpayers is that Inland Revenue will never have sufficient resources to advise all taxpayers about the implications of every transaction or income source. The Government expects Inland Revenue will need to balance its resources against the goal of providing more individualised advice and its other functions. The provision of advice will therefore need to be prioritised and streamlined for different contexts and to different audiences – for example, specific 43 classes of taxpayers and for the wider public. Inland Revenue is in the process of designing its future organisational structure, which will be crucial in determining how it will balance its resources and provide more effective advice. A view on the best way of providing advice to taxpayers is still to be finalised. However, some changes are suggested in this chapter to the binding rulings regime as part of the move to expand the type of advice that can be provided in the form of a binding ruling, to lower its cost and create more flexibility around the time at which a ruling can be sought. General advice The Commissioner currently provides a wide range of general advice to taxpayers, through public statements, guides, newsletters, booklets and the Inland Revenue website. General advice is relied on by a large number of taxpayers (especially small and medium-sized businesses), so it is very significant to the assessment process. The Government considers that general advice will continue to be the most important source of information for small and medium-sized businesses under the modernised tax administration. By increasing the volume and usefulness of general advice, the Commissioner may be able to some extent to reduce the need for individualised advice. Binding public rulings provide a taxpayer with certainty if they come within the scope of the ruling (and no exceptions apply). A taxpayer cannot be subject to a reassessment, penalties or interest if a current ruling applies to them. Public Rulings will continue to play an important role in providing certainty to taxpayers. The Government is not proposing any significant change to the regime which is well supported by the taxpayers who use it. Inland Revenue will continue to seek improvements in the way small and medium-sized businesses can engage in the process for determining the public rulings work programme. Other general advice provides a taxpayer who relies on it with a statutory defence against the imposition of shortfall penalties or interest (subject to some conditions).49 As a result, taxpayers obtain some level of certainty from such general advice. While the taxpayer can still be reassessed for the amount of the core tax, the Commissioner has committed to only changing general advice on a prospective basis when the new view is unfavourable to taxpayers (unless exceptional circumstances apply).50 This means the general advice usually provides certainty to taxpayers for past assessments of core tax. Taxpayer-specific advice The Commissioner currently provides a wide range of taxpayer- specific advice either over the phone or through other forms of correspondence. As with general advice, taxpayer-specific advice can provide greater but differing levels of certainty for taxpayers: 44 • Private binding rulings provide certainty to particular taxpayers on the core tax, penalties and interest. Although they are limited in number, they cover transactions worth more than $1 billion per annum.51 • More widely applicable, some taxpayer-specific advice is a Commissioner’s official opinion, which provides the taxpayer with certainty that interest or a penalty cannot be applied (subject to some conditions).52 This assists with transparency and provides some certainty for taxpayers following the advice. It does not provide certainty for a taxpayer on the amount of core tax though. This is because the law does not allow the Commissioner to bind herself to a view on the law, other than through the binding rulings regime. This is consistent with the long-standing principle that the Commissioner cannot impose or suspend a tax without Parliament’s consent. However, when the Commissioner changes her view on taxpayer-specific advice (other than in a binding ruling), the new position will generally only apply on a prospective basis. • Some taxpayer-specific advice does not meet the requirements to be an “official opinion”, such as if insufficient information has been provided to the Commissioner. This type of advice does not provide a statutory defence against interest and penalties, and may not provide sufficient certainty to a taxpayer for the amount of core tax. Inland Revenue is investigating different channels for communicating to taxpayers. Traditionally, Inland Revenue has been reluctant to use electronic means of communicating with taxpayers due to concerns with maintaining confidentiality. As part of modernising the tax administration system, Inland Revenue is investigating more digital options. The increased use of technology should allow more customised advice to be provided to taxpayers. For example, one option being investigated is allowing Inland Revenue staff to see the same screen as the taxpayer in real time. This will allow the Inland Revenue staff member to more accurately guide the taxpayer. Embedded advice A significant new channel to aid taxpayers may in the future be through digital accounting products that interact with Inland Revenue’s new system. Inland Revenue is interested in exploring whether prompts and links could be embedded into accounting software. This would mean that tax information could be highlighted to software users through prompts created by the embedded rules. Inland Revenue is interested in further conversations with software providers on whether cloud-based accounting products may have the ability to provide prompts to taxpayers in the future through links to Inland Revenue publications or a suggestion to seek tax advice on a particular matter. 45 Example: Prompts and nudges in the United Kingdom HMRC envisages the use of authorised computer software will allow a range of nudges and prompts to provide guidance to taxpayers. These could be pop-ups and questions within the software, which flag potential inconsistencies or errors to the taxpayer. In such instances, the software will ask the business to double check they are happy with the figures they are providing to HMRC. For example, during the year Richard buys a new van for his business, but he is not aware that he is entitled to claim capital allowances against the purchase. When entering his van purchase into his accounting software, a pop-up message advises him of the capital allowances available, with a targeted link to online information. When he enters the cost of the van, the software automatically calculates the capital allowance and reflects it in his year-to-date tax figure. Binding Rulings Regime One of the key methods of providing certainty for taxpayers is the binding rulings regime. This has been reviewed from time to time, resulting in some minor legislative changes over the years. There is no indication that the system requires a full overhaul at present. The regime is highly valued by those taxpayers who utilise it and the Government does not propose to substantially change it. The binding rulings regime was introduced in 1994-95 following the recommendation of the 1989–90 Tax Simplification Consultative Committee. The recommendation reflected the need for businesses to ensure that the tax consequences of a transaction are clear before a taxpayer makes a self-assessment, and that if Inland Revenue has given advice, that the advice will not change. This is particularly important when a business enters a large and complex tax arrangement. The need for certainty is ongoing and will be particularly relevant in the modernised tax administration system. It is expected that the rulings regime will in the future be better co-ordinated with other forms of advice as both have a similar objective of enhancing certainty. As a first step towards Inland Revenue rationalising its advice products, the Government proposes to widen the scope of the rulings regime to make it more flexible, and make it more affordable for small and medium-sized enterprises. 46 The Government is proposing the following: • REDUCE THE COST The first proposal is to reduce the fees charged by Inland Revenue for providing a binding ruling. The key goal in reducing the fees would be to make binding rulings more accessible for small and medium-sized enterprises. Currently, private, product and status binding rulings all incur fees that are based on recovering some of the cost of providing the ruling. These include an application fee of $322 (GST inclusive) which covers the costs of receiving and reviewing the ruling application and a fee of $161 (GST inclusive) per hour spent by Inland Revenue considering the application and the issues it raises. This includes time spent consulting with the applicant. Inland Revenue’s costs in obtaining independent advice from external professionals are also passed on to the applicant (although this is rare). The current rationale for charging fees is that the applicant receives the benefit of certainty about how Inland Revenue will apply the tax laws in relation to their situation. The applicant also gets priority of the Commissioner’s resources on their issue. If no fee were charged, taxpayers in general would effectively fund the benefit received by individual applicants. Charging a fee also ensures that only significant and serious applications for rulings are made. However, the Government understands that the fees charged for rulings in New Zealand are a significant barrier to smaller businesses and individuals using the regime. Justice Susan Glazebrook recently raised the issue of whether the fees charged for binding rulings are consistent with the rule of law principle of equality before the law.53 A reduction in the fees would make it more affordable for small and medium-sized businesses and individuals to obtain certainty for important or complex transactions. The Government acknowledges there are still likely to be significant external costs for taxpayers in getting a ruling, being the likely costs for an advisor to prepare the ruling application and represent them in interactions with Inland Revenue. The application process places the obligation on the taxpayer to fully disclose the relevant facts and set out how the propositions of law apply to those facts. This is likely to mean that taxpayers will still only apply for rulings for significant transactions. A reduction in the fees would, however, be consistent with the overall goal of assisting taxpayers to get the initial assessment right. The reduction may also make it possible over time to remove the inefficient process of taxpayers issuing notices of proposed adjustments to their own self- assessments. 47 The Government has considered whether the proposed reduction in the fees could be achieved either by: • A LOW FLAT APPLICATION FEE FOR ALL RULINGS Having a single flat application fee would have low compliance costs for taxpayers and low administrative costs for Inland Revenue. A fixed fee also provides certainty for applicants as to cost for the ruling. However, a flat fee would not reflect the relative value of the benefits for a small enterprise as compared with a large company. Further, it will be difficult to set a fee level that reflects the benefits that large corporates get from a ruling, while not acting as a barrier to small and medium-sized enterprises. • A GRADUATED SCHEDULE OF APPLICATION FEES DEPENDING ON THE SIZE OR TYPE OF ENTITY APPLYING FOR THE RULING (AS IN THE UNITED STATES) Various elements may be relevant in determining the graduated schedule including the entity size and whether the entity is profit- driven. A graduated schedule will be able to more accurately reflect the benefit received by a specific applicant, making it fairer overall. The relevant elements have to balance the complexity of the issue with the value of the benefit received by an individual applicant. The more complex the schedule, the more likely it will be able to reflect the benefit received but also the more likely questions will arise about what fee will be appropriate in a given circumstance. This document does not suggest a specific fee level but a significant decrease in fees is expected, at least for small and medium-sized enterprises. The current hourly rate fee would be removed. The extent to which a reduction in fees will lead to an increase in the demand for rulings is unclear. When the rulings regime was first introduced, the fees were substantially lower and the demand was much greater than currently. However, some overseas experience suggests that the demand for rulings as a function of cost is fairly inelastic 54. In the United States, recent academic papers suggest that the guaranteed awareness of a transaction by the revenue authority when a ruling is applied for is a significant reason why taxpayers may choose not to apply for a ruling (even if it is free), preferring instead to run the risk of being audited. Nevertheless, the Government acknowledges there is likely to be an increase in the base level of demand if fees are significantly reduced. Any increase in demand for rulings may require more resources to be devoted to providing rulings. • OFFER POST-ASSESSMENT RULINGS As part of the move to advice being more rationalised, the second proposal is to allow post-assessment binding rulings. Currently, a ruling application cannot be made following an assessment. The reason for this prohibition was that post- assessment issues were seen to be the domain of the disputes process. The practical effect of the 48 proposal would be to deliberately blur the boundary between a ruling and a dispute. The proposal would provide the right level of advice and certainty for a taxpayer, without being necessarily fixed on a particular advice product or process. It would reduce the time for a taxpayer to know the Commissioner’s opinion, when there is a discrete legal issue in dispute. Submissions are sought on how this proposal should fit in with the disputes review process. • ENHANCE THE SCOPE OF RULINGS The Government also proposes some extensions to the scope of the rulings regime: • Remove the prohibition on ruling on the purpose of a taxpayer under certain provisions. • Relax the requirement that a ruling can only be issued on an “arrangement” but only to the extent of allowing the Commissioner to give certainty on some specific quasi-factual matters (such as whether a person is resident in New Zealand). The “arrangement” concept will be retained when ruling on transactions to reflect the relative complexity intended by the rulings regime. • Clarify the connection between rulings and the financial arrangement rules determinations. This may allow the Commissioner to rule on certain matters rather than having to issue a determination. It may lead to completely replacing specific financial arrangement determinations with private or product rulings. • Clarify the role of assumptions and conditions for rulings by setting out the differences between the two and when they should be used. This may also involve clarifying when a ruling no longer applies because a condition or assumption is breached. RETURNS AND INFORMATION COLLECTION Inland Revenue is considering the future of the return design process. New Zealand has one of the lowest disclosure requirements for tax returns in the world. Many jurisdictions require comprehensive information with the tax return to assist the tax authority. Often Inland Revenue sends targeted surveys to taxpayers to supplement tax return information. Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme provides an opportunity to revisit these information settings to see if these are still fit for purpose. The Government considers the return process can be improved so that Inland Revenue obtains better information while reducing the compliance costs for taxpayers in providing the information. The returns processes will be considered as part of the work being undertaken for businesses and individuals. 49 ASSESSMENT One of the key aspects of the assessment process is the time the assessment is made. Many aspects of the tax administration process turn on the date of the assessment. For example, a taxpayer’s dispute rights can start and end in relation to the date of the assessment.55 The Government has considered whether the rules around the time of the assessment need to be updated as a result of the proposed changes to the assessment process. Currently, the date on which the relevant return is filed is treated as the date the self-assessment is made56. The move to more electronic filing of returns, and a greater use of pre-populated returns, raises the issue of whether the rules relating to the timing of assessment need to be updated. The present approach requires taxpayers to consider the relevant facts and apply the law to those facts. Taxpayers may be required to verify the tax position by confirming a prepopulated return. The date on which the relevant return is confirmed will be treated as the date the self-assessment is made. Alternatively, if a taxpayer files a paper or electronic return the current timing rules will apply. As the same assessment process will apply in the digital environment only minimal changes need to be made to the timing rules. As is currently the case, the filing of a return following a default assessment will be treated as a request for an amendment (or as a notice of proposed adjustment if the relevant criteria are satisfied). The original date of assessment will not change as a result of the filing of the return. In cases when the Commissioner issues a default assessment, as is currently the case, the date of the assessment will be the date the Commissioner makes the default assessment. Amending an assessment While the focus of the modernised tax administration is on getting the assessment right from the start, there are inevitably going to be situations when either the taxpayer or the Commissioner will seek to amend or correct the initial assessment. Correcting tax positions is an integral part of tax administration, and will continue to be so under the modernised tax administration system. Tax liabilities are as much about timing as quantum. It is important that, where practicable, tax be accounted for in the correct tax period. Process for taxpayers to amend an assessment The current process for taxpayers to amend an assessment was designed in the environment of paper returns and the limits of FIRST (Inland Revenue’s current computer system). The process can be resource intensive for both taxpayers and Inland Revenue, and involve significant delays. It imposes significant compliance costs on taxpayers and administration costs on Inland Revenue. There are different processes depending on the type of tax, the reason for the change, 50 and the amount of the amendment. The different processes can be difficult for taxpayers to understand and easy for them to get wrong. The key distinction between the different processes is whether the taxpayer: • has to correct the original assessment, or • is allowed to put the amendment in a subsequent return. Income tax amendments: current law and practice In general, amendments to income tax assessments need to be made to the original assessment (subject to an exception for minor errors discussed below). There are various ways that a taxpayer can seek an amendment to the original assessment: • The taxpayer can file a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA) to the assessment or default assessment within the required response period (generally up to four months after the date of the assessment). The filing of the NOPA commences the formal disputes process and means the Commissioner must consider the taxpayer’s proposed adjustment. • The taxpayer can request that the Commissioner use her discretion to amend the original assessment (this may be by means of a voluntary disclosure). In this case, the Commissioner is not required to consider the merits of the proposed adjustment if she determines she does not have sufficient resources.57 This means if the taxpayer does not file a NOPA within the response period, then the amendment may be made at the Commissioner’s discretion. There is uncertainty for taxpayers as to whether their tax position will be amended. The Commissioner does not use her discretion in situations when there is uncertainty regarding the facts or the law (or both) as those situations should be dealt with under the disputes process.58 Consistently with that, the Commissioner’s current approach is to only remedy genuine errors or underpayments of tax. Taxpayers reported that the process can be frustrating when the requested amendment is to their benefit. The aim of the modernised tax administration system is to be more flexible and adaptive. The approach of the Commissioner to amendments will need to reflect the new environment. GST amendments: current law and practice Additional processes apply for GST amendments. When a taxpayer has not claimed a GST deduction (input tax) in an earlier taxable period, they can claim that deduction in a later period.59 However, if the taxpayer does not include GST to pay (output tax) in a return, the original assessment must be reopened to correct the tax position. 51 The Commissioner’s current approach is generally not to use her discretion to reopen a previous assessment to allow a taxpayer to claim a deduction, because they are able to claim it in a subsequent period. The approach is less clear when the taxpayer seeks to increase the amount of output tax for a specific period or to decrease the amount of an input tax deduction for a period. The approach is also more complicated when a taxpayer has omitted to return output tax for a period and to claim input tax for the same period. In those circumstances, the taxpayer may want to claim the input tax in the earlier period to offset or remove any liability for use-of­ money interest for the increased output tax. As a result, there are different processes depending on the nature of the error. Anecdotal evidence suggests that many taxpayers include errors involving both output tax and input tax in subsequent returns. This may reflect the complexity and the compliance costs of the process and the uncertainty for taxpayers about which process to follow. Minor errors: current law and practice Currently, there is a further option for remedying a minor error in an assessment for income tax, FBT or GST 60. The option allows a taxpayer to include the minor error in a subsequent return. The aim of allowing minor errors to be remedied in subsequent returns is to reduce tax compliance costs for small and medium-sized enterprises and individuals, although it applies to taxpayers generally.61 A minor error is one that is caused by a clear mistake, simple oversight, or mistaken understanding by the taxpayer. The total discrepancy caused by the minor error must be less than $500 for a single return.62 Putting the minor error in a subsequent return avoids the use of money interest that may apply if the original return is reopened. The option also avoids the compliance costs for the taxpayer of filing a separate notice to reopen the original assessment. However, the option means there can be a significant delay between identifying the error and providing certainty for the taxpayer. Delaying dealing with the error can create a risk for the taxpayer in that the amendment may exceed the threshold or not satisfy the criteria. This would mean it would have to be included in the original assessment. However, due to the delay in dealing with the issue, the taxpayer’s liability may have increased significantly. Accounting treatment: current rules and practice One of the goals of the “right from the start” framework is to align with the processes of the taxpayer rather than just requiring the taxpayers’ processes to fit into Inland Revenue’s processes. This suggests that, to the extent possible, the approach to remedying errors should align with the accounting approach. 52 However, for most taxpayers, including individuals, there will be no applicable accounting treatment for correcting errors. This means the process for remedying errors cannot align with an accounting treatment. For those taxpayers required to use accounting standards, the requirements depend on the size of the entity and the nature of their operation. In broad terms, large or publicly accountable for-profit entities have to comply with the New Zealand equivalents to international financial reporting standards (NZ IFRS); large, non-publicly accountable, for-profit entities have to comply with New Zealand’s reduced disclosure regime (NZ IFRS RDR); and other small and medium-sized entities only have to comply with Inland Revenue’s special purpose reporting requirements. There is a similar scale of different reporting standards for public benefit entities. Under the accounting standards, the general approach for material changes is to require the figures to be restated for the prior periods being disclosed as comparatives in the latest financial statements, including cumulative adjustments to any balances brought forward where relevant.63 Materiality in accounting standards means a change that could influence the economic decisions that users make on the basis of the financial statements.64 Materiality depends on the size and nature of the omission or misstatement judged in the surrounding circumstances. The size or nature of the item, or a combination of both, could be the determining factor. Anecdotal evidence suggests most corrections are made in the current period because they are considered not to satisfy the materiality threshold. Compliance costs The aim in making any change is to reduce the compliance costs for taxpayers of the amendment process. The current processes can impose significant compliance and administrative costs for relatively minor amendments. Considerations Various considerations have been taken into account in developing options, including: • THE RIGHT FROM THE START FRAMEWORK: As discussed above, in accordance with the overall “right from the start” framework there should be as much consistency as possible with taxpayers’ existing processes, rather than requiring them to fit into Inland Revenue processes. • THE RELEVANT ACCOUNTING TREATMENT To the extent possible, the requirements on taxpayers should reflect the materiality approach adopted in accounting standards. This suggests significant amendments need to be reflected in the previous period and minor amendments can be carried over to the current period. • USE OF MONEY INTEREST The fact the use of money interest regime reflects the time value 53 of money is a consideration in designing rules for amendments to assessments. It is acknowledged that credit and debit use of money interest can apply to amendments. • NEUTRALITY A balance needs to be drawn between encouraging taxpayers to take care not to make errors in the initial assessment while recognising that even with due care mistakes will occur. There also needs to be fairness between taxpayers who diligently make correct assessments and those that are less diligent. • THE ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES An aim needs to be to enable the Commissioner to allocate her limited resources to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law, rather than focus on minor matters. • BENEFITS OF START The lower compliance costs of amending previous assessments under Inland Revenue’s new computer system (START) need to be taken into account. Options The Government is proposing amendments to the specific exemption for minor amendments. Two options are being considered: • REMOVE THE CRITERIA: The first option is to remove the current criteria that determine when an amendment is minor, and instead rely solely on a monetary threshold. This would remove the need for determining whether an error is a clear mistake, simple oversight, or mistaken understanding by the taxpayer. • SUPPLEMENT THE MONETARY THRESHOLD The second option is to supplement the single monetary threshold with an approach that relies in some way on the significance of the error to the taxpayer. The Government proposes that the changes for minor amendments would apply for both income tax, FBT and GST. The exemption would not be mandatory and taxpayers could apply for a minor error to be included in the original assessment (rather than wait to put it in a subsequent return). This would provide earlier certainty for taxpayers. The exemption would not apply when the taxpayer had used the threshold for the main purpose of delaying the payment of tax. Proposal: Supplement to the monetary threshold The current threshold is proposed to be increased from $500 to $1,000 by the Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill. The $1000 limit represents a maximum adjustment of income or deductions of $3,571 for a company, $3,030 for an individual and $7,667 for GS T. The Government proposes supplementing the single monetary threshold with an approach that relies to some extent on the significance of the error for the particular taxpayer. 54 This would allow taxpayers to include any error in a subsequent return if the amount of the error was equal to or less than both $10,000 and 2% of their taxable income or output tax for the relevant period (as appropriate). It would be optional for taxpayers. Some benefits of the proposal are that it would: • better align with the current practices of taxpayers, and the accounting treatment (where applicable) • enable the Commissioner to allocate her limited resources to collecting over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law by better focusing on significant risks • reduce compliance costs for taxpayers and administrative costs for Inland Revenue. A materiality approach has been adopted in Australia for GST and the United Kingdom for VAT (see Appendix 1). Although it is arguable this is more appropriate given the frequency of GST or VAT returns, a similar approach may be equally relevant to income tax. The Government notes that the increasing reliance on withholding payments and the introduction of the accounting income method (AIM) diminishes the distinction in frequency of returns between income tax and GST. Submitters’ views are sought as to whether the approach would appropriately balance the requirement to maintain integrity with the compliance costs of the amendment process (given the lower compliance costs under Inland Revenue’s new computer system (S TAR T )). PROCESS FOR THE COMMISSIONER TO AMEND AN ASSESSMENT The current process for the Commissioner to amend an assessment is: • The Commissioner can file a notice of proposed adjustment to the assessment. The filing of the notice commences the formal disputes process. • The Commissioner may make an amendment to the original assessment without issuing a notice of proposed adjustment in some circumstances.65 WITHHOLDING TAXES The discussion in this chapter on amending assessments relates to the core taxes. Consideration is also being given to whether the same approach should be adopted for amending returns for withholding taxes.66 The most significant withholding tax is PAYE, which involves frequent filing. The Government has consulted on this (Making Tax Simpler: Better administration of PAYE and GST (November 2015)) and has recently announced its decisions in the light of the feedback received. 55 PAYMENT OF TAX The Government has recently introduced new options for the payment of tax, including increasing the scope of withholding payments and changes to provisional tax. The business tax proposals, contained in the Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill, include the proposed introduction of AIM, which may change the process for paying tax. Any future proposals to change the payment of tax will need to be aligned with the assessment process. DISPUTES PROCESS The disputes process originated from the findings of the Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Department (the Richardson Committee) 67. The recommendations of the Richardson Committee were subject to a post-implementation review, the key aspects of which were included in the 2003 discussion document, Resolving tax disputes: a legislative review.68 The disputes process was further considered in Disputes: a review (an officials’ issues paper, July 2010). Several administrative changes were made following the review in 2010 (such as facilitated conferences, shorter NOPAs and the truncation criteria). One of the specific issues looked at during the 2010 review was the complaint that the disputes process can “burn-off” taxpayers (that is, discourage them from proceeding with the dispute because of the cost). The complaint was especially focused on small and medium- sized enterprises. There are no easy answers for reducing the costs of the disputes process because the disputes process deliberately demands engagement between taxpayers and Inland Revenue. Further, the process requires the identification of the facts and arguments to support understanding and resolution of the issue, and taxpayers will generally wish or need to be represented. However, as the following table shows, the vast majority of issues are resolved before the formal disputes process and it therefore makes sense for Inland Revenue to first focus its organisational design thinking on the areas of highest demand. Therefore, the question of burn-off in the formal disputes process will be considered by Inland Revenue as it continues to develop the optimum approach to providing advice to taxpayers within its given resource constraints. Any changes to the disputes process can be considered at that time. The option (set out earlier in this chapter) to allow binding rulings following an assessment, including during the formal disputes process is, however, one measure to reduce burn-off. 56 DISPUTES PROCESS AUDIT PROCESS INLAND REVENUE ISSUES A NOPA ADVICE FROM INLAND REVENUE TAXPAYER SELF ASSESSMENT TAXPAYER ISSUES A NOR FACILITATED CONFERENCE INLAND REVENUE ISSUES A SOP TAXPAYER ISSUES A SOP ADJUDICATION PROCESS COURT PROCESS 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 EXTERNAL ADVISOR COSTS \* based on 2013 data PE N A LT I E S Because New Zealand’s tax system relies on self-assessment, rules are necessary to encourage taxpayers to file their tax returns on time, pay on time and take reasonable care in calculating their tax liabilities. For the system to work, it is vital that those who do not comply with the rules face consequences and are seen to do so. It is also important that the penalties that result when someone has not complied with the rules are in keeping with the severity of the offence and that there is a reasonable degree of certainty about when penalties will be imposed. As noted in Towards a new Tax Administration Act, modernising the tax system provides an opportunity 92% OF ISSUES RESOLVED AT THIS STAGE 4% OF ISSUES RESOLVED AT THIS STAGE 2% OF ISSUES RESOLVED AT THIS STAGE 2% OF TAXPAYERS WILL GO FURTHER THROUGH THE DISPUTE PROCESS to recognise that taxpayer behaviour is about more than attitude. A combination of capability, opportunity and motivation make up compliance behaviour. Inland Revenue needs to think more widely about taxpayer needs and behaviours, and tailor activities depending on the causes of non-compliance. A review of the penalties regime is on the current tax policy work programme. The penalties regime is based on encouraging taxpayers to: • file their relevant returns (and so provide the Commissioner with the relevant information) through the use of late-filing penalties • pay the taxing owing on time through the use of late payment penalties 57 • get their tax positions right through the use of shortfall penalties. Late filing penalty Currently, for most small and medium- sized taxpayers not filing a GST or income tax return on time would likely result in a one-off penalty of between $50 and $100. For many taxpayers, these amounts are insignificant, and once imposed, and there are no further penalties imposed to encourage the taxpayer to file. The Government is considering a new late filing penalty that better encourages taxpayers to file their tax returns on time, while also being more proportionate to the potential harm of late filing. One of the options could be to set the penalty as a given percentage of the unfiled assessment, or a given amount that is imposed over a period of time, the longer the tax return remains overdue. It would be important to ensure the penalty does not become unreasonable (given the diverse size of various taxpayers), so the penalty may have minimum and maximum amounts. Late payment penalty The Government announced that the 1% monthly incremental late penalty is being removed from GST, provisional tax, income tax and Working for Families tax credit debt. The Government is considering whether to extend this to the 58 remaining taxes and duties that currently incur the incremental late payment penalty (such as PAYE and FBT). Late payment penalties can encourage payment on time. However, there is a point when the accumulated penalties and interest can overwhelm taxpayers, and any further penalties become ineffective at encouraging taxpayers to comply. Inland Revenue currently imposes approximately 26% per annum on overdue tax debt in late payment penalties and interest. PAYE debt in particular can incur an even higher rate due to incurring other financial penalties as well. This relatively high rate can lead to some businesses quickly becoming deterred from proactively repaying their tax debt. The Government is considering options in this area. Shortfall penalties The shortfall penalty rules may need to be modernised to see whether they are still fit for purpose within a modern tax administration. There may be a need for more flexible rules that provide the Commissioner with greater discretion to not impose a penalty. Certain parts of the shortfall penalty rules encourage taxpayers to follow particular processes and recognise some of the different causes of non- compliance: Advice: Taxpayers who rely on official opinions of the Commissioner are not subject to use-of-money interest or to shortfall penalties as a result of their reliance. Tax advisor: Taxpayers who use a tax advisor are deemed to have taken reasonable care in taking their tax position. Voluntary disclosure: If a taxpayer makes a voluntary disclosure, shortfall penalties can be substantially reduced. These elements mean that shortfall penalties are not imposed very often compared to the number of audit cases. In 2014 shortfall penalties were imposed in 570 audit cases out of a total of 9,862 closed audit cases (5.8%). The following graph shows the number of penalties that were imposed between 2005-2014:69 59 SHORTFALL PENALTY IMPOSITIONS, 2005–2014 (VOLUME) Lack of reasonable care Unacceptable interpretation Gross carelessness Evasion Abusive tax position 1,200 1,000 800 600 400 200 0 VOLUME 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 YEAR A greater number of small and medium-sized enterprises are using accounting software to manage their businesses. As part of Budget 2016, the Government announced that it would introduce AIM which allows taxpayers to pay their provisional tax based on a calculation prepared by accounting software. The Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill proposes that taxpayers who use AIM are deemed to have taken Further integration between accounting software and Inland Revenue’s systems and processes has been requested by taxpayers. The government will consider options for greater integration, including whether any further changes are needed to shortfall penalties as a result of greater integration or to better align shortfall penalties with the new compliance framework. RECORD KEEPING an acceptable tax position for their provisional tax. This recognises that when a taxpayer uses AIM any non-compliance is not due to their motivation, so a penalty will not assist with compliance. The way people keep records is changing with the growth in electronic record keeping and cloud- based storage. The Government considers it is prudent to take a look at the record keeping rules and the relevant penalties to see whether these rules are fit for purpose. 60 45 Right from the Start: Influencing the Compliance Environment for Small and Medium Enterprises (OECD, January 2012) 3. 46 Right from the Start (January 2012) 3. 47 Right from the Start (January 2012) 3. 48 See Making Tax Simpler – A Government Green Paper on Tax Administration (March 2015) 41. 49 Sections 120W and 141B.

This would extend to PAYE and GST filers. • Clarify in the TAA the persons who are eligible for an extension of time, based on whether they prepare income tax returns for 10 or more taxpayers. • Provide a new discretion for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to choose not to recognise a person as a taxpayer’s nominated person if doing so would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system. Under the Business Transformation programme, Inland Revenue’s interactions with tax intermediaries will need to be efficient and tailored, so they can positively influence compliance behaviour. Under consideration are the services that Inland Revenue will provide to these intermediaries, as well as any risks to the integrity of the modernised tax system arising from tax intermediaries’ interactions with it. ROLE OF INTERMEDIARIES For many taxpayers, using the services of a third party (such as a tax agent, tax advisor or bookkeeper) is less costly than dealing with their own tax obligations. This is firstly because tax laws are complex, and secondly because there are other important things which taxpayers would rather do with their time (such as attending to their businesses). Although the Government is working towards greater tax simplification, tax laws will, by their nature, continue to be complex for taxpayers. For this reason, it is expected that tax intermediaries will continue to play a vital supporting role in the future tax administration. 62 Recent proposals (such as the accounting income method (AIM) and the filing of GST and PAYE information directly from business accounting and payroll software) are likely to mean that intermediaries will have a greater role in advising on setting up accounting systems for businesses and in proactively checking the accuracy and coding of transactions entered into business accounting software before the end of the period. It is therefore anticipated that for many intermediaries, their workload will shift from being focused primarily on period-end preparation towards a steadier flow throughout the year. As discussed in Chapter 5 of Towards a new Tax Administration Act, some of the ways in which tax intermediaries assist their clients to comply with their tax obligations include: • preparing financial statements and making year-end adjustments to calculate taxable income • providing advice about the tax implications of certain transactions and business structures • interpreting tax laws • educating clients about specific areas of the law and the administrative requirements involved in setting up a business and filing returns • advising on the nature and quality of records required to be kept • recommending accounting systems • preparing and filing tax returns • ensuring that clients meet their filing and payment obligations • interacting or corresponding with Inland Revenue on the client’s behalf. TYPES OF INTERMEDIARIES Because of the present legislative settings and Inland Revenue’s current operational practices concerning tax intermediaries, it is useful to distinguish between different types of tax intermediaries.70 The intermediaries who fall within the scope of the proposals raised in this chapter can be described as those who are engaged by taxpayers to assist them to comply with their tax obligations, and who interact with Inland Revenue (or with Inland Revenue’s systems via e-services) as a fee-earning agent of the taxpayer (or in their capacity as a fee-earning tax preparer71). In this context, the primary questions are therefore about who should be allowed access to Inland Revenue’s systems, and what level of access is appropriate, given the Commissioner’s responsibility to protect the integrity of the tax system. As discussed later in this chapter, it is proposed that a “tax intermediary” will, under the legislation, mean a third party who acts on behalf of taxpayers in relation to their tax affairs in a fee-earning capacity, and who is involved in the provision or preparation of tax information to Inland Revenue. Some of these 63 intermediaries may also pay tax to Inland Revenue on behalf of taxpayers. This includes some withholding intermediaries who are specifically contracted by employers to deduct and remit PAYE payments to Inland Revenue (such as PAYE intermediaries and payroll bureaus). A number of other third parties in the tax system (such as employers and banks) are required by law to withhold and pay tax to Inland Revenue on behalf of other taxpayers, and provide information about the income from which the tax was withheld. These third parties do not fall within the scope of the proposals raised in this chapter. This is primarily because the taxpayer does not “engage” their bank or their employer to deal with their tax affairs. Also, banks and employers do not need to access the taxpayer’s account information in order to perform their obligations, and they generally should not need to contact Inland Revenue in relation to the tax affairs of their employees or customers (with the exception of sending PAYE and RWT information and paying the tax that they withhold). There are some similarities between certain aspects of the roles performed by “traditional” tax intermediaries and the functions of accounting and payroll software products which software providers are currently developing in collaboration with Inland Revenue. For instance, accounting software packages will calculate tax liabilities from the data input, provided that transactions are entered accurately and are coded correc tly. At present, the Government does not consider accounting or payroll software developers to be intermediaries between taxpayers and Inland Revenue for the purpose of the proposals in this chapter. Instead, these software developers are providers of a commercial product which merely assists taxpayers in calculating their tax liabilities and in sending this information to Inland Revenue. If there are problems or errors with returns filed through software, Inland Revenue would only contact the software provider if it was a systemic issue affecting multiple taxpayers using the same software. For individual errors, Inland Revenue would contact the taxpayer or their agent.72 Application programming interfaces allow software products to transmit electronic returns of information (approved for transmission by the taxpayer or their agent) to Inland Revenue’s systems. In some cases, Inland Revenue might also provide access to some information about the software provider’s customers that is needed for accurate calculation of their tax liability – for example, in the context of AIM software, Inland Revenue might confirm the taxpayer’s Residual Income Tax (RIT) from the previous year. For these reasons some consideration needs to be given to software and its providers. For instance, it will be necessary to ensure that the software can calculate tax liabilities correctly in accordance with the current tax laws, as well as 64 reliably transmit all of the required information to Inland Revenue. The Commissioner also needs to have confidence that a particular software product will not have an adverse impact on the integrity of the tax system. In the future, some tax intermediary firms may branch out into software development, or approved software providers may broaden their role and offer tax intermediary services. If a software provider does this, they should be eligible for listing as described in this chapter. INTERMEDIARIES WHO FALL WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE PROPOSALS Since banks, employers and software providers are not considered to be tax intermediaries, this chapter focuses on tax agents who currently meet the definition in section 34B of the TAA and nominated persons who act on behalf of other taxpayers in a fee-earning capacity, such as bookkeepers. Ta x a g e n t s Section 34B(2) of the TAA defines a tax agent as a person who: • prepares the returns of income required to be furnished for 10 or more taxpayers; and • is one of the following: • a practitioner carrying on a professional public practice; • a person carrying on a business or occupation in which returns of income are prepared; or • the Māori Trustee. Tax agents have a critical role in the compliance behaviour of their clients, and hence in tax collection73. Currently, approximately 5,900 tax agents in New Zealand act on behalf of around 2.7 million taxpayers. Around 60% of these tax agents are members of professional bodies or associations. Tax agents also have an important role in reducing Inland Revenue’s administrative costs of acquiring income and tax information from the 2.7 million taxpayers who use an agent. Section 34B(1) of the TAA requires Inland Revenue to compile and maintain a list of registered tax agents. People and entities who meet the section 34B definition are eligible to apply to be listed as a tax agent. The current legislation recognises the importance of tax agents in 65 influencing compliance outcomes by providing listed tax agents with an extended period of time in which to file their clients’ income tax returns, and extending by two months the end-of-year tax due date for taxpayers linked to a tax agent. In addition, Inland Revenue provides a range of services specifically for listed tax agents. These services include: • a dedicated phone service for tax agents to communicate with Inland Revenue • self-service options in myIR (and in the E-File software package) which allow tax agents to file their clients’ tax returns online and view clients’ account information. Intermediaries who may not meet the statutory definition of a tax agent Intermediaries who do not meet the formal section 34B definition of a tax agent must be nominated by a taxpayer to act on their behalf when dealing with Inland Revenue. This includes things like receiving their clients’ statements, refunds and correspondence from Inland Revenue. People who are specifically nominated to file returns on behalf of a taxpayer also have access to electronic filing via online services in myIR, but not through E-File. Nominated persons commonly include bookkeepers (who typically deal with GST and PAYE returns but not income tax), payroll intermediaries and tax pooling intermediaries. THE FUTURE ROLE OF TAX INTERMEDIARIES Regardless of the level of simplification and automation of the tax administration system that will occur under the Government’s Making Tax Simpler agenda (and under Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme), many taxpayers will still prefer to pay an intermediary rather than deal with everything related to their tax affairs. Tax intermediaries will therefore have a key role in enabling their clients to benefit from the new features of the modernised tax administration. Tax agents currently spend a considerable amount of time checking the accuracy of their clients’ accounting records and making year-end adjustments. Even with the features of a modernised tax administration, tax intermediaries will still need to carry out these tasks, as well as continue to provide advice to clients on how to comply with their tax obligations. Hence, tax intermediaries will continue to play a vital role in compliance outcomes. Nevertheless, as noted earlier, it is inevitable that the role of tax intermediaries will change. The tax administration changes (along with changes in business systems and processes) will allow tax intermediaries to work more in real time, and spend less time on routine processes and more time on providing other valuable services to their clients. 66 Improved services for tax intermediaries via digital channels To support tax intermediaries in enabling their clients to benefit from the new features of the modernised tax administration, Inland Revenue intends to offer more online self- service options. Towards a new Tax Administration Act invited submissions from tax agents on which current Inland Revenue services they find most useful, and what types of services they would like in the future. The submissions received showed that tax agents would like to see a wider range of self- service options so that they can work more efficiently and manage clients’ tax affairs in real-time. Some existing services could be streamlined and made more efficient through online self-service channels, such as: • requesting a notification to the client’s myIR portal asking the client to provide records to their tax intermediary • changing the filing frequency or basis for GST • requesting an amendment to an assessment for a client’s tax return • transferring funds between accounts for tax pooling (below a certain threshold) • accessing client filing statistics. An intermediary will only be able to see the tax types for which the client has given authorisation for them to view and/or edit. The examples below illustrate the benefits of using electronic self- service to issue a records request, compared with having Inland Revenue send a letter. 67 CURRENT STATE Malcolm is one of the partners in XYZ. XYZ is experiencing difficulty in getting one of their clients to provide business records to enable finalisation of their tax position. Malcolm has found in the past a letter from Inland Revenue requesting the client to provide their records to their tax agent has encouraged his clients to provide the information necessary to complete their tax return. MALCOLM PARTNER IN XYZ FIRST CALL TO INLAND REVENUE Malcolm gets through to Inland Revenue call centre staff member and is given a temporary PIN which is valid for 24 hours.

Malcolm decides to ring the tax Malcolm rings the Inland Revenue agent self-service phone line to call centre and continues with his request an “L letter” to be sent to other work while he is waiting to his client. Unfortunately he has talk to a call centre staff member. He forgotten his PIN. leave his phone on speaker while he works which limits what he can do Example – issue of an “L letter” XYZ Tax Limited (XYZ) is a Dunedin chartered accountancy firm which offers tax return preparation and advisory services. XYZ is experiencing difficulty in getting one of their clients to provide business records. Malcolm – one of the partners in XYZ – has found that, in the past, a letter from Inland Revenue requesting their records (an “L letter”) has encouraged his clients to provide the information needed to complete their tax returns. Malcolm decides to ask Inland Revenue to issue an L Letter in this instance. To do this, he has to use the tax agent self-service phone line, but he has forgotten his PIN. He rings the Inland Revenue call centre and continues with his other work while he is waiting. He leaves his phone on speaker while he works, which limits what he can do. The Inland Revenue call centre staff member gives him a temporary PIN which is valid for 24 hours. Malcolm then makes a second call to the tax agent self-service line to reset his PIN. Then he can follow the prompts on the self-service line to request the issue of the L letter. 68 FUTURE STATE MALCOLM PARTNER IN XYZ ONLINE SELF-SERVICE Malcolm needs to issue a notification to encourage his clients to provide the information necessary to complete their tax returns. He has forgotten his sign in password. myIR FORGOTTEN YOUR PASSWORD? RESET PASSWORD LOG IN Malcolm can use the password reset on the myIR page and have a new password generated and emailed to him. From here it is a quick and easy process to sign in to his online portal and request that notifications be sent. Example – issue of an electronic request to provide tax records This process could be streamlined through the use of online self- service. Malcolm will sign in to his online portal in myIR and pull up his full client list. He can simply tick the boxes to select the clients who need a records request. The system will do the rest. If he forgets his password, he can use the password reset on the myIR log-in page and his new password will be emailed to him straight away. Although the scenario described in the second example does not demonstrate a large technological advancement, the difference between the two examples is a good demonstration of the efficiency gains that can be made through providing more online services for tax intermediaries and moving more existing self-service options to digital channels. The following examples use another scenario to illustrate how online self- service can make things easier for tax intermediaries. 69 CURRENT STATE MALCOLM JOANNE PARTNER IN XYZ ACCOUNT MANAGER 1.

Joanne generates the report, prints it, scans it as a PDF, password protects it and emails it to Malcolm (with a separate email containing the password). When Malcolm receives the report the following day, he thinks how helpful it would be to have a report which covers filing information for other tax types, rather than just income tax. He also notices that the report is not completely up to date, as it does not include returns which have been filed but not yet processed. 70 FUTURE STATE myIR Client Filing Statistics Filter data by tax types Update Welcome Malcolm at XYZ Clients who have filed their income tax return Clients who have not filed their income tax return PAY E FBT Income tax GST Example – self-service access to client filing statistics This process could be streamlined through allowing intermediaries to access client filing statistics in myIR. Malcolm will simply log in to request the filing data, and can tailor it to include whatever tax type details he needs. He will be able to view up-to-date information in real-time. XYZ will be able to monitor their clients’ filing performance and provide early assistance to any clients who need it. EXTENSION OF TAX AGENT SERVICES TO PAYE AND GST FILERS The tax agent definition in section 34B only covers income tax returns, so does not include intermediaries who only deal with PAYE or GST, or who prepare fewer than 10 income tax returns per year. Intermediaries who do not meet the legal definition of a tax agent are currently not able to access Inland Revenue’s services provided to tax agents. This restriction is not required by law, but is an administrative decision by the Commissioner to better ensure the integrity of the tax system. 71 However, the Government understands that many stakeholders consider that there needs to be more recognition of tax intermediaries who may not act for clients with respect to income tax but who offer payroll or GST services. It is proposed that these intermediaries (as long as they meet some minimum eligibility requirements) be able to register with Inland Revenue, so they and their clients may benefit from some of the services currently offered to tax agents. It would be inappropriate to grant intermediaries not meeting the current section 34B definition of a tax agent more access rights without being able to deny or remove their access if the intermediary is considered to be a risk to the integrity of the tax system. By granting them similar benefits to those received by tax agents, these intermediaries would be given an elevated position of trust in the tax system. From a fairness perspective, they should therefore be subject to the same integrity standards and rules. There may be value in a statutory rule that grants the Commissioner discretion to suspend if necessary an intermediary’s status and access. EXPANDING THE COVERAGE OF SECTION 34B To deal with this issue, the tax agent definition in section 34B could be widened to cover intermediaries who act on behalf of taxpayers in relation to their tax affairs for a fee,74 as well as those who prepare tax returns on behalf of their employer.75 It is proposed that bookkeepers, payroll intermediaries, tax pooling intermediaries and other intermediaries should be eligible to apply for listing. Proposed definition of “fee” (for the purposes of a new section 34B) To clarify the application of a new definition, it is proposed that a “fee” could be defined as consideration paid for the tax intermediary services supplied, which is (or has a monetary value equivalent to) a dollar value typically paid in an arm’s length transaction on the open market for the type of services provided. This could also include margins charged by the intermediary (for instance, a percentage of a tax refund paid out) and any government subsidies, as well as direct fees. Applying for listing is proposed to be optional for those who are eligible The Government recognises that in the new START system, nominated person access (as opposed to access as a listed tax agent) will likely be sufficient for some intermediaries. Applying for listing under section 34B will be optional for those who qualify. Intermediaries will only apply for listing if they would gain a benefit, for example through the additional services.76 72 Change in terminology To better reflect the proposed wider group of tax intermediaries who would be eligible to apply for listing under section 34B, it may be appropriate to replace the term “tax agent” with an alternative term. For instance, the references to “tax agent” in the TAA (including in section 34B) could be changed to “tax intermediary”, meaning the wider group representing taxpayers for a fee, as well as those preparing tax returns for their employer. Taxpayers can be linked to multiple intermediaries A taxpayer might engage more than one intermediary for different tasks, so they will be able to link to multiple intermediaries in Inland Revenue’s system. Defining who is eligible for the extension of time The Government considers that the existing extension of time for filing and paying income tax for clients linked to tax agents should continue to apply to income tax only. Any extension of time for PAYE would be inconsistent with the policy objective of increasing the regularity at which businesses send PAYE information to Inland Revenue. It is proposed that the legislation defines eligibility for an extension of time separately from the definition of a tax intermediary or agent. This is to ensure that the two concepts are not automatically linked. At this stage, there are no firm proposals for any change to the eligibility criteria for an extension of time: however, as was noted in Towards a new Tax Administration Act, the extension of time may become less important in the modernised tax administration and may be reviewed later. For the time being, only listed intermediaries who prepare income tax returns for 10 or more taxpayers will be eligible. Tax intermediary linking process and taxpayer control of intermediaries’ access To enable easy and convenient client self-management of intermediaries’ access, Inland Revenue is expecting to make more online self-service options available to taxpayers. Appendix 2 explains the expected process for intermediary access to taxpayers’ accounts. PROTECTING THE INTEGRITY OF THE TAX SYSTEM If the Commissioner of Inland Revenue believes that accepting an application to be a tax agent would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system, she must refuse the application.77 The Commissioner may also remove a person from the list of tax agents if she is satisfied that the applicant is not eligible to be a tax agent, or if their remaining on the list would compromise the integrity of the tax system.78 Listing a person as a tax agent (or allowing them to stay on the list) may be determined to have an adverse 73 effect on the integrity of the tax system if the applicant (or a “key office holder” of the applicant if the applicant is not a natural person): • is an undischarged bankrupt • is a liquidated company • is a company under voluntary administration or in receivership • is not allowed by the Registrar of Companies to be a company director • has been notified of a breach by the disciplinary body of a professional organisation they belong to • has been convicted of any criminal offence involving dishonesty • has a record of non-compliance with any Inland Revenue Acts, including overdue returns or payments, or social policy that Inland Revenue administers. The above criteria are cited in the form Application to be listed as a tax agent or update a tax agent’s details (IR791) but the Commissioner may also consider other factors to determine whether listing a person as a tax agent would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system. Consideration has been given to whether more regulation of tax intermediaries (like in Australia, for instance) might be justified. An argument can be made that setting some minimum standards for eligibility to apply for listing as a tax agent would reduce the likelihood of an unsuitable advisor being listed. These standards could require certain qualifications, years of relevant experience or membership of an approved professional body. Requiring membership of an approved professional body could be considered to reduce the tax integrity risk because professional accounting bodies have their own code of conduct and disciplinary procedures for members who contravene that code. There would be a case for regulation if it can be determined that the resulting tax integrity benefit would outweigh the additional costs imposed. However, this is unlikely to be the case. Instead, the imposition of higher barriers to entry is likely to increase the price of tax intermediary services (by reducing the supply of those services) and thus increase taxpayers’ costs of getting advice. It is also likely that people who do not qualify will seek access as nominated persons, rather than as tax agents. As well as delisting, other measures are currently used to discourage the types of behaviour by intermediaries that would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system. These include sanctions such as promoter penalties and criminal prosecutions for aiding and abetting (or directly engaging in) fraud. If taxpayers have incurred penalties due to a mistake or unscrupulous behaviour by their intermediary, they have a remedy in contract law and in general consumer 74 law to recover their loss from the person. Currently, the number of declined applications and delistings is relatively low. This is not expected to change. It is therefore considered that any tax integrity benefit from stricter eligibility requirements for tax intermediaries would be outweighed by higher compliance costs for taxpayers (along with increased administrative costs for Inland Revenue), and would unfairly penalise a large proportion of currently listed tax agents. On this basis, the Government does not propose introducing any stricter eligibility rules for tax intermediaries. Intermediaries’ access as nominated persons The Commissioner can only revoke a nominated person’s authority to act for a taxpayer at the taxpayer’s request – even if the person has been convicted of fraud and is acting on behalf of the taxpayer for a fee. As a result, there is a risk that an individual removed from the list of tax agents for integrity reasons could come back into the system as a nominated person. To deal with the problems caused by a small minority of nominated persons, the Government proposes that the Commissioner be granted the discretion to refuse to accept a nominated person application if that person has been delisted for tax integrity reasons, or if allowing that person access would adversely affect the integrity of the tax system. The criteria that the Commissioner might apply in exercising this discretion could be the same criteria used to remove a person from the list of tax agents. Hence, the Government does not intend to introduce a prescriptive set of criteria into the legislation. The discretion to refuse to accept a nominated person application is proposed to be limited to situations where the person is acting on behalf of a taxpayer for a fee or otherwise acting in a professional capacity. It is important that taxpayers still have the freedom to have a friend or relative of their choosing (or a volunteer in the case of a non-profit body) act on their behalf in relation to their tax affairs if they wish. 75 70 These are not formal distinctions but explain the different roles of these intermediaries and the different levels of access to Inland Revenue’s services. In practice, nominated persons who act on behalf of taxpayers in a fee-earning capacity (such as bookkeepers, for instance) can be thought of as tax agents who do not meet the TAA definition of a tax agent – either because they are not in the business of preparing income tax returns, or because they prepare fewer than 10 income tax returns per year. 71 “Acting in their capacity as a fee-earning tax preparer” would include situations where a person who acts on behalf of some taxpayers for a fee, also performs pro bono work for family or friends. 72 If a taxpayer has trouble meeting their filing obligations or calculating tax correctly because of a software error, they would need to contact the software provider to get the problem sorted out. 73 Erard, B. (1993). Taxation with representation: An analysis of the role of tax practitioners in tax compliance. Journal of Public Economics, 52 (2), 163-197. 74 “Tax affairs” includes social policy administered by Inland Revenue (such as student loans and Working for Families tax credits). 75 A change to the section 34B definition would have no impact on tax advisors’ privilege under section 20B. 76 In the current system, nominated persons who file returns online on behalf of multiple taxpayers have a myIR log-in for each client. Because tax agents can file electronically using the Commissioner’s E-File software, they do not need to have multiple log-ins. In START, nominated persons will also have just one log-in for Inland Revenue’s e-services, regardless of how many taxpayers they are linked to. 77 Section 34B(7) of the TAA. 78 Section 34B(8) of the TAA. 76 CHAPTER 6 ROLE OF THE COMMISSIONER & DESIGN OF A NEW TAX ADMINISTRATION ACT SUMMARY OF PROPOSALS • Extend the care and management provision to allow the Commissioner some greater administrative flexibility in limited circumstances. • Allow a greater use of regulations for tax administration, including for: • a more tailored approach to different types of taxpayers • trials of tax administration processes. • Amend the structure of the TAA to reflect the modernised tax administration, including basing the Act around core provisions. • Adopt a more hierarchical approach to drafting the TAA, including a greater use of principles in specific situations when it is appropriate. Towards a new Tax Administration Act noted that tax administration is integral to supporting the Government’s objectives for better public services, and ultimately for building a more competitive and productive economy. The discussion document also noted that the future TAA must be capable of accommodating shifting priorities and allow for a more resilient and responsive tax system to better fit New Zealand’s needs. A question is whether the current TAA fully achieves those goals and whether it is too prescriptive and inflexible. This chapter: • firms up the Government’s proposals to broaden the Commissioner’s care and management responsibilities • discusses the role of regulations in tax administration • considers changes to the structure of the TAA to make it more resilient and responsive to the changing environment. 77 As part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation, the Government expects numerous changes to tax administration will require legislative amendments. The Government intends to progressively rewrite the legislation, so any amendments will be made to the existing Act but will be drafted consistently with the proposed structure. The Government considers that enacting a rewritten TAA should wait until Business Transformation is complete. GREATER ADMINISTRATIVE FLEXIBILITY As discussed in Towards a new Tax Administration Act, one of the key aspects of the Commissioner’s care and management of the tax system is applying and explaining the law to taxpayers. Generally, the tax law can be interpreted consistently with the policy intent. However, in some cases the interpretation of the law using ordinary statutory interpretation principles may not accord with the policy intent. In applying those ordinary statutory interpretation principles, the courts have discussed the extent to which the purpose of a provision can override the ordinary meaning of the words through giving the relevant statutory terms a strained meaning or gap-filling. The Commissioner’s care and management responsibility in sections 6 and 6A has been interpreted as limited to providing her with flexibility as to the allocation of her resources. This could be argued as not providing her with flexibility regarding legislative anomalies. However, flexibility around legislative anomalies can be closely related to the allocation of resources, because it can prevent Commissioner and taxpayer resources being tied up in outcomes that are inconsistent with both parties’ practice and/or expectations. As a result, the proposed extension of the Commissioner’s care and management responsibility outlined in Towards a new Tax Administration Act can be seen as a clarification of the current scope of the provision. Towards a new Tax Administration Act suggested a clarification to the care and management provision in New Zealand to include some of the situations mentioned in R v Inland Revenue Commissioners; Ex parte Wilkinson \[2005\] UKHL 30. The proposal was not to incorporate the United Kingdom approach to the care and management provision (including the use of extra-statutory concessions) because it was not considered consistent with New Zealand’s tax administration system. Instead the approach was to consider what could be drawn from the criteria listed in Wilkinson, adapted for the New Zealand statutory context. Most submitters expressed tentative support for expanding the Commissioner’s administrative flexibility under her care and management power, subject to a number of conditions. These included safeguards and clear guidelines over the exercise of the power, as well as requirements that the discretion be exercised in a consistent and taxpayer-favourable manner. Some submitters stated that they believe 78 that this discretion already exists, but that the relevant provisions are being too narrowly interpreted. Others said that they would like Inland Revenue officials to explore further the option of greater regulation-making powers (which is discussed in the next section). The Government considered whether it should set out specific criteria to limit the exercise of the power, or whether it should have a general ability to remedy legislative anomalies. While having a general discretion would provide the Commissioner with more flexibility, the Government considers that given the importance of maintaining the rule of law, the power should be specifically limited to set criteria. Further, the criteria would provide clear guidelines over the exercise of any discretionary power, as sought by submitters. Following consideration of the submissions, the Government proposes that the Commissioner would be able to use her discretion in relation to: • MINOR LEGISLATIVE ANOMALIES Limiting this criterion to minor gaps in the legislation would mean it is intended to have a narrow application and to be used in limited situations. The criterion would be drafted narrowly but without reference to a monetary threshold, which could give rise to the standard difficulties with a bright-line test. • TRANSITORY LEGISLATIVE ANOMALIES Allowing the Commissioner to deal pragmatically with transitory issues would involve considering whether the cost of complying with the provision is disproportionate to the relevant purpose or object. If that is the case, then it may support the Commissioner exercising her discretion. • CASES WHEN THE RELEVANT LEGISLATION DOES NOT ADEQUATELY DEAL WITH A PARTICULAR SITUATION BECAUSE A STATUTORY RULE IS DIFFICULT TO FORMULATE This criterion would only apply in rare situations when owing to the complexity of the legislation it has not quite managed to encompass the policy in a sufficiently precise way. In most cases, a purposive approach to statutory interpretation would resolve the issue. However, when this was not the case, the Commissioner would be able to use her discretion to clarify the application of the legislation until it could be clarified by subsequent legislative amendment. • A LONG-STANDING ESTABLISHED PRACTICE OF BOTH THE COMMISSIONER AND TAXPAYERS The discretion would be able to be used when a long-standing practice has been accepted by the Commissioner and taxpayers, which subsequently turns out to be inconsistent with the legislation (interpreted purposively). The inconsistency may arise because of a court decision or a change in an Inland Revenue interpretation. The use of the discretion would allow the desired administrative 79 action to be taken until the law can be amended or the practice be changed to be consistent with the law. • CASES OF UNFAIRNESS AT THE MARGINS This criterion would allow the Commissioner to deal with situations where the result under the law would create inequity to a broad group of taxpayers. The criterion is intended to reflect the Commissioner’s current obligation to protect the integrity of the tax system, which includes considering taxpayers’ perceptions of tax integrity and fairness when administering the law.79 At the margin, this means that the care and management decision would be on small matters that could go either way but when it would be fairer to give taxpayers the benefit of the doubt. A criterion that the discretion would be applied only in taxpayer-friendly situations has been considered. This would not be stipulated directly, since Inland Revenue may not know the precise impact for some taxpayers. Instead, the Government considers the better approach is to make the application of the care and management decision optional. Any application of the proposed discretion would not rewrite the current law, as it would still apply. This would align with the proposed Australian statutory remedial power (discussed below). This would mean that taxpayers would apply the discretion if they thought it was favourable to them. The taxpayer would still be able to apply what they consider to be the best view of the law if they did not consider that the application of the discretion would be favourable to them. The Commissioner will have to weigh the consequences of different taxpayers using different approaches in determining whether to apply her discretion to an issue. It may be that the discrepancies between the treatments for different taxpayers (and the likely fiscal impact) would make it inappropriate to apply the discretion. The Government considers that the exercise of the discretion would be consistent with the Commissioner’s obligation to collect over time the highest net revenue practicable within the law because: • The exercise of the discretion would promote voluntary compliance by reducing taxpayer compliance costs for issues that are inconsistent with the policy intent. • The Commissioner would be able to avoid committing resources to minor or transitory anomalies, so she could better direct resources to the relevant risks. 80 Examples The proposed approach can be seen in the two examples set out in Towards a new Tax Administration Act. The first example was when the Act did not allow the Commissioner to set a value for FBT purposes for something that was not a good or service, and this was contrary to the clear policy intent. The Commissioner could use the discretion to set a value for the relevant thing (such as a discount on a sale price) despite the legislation being limited to goods and services. The taxpayer could then determine whether they want to apply the market value or the value set by the Commissioner under her discretion. The second example discussed a drafting error that prevented taxpayers from using different methods for determining their FIF income when they had different investments in the same FIF. In that hypothetical example, the Commissioner could exercise her discretion to allow taxpayers to calculate their FIF income using two different methods. It would be up to taxpayers whether they used one or two methods. Given the potential for deviations from the rule of law, the Government considers that some specific safeguards should apply to the care and management extension, including the following: • EXERCISING THE DISCRETION CONSISTENTLY WITH POLICY INTENT Any exercise of the discretion would have to be consistent with the commonly-accepted policy intent of the primary legislation, and would not allow for any policy-making ability. This means, the policy intent would have to be clear. • GUIDED BY THE CURRENT PRINCIPLES The exercise of the discretion would be guided by the current principles in section 6A. Specifically, the exercise would have regard to — • the resources available to the Commissioner • the importance of promoting compliance, especially voluntary compliance, by all taxpayers with the Inland Revenue Acts • the compliance costs incurred by taxpayers. • PLACING TIME LIMITS ON THE USE OF THE DISCRETION Any exercise of the discretion would be time-limited and could not exceed three years. If the issue was ongoing after the expiry date, it would need to be amended in the primary legislation. 81 • REQUIRING CONSULTATION Before exercising the discretion, the Commissioner would be required to undertake consultation. Depending on the issue, this could range from broad public and private sector consultation to targeted consultation. • BEING TRANSPARENT ABOUT THE USE OF THE DISCRETION Assisting taxpayers to meet their tax obligations is an important part of Inland Revenue’s role in the tax system. Taxpayers must be informed if their rights and obligations are to be understood. Accordingly, the Commissioner would be required to publish any exercise of the discretion. This would ensure that the discretion would be exercised consistently. • REQUIRING THE DISCRETION TO BE EXERCISED BY AN APPROPRIATE PERSON The person authorised to exercise the discretion would have an appropriate level of expertise and would hold an appropriate office having regard to the importance of the issue. The Commissioner’s application of the extended care and management power would be treated as being similar to an official opinion of the Commissioner and would be subject to the current protections that apply to such advice.80 As noted in Towards a new Tax Administration Act, the Government proposes to clarify how the care and management responsibilities relate to the Commissioner’s non-tax functions. The proposed extension to the care and management power discussed above would be made in conjunction with the clarification for the non- tax functions, so that the extended power would also apply to the Commissioner’s non-tax functions. MAKING GREATER USE OF REGULATIONS The current tax administration system in New Zealand relies heavily on primary legislation, as predominately reflected in the TAA. This means the rules are slow to adapt, and inflexible for different types of taxpayers. Parliament has provided a broad regulation-making power in the TAA (sections 224 and 225), as well as specific provisions allowing regulations to be made. However, there has been a general reluctance to use regulations to support primary legislation in the tax context because of the critical role of Parliament in imposing taxes. The principle that only Parliament can impose or suspend taxes is longstanding, dating back to the Bill of Rights Act 1688. However, this alone does not explain the reluctance in using regulations for tax administration, which relates to tax administration procedures rather than the imposition of taxes. The limited use of regulations in the current tax administration system contrasts with the use of regulations in some other statutory regimes.81 The broader use of regulations in those 82 Acts reflects the general acceptance that delegated legislation is both necessary and desirable. The Government considers that a greater use of regulations could assist in modernising the tax system to meet the changing expectations of the public and government. As discussed below, the Government is not seeking, however, to introduce an overriding regulation-making power (a so called Henry VIII clause) beyond the transitory regulation-making power in the Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill. Reasons for making a greater use of regulations There are some good reasons why a greater use should be made of regulations in the tax administration context. Overall, including all the tax administration rules in primary legislation makes the Act complex and cumbersome. Using regulations could make it less so. The process for making and amending regulations is quicker than the process for enacting or amending primary legislation, because it is less dependent on Parliamentary timetables. This means that regulations can be changed more quickly to deal with new issues. There are also some more specific reasons for making more use of regulations: • They would allow for a more tailored approach to different types of taxpayers (eg, different tax administration requirements could apply to large corporates as compared to single individual taxpayers). The tailored guidance could help taxpayers to understand how specific rules apply to their situations. Alternatively, the regulations could be used to exempt certain types of taxpayers from a requirement under an administrative provision. • Tax administration processes could be trialled, given the relative speed for making changes. Any regulations providing for a trial would need to state a start and end date of the trial, and be clear about what the trial involved. • The increased use of regulations could be as part of a general move to a more hierarchical approach to drafting which could provide the legislative setting for regulations. Any increase in the use of regulations in the tax administration system has the potential to be seen as undermining the role of Parliament. As a result, the Government seeks to strike a balance as to when regulations will be used instead of provisions in the tax Acts. At this stage it is considered appropriate to focus only on including administrative processes in regulations. To ensure maintenance of the rule of law, regulations are subject to the Regulations Review Committee’s process, disallowance by Parliament under the Regulations (Disallowance) Act 1989 and judicial review by the courts. 83 Remedying legislative anomalies As noted above, some submitters on Towards a new Tax Administration Act suggested that a broader regulation- making power could be used to remedy legislative anomalies, in addition to or replacing the proposed extended care and management proposal. The submitters cited the current proposal in Australia. The Australian proposal is to provide the Australian Commissioner of Taxation with a statutory remedial power to allow for the timely resolution of unforeseen or unintended outcomes in the application of taxation and superannuation laws. The proposal is currently progressing through the Australian Parliament.82 The proposed remedial power does not allow the Australian Commissioner to directly amend the text of primary legislation or to alter or extend the purpose or object of the law. Rather it allows the Commissioner to modify the operation of a provision of a tax law where that modification is consistent with the purpose or object of the provision and any budget impact from the modification is negligible. The proposed remedial power can only be exercised as a last resort after the other options have been considered unsuitable. Although the power may resolve some issues, in many cases it would be more appropriate for the Commissioner to seek an amendment to the primary legislation. The Australian proposal intends to reduce the time taken to give effect to minor legislative corrections. It also allows for some minor technical corrections to be made when this might otherwise not occur. Any modifications made using the power will not apply to a taxpayer if it produces a less favourable result for them than would otherwise be the case. The New Zealand Parliament is a fully sovereign legislature, so it has the power to delegate the authority to make regulations that amend or repeal primary legislation in limited cases. As submitters on the Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill indicated, the case for such a regulation-making power needs to be clearly made and taxpayers’ rights protected. The proposed extension to the Commissioner’s care and management power would mean that an ability to make remedying legislative instruments is not essential. The Government also considers the Australian proposal is shaped by the relevant context, and the difficulty in getting primary legislation enacted due to the particular characteristics of that jurisdiction. The same issues do not apply in New Zealand. As a result, while some submitters supported allowing regulations to remedy legislative anomalies, the Government does not propose such a power in New Zealand. 84 ISSUES WITH THE CURRENT STRUCTURE OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATION ACT The Working Party on the Reorganisation of the Income Tax Act 1976 described the original purpose of the TAA as creating the process for collecting tax.83 The Act was intended to regulate the relationship between the Commissioner and taxpayers. The working party noted that the way in which taxpayers perceive the fairness of the taxation system, and the efficiency and effectiveness with which it is administered are just as important as the law defining taxpayers’ liability. The working party also noted that some provisions did not fit easily into either the Income Tax Act or the proposed TAA, as they contained elements of both quantification and administration. As a result, the working party adopted a pragmatic approach to which Act these provisions should be in and allocated them accordingly. There are several issues with the current structure of the TAA: • THE ACT IS STRUCTURED AROUND A PROCESS THAT HAS UNDERGONE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE Tax administration has undergone Tax administration has undergone significant change since the TAA was enacted. For example, the Act was originally structured on the basis of a Commissioner assessment model. This means the part dealing with returns is divorced from the part dealing with taxpayer self-assessment, even though the two are now part of the same process. • OVER TIME THE ACT HAS BECOME LESS COHERENT The Act has undergone significant amendment since it was enacted 22 years ago, including the addition of several new parts. While every effort has been made to incorporate the amendments into the existing structure, inevitably the Act has become less coherent. As tax administration continues to evolve, it will become increasingly difficult to maintain the coherence of the current Act. • CHANGES UNDER BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION NEED TO BE BETTER REFLECTED IN THE ACT Proposals in this discussion document suggest changes to relationships and processes that underpin the current structure – for example, changes to the nature of secrecy/confidentiality and information collection/sharing, and changes to the role of agents and intermediaries. More broadly, the Act needs to incorporate future new processes and evolving concepts, such as the proposed accounting income method. These changes need to be coherently reflected in the legislation. The new Act will continue to contain the procedural or administrative provisions that create the process for collecting tax, and to regulate the relationship between the Commissioner, taxpayers and tax intermediaries. In addition, the new Act will need to have two important characteristics: 85 • REFLECT THE FIVE KEY DIMENSIONS OF THE MODERNISED TAX ADMINISTRATION SYSTEM the modernised tax administration rests on five key dimensions: the role of the Commissioner, the role of taxpayers, the role of tax intermediaries, confidentiality and information collection/sharing. The new Act would ideally be structured in a way that better reflects those five key dimensions. • RESPONSIVE AND RESILIENT The new Act will need to be drafted in a way that is more responsive and resilient to changes in tax administration. The responsiveness can be incorporated into the Act by: • providing the Commissioner with greater administrative flexibility • reducing the reliance on primary legislation and making greater use of regulations • adopting a more hierarchical approach to drafting (when appropriate). HIERARCHICAL APPROACH TO DRAFTING The Government proposes a more hierarchical approach to drafting in the TAA, including a greater use of principles when it is appropriate. The Working Party envisaged the tax legislation “would embody a hierarchy moving from general principles reflected in the core provisions part, which are developed in more detailed provisions contained in the subparts of the succeeding parts of the Act, to even greater detail ... in regulations in relation to mechanical or administrative matters"84. While such an approach has been adopted in the Income Tax Act 2007, there are few examples of such an approach in th e TA A . The Government acknowledges there are both advantages and disadvantages with adopting a more hierarchical approach, which may include a greater use of principles.85 The risks need to be balanced against the benefits of the approach in particular cases. Australia and the United Kingdom have adopted a more hierarchical approach (including a greater use of principles) to a much greater extent.86 The Government seeks submissions on areas where the approach may be appropriate for the n ew TA A . 86 Example The Government considers that the current rules around secrecy/ confidentiality are complex and detailed, and are an example of when a principles-based approach to drafting could be used. There is a general principle that Inland Revenue staff must maintain secrecy and must not communicate any matter except for the purpose of carrying into effect the tax legislation. However, there are numerous detailed exceptions to that principle. It is difficult for taxpayers to understand when their information will be shared and when it will be kept confidential. . As discussed in Chapter 3, it may be possible to draft the confidentiality provisions setting out the principles when Inland Revenue is able to share or communicate the relevant information. 79 Section 6(2)(f ). 80 See Status of Commissioner’s Advice (http://www.ird.govt. nz/technical-tax/commissioners-statements/status-of­ commissioners-advice.html). 81 The Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013, the Resource Management Act 1991 and the Fisheries Act 1996 make extensive use of regulations 82 See the Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2016 Measures No. 2) Bill 2016. 83 Second Report of the Working Party on the Reorganisation of the Income Tax Act 1976 (September 1993) 35. 84 Second Report of the Working Party on the Reorganisation of the Income Tax Act 1976 (September 1993) 35. 85 See Sir Ivor Richardson, Inland Revenue Tax Drafting Conference (Auckland, 27-29 November 1996) 29-30; John F Avery Jones Tax Law: rules or principles British Tax Review (1996) 580, 587; Greg Pinder The Coherent principles approach to tax law design in Australian Treasury, Treasury Economic Roundup (Autumn 2005); Daniel Lovric Principle-based drafting: experience from tax drafting The Loophole—Journal of the Commonwealth Association of Legislative Counsel (December 2010) 17. 86 See Tax Law Reform Committee Final Report on Tax Legislation (1996) IFS and Greg Pinder The Coherent principles approach to tax law design in Australian Treasury, Treasury Economic Roundup (Autumn 2005). 87 APPENDIX 1 APPROACHES TO AMENDING ASSESSMENTS IN AUSTRALIA & THE UNITED KINGDOM AMENDING GST ASSESSMENTS IN AUSTRALIA A materiality approach is adopted in determining what errors can be included in a subsequent return for Australian GST. If a taxpayer makes a GST error on an earlier activity statement, they can choose to correct that error on a later activity statement if they meet certain conditions, including the materiality of the error and whether the error was a result of recklessness or intentional disregard of a GST law. Alternatively they could correct the error by revising the earlier activity statement. The benefits of correcting GST errors on a later activity statement are: • the taxpayer is not liable to any penalties or general interest charge • it is generally easier than revising the earlier activity statement. When the taxpayer has reported or paid too little GST for a period (a debit error), it can only be corrected in a later activity statement if it is under thresholds that relate to the taxpayer’s turnover. These are shown in the table on the following page. Taxpayers can offset any credit errors against debit errors to work out whether they are below the debit error threshold. The Government notes that the Australian approach applies very low materiality thresholds compared to the GST turnover. The percentage values are generally significantly less than 1%. However, the absolute amounts are very large. For small and medium-sized enterprises (with GST turnover under $20 million) the monetary threshold is significantly higher than the current minor error exception in New Zealand. However, an error cannot be corrected in a later activity statement if the error was a result of recklessness or intentional disregard of a GST law. The error also cannot be corrected later if it relates to a matter that was specified to be subject to a compliance activity or if it was made in a reporting period that is subject to a compliance activity. 88 CURRENT GST TURNOVER (AUD) TIME LIMIT DEBIT ERROR VALUE LIMIT (AUD) Less than $20 million The error must be corrected in a GST return that is lodged within 18 months of the due date of the GST return for the tax period in which the error was made. Less than $10,000 $20 million to less than $100 million Less than $20,000 $100 million to less than $500 million The error must be corrected in a GST return that is lodged within 12 months Less than $40,000 $500 million to less than $1 billion the tax period in which the error was made. of the due date of the GST return for Less than $80,000 $1 billion and over Less than $450,000 AMENDING VAT ASSESSMENTS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM A materiality approach is also adopted in the United Kingdom to determine whether an error can be included in a later VAT return. The option allows errors to be corrected later if the net value: • does not exceed £10,000, or • is between £10,000 and £50,000 and does not exceed 1% of the net outputs on the return (subject to certain other conditions). Correcting errors this way is not a disclosure for the purposes of the penalties rules, so if the taxpayer has been careless they will not be able to gain the maximum reduction of the penalty unless they also notify HMRC separately in writing. The United Kingdom approach has a higher threshold to include errors in a subsequent return and a larger percentage (at 1%) for the turnover threshold (net outputs). However, unlike the Australian approach, including the error in a subsequent return does not provide any protection from penalties. For any reduction to a penalty a taxpayer must provide a separate notice if they have made a careless error or deliberate inaccuracy regardless of its size or value. The two countries allow for a much higher threshold than is being 89 currently considered in New Zealand. The above examples balance the requirement to maintain integrity with the compliance costs of the amendment process. The balance requires that the higher turnover thresholds are matched with more conditions and requirements. Such requirements create boundaries and compliance costs for taxpayers in determining which process they can apply in different situations. It reduces the simplicity of the process. The Government considers that the lower threshold currently being considered avoids the need for more conditions and requirements that would complicate the process further. 90 APPENDIX 2 TAX INTERMEDIARY LINKING PROCESS & TAXPAYER CONTROL OF INTERMEDIARIES’ ACCESS It is proposed that (for the majority of cases) the process of linking a registered tax intermediary to a taxpayer will work as follows. • The taxpayer provides their IRD number to their tax intermediary. • The tax intermediary submits a request through their myIR portal to link to the taxpayer. • The taxpayer accepts the linking request under their secure log-in in myIR. • The taxpayer is automatically directed to a self-service menu in their secure online portal in myIR, where they must select what information the intermediary can view (such as the tax types), and whether or not the intermediary can edit the taxpayer’s contact details or bank account details, or file tax returns on the taxpayer’s behalf. • The tax intermediary can view the taxpayer’s authorised information in their secure online portal in myIR. If they have permission, they can also file tax returns for the client or edit the client’s details. For those who do not have internet access, or who do not want to use online self-service, the following alternative process is proposed. • The tax intermediary submits the linking request in myIR or through the intermediary self- service phone line and indicates the taxpayer’s preferred method of confirming the request and setting up the intermediary’s access rights. • The taxpayer accepts the linking request using their preferred channel and authorises the intermediary’s access to their information and any ability to edit details or file returns. The tax intermediary can only access a taxpayer’s information or file tax returns when the taxpayer accepts the linking request, regardless of the way the linking request was made or accepted. The online process offers a considerable time advantage over the more manual alternatives of phone calls and submitting forms. The process could also work in reverse, so the taxpayer could make the linking request and choose the access for 91 their intermediary. The intermediary accepts the linking request and is then given the access authorised by the taxpayer. The process around linking to a tax intermediary and deciding the level of access will need to be clear to taxpayers so that they understand what they need to do. Tax intermediaries will have a part in explaining the process to their clients. However, there is a risk that some taxpayers may perceive the process as too complicated, or may not realise that they should choose their intermediary’s level of access. They may give their intermediary their personal log-in details so that the intermediary will do it for them. This would defeat the policy objective of requiring the taxpayer to make an active decision about their intermediary’s access and inform Inland Revenue of their choice. In this situation, the intermediary could set a level of access which is greater than necessary for them to perform the tasks that they have been engaged to do. A more serious concern is that if the intermediary has the taxpayer’s log-in details, possible fraud or dishonesty may result if there is no oversight by the taxpayer. Taxpayers will need to understand that they must be careful to keep their log-in details secret, and that sharing their log-in details breaches the terms and conditions of myIR. Most tax intermediaries, as well as the majority of taxpayers that they represent, will likely want to use the online self-service option. As long as the taxpayer promptly accepts the request, the intermediary will have near-instantaneous access. This will save time and effort for taxpayers and their intermediaries, allow taxpayers more control over their information, and make the process more administratively efficient. 92
The Tax Administration Act needs to continue to ensure the right rules and incentives are in place to assist taxpayers and maximise compliance. The Government would like to get your views on changes it is proposing to the Tax Administration Act. In November 2015 the Government released the discussion document Making Tax Simpler: Towards a new Tax Administration Act which emphasised the importance of the tax system in supporting the Government’s Better Public Services objectives. It focused on the five core dimensions of the Act – the roles of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (the Commissioner), taxpayers and tax intermediaries, information collection, and confidentiality. Two common themes emerged from the submissions: • The need for the Commissioner to have greater flexibility in applying the law, but not at the expense of transparency in her decision-making. • The need for greater information sharing within government was recognised, but this should not be detrimental to taxpayer confidentiality. The Government has considered the submissions received and developed further detailed proposals. These proposals will affect a wide range of taxpayers and intermediaries. In addition, the changes proposed are designed to give the Government flexibility in areas that will be consulted on in future, such as improving the administration of individuals’ obligations and social policy (including Working for Families Tax Credits and Child Support). This discussion document is your opportunity to have your say on the future of tax administration. Please consider the proposals and take some time to tell us what you think. By helping the Government to shape the future of the tax system you can make a difference. THE PROPOSALS Information collection, confidentiality and disclosure • narrowing the confidentiality rule to cover information that would identify a taxpayer (currently it extends to all information relating to the Inland Revenue Acts); • retaining an ability for the Commissioner to withhold certain non-taxpayer specific information in order to protect revenue collection; • clearly setting out the broad categories of exceptions to the new taxpayer confidentiality rule; • introducing a more flexible, cohesive and transparent regulatory framework governing the sharing of Inland Revenue information; makingtaxsimpler.ird.govt.nz PROPOSALS FOR MODERNISING THE TAX ADMINISTRATION ACT MAKING TAX SIMPLER • allowing information to be shared for the delivery of public services where a taxpayer has consented without need for regulations; • retaining the obligation on Inland Revenue officers to keep information confidential; • clarifying how the confidentiality rule applies to people receiving Inland Revenue information; • including a new provision for regulations to be made governing the regular collection of external data; • clarifying that information collected for one particular function can be used for any other function of Inland Revenue. Getting it right from the start • focusing more of Inland Revenue’s resources to help taxpayers get it right from the start including the way that Inland Revenue provides advice. The aim is to provide the right level of certainty to a taxpayer at the right time subject to Inland Revenue’s resource constraints.

Although the design and the accounting treatment of these plans have evolved considerably over recent decades, the tax rules applying to them in New Zealand have not been comprehensively reviewed during that period and are now out of date. 1.2 Employee share schemes can have beneficial economic effects and it is important that the tax rules do not raise unintended barriers to their use. In some circumstances, the current rules can result in over-taxation; in others they result in under-taxation. Current impediments and potential over-taxation 1.3 The current system impedes the use of employee share schemes in a number of ways. These problems can be particularly relevant for start-up companies. • There is considerable uncertainty about how the current rules apply to taxation of employees and employers, which may deter firms fro m offering these schemes. • The costs to employers of providing shares to employees are not explicitly deductible. Non-deductibility creates overtaxation, which is a disincentive to using employee share schemes. • Start-up companies may have difficulties valuing employee share scheme benefits. • Start-up companies may not have sufficient cashflow at the employee and employer level to fund upfront tax payments. Potential under-taxation 1.4 The current treatment of some sophisticated employee share schemes can result in taxable employment income being treated as tax-free capital gains and so escaping taxation. This undermines the fairness of the tax system. These sophisticated employee share schemes can provide a significant amount of untaxed employment income for some high income earners. 1 For the purposes of the employee share scheme rules, the term “employee” also includes directors. 1 A framework for taxing employee share schemes 1.5 The paper sets out a number of proposals to address these problems in a manner consistent with New Zealand’s broad-base, low-rate (BBLR) taxation principles. The goal of the proposals is to ensure that the taxation o f employee share schemes is simple, efficient and fair. 1.6 The framework adopted in this document for taxing employee share schemes may be simply expressed. The tax treatment of employment income paid in shares should be consistent with the taxation of employment income paid in cash. Deductibility of employee share scheme benefits 1.7 The paper notes that, under current law, the cost to employers of providing shares to employees is not explicitly deductible. On the other hand, emplo yment remuneration paid in cash would give rise to deductions. To achieve consistent treatment, the paper proposes giving the employer a deduction equal to the amount of income taxable to the employee. Types of employee share schemes 1.8 For purposes of exposit ion, it is useful to distinguish three types o f emplo yee share scheme. Unconditional employee share schemes 1.9 Unconditional employee share schemes are shares and options that are provided to emplo yees free from further conditions. As such, they ma y be considered to be remuneration for past work. Conditional employee share schemes 1.10 Conditional employee share schemes invo lve acquisit io n o f shares by the emplo yee where the retention of the shares is subject to future conditions based on continuing employment. 1.11 Conditional employee share schemes are economically similar to emplo yment-conditional bonuses (i.e. payments in cash). As they have a requirement of continuing employment they can be considered, at least in part, to be a reward for future work. Currently some such schemes are taxed prior to the fulfilment of the employment conditions, which is inconsistent with the taxation of conditional bonuses. Conditional bonuses that depend on future employment services are appropriately taxed when the conditions are fulfilled and the employee receives the bonus. Conditional employee share schemes should be taxed in the same manner. 2 Option-like arrangements 1.12 Option-like arrangements have terms and conditions based on the future price of the shares or similar criteria and other more sophisticated features. In practice, price conditions are often combined with employment conditions. Under current rules, they are taxed when the shares are first acquired, rather than when the conditions are satisfied and the employee is entitled to keep the shares. The arrangement allows employment income to be converted into tax-free capital gains, so that less tax is paid than for comparable bonuses or unconditional employee share schemes (in particular, employee share options). Those receiving benefits under these schemes in effect pay lower rates of tax on their income than salary and wage earners with similar amounts of inco me. Proposed taxation of income of employee share schemes 1.13 No changes are proposed for taxing employment income arising from uncondit io nal employee share schemes. They give rise to employment income when shares are acquired and are appropriately taxed in the hands of the employee under current law. In the case of emplo yee share purchases, this is at the time that shares are provided. In the case of employee share options, this is when the options are exercised. This results in the same after- tax outcomes for the employee as levying tax when options are issued, but avoids many of the valuation and cashflow concerns of tax at issue. 1.14 The paper proposes that income arising from the receipt of shares fro m an employee share scheme should be calculated and subject to tax only once the employee holds the shares free from substantive conditions. In other words, when the shares are held on the same basis as any other shareholder. This timing would be consistent with the taxation of condit io nal bonuses and ensures that employment income is appropriately taxed. 1.15 The proposed new rules are intended to resolve current uncertainty in the taxation of share schemes by giving clearer guidance to taxpayers and administrators. They do this by more clearly delineating the timing and amount of employment income to be taxed, and giving an explicit deduction for employer costs related to employee share schemes Start-up companies 1.16 The paper recognises that some start-up companies may have particular difficulty valuing shares provided under employee shares schemes and paying tax at the time they are taxed currently. These problems could be avoided by delaying the taxing point until the shares are sold or listed. In some cases, deferred taxation would leave employees in the same after-tax position as if the shares had been taxed when they were provided. However in other circumstances, delay could result in some increase or decrease in taxation. The paper outlines some technical and administrative options for reducing barriers to the use of employee share schemes by start-up companies, and invites comments and suggestions. 3 Specific concessionary regime for widely offered share schemes 1.17 The paper discusses the existing specific concessionary regime for widely offered schemes. The regime was introduced in the mid-70s and has numerous technical deficiencies. The current proposals, especially the deductibility of issuance costs to the employer, and the proposed amendments to allow employers to pay PAYE on employee share scheme benefits, should facilitate broad-based employee share schemes. 2 In these circumstances, the paper invites comments on whether the concessionary regime should be retained. Transition 1.18 A transit ional period is proposed to allow firms time to adjust to the new rules.

Income can result when the price charged to employees for the shares or options is less than their market price. Emplo yee share schemes can align the incentives of employees with those of the firm and its non-emplo yee shareho lders and can engender greater work effort and employee engagement. 2.2 It is important that, as far as possible, tax rules are not an obstacle to firms using employee share schemes where they are a sensible and economically efficient form of remuneration. BBLR and tax neutrality 2.3 The framework adopted to achieve this result is one of tax neutrality. This means that the imposition of tax should not affect the form in which employees are paid. Tax neutrality is a core part of New Zealand’s general BBLR approach to taxation. 2.4 Tax-neutral treatment of the emplo yment inco me in employee share schemes means, as much as possible, we should tax all types of employee remuneration, whether paid in cash or shares, consistently. It also means we should ensure that taxation does not act as an impediment to otherwise sensible remuneration decisions. 2.5 Under the BBLR framework, tax bases are defined as broadly as possible, so no activity or form of payment (such as remuneration in shares) is either advantaged or disadvantaged through the operation of the tax system. This helps reduce economic distortions. It also helps keep tax rates low as a broader base means the Government’s revenue needs can be met with lower tax rates. This, in turn, also helps reduce the distortions generated by the tax system. 2.6 A BBLR tax system also ensures that taxes are fair because, as much as possible, all forms of income are subject to tax. New Zealand’s personal income tax rates are relatively low by OECD standards. This is only possible because the tax base is broad. 2.7 An alternative approach would be to provide tax incentives for employee share schemes. 6 Should tax incentives be offered for employee share schemes? 2.8 As noted above, employee share schemes are offered to help align incentives of employees with those of the firm and to improve general employee engagement. Given these positive effects, it is sometimes suggested that these schemes should benefit from tax incentives. 2.9 A prima facie case for the Government to provide some form of subsidy, possibly tax incentives, arises if an activity produces positive externalities – that is, benefits arising from an activity (or a transaction) that are not enjoyed by the parties involved, but by a third party. Without some sort of Government incentive, less of the activity/transaction would occur than is ideal from society’s perspective, as the wider benefits are typically ignored by those undertaking the activity/transaction. 2.10 An example of a positive externality is a beautiful home garden. A beautiful garden improves the home of the homeowner but also improves the character of a street for all who live on it. However, this wider benefit typically is not taken into account by homeowners; many homeowners do not create a garden even if society would be better off if they did. 2.11 Externalities can also be negative, in which case a special tax would be applied to the offending activity under the same logic justifying incentives. 2.12 The 2001 Tax Review 3 noted that, as a practical matter, it is difficult for the tax system to identify positive externalities. Moreover, because positive externalities are common, subsidising an activity on externality grounds would invite lobbying to support other activities on the same grounds. The Tax Review noted: A practical difficulty with the externality theory, however, is that such effects are pervasive, and it is generally impossible to measure either the relevant external effects or the effects of the intervening government measure. Many economists argue that government intervention typically worsens rather than improves national welfare because of infirmities of the political market. These concerns about externality-based interventions are compounded by the fact that the widespread existence of externalities provides a platform for practically any lobbyist’s reform agenda. 4 2.13 For this reason the 2001 Tax Review suggested a high burden of proof is required before providing tax incentives on externality grounds. 3 Tax Review 2001, The Treasury (2001), http://www.treasury.govt.nz/publications/reviews- consultation/taxreview2001/taxreview2001-report.pdf 4 Ibid at pp 22. 7 2.14 This high burden of proof is not met for employee share schemes. It is unlikely that employee share schemes generate significant positive externalities. While these schemes can provide benefits (higher productivity, better engagement), these benefits are likely to be fully captured by the parties to the transaction (the employer and the employee). Higher productivity will increase profits for the employer, and likely increase remuneration for employees. An employee share scheme is unlikely to generate a greater positive externality than a simple cash bonus dependent on share price performance. 5 2.15 If employee share schemes do not generate significant positive externalities compared wit h cash remuneration, then providing tax incentives for them would reduce New Zealand’s welfare. Incentives would lead to emplo yee share schemes being excessively used when this would not be attractive under a more neutral tax regime. They would reward firms that are able to provide remuneration by means of employee share schemes ahead of other firms. They would also be unfair, as employees of such firms would more easily be able to earn income by way of employee share scheme benefits and therefore bear a lower tax burden than employees of other firms earning equivalent cash remuneration. Moreover, it is difficult to target tax incentives, so that the benefits would likely spill over to arrangements that do not satisfy the intent underlying the granting of the incentives. 2.16 For these reasons we consider that tax neutrality is the best framework for deciding how to tax employee share schemes, as providing tax incentives for these schemes would be detrimental to New Zealand’s national welfare. Taxing employment income consistently 2.17 Salary and wages are taxed on a cash basis – that is, an employee derives the income, and is therefore liable for tax, when it is paid to them. 6 This is also true of other forms of employee remuneration paid in money, such as cash bonuses. If an employee is promised a $10,000 bonus if they remain emplo yed for three years, no tax is payable until they receive the bonus. If they fulfil the condition and are paid the bonus, the full $10,000 will be taxable in the year it is paid. No tax is payable before the condition is fulfilled and bonus paid. 2.18 There are other ways of rewarding employees, for example through employee share schemes. Tax neutrality requires income arising from share schemes to be taxed similarly to income arising from payments of cash. This ensures that tax does not affect how employees are best rewarded – they will be rewarded in the way that makes the most commercial and economic sense. 5 In support of this conclusion, see The Taxation of Employee Stock Options (OECD) 2005 at p11. 6 Though in the unusual case where cash remuneration is paid in advance of the provision of employment services, it is likely that the income is derived only once those services are provided. 8 Example 1 Jim has a tax rate of 33%. If his employer offers him a $1,000 bonus if he is still working for the employer in a year’s time, he will receive a net $670 in one year and $330 tax will be withheld. If instead his employer decides to pay Jim the same bonus in shares, the tax-neutral outcome 7 (assuming the shares are not subject to PAYE) would be for the employer to provide $1,000 of shares, and for Jim to pay $330 tax (this assumes there is no cash gross-up provided by the employer with the shares). In both cases Jim receives $1,000 of before-tax income and has paid $330 of tax. Tax will not be a factor in how Jim wants to be paid. 2.19 Consistent treatment of employment income is not simply a matter of ensuring that employee share scheme benefits are treated as taxable income. It is also important that the timing and amount of the income is determined consistently with the timing and amount of other forms of remuneration, most obviously cash. Example 2 Suppose that in the previous example, instead of offering Jim a $1,000 bonus in one year, Jim’s employer promises him 1,000 shares if he is still with the company in one year. At the start of the year, when the offer is made, the value of the shares is $1 per share. Suppose when the bonus is paid, the shares are worth $1,500 in total or $1.50 per share. It clearly would not be appropriate for Jim to pay tax on only $1,000 of income in that case. $1,000 is the value of the shares when the offer was made, not when they are received. Jim should be taxed on $1,500, that is, the value of the shares when they are received and taxed. This is the same amount of income as Jim would have if his employer offered him a cash bonus equal to the value of 1,000 shares in a year. The principle is the same if the shares are worth only $0.80 when they are provided to Jim. In that case he should be taxed on only $800. 2.20 Taxing employee share scheme benefits using the share value at a time different from the time when the benefit is received is particularly undesirable from a neutrality perspective if it leads to an expected under- taxation or over-taxation of the benefit. As will be explored in more detail in Chapter 5, systematic under-taxation of the income can arise in circumstances where there is some contingency in the receipt of the benefit. 7 Under current law, this transaction is not tax-neutral because there is no deduction for the employer. However, as discussed below we propose that the law should be changed so a deduction is allowed. 9 Establishing the border between income and capital gains 2.21 A fundamental issue in the taxation of certain sophisticated arrangements with option-like effects is establishing the appropriate border between income and capital gains treatment for the income earned under the scheme. 2.22 While New Zealand has a broad-based tax system, it does not have a general tax on capital gains. Accordingly, there is a benefit to be gained if taxable emplo yment income can be recharacterised as a tax-free capital gain. 2.23 In ensuring neutral treatment between different ways of earning employment income, it is important to correctly determine the nature of that income, as capital gains or emplo yment inco me. This is the central point at issue in the discussion of the taxation of option-like arrangements in Chapter 5. 2.24 The proposals in the following chapters seek to make this borderline clearer in concept and application. Treatment of employer costs 2.25 In order to provide neutral taxation, employer costs of issuing employee shares schemes should be deductible to the employer to the extent they are taxable to employees. This would parallel the treatment of emplo yment income paid in cash. Otherwise there is a bias against using employee share schemes, which would be inconsistent with the neutrality framework. Submission points We are interested to hear from readers whether they agree that a neutral framework is the best framework for assessing the tax treatment of employee share schemes. If not, why not, and what would be a preferable framework? 10 CHAPTER 3 Employer deductions for shares provided under employee share schemes 3.1 Under current law there is no explicit deduction for a company that issues shares to an employee at a discount. This is not appropriate. In principle, employers should be able to claim a deduction for providing employee compensation in the form of shares, just as they can claim a deduction for other types of remuneration. Providing a deduction would ensure that the tax system does not act as an impediment to paying staff in the most sensible manner. Neutral treatment 3.2 In the absence of inco me taxes, it is worthwhile paying an employee $1,000 if that employee will increase company revenue by $1,001. In the presence of taxes, it remains sensible to hire the employee only if the salary is deductible. If it is deductible, the company will be taxed only on its $1 profit – it will be profitable to hire the employee in the same circumstances after tax is imposed as before tax is imposed. If the salary is not deductible, the company will face tax on income of $1,001, despite making only $1 of profit. It would not be profitable to hire the employee. 3.3 Similarly, in the absence of tax it is worthwhile providing an employee wit h $1,000 of shares if this would incentivise the employee to increase revenue by $1,001. In the presence of tax, it is necessary to allow an employer a deduction for the provision of shares in order to maintain tax neutrality. Without a deduction, the employee would have to increase revenue by at least $1,390 in order for it to be worthwhile (for the company) to provide $1,000 worth of shares. 8 3.4 Allowing employers a deduction for remuneration in shares is important to ensure tax neutrality. It equalises the tax treatment of employee share scheme benefits with cash remuneration, which is deductible to the emplo yer. If a deduction is available for cash remuneration but not remuneration in shares, the tax system will discourage the use of employee share schemes. Costs when shares provided 3.5 In general, the costs of issuing a share are not deductible as they do not represent a cost to the company. The value of the shares is supported by the extra cash the company receives as a consequence of selling the shares. However an employee share scheme is a different transaction. The transaction could be viewed as payment of a cash wage to the employee, 8 If the company earns $1,390 and pays tax at 28%, it will clear $1,001. This will yield a $1 profit after providing th e employee with the shares. 11 followed by the purchase of shares of the company. The cost being deducted is not for the issuance of the share, per se, but the implicit cash wage that the share represents. 3.6 In some circumstances, it is possible under current law for an employer to structure employee share schemes so deductions are available. However, this is an unsatisfactory solution. Such employee share scheme structures may be costly and complex and could also be seen as tax avoidance. The amount and timing of the deduction may be different from the amount of income to the employee. For these reasons, not all employers offering employee share schemes may be able to or want to structure them so that the amount treated as income to the employee is also deductible to the employer. This creates a barrier to otherwise beneficial employee share schemes. 3.7 The fact that the issue of shares by a company does not involve an explicit cash cost to the company itself does not affect the above analysis. The deduction reflects the transfer of value to the employee, which arises whether that value is transferred as cash or as shares in the company. In contrast, in the case of shares issued for consideration, there is a dilution cost to the existing shareholders in the company when shares are issued as part of an employee share scheme. Under the corporate tax system, where company expenses are deducted by the company as a separate taxpayer from its owners, this cost must be recognised in the calculation of income by the company rather than the shareholders on whose behalf it is earned. 3.8 Recognition of expenditure arising from the issue of shares and options to employees is now required under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), though on a different basis to that proposed here. 9 Proposed deduction 3.9 It is proposed that employers be allowed a cost for the provision of shares under employee share schemes to the extent that they give rise to emplo yment income taxed in the hands of employees in the year. 3.10 Clear availability of this deduction, and its linkage to taxation of the employee, may well assist in reducing concerns about the amount and timing of employee share scheme income to employees, and also in reducing the incentive to find ways to artificially reduce or defer emplo yee share scheme income. It also ensures the deduction is available to the employer without having to structure the emplo yee share scheme to achieve deductibility. 3.11 Consequential amendments would be required to ensure that no other costs with respect to the provision of the shares are deducted by the employer. Other consequential issues would also need to be considered – for example, the effect of employee share schemes on the employer’s available subscribed capital. 9 IFRS are the international accounting standards that specify the basis on which certain types of businesses are to prepare their financial accounts. 12 Submission points We are interested to hear from readers: - whether the current non-deductibility of employee share scheme benefits is a barrier to offering employee share schemes in practice; - whether clarifying the basis for a deduction is desirable; - whether readers agree that the appropriate approach to quantifying and timing the deduction is to match it to the employment income recognised by the employee. If not, why not, and what would be preferable approach? - whether the approach should be modified where the employer is not the direct provider of the shares, for example, where there is a trust involved, or where the shares are issued by the ultimate parent company of the employer. 13 CHAPTER 4 Taxing employment income from unconditional employee share schemes 4.1 As described in Chapter 2, tax neutrality requires that the benefits provided to employees under employee share schemes are taxed consistently wit h other forms of remuneration. 4.2 As previously noted, emplo yee share schemes may be divided into three general categories: • Unconditional employee share schemes – which provide shares or options free from further conditions. • Conditional employee share schemes – where the shares or options received are subject to future emplo yment condit ions. • Option-like arrangements – which are in the form of a share purchase, but have terms and condit ions (often based on the price of the shares) and other features that make the arrangement similar in economic effect to an option. Option-like arrangements often have employment conditions in addit io n to the price condit io ns. 4.3 This chapter discusses the current taxation of unconditional employee share schemes. In general, under current rules, unconditional employee share schemes are taxed in a manner which is consistent with the policy framework in Chapter 2. It provides context for the discussion in Chapter 5 of conditional employee share schemes and option-like arrangements. 4.4 Broadly, unconditional employee share schemes fall into two categories: • share purchase plans, where an employee purchases (or is given) shares; and • share option plans, which are in effect deferred share purchase plans. Share purchase plans 4.5 Employees participating in a share purchase plan are taxed when they acquire the shares. The taxable income is the difference between the value of the shares at that time and the price they pay for them. If employees pay full market value for the shares, then no taxable income arises. At the other extreme, if employees are given shares for no consideration, then the full market value of the shares is taxable income. 4.6 We consider that this treatment is appropriate when shares are received without further conditions. Income is earned at the time the shares are acquired in much the same way as income would have been earned if paid as salary and wages and the proceeds used to acquire shares of the company. 14 4.7 The concerns of start-up companies with the taxation of share purchase plans are discussed in Chapter 6. Share option plans 4.8 With a share option plan, employees are given a right to purchase shares at some future date for a set price (the strike price). An employee will exercise the option if the shares’ price at the future date exceeds the strike price – the option effectively allows them to acquire the shares at a discount. If the strike price exceeds the shares’ price the employee will not exercise their option. 4.9 When an employee receives an option, emplo yment income equal to the value of the option is received and that income should be subject to tax. 4.10 Under current rules, no tax is paid when the option is issued. An employee participating in a share option plan is taxed only if and when the option is exercised. The difference between the market value of the shares at exercise and the value at the strike price is taxable income. This approach is tax at exercise. 4.11 In principle, an employee participating in a share option plan could be taxed when the options are provided to them. No further tax would be paid when the option is exercised. This approach is tax at issue. 4.12 Concerns have been expressed that tax at exercise taxes the potential share price increase when compared wit h tax at issue; that is, tax at exercise taxes capital gains. These concerns are misplaced. The two tax treatments are equivalent. They lead to the same distribution of after-tax outcomes for the emplo yee for all share price outcomes. Accordingly, the current tax treatment of employee share options is consistent with New Zealand’s general capital gains tax policy. 4.13 This result is counter-intuitive. Certainly more tax is paid when prices increase. But the bottom line is that the after-tax outcomes of the employee are the same under the two approaches. 4.14 This result is illustrated with Example 3, 10 with shares that can increase or decrease in value by 50 percent in a year’s time with equal probability. 4.15 The essential difference between the two approaches is the after-tax amount available to be held as options by the employee, when equivalent compensation packages are compared. With tax at issue, tax must be paid on the employment income. Only the after-tax amount of income is available to be held in options. Under tax at exercise, no tax is paid when the option is provided, so the entire before-tax amount of income can be held in options. 10 The example assumes an interest rate of zero for simplicity, but the results are not affected by this assumption. 15 4.16 Under the assumptions, shares worth $100 currently would be worth either $150 or $50 in a year’s time. An option on the shares with a strike price equal to the current price is worth $25; that is, the 50 percent probability o f receiving $50 = $150 - $100. Thus when the share price increases by 50 percent, the option doubles in value from $25 to $50. If the share price falls, the option is worth nothing. 4.17 Assume that the company wishes to provide compensation in the form of options that would be equivalent to pre-tax cash wages of $25. With cash wages, the employee would pay $8.25 in tax, 11 and receive an after-tax benefit of $16.75. 4.18 Under tax at issue, an equivalent option scheme would result in tax being paid of $8.25 and an after-tax amount of $16.75 held as an option on the shares of the company. Under the price assumptions, the option yields a benefit of $33.50 (twice $16.75) when the share price increases. No further tax is paid when the option is exercised. If share prices fall, the option is not exercised. 4.19 Wit h tax at exercise, no tax is paid when the option is provided, so the entire $25 can be held as an option. The option yields a before-tax profit at exercise of $50 (twice $25) when share prices increase, with tax payable of $16.50 (= .33 x $50). The net after-tax benefit is $33.50 (= $50 - $16.50). If share prices fall, the option is not exercised. Example 3: Taxation of unconditional options Period 1 Period 2 Price outcome Price of shares $100 $150 High price $50 Low price Tax at issue Pre-tax benefit $25 $33.50 High price $0 Low price Tax paid $8.25 $0 High price $0 Low price After-tax value of benefit / Option held $16.75 $33.50 High price $0 Low price Tax at exercise Pre-tax benefit $25 $50 High price $0 Low price Tax paid 0 $16.50 High price $0 Low price After-tax value of benefit / Option held $25 $33.50 High price $0 Low price 4.20 The example demonstrates that tax at issue and tax at exercise result in the same pattern of after-tax cashflows. The basic point is that it makes no difference if a tax rate of 33% is applied when the option is provided or if the 33% rate is applied when the proceeds are received. Either way tax reduces the emplo yee’s final holdings of shares by 33%. 11 A tax rate of 33% is assumed in all examples. 16 4.21 Because the employee’s after-tax benefit from the arrangement is the same regardless of whether tax is imposed at issue or at exercise, they should be indifferent between the two taxing points. 4.22 This is notwithstanding that more tax, $16.50, is paid in high price situations under tax at exercise than under tax at issue (tax of $8.25). Reducing the shares held by $8.25 in the first period with tax at issue has the same effect on the employee’s final holdings as taxing the full amount of the proceeds under tax at exercise. 12 4.23 The equivalence of tax at issue and tax at exercise reflects the standard public finance result that taxing income as it is earned and investing the after-tax amount free from further tax is equivalent to investing the before-tax income and taxing the entire proceeds when they are realised in the future. 13 Maintaining the current approach 4.24 The current taxation of employment income from unconditional employment share schemes is consistent with the framework and no changes are proposed. Submission points We are interested to hear from readers: - whether they agree that the current tax treatment of unconditional employee share schemes (including employee share options) is appropriate and does not require reform; - if you disagree with any of the above, why and what your preferred approach would be; - whether there are any technical or remedial issues with respect to the employee share scheme rules that could be addressed as part of any legislative reform. 12 On average, over high and low price outcomes, the government collects the same amount of tax whether tax is imposed at issue or on exercise. However, the government accepts a more risky revenue stream if it taxes on exercise since it only receives tax in high price worlds. 13 Essentially this is the standard TEE equals EET result for deferred tax schemes. 17 CHAPTER 5 Proposed taxation of conditional employee share schemes and option- like arrangements 5.1 This chapter discusses the problems associated with conditional employee share schemes before addressing option-like arrangements. For conditional employee share schemes, the timing of taxation may differ from other forms of employment income. In some cases, the expected level of taxation may also be different. For option-like arrangements, employment income may be derived that would be taxable if it were in the form of an equivalent option or a conditional bonus. However under the current treatment of the arrangement, this employment income may escape taxation altogether. Further examples of conditional employee share schemes and option-like arrangements are contained in Appendix 1. 5.2 The chapter puts forward a proposal to address the timing and under-taxation problems. The proposal does not affect the taxation of the income of emplo yees arising fro m unconditional employee share schemes. Taxing conditional employee share schemes 5.3 Unconditional employee share schemes are granted without a stipulation that the employee continues in employment with the company. As the receipt of the shares does not depend upon performing any services in the future, they can be seen as a reward for past emplo yment services, and their tax treatment reflects this. 5.4 However, a condit io nal employee share scheme shares many characteristics with condit io nal cash bonuses or other forms of remuneration. In particular, the services that the contract rewards have not yet been performed and the associated employment income not yet earned. It effectively provides a reward for future work. 5.5 Under current law, a condit ional employee share scheme may, at times, be disadvantaged compared wit h a condit io nal cash bonus. Currently, a conditional employee share scheme has a different taxing point to a conditional bonus providing an equivalent employment benefit. Consider a share, worth $100, acquired in Period 1 for no consideration, subject to forfeiture if the employee is not employed at the end of Period 2. Currently, $100 would be taxed in Period 1. If the employee leaves before the end of Period 2 (thus forfeiting the share), this income would be reversed for tax purposes, but the employee would have been out of pocket for the tax over the period. 5.6 In effect the tax would be payable before the services were rendered and before any remuneration was earned. An equivalent cash bonus and its tax would only be payable in Period 2. 18 5.7 On the other hand, Example 1 in Appendix 1 outlines situations where the expected value of tax could be reduced by using a conditional employee share scheme in combination with an interest-free loan and a bonus. 5.8 Current law already deals satisfactorily with share options where the right to exercise is conditional on remaining in employment (the employee share scheme benefit is taxed on exercise). Taxing income from option-like arrangements 5.9 Option-like arrangements have more complicated features than other conditional employee share schemes. Features can include interest-free non- recourse loans and various mechanisms to return the shares if conditions are not met. More examples of option-like arrangements are contained in Appendix 1. 5.10 Under an option-like arrangement: • an employee purchases shares in the company, but retains the shares only if certain share price-related conditions are met; 14 • because of the price conditions, the arrangement has a positive expected value at the time of issue; • if the conditions are not met, the shares are forfeited, but there is no loss to the emplo yee; • as the arrangement is remuneration for employment services, the value is employment income and should be taxed; • however, the effect of the arrangement is to bring forward the taxing point to a time prior to the satisfaction of the conditions; • under current law, the arrangement is viewed as a purchase of shares for full consideration; • accordingly, no income is subject to tax at issue; • any income arising from price movements of the shares between the time that they are purchased and the satisfaction of the condition is tax- free; and, • as a consequence, taxable employment income is converted into tax- free capital gains. 5.11 The cashflows of this t ype o f arrangement can be equivalent to the cashflows of an option that would give rise to tax. Or, they can be the same as a conditional cash bonus where the amount of the bonus depends on the price of the shares (sometimes referred to as a phantom share scheme). 14 There are also typically employment conditions. 19 5.12 Given the income arises from a benefit which is conditional on future services, it is appropriate that it be taxed at the same time as other equivalent forms of emplo yment inco me. 5.13 Consider Examples 4 and 5 which compare the taxation results of an option and an option-like arrangement under current law. In the examples, the option-like arrangement results in no tax. This is despite the fact that $25 of income has been provided to the employee by the employee share scheme. By contrast, the equivalent option yields $25 of expected taxable inco me. The examples are based on the price situat ion used in Example 3. Example 4: Taxation of option The share prices movements are the same as in Example 3. In this case, the employee is given a share option that is exercisable with a strike price of $100 if they continue in employment for one year. The expected value of the benefit is $25 (that is, a 50 percent chance of getting $50). 15 Period 1 Period 2 Probability Share price 100 150 50% 50 50% Employee cashflow 0\* 50\*\* 50% 0 50% Taxed income 0 25 \* the employee receives a benefit of an option worth $25, but no cashable benefit \*\* $50 is the difference between the strike price of $100 and the share value of $150 in the high- price state of the world. In the low-price state of the world, the share value of $50 is less than the strike price and the option is not exercised by the employee. Example 5: Taxation of option-like arrangement The facts are the same as in Example 4, except that, instead of issuing an option, the employer issues shares to the employee for $100, funded by an interest-free loan. There is zero net cashflow for the employee in period 1, which is the same as the option in Example 4. If the price is $150 in period 2, the employee keeps the shares and repays the loan. Net income and benefit are $50, the same as the option in Example 4. But the benefit in this example is treated as a capital gain and no tax is payable under current rules. If the share price falls to $50, the employee hands back the share in satisfaction of the loan, with no taxable income or loss if the documents are appropriately drafted. Period 1 Period 2 Probability Share price 100 150 50% 50 50% Employee cashflow 0\* 50\*\* 50% 0 50% Taxed income 0 0 \* $100 loan advanced minus $100 purchase price. \*\* $150 share minus $100 loan repayment. 15 If the share pays a dividend during the year after it is given, the employee receiving the employee share scheme benefit will also receive the dividend. However, the employee will in that case be taxed on the dividend, so this difference in outcomes is appropriately taxed. 20 5.14 As noted above, some concerns have been expressed that tax at exercise taxes the potential share price upside more than tax at issue. Under tax at issue, the same $25 of income would be subject to tax, in contrast to the option-like arrangement which results in no tax. As discussed in detail in the chapter on unconditional employee share schemes, tax at issue and exercise are equivalent, and in any event are not relevant to the conclusion that option-like arrangements can lead to under-taxation under current rules. Summary of problems 5.15 The current tax treatment of condit io nal employee share schemes and option- like arrangements is not appropriate when tested against the framework described in Chapter 2. Specifically, inconsistency between the taxation of conditional employee share schemes, option-like arrangements and other forms of employee remuneration can arise if: • shares are subject to forfeiture if the employee does not continue to provide services for a certain time; • there is downside price protection on the shares; or • shares have contingent rights that make them hard to value on issue. 5.16 In all cases, income can be considered to be earned when the conditions are satisfied (or the downside protection ceases) and value is received. However, under current rules, taxation may occur at a prior point. For option-like arrangements and shares with contingent rights, early taxation may result in some employment income not being taxed. 5.17 The current rules are also a source of considerable complexity and uncertainty as economically equivalent transactions can have a significantly different tax treatment depending upon arbitrary and obscure technical differences. The current rules lack clear legislative guidance on which to base consistent determination of treatment. Proposal to clarify taxation of conditional employee share schemes and option- like arrangements 5.18 The objective of the proposal is to clarify the tax rules applying to employee share schemes to: • ensure that the amount of taxable income reflects the emplo yment income arising from the arrangement; • ensure consistency with the taxation of other equivalent forms of employment income; • eliminate uncertainty of application; and • ensure emplo yers can use employee shares schemes where they are economically efficient. 21 5.19 The proposal directly addresses the problem of the taxing point occurring before the income is actually earned. It defers the time of taxation until all o f the substantial conditions have been fulfilled. We refer to the proposal as a “substantial conditions” approach. It would clarify the taxation of complex schemes, and would generally align the taxation of employee share scheme benefits with the taxation of equivalent benefits provided in cash. 5.20 By clarifying the taxation of complex arrangements, it will eliminate uncertainty and simplify compliance and administration. Technical issues 5.21 Deferral of income recognition would apply generally when the employee does not have all the risks and rewards associated with share ownership. 16 For example: • when there is a real risk of forfeiture of the shares; • where the employee has a right to transfer the shares back to the company (often in satisfaction of a loan used to acquire the shares); • where the employee is protected against loss due to a decline in the share price, for example, by way of a non-recourse loan or other payment; • when employment-related conditions have not been satisfied; and • when contingent rights associated with the shares have not been exercised or extinguished. 5.22 Not all conditions would be considered to be substantial. For example, a sale restriction alone should not be considered to be a substantial condition that gives rise to deferral of tax, nor should it be taken into account in valuing employee share scheme benefits. 17 This is because sale restrictions are very difficult to value, and if they were taken into account to reduce the assessable income under an employee share scheme, when the sale restriction was removed, the remaining value of the shares would need to be taxed at that point. This approach seems overly complex and compliance cost-heavy. 5.23 If the substantial condit io ns approach is adopted, a number of technical details would need to be worked through during the legislative process. In particular, deferring the taxing point for shares may also require legislation to deal with other possible events that might occur before a condit io n is fulfilled, but that should nevertheless trigger recognit ion of employment income. Such events include: 16 If an employee simply acquires ordinary shares in their employer using a loan (interest-free or otherwise) from the employer and there are no other arrangements relating to the shares, for example, substantial contingencies attached to the shares, or downside protection, then the shares will be treated as acquired by the employee at the outset of the arrangement. This treatment is consistent with the position of other equity investors in the company who have borrowed (at full recourse) to purchase shares. 17 Contrary to the current rules in section CE 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 22 • termination of employment where shares or options are retained (often they will not be); • migration by the employee; • expiry of a certain number of years; or • the condition becoming insubstantial. 5.24 It is important that the new rules cannot be circumvented, either by avoiding an employment relationship, or having shares or options issued directly to an associated person of an employee, rather than the employee themselves. For example, suppose a person provides personal services to an employer through a personal services company and the company receives shares as part of the remuneration for those services. Prima facie, because the company is not an employee, the taxation of those shares will not be determined by the proposed rules. Some form of anti-avoidance provision would be appropriate to ensure that the new rules do apply in such a situation, perhaps adopting a similar approach to the existing personal services attribution rules. 5.25 There will be other technical or remedial issues that should be dealt with if and when the legislation is amended. These issues could include: • the anomalous treatment of convertible notes under the employee share scheme rules; • clarifying the cost base of the shares for the employee; • any cross-border issues peculiar to employee share schemes; and • any uncertainties that exist in the way employee share scheme trusts are currently taxed. Submission points We are interested to hear from readers: - whether they agree that the current tax treatment of conditional employee share schemes and option-like arrangements is at odds with the neutral framework outlined in Chapter 2; and - whether they agree with the “substantial condit io ns” approach to taxing employee share scheme benefits. If you disagree with any of the above, please outline why and what your preferred approach would be. 23 CHAPTER 6 Start-up companies 6.1 Employee share and option schemes can be an attractive form of remuneration for start-up companies, such as technology companies, as they allow companies to reward employees with the prospect of future share price gains rather than payment of cash wages and salaries. Tax rules are sometimes seen as a barrier to start-up companies using these schemes. 6.2 In particular, concerns have been raised that if the tax impost arises without a sale or an active market for the shares, it is difficult to determine their value so as to work out the tax liability. Even if the shares can be valued, the employees are often unable to sell a portion of their shares to meet the tax liability and therefore have to fund the liability from other income or borrowings – thus making the scheme less attractive. In principle, the employer could provide cash income to pay the tax. But, start-up companies typically experience cashflow problems as well and therefore the problem is simply transferred to the employer. 6.3 The lack of deductibility of costs associated with the issuance of shares may also deter their use as the after-tax cost of providing share-based compensation is higher than alternative cash-based compensation that would give rise to a deduction. 18 The proposal to allow an explicit deduction – discussed in Chapter 3 – would remove this disincentive. 6.4 There may also be other tax issues that hinder the ability of start-up companies to offer employee share schemes. Submission points We are interested to hear from readers: - whether valuation and liquidity issues are barriers to start-up companies offering employee share schemes; and - whether there are other tax obstacles to start-up companies offering employee share schemes. 18 For start-up companies without income, the tax deduction may not be useable until sometime in the future. 24 Timing of taxation 6.5 The fundamental tax issues for start-up companies offering employee share schemes concern the timing of taxation. These issues can be illustrated with a simple example that modifies the examples in the previous chapters to better reflect a start-up company’s situat ion. Assume that shares wit h a current value of $100 will be listed on the stock exchange at a value of $1,000 in period 10, 10 percent of the time. Otherwise the company fails and the shares will be worth nothing. Over the period, the start-up company pays no dividends. Again, assume for simplicity a zero interest rate. This situation is illustrated in Example 6. Example 6: Start-up company share valuation Period 1 Period 10 Probability High value $100 $1,000 10% Low Value $100 $0 90% Average value $100 $100 6.6 Companies have considerable flexibility in determining the timing of taxation of employee share scheme benefits through their choice of scheme. The company can choose between providing discounted shares and paying tax upfront or providing an option that is taxed when it is exercised (at which time valuation and cashflow problems may be resolved). Example 7 demonstrates that the distribution of the net of tax benefits to the employee over different share price outcomes is the same. 6.7 Consider an unconditional employee share purchase scheme offered with a full discount. The $100 benefit would be subject to tax when the share is issued, so that the after-tax amount of shares held would be $67. 6.8 Alternatively, the company could offer an option over the share with a strike price of zero, exercisable if there is a liquidity event (assumed to be in year 10). A liquidity event, such as public listing of the shares or a large trade sale would avoid valuation and liquidity problems. The full $100 of value could be held as an option. 25 Example 7: Deferral of taxation The table compares the net of tax outcomes from receiving a fully discounted share or a fully discounted option. On one hand, the employee receives $67 of shares at a full discount on which tax of $33 has been paid upfront; equivalent to $100 of income. In period 10, either: (a) the underlying shares increase in value to $670; or, (b) the shares drop in value to zero. On the other hand, if the employee receives $100 of options in Period 1, but does not pay tax until Period 10, then either: (a) the shares go up in value, the employee buys $1,000 worth of shares for $0, makes a pre-tax gain of $1000 and, after paying tax of $330, ends up with $670 of shares; or (b) the shares go down in value to zero. The employee’s after-tax benefit in both the high price and low price states of the world is the same regardless of whether they pay tax upfront on a fully discounted share purchase or pay tax at exercise on a fully discounted option. Period 1 Period 2 High price (shares worth $1000) or low price (shares worth $0) Tax on share purchase Before tax benefit $100 $670 High price 0 Low price Tax paid $33 $0 High price $0 Low price After-tax value of benefit $67 $670 High price $0 Low price Tax on share option Before tax benefit $100 $1000 High price $0 Low price Tax paid 0 $330 High price $0 Low price After-tax value of benefit $100 $670 High price $0 Low price 6.9 The example demonstrates that for start-up companies that do not pay dividends, where the employee receives the shares at a full discount, there is a simple way under current rules to avoid valuation and cashflow problems, while yielding equivalent after-tax benefits to the employee. 26 Submission point We are interested to hear from readers whether this flexibility in the choice of scheme structure is likely to be sufficient to resolve the liquidity and valuation issues for start- up companies, or whether there is a need for legislative solutions to be explored. Possible statutory deferral for start-ups 6.10 If valuation, liquidity and possibly other issues are likely to continue to present a significant barrier to start-up companies offering employee share schemes, we would like to explore ways to ameliorate these tax issues within the proposed framework (discussed in Chapter 2). To be consistent with the policy framework, any proposals should not result in material under-taxation of emplo yment inco me nor increase the risk of non-compliance. 6.11 For example, a possible way to address the valuation and liquidity problems would be to allow emplo yees o f start-up companies who receive shares under an employee share scheme to defer the taxing point until the shares are sold or listed. This would address both the valuation and liquidity issues – at the time the shares are sold, there is an established market value and the employee has cash with which to satisfy the tax liability. Ordinarily income received in-kind is recognised when received rather than being deferred until the asset is sold. 6.12 This potential deferral differs from the self-help deferral discussed above (that is through using an option scheme), since, in this case, the employee actually receives the shares. With an option, the receipt of the shares is delayed. 6.13 Under a statutory deferral approach, income tax would be imposed at the time the shares are sold on the sale price of the shares less any amount the emplo yee paid to acquire the shares. 6.14 Deferral might seem unattractive to taxpayers. Employees entering into employee share schemes will often do so on the basis that they believe the shares might increase significantly in value. If the corollary of deferring the recognit ion o f inco me fro m the receipt of shares in an employee share scheme is that the taxed income is equal to the value of the shares at the time of the deferred recognition, employees may prefer not to defer. 6.15 Perhaps counter-intuitively, Example 8 demonstrates that, if shares are offered at a full discount, deferral of taxation yields equivalent after-tax outcomes for the employee. As with the discussion on tax at issue versus tax at exercise for options in Chapter 4, the apparent taxation of the capital gains is in fact equivalent to upfront taxation, without the attendant problems of valuation and cashflow. The intuition is that scaling down the amount invested at the beginning through taxation is equivalent to scaling down the benefits by the same percentage through taxation at a later time, such as a sale or listing of the shares. 27 Example 8: Simple comparison of tax at issue and deferred tax The employee receives $100 of wages, pays tax (or not if tax is deferred), and invests the after-tax proceeds in shares of the company. Tax at issue Tax of $33 is paid upfront, leaving an after-tax amount of $67 to be invested in shares of the company. The shares go up 10 times to $670. Deferred tax No tax is paid upfront and $100 is invested in the shares of the company. The shares go up 10 times to $1,000, and tax of $330 is paid when the shares are sold, leaving the same net position of $670. Conclusions Tax at issue and deferred tax at sale are equivalent. Reducing the amount invested by 33% upfront is equivalent to reducing the proceeds by 33% at the end. The small amount of tax of $33 upfront leaves the employee in the same net position as the large amount of tax of $330 at the end. 6.16 If the employee makes a payment for the shares, deferral can result in an increase in taxation for the employee. Possible remedies for this can be explored. 6.17 This approach allows the deferral of the payment of tax which could result in an effective decrease in tax revenues to the Government. When no dividends are being paid, the deferral would be expected to be compensated for by the collection of a greater amount of tax (because the shares increase in value over the deferral period). However, if the company pays dividends, the expectation will be that the value of the shares would not increase sufficiently for the increased tax to compensate for the deferral benefit. 6.18 For example, assume a 5% after-tax discount rate and a 33% tax rate. An emplo yer grants to an employee the right to acquire a number of shares in three years for no consideration if the employee is still employed at that time. The option is exercised in year 3 when the shares are worth $900. Ordinarily tax of $297 would be payable at that time. However deferral of payment of tax until the shares are sold would have a cost to the Government if dividends are paid. If dividends of $45 19 per annum are paid on the shares, the shares would be expected to remain worth $900. The shares are sold in year 5. If tax of $297 is levied at that time there would be a time value of money cost to the Government (though this cost would be reduced by the benefit of deferring the employer’s deduction). 19 The tax on dividends is irrelevant for the purpose of comparison as these are taxed with or without deferral. 28 6.19 If the shares did not pay dividends, then the shares would be expected to appreciate by 5% per year to $992 20 in year 5, leading to tax of $327 (with a present value of $297) – the same present value of tax as taxing at exercise. Accordingly, the Government would be equally well off if it allowed a deferral of tax until sale as if tax was imposed at exercise. 6.20 One possibility would be that deferral could be made available only on shares that do not pay dividends. This may not be too great an issue as many start-up companies do not have the cash to pay dividends in any event. However, tax would need to be triggered once the share starts to pay dividends to avoid the under-taxation issue described above. Providing a precise targeting of eligibility for the deferral to cash-strapped start-ups might also alleviate this concern. 6.21 An alternative deferral approach, which would deal with situations with less than a full discount and the cashflow issue – though not the valuation issue, would be to determine the tax liability at the time of vesting, but alleviate the liquidity issue by deferring the payment of the tax until the shares are sold with use-of-money interest (UOMI) applying to the outstanding tax liability. 6.22 Any deferral of the taxing point for the employee would need to be matched by a deferral of the proposed deduction for the employer. Scope of any deferral measure 6.23 An important issue to decide is which companies would be eligible to use a start-up concession? There are difficulties associated with defining a “start- up company”. In Australia’s recently enacted start-up concession, a “start-up company” is, broadly speaking, an unlisted Australian company which, along with all group companies, is less than 10 years old and has turnover of less than A$50 million. One issue with this approach is that it creates a “cliff face” – once a company earns $1 more than $50 million or is 10 years and one day old, it is ineligible for the regime. This could, in theory at least, create perverse incentives at the margins – for example, a company would not want to earn more revenue because it would lose eligibility to adopt the deferral approach. 6.24 Moreover, the Australian definition seems very broad and would appear to include companies that would not have the same liquidity and valuation problems that start-ups do. 6.25 Deferral raises various design issues; most obviously, should it be elective or mandatory. If elective, on what basis (scheme by scheme, employee by employee) and who should make the election? How would PAYE be dealt with in the case of income triggered by a sale? How would the system be made robust, so that if tax is not paid at the usual time, is it collected on deferral? Should there be a “sunset” clause, for example, so income cannot be deferred for more than five years? 20 Assuming a compounding 5% appreciation. 29 Submission points We are interested to hear from readers: - whether deferring tax until sale or listing would be beneficial; - whether this option should be limited to non-dividend paying shares; - which companies should be eligible to adopt the deferral option? How should this class of companies be defined? - whether providing an option to defer the payment of tax (with UOMI applying) would be beneficial; and - what are the best answers to the questions raised in paragraph 6.24? Administrative measures to remove barriers to the use of employee share schemes 6.26 There is a range of other measures that could potentially reduce barriers to the use of employee share schemes, particularly by start-up companies. 6.27 Most obviously, keeping employee share scheme taxation simple and predictable, particularly in relation to the relatively simple and straightforward employee share schemes which a start-up company might be expected to enter into, is of considerable value to such companies. This reduces the need for expensive or complex advice. 6.28 Other countries (including Australia) have provided specific safe harbour valuation methodologies to reduce compliance costs associated with valuing shares. The question is whether it is possible to develop methodologies that provide reasonable results. 6.29 For example, valuation methods based on balance sheet information are likely to significantly undervalue a company and this is inconsistent with the employee share scheme framework of neutral taxation. In particular, in relat ion to start-up companies, intangible assets may constitute a significant part of the value of the business and these assets are generally excluded from the safe harbour valuation methodologies or, if included, are still notoriously difficult to value. Abandoning the usual valuation standard, (ultimately, what would a willing buyer pay a willing seller), has considerable risk. Deferring tax until the sale of the shares would be a more robust way to deal with valuation difficult ies. We are interested in readers’ views on this issue. 30 6.30 Another measure recently adopted in Australia is the publication on the Australian Tax Office (ATO) website of sample employee share scheme documentation, along with guidance notes on the implementation of the documentation and the tax consequences. 21 6.31 In addition, the ATO partnered with software developer LawPath to create an online tool – “Easy ESS” – that allows employers to quickly and easily generate emplo yee share scheme documentation by filling out a simple questionnaire. The documentation includes an offer letter, a standard form agreement and a board resolution approving the scheme. The tool also allows the employer to assess its eligibility for the start-up concession and has a market value calculator which determines the value of the shares under the ATO’s safe harbour rules. The tool can be accessed at: http://sem.lawpath.com.au/easy-ess/. 6.32 Easy ESS also advises employers about disclosure requirements under the Australian Corporations Act (as in New Zealand, employers must provide employees with certain information before they participate in an employee share scheme). This means the employer can access the information it needs to offer an employee share scheme (about both its tax obligations and its general corporate law obligations) in one place. Submission points We are interested to hear from readers: - how valuation and liquidit y issues are currently dealt with in practice; - whether readers think providing approved valuation methodologies are possible and would result in reliable and robust valuations; - whether the provision by Inland Revenue of standard documentation and guidance would be helpful; - whether an online tool like the Australian Easy ESS would reduce the costs associated with offering an employee share scheme – thus reducing barriers to offering such schemes; - whether it would be useful to have a tool/guidance covering both the tax and securities law requirements for offering an employee share scheme; and - whether there are any other options to address barriers to offering employee share schemes that fit within the proposed framework. 21 This documentation can be found at https://www.ato.gov.au/general/employee-share-schemes/in-detail/standard- documents-for-the-start-up-concession/ 31 CHAPTER 7 Concession for widely offered share purchase schemes 7.1 The Income Tax Act 2007 currently provides a concessionary regime to encourage employers to offer shares to employees under certain widely- offered employee share schemes. Tax benefits provided by the concessionary regime 7.2 There are two main benefits available under the concessionary regime: • Exemption for employee: The value of a benefit received by an employee under a concessionary scheme is not taxable to the emplo yee. • Deemed interest deduction for employer: The employer company is given a deemed deduction of 10 % notional interest on loans made to employees to buy shares. This is additional to any deduction for actual interest incurred on money borrowed to finance the scheme. 7.3 Another benefit under the concessionary regime is that interest-free loans made under a qualifying employee share scheme are automatically exempt fro m fringe benefit tax (FBT). 22 Requirements of the concessionary regime 7.4 The main requirements of the concessionary regime are: • the cost to employees of shares made available for purchase must not exceed their market value at the date of purchase (but may be less); • the amount that an employee spends on buying shares under the scheme (or a similar scheme) must not exceed $2,340 within a three- year period; • every full-time permanent employee must be eligible to participate in the scheme on an equal basis with every other full-time permanent employee. If the scheme applies to part-time employees or to seasonal employees, they must also be eligible to participate on an equal basis with every other part-time employee or every seasonal employee; • any minimum period of service which may be required before a full- time permanent employee becomes eligible to participate must not exceed three years (or the equivalent of three years full-time service); • loans to employees for the purchase of shares must be free of all interest and other charges; 22 The majority of employee share scheme loans are exempt from FBT for the reasons explained in Appendix 2. 32 • the repayment of loans by employees is to be by regular equal instalments at intervals of not more than one month over a period between three and five years from the date of the loan; and • a trustee must hold the shares on trust for the employee for a period of restriction (generally at least three years). 7.5 The benefits of the regime do not apply to shares given to directors of the company or a person who (with any associated person) holds 10 percent or more of the issued capital of the company. Period of restriction 7.6 The period of restriction is the period that employees are prohibited from charging or disposing of their rights or interests in the shares. There are a number of different time periods specified in the concessionary regime provisio ns. 23 After period of restriction 7.7 On the expiry of the restrictive period, the employee has two options. First, the employee can opt to have the shares transferred from the trust to them. Secondly, the employee can opt for the trust to buy the shares back at the market value (but not more than the price paid by the employee). These options incentivise the employee to hold onto the shares and not sell them back to the trustee, because the maximum amount they can obtain from selling them back is the amount they paid for them. If they hold onto the shares, they continue to have a shared interest in the success of the company. Issues with current law 7.8 There are various issues with the current concessionary regime: • the concessionary nature of the regime appears to undermine fairness, tax neutrality and economic efficiency; • the reasons for introduction of the regime may no longer be valid; • the regime is complex and inflexible; • the tax benefits of the regime are uncertain and poorly targeted; • the regime does not limit the amount of tax-free benefit that can be conferred; • there are some drafting issues with the legislation; and • the maximum amount an employee can pay for shares ($2,340 over a three-year period) has not been adjusted since 1980, and this means as a practical matter that the benefits available under the regime are very limited. Adjusted for wage inflation, the figure would now be around $13,000. 23 See sections DC 13 and DC 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 33 The reasons for introducing the regime may no longer be valid 7.9 The current concessionary regime was introduced in 1973. It was enacted in the context of a heavily-regulated labour market which meant there was limited ability to directly relate an employee’s salary to the performance of the employer. There was also a high level of industrial unrest at the time of enactment. 24 The purpose of the concessionary regime was to encourage companies to give employees a stake in their industry by issuing shares to them. 25 The Government wanted to encourage a greater identity of interest between the employer and the employee. As noted in the discussion of tax incentives, these benefits are probably captured by the parties themselves and so do not provide a convincing rationale for an incentive. The regime is complex and inflexible 7.10 The complexity in the regime comes from the various requirements that need to be satisfied in order for an employee share scheme to qualify for concessionary treatment. Specifically, there are various thresholds and timing requirements that must be satisfied (see above). Further, because the regime has various thresholds, and because it needs to apply to all employees equally, the schemes tend to be inflexible. For example, the concessionary regime cannot factor in the remuneration or time worked in determining the number of shares allocated to an employee. Further, when a loan is provided, the repayment instalment periods cannot exceed one month. Likewise, the period of the restriction on the shares is specified in the legislation so it may not reflect an individual employment situation. The tax benefits provided by the regime are arbitrary 7.11 The deemed 10 percent interest deduction seems anomalous. Why should a company offering interest-free loans under an approved scheme be entitled to a deduction equal to 10 percent of the loans each year? Clearly this is an incentive, but the amount and basis for this particular incentive are not obvious. 7.12 The FBT-exempt status of the loans will also often be of little benefit. In most cases such loans would be FBT-exempt in any event, as “employee share loans” (that is, any loan provided by an employer to an employee to purchase its shares under an employee share scheme). 26 The only benefit o f the concessionary regime is that the interest-free loan can be FBT-exempt regardless of the company’s dividend paying policy. 24 See Hansard (28 June 1974) 391 NZPD 2457. 25 See Hansard (21 November 1973) 388 NZPD 5245. 26 See discussion in Appendix 2. 34 No limit on tax-free benefit 7.13 As noted above, there is an upper limit on the amount of consideration that an employee can pay for the shares in a three year period. However, there is no explicit minimum amount of consideration an employee must pay to be entitled to the shares, nor is there any limit on the value of the shares that may be provided. In the case of a company with a large number of employees, or with employees on quite different remuneration levels, there is a natural limit on the value of the shares that can be provided under a concessionary scheme. However, in the case of a company with a smaller number of broadly equal employees, there may be an opportunity to take advantage of the concessionary nature of the regime. In other words, it may allow very large amounts of employment income to be received tax-free. Options for reform 7.14 There are three broad options: • Repeal the current concessionary regime and retain only the non- concessionary provisions in subpart CE and section CX 35: This option is consistent with the overall framework set out in Chapter 2. • Retain the current concessionary regime: This option is inconsistent with the overall tax framework set out above. It also results in the continuation of the current technical issues, but these could obviously be addressed by remedial amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007. Furthermore, there are various specific aspects of the regime (such as the amount of the notional interest deduction) that may have been appropriate when the scheme was first introduced, that now seem inappropriate. As a result, there would need to be good reasons for retaining the current concessionary regime. If it were retained under the proposal set out in Chapter 3, no deductions for the costs of providing the shares should be allowed for the employer (because no income is included for the employee). • Modernise the current regime: This option is inconsistent with the overall tax framework set out above. Amendments could include: - the current limit on the amounts employees can pay for their shares could be significantly increased; - a minimum level of contribution could be required; - schemes could be allowed to be somewhat more flexible in terms of discriminating between full-time and part-time employees, without losing the requirement for schemes to offer benefits which are practically accessible by all employees; - an upper limit could be placed on the exempt benefit to employees; - the deemed interest deduction could be removed; and - the legislation could clearly state whether a loan facility for the full cost of the shares is mandatory. 35 Submission points We are interested to hear from readers: - whether there are good reasons for retaining the current concessionary regime or replacing it with another concessionary regime; and - if so, whether there are any particular features of the current concessionary regime that should be retained or removed. 36 CHAPTER 8 Transitional issues 8.1 Employee share schemes are often lo ng-term arrangements, lasting three or more years. Additionally, new share schemes are set up fairly regularly by companies and it is important for companies and employee participants to have clarity around the tax laws when they enter into these arrangements. 8.2 Accordingly, it is important to consider transitional measures for existing and contemplated employee share schemes carefully. It is not desirable to put emplo yers and emplo yees in a posit ion where emplo yees are being granted employee share scheme benefits without certainty as to their tax treatment. However, it would also not be appropriate for employers and employees to be able to unduly extend the application of the existing rules by artificially qualifying for grandparenting grants of emplo yee share scheme benefits which are not, in substance, intended to be conferred until a much later time. Employee taxation 8.3 Considering the need to meet these objectives we propose that: • where shares are acquired by an employee and taxed under the existing rules (before the enactment of any new rules), the taxation of that benefit would be dealt with solely under the existing rules (even if under the new rules a subsequent taxing point arises); but • grandparenting would expire at the end of the third full tax year following enactment. For example, if enactment were to occur in June 2017, grandparenting would expire on 31 March 2021. Any transactions occurring after that date which trigger tax under the new rules would be taxed under the new rules, with an allowance for any tax already paid under the old rules. Example 9: Transitional rule applies Paul’s employer issues 1,000 shares worth $1,500 to a trustee on his behalf on 15 October 2016. The shares are issued for no consideration, and so give rise to assessable income to Paul of $1,500. The shares vest in Paul if he remains employed on 15 October 2018. On 30 June 2017, new employee share scheme tax rules are enacted, pursuant to which a similar grant of shares would be taxed only once the employment condition is satisfied, on the value of the shares at that time. The shares duly vest in Paul, and are worth $1,950 on vesting. However, because Paul acquired the shares before the enactment date of the new rules, and the employment condition is satisfied before 31 March 2021, Paul is not taxed when the shares vest in him. 37 Example 10: Transitional rule does not apply Peter works for the same employer as Paul, and is issued the same number of shares at the same time, also for no consideration. However, Peter’s shares do not vest unless he is still employed on 15 October 2023. Peter does remain employed, and the shares vest in him on 15 October, 2023, at a time when they are worth $3,000. Peter will be taxed on $3,000 of income, less the $1,500 on which he paid tax in the 2016–17 year. 8.4 If Example 9 is modified so that instead of being given the shares, Paul: • acquires the shares for $1,500, funded by an interest-free loan from his emplo yer; and • Paul has the right to sell the shares back to his employer for $1,500 if they do not vest, there will be no change to the outcome. The taxing point under current law is still the acquisition of the shares, and that occurs before enactment. Employer taxation 8.5 The employer’s position also needs to be considered. Our proposal for a deduction will not apply to employee share scheme benefits provided which are not taxable because of the grandparenting described above. Transitional rules will also be needed so that an employer is not able to take a deduction under the new rules for granting a benefit where the employer has already claimed a deduction for funding that same benefit under the existing rules. An example is where an employer has taken a deduction for a contribution to a trust for the benefit of employees, and the share benefit is provided by that trust. Widely offered schemes 8.6 The transitional treatment of the current widely offered concessionary schemes also needs to be considered. 8.7 If it is decided that these schemes should not continue to be available, on what basis should that be done? 8.8 Most obviously, grants made under a concessional scheme: • before enactment of these proposals would not be affected, and nor would the deemed employer deduction or the FBT treatment of any associated loan; and • after enactment of these proposals would no longer be entitled to the current exemption, and nor would the associated loans. 38 8.9 If the concessionary schemes are retained, but the rules are amended, then other transitional approaches may be more appropriate. Submission points We are interested in readers’ views on this approach to implementation, and whether there are any other issues that need to be taken into account. 39 CHAPTER 9 Administration, record keeping and reporting 9.1 There are currently no specific reporting requirements for employers offering, or employees participating in, employee share schemes. 27 While employers offering the concessionary schemes discussed in Chapter 7 must apply to the Commissioner initially for approval, there are no on-going reporting requirements with respect to these schemes. 9.2 Similarly, there are no requirements for employers to provide employees with a share scheme statement containing the necessary information to complete their tax return (for example, the market value of their employee share scheme interests). Some employers may voluntarily provide their employees with such a statement. 9.3 The PAYE measures contained in the Taxation (Transformation: First Stage Simplification and Other Measures) Bill require employers to include employees’ employee share scheme benefits in the employer monthly schedule (EMS) (whether they elect to withhold PAYE or not). However, this amendment does not require the employer to provide specific details of the share scheme benefits provided. 9.4 This lack of reporting raises a number of issues: • it is difficult to know whether employers and employees understand and are complying with their share scheme tax obligations; • employees may not have sufficient information to complete their tax return; and • there are no comprehensive statistics on how widespread employee share schemes are and what form they take. This type of information is particularly important to collect in respect of the Commissioner- approved concessionary schemes. This is because it is important for the Government to know how much the tax concession costs and whether it is being appropriately targeted. 9.5 There are a number of measures that could be considered to address these issues. For example, New Zealand could adopt a reporting system similar to Australia’s. This would require employers to provide: • employees with an employee share scheme statement in the year in which they should be returning income from the share scheme (for example, when no substantial contingencies exist with respect to their interest); and 27 Employees return the share scheme income in their tax return, but this is not separately identified as such. 40 • Inland Revenue with an annual employee share schemes report listing which employees participated in a particular employee share scheme, what taxable benefits they received during the year and the value of those benefits. The report would need to provide information about any amount the employee had paid for the share scheme benefit to enable the discount to market value to be determined. 9.6 We understand that Australia has seen a significant improvement in compliance as a result of implementing such a reporting regime. 9.7 However, because of the recent changes to the collection of tax on employee share schemes, the Australian approach may not be appropriate for New Zealand. This is because in New Zealand employers will soon be required to include employee share scheme benefits in the EMS for the month in which the benefit is received, even if PAYE is not paid. Because employers are reporting the employee share scheme benefits in (close to) real time, it may make more sense to align more detailed reporting requirements with the monthly EMS filing, rather than requiring employers to provide an annual return. 9.8 Introducing specific employee share scheme reporting requirements involves a trade-off between better compliance and targeting of tax benefits, and increased compliance and administrative costs. It is also important to consider who the compliance costs will fall on. 9.9 Employers will soon be required to generate much of the required information to include their employees’ employee share scheme benefits in the EMS. Under the proposal, employers will also need to collect the information to determine their own deduction. 9.10 Accordingly, it makes the most sense for employers to provide the required information to Inland Revenue and employees. This is generally in line with the reporting requirements in other jurisdictions. It is also generally more efficient for the reporting requirement to fall on the employer (who is managing the employee share scheme for a number of employees), rather than individual employees. Employees are also less likely to be familiar wit h filing returns and therefore compliance is likely to be lower. However we are interested to hear whether this obligation would impose particularly high compliance costs and whether there are ways these costs could be minimised. 9.11 Another option would be to simply require employers to keep a record of employee share scheme information, which could be requested by Inland Revenue as part of an audit. 9.12 However, one of the aims of the review of the tax treatment of employee share schemes is to move these schemes out of audit and into routine compliance – an actual filing requirement is more likely to achieve this aim. 41 9.13 We are interested in readers’ views as to whether filing a monthly (real time) or annual employee share schemes report would impose significantly greater compliance costs on employers than simply being required to hold the information. We are also interested in whether readers would support a requirement to provide an employee share scheme statement to participating employees at the time the share scheme benefit is included in the EMS. 9.14 It would also be possible to require employers to register their schemes with Inland Revenue when they are implemented, in a similar way to the current concessionary Commissioner-approved employee share schemes. This, in addition to the reporting described above, would help address the current lack of information on share schemes. However, this measure may impose addit ional co mpliance costs on businesses and the other reporting may provide sufficient information for these purposes. 9.15 Whichever approach is adopted, the employee share scheme reporting/record keeping requirements should be implemented in a way that reduces compliance costs as much as possible and potentially capitalises on information already recorded by employers for other purposes (for example, through payroll systems, for financial reporting purposes or for the administration of their employee share schemes generally). The chosen approach should also be consistent with Inland Revenue’s wider Business Transformation framework, both conceptually and in terms of timing of implementation. Provisional tax for employees 9.16 As discussed in the officials’ issues paper Simplifying the collection of tax on employee share schemes (April 2015), subjecting employee share scheme benefits to provisional tax can increase compliance costs for employees and potentially result in the imposit ion o f UOMI. Wit h many emplo yers elect ing to pay PAYE on employee share scheme benefits, the number of employees subject to provisional tax due to the receipt of a share scheme benefit should reduce. However, if employers do not elect to pay PAYE, it is still possible for some employees to fall into provisional tax. 9.17 We are interested in readers’ views as to whether the application of provisional tax to employee share schemes is problematic in practice, or is likely to become so. If so, are there changes that could be made to reduce the practical difficulties associated with provisio nal tax? 42 Submission points We are interested to hear from readers: - whether they think the current lack of employee share schemes reporting contributes to misunderstanding of tax obligations and non-compliance; - whether specific employee share schemes reporting (to Inland Revenue and employees) would impose significant compliance costs on employers; - whether there are ways these compliance costs could be minimised; - whether monthly (real time) or annual reporting would be preferable; - whether it would be preferable for employers to simply be required to hold the relevant employee share scheme information, which could be requested by Inland Revenue if required; - the extent to which the information needed to report on employee share schemes is already held by employers; - whether registration of employee share schemes with Inland Revenue would impose significant compliance costs; - whether applying provisional tax to employee share schemes is problematic in practice; - whether changes could be made to reduce the practical difficulties associated with provisio nal tax. 43 APPENDIX 1 Examples of complex employee share schemes As noted in Chapter 5, problems arise with the application of the current tax rules to complex arrangements such as conditional employee share schemes and option-like arrangements. These include: • discrepancy between the timing and valuation of employment income generally (for example, salary and wages or cash bonuses) compared with the timing and valuation of emplo yment inco me from condit io nal emplo yee share schemes; • under-taxation of option-like arrangements; • anomalous taxation of certain schemes that involve price support by way o f debt forgiveness or a taxable payment; and • difficulty in valuing shares with rights which can change, and the inconsistency between the taxation of such shares and the taxation of options. This appendix provides examples of: • Conditional employee share schemes – where the shares received are subject to future employment conditions. They may be similar in form to unconditional employee share schemes, are economically similar to conditional cash bonuses and should be taxed in the same manner. That is, they are contingent payments that depend upon future employment services and should be taxed when the value, in the form of shares, is received free fro m further emplo yment conditions. • Option-like arrangements – have terms and conditions and arrangements that may bring forward the taxing point of the share acquisition to a time prior to the earning of the associated employment income and the satisfaction of conditions. If so, they are taxed inconsistently with options, cash bonuses and unconditional employee share schemes, with employment income essentially converted into tax-free capital gains. • Shares with contingent rights – are shares (usually of a special class) with terms and conditions that make them very difficult to value, that only become ordinary shares if certain events occur (such as listing or sale of company). They are similar to options and cash bonuses as they only have value if future events unfold and should be treated in a similar manner. • Interest-free share purchase loans repayable out of bonuses – are loans to employees made to acquire shares that are not repayable until some future date, effectively deferring tax on the discount on the acquisition of a share. Simple examples of option-like arrangements and conditional ESS were explored in Chapter 5. The following provides more complex examples of such arrangements to illustrate the problems they raise. 44 Conditional ESS The tax treatment of schemes where shares are acquired subject to a risk of forfeiture if the employee does not remain in employment for a specified time appears inconsistent with the tax neutrality framework discussed in Chapter 2. In this case, there is no condition dependent upon the future price of the share. An example of this kind of share scheme is: • an employee purchases shares in their employer for market value, funded by an interest-free loan provided by the employer; • the shares are held by a trustee on behalf of the employee, and vest in the emplo yee provided they remain employed for a period; • on vesting, a bonus is paid to repay the interest-free loan; • if the employment condition is not met, the employee surrenders their right in the shares in repayment of the loan. This arrangement results in employees being taxed only if and when the employment condition is satisfied, but on the value of shares when they enter into the share scheme. The arrangement is a contingent bonus dependent on continued service that is paid in shares. However, unlike an equivalent contingent bonus paid in cash, the employee is taxed on the initial value of the shares, not the value of shares when the bonus is paid. Accordingly, it is likely to result in under-taxation (compared with other equivalent forms of remuneration) if a company’s shares are expected to increase in value (which would be the case if, say, the company does not pay dividends). The employee is (in essence) taxed when they become unconditionally entitled to the shares, but on the initial value of the shares rather than their value when they are received free of conditions. The tax system makes the loan and bonus to purchase the shares artificially attractive compared wit h an equivalent cash bonus without shares. 45 Example 1: Share issued for value subject to service-related forfeiture, funded by loan with contingent bonus Say a company is considering offering some form of share-based remuneration to employees to encourage them to stay with the company and to incentivise performance. The shares are currently worth $100. The first option being considered is to give the employees, in a year’s time, cash equal to the value of a share in the company at that time, if they are still employed by the company. The second option is the same as the first, but to give the employees a share in a year’s time instead of cash. The third option is for an employee to purchase immediately a share for $100 funded by an interest-free loan from the employer. The share is held in a trust until the employee has stayed with the company for 1 year. After this, the share vests and the employee is paid a bonus to repay the loan. If an employee leaves before 1 year is up, the share is returned to the employer and the loan is extinguished. Under the first and second options (transfer of cash or shares in a year’s time), if an employee remains with the employer for a year, the employee will be taxed in year 2 on the value of the share in year 2. Under the third option, if the employee remains with the company for a year, the employee will be taxed in year 2 on the value of the share in year 1 (the bonus to repay the interest-free loan is taxable, and the balance of that loan will be equivalent to the initial value of the shares). There is clearly an inconsistent approach to taxing these equivalent remuneration methods, with the third option being preferable if the shares are expected to increase in value. Of course, it may be the case that, at the time the employment condition is met, the shares are worth less than they were when the employee share scheme was entered into. In this case, the result of the scheme will be more assessable income to the employee than in the case of a simple bonus paid in cash or shares. However, so long as the employer does not pay dividends, the value of the shares will be expected to increase over time, and the employee share scheme considered above will therefore be expected to produce a lower tax burden than its more simple but pre- tax equivalent alternatives. Furthermore, this kind of employee share scheme raises another fundamental question, as to when employment income is earned. Example 2: Share gifted subject to service-related forfeiture Suppose the same facts as the third alternative in Example 1, except that the employer decides to gift the shares to a trustee on behalf of the employee at the outset, with the shares vesting in the employee only if the employee is still with the company in one year. That is, there is no loan or bonus. The economic benefit of this scheme is identical to the scheme in Example 1. However, in this case the employee will be taxable on $100 in year 1, and this income will be reversed in either year 1 (or year 2) if the employment condition is not met. The taxation of Example 2 is clearly not consistent with the general approach to taxing income from services, which is that the income is derived once the services for which it is provided are performed. In Example 2, these services are performed only once the year is up. The income should therefore be taxed at that time. If the income 46 is provided in shares (or any other non-cash form) it should be determined by valuing the shares at that time. The only difference between Example 2 and the third alternative in Example 1 is the time of derivation of the income. The employee share scheme in Example 1 defers the income to year 2, when the employment condition is met. However, the amount of income is the same as Example 2. Option-like arrangements Some employment income can avoid taxation by being converted to capital gains where there is downside price protection on the shares. For example: • if the retention of the shares by the employee is correlated with share price (perhaps with the purchase of the shares funded by a non-recourse loan or if the employee has the right to put the shares back to the employer for the price the employee paid for them); or • the shares are retained regardless of their value, but the employee is protected from any fall in their value by loan forgiveness or a payment from the emplo yer. Share acquired subject to forfeiture purchased with loan from employer There are a number of employee share schemes which result in non-taxation of emplo yment income. In general, the issue raised is defining the borderline between taxable employment income and tax-free capital gains. Essentially, the schemes involve an upfront purchase of the shares, so that any future gains on the shares will be treated as a capital gain. The result in some employment arrangements is that no tax is payable. However the terms and conditions of the arrangements can mean that they are economically equivalent to a bonus or a share option with employment conditions that would give rise to tax on employment income. In these schemes, the employee does not need to fund the purchase of the share, as the employer provides the funding through an interest-free loan (as in Example 3 below). The terms of the scheme ensure that the employee will not be out of pocket if the share declines in value. The commercial outcome is equivalent to a bonus or an employee option, in that the employee will only retain the share if it increases in value. However, under current law, there may be no taxable income to the employee. 28 The benefit derived from the increase in the value of the share is treated as a capital gain. This is inconsistent with the taxation of similar remuneration (such as an employee option or a contingent cash bonus). As the price increase is what gives value to the arrangement and is integral to the employment contract, it is appropriately taxed as employment income. This is demonstrated in Example 3. 29 28 If the share declines in value, whether or not there is debt forgiveness income depends on how the scheme is drafted and structured. This example assumes there is no debt forgiveness income, but that is not critical to the conclusion. A case where debt forgiveness income arises is discussed below. 29 The analysis of the tax consequences of all the examples assumes that section BG 1 does not apply. 47 Example 3: Share issued for value funded by loan from employer As in the examples in the body of the paper, the company’s shares are currently worth $100 each and will be worth $150 or $50 with equal probability in a year’s time. Assume that the employee purchases the shares for $100 in year 1, but this purchase is funded by an interest-free loan from the company. 30 This is treated as a share purchase. Because the employee pays market value for the shares, there is no taxable income. If the shares increase in value, the employee retains the shares and repays the loan, leavin g them with a $50 benefit which is treated as a capital gain under current law, and so is tax-free. But if the shares are worth $50, the employee must forfeit the shares in exchange for $100 and use the $100 to repay the loan. When the shares are worth $150 the employee is effectively paid $50, but is not taxed. Alternatively, the company could offer to pay a cash bonus of $50 if the share value is $150, or could provide the employee with an option with a strike price of $100. These three packages are economically equivalent, but the first package is tax-free, whereas the second and third packages are currently taxed in the same way – if the share is worth $150 in a year’s time, the reward to the employee of $50 is taxed as employment income at that time. This is illustrated as follows: Remuneration type Benefit if shares worth $50 Benefit if shares worth $150 Share option $0 ($0 after-tax) $50 ($33.50 after-tax) 31 Contingent bonus $0 ($0 after-tax) $50 ($33.50 after-tax) 32 Employee share scheme with forfeiture $0 ($0 after-tax) $50 ($50 after-tax) Retention of share with downside protection on loan repayment A possible variation on Example 3, is an employee share scheme which omits the requirement to transfer the share in satisfaction of the loan if it falls in value, and instead allows the employee to retain the share. Downside protection in this case could be provided by limiting the employer’s right to repayment of the loan to the value of the share at the time of repayment. 30 The interest-free loan will be exempt from FBT provided it meets certain criteria. The reason for the FBT exemption for employee share loans is discussed in Appendix 2. 31 Assuming a 33% tax rate. 32 Assuming a 33% tax rate. 48 Example 4: Share issued for value funded by loan from employer, with repayment obligation limited to the value of the share The facts are the same as in Example 3 except that the employee has no right or obligation to sell the share, but their liability to repay the loan is limited to the value of the share at the time repayment is due. On a pre-tax basis, this arrangement is economically equivalent to Example 3. If the shares go up in value to $150, the employee has a $50 benefit. If the shares go down in value, there is no benefit (the employee has in effect paid $50 for a share worth $50). However, the current tax treatment differs from Example 3. As in the previous example, because the employee pays market value for the share, there is no taxable income upfront. If the share increases in value, the employee retains the share and repays the full $100 loan, leaving them with a $50 benefit tax-free. However, if the shares are worth $50, the employee keeps the share and is only required to repay $50 of the loan. This results in $50 of income to the employee under the base price adjustment (so called, “debt forgiveness income”). There may well be no corresponding deduction to the employer. The alternative pre-tax equivalent transactions, and their tax treatment, are as described in Example 3. This is illustrated as follows: Remuneration type Benefit if shares worth $50 Benefit if shares worth $150 Share option $0 ($0 after-tax) $50 ($33.50 after-tax) Contingent bonus $0 ($0 after-tax) $50 ($33.50 after-tax) Example 3 – share scheme with forfeiture $0 ($0 after-tax) $50 ($50 after-tax) Example 4 - share scheme with partial debt remission $0 (-$16.50 after-tax) $50 ($50 after-tax) In this case, there is no difference from Example 3 in pre-tax economic outcome. However, taxation outcomes would be different under current law. When the share price rises, the employee would get a $50 benefit without paying tax. When the share price falls, there would be an inclusion in taxable income equal to the amount of the loan that is forgiven or otherwise offset (in the example, $50). The unrealised loss of $50 on the shares would not be recognised. Accordingly, if the price falls, tax would be paid, while no tax would be due when the price rises. In Example 4, the correct amount of tax is paid, but in the wrong circumstance. That is to say, if the shares decline in value, the employee has no economic return, but has $50 of debt remission income. If the shares go up in value, there is no taxable income, even though the employee is better off. This reflects the fact that under current law while the debt is effectively on revenue account for the employee, the shares are on capital account. This would appear to be inappropriate. The arrangement is equivalent to a call option or a conditional cash bonus and should be taxed in an equivalent manner as a matter of principle. Merely taxing the downside protection could also result in significant under-taxation with different economic assumptions involving the time value of money. Consider a different situation. Share prices in period 2 can be either $100 or $120 with equal probability, and the discount rate is 10%. In that case the arrangement would have expected income of $10 (= 50% x \[120 – 100\]) that should be subject to tax. But in this case, there would be no debt forgiveness income. In the low price world the share is worth $100 which is sufficient to pay off the loan. The arrangement would be 49 under-taxed. Focussing on the debt forgiveness income ignores the substance of the transaction and concentrates too much on its form. Employee share schemes with bonus Example 5 adds a bonus to Example 3 to provide a more significant benefit to the employee. The underlying issues are the same as in the previous examples. Some of the benefit received by the employee from the arrangement escapes taxation. Example 5: Share issued for value subject to price-related forfeiture, with non-recourse loan and contingent bonus Suppose the company in Example 1 instead wishes to provide the employee with the entire value of a share, rather than just the $50 increase, if the share value in one year is $150. The company could pay a cash bonus in one year of $150 if the share value is $150, or could provide the employees with the share in one year’s time only if the share price is $150. These packages are economically equivalent, and are currently taxed in the same way. If the share is worth $150 in a year’s time, the reward of $150 is taxed at that time. If it is worth less, there is no income. However, the company could also use an employee share scheme with an immediate issue of shares subject to a risk of forfeiture if the price drops, funded by an interest-free loan, repayment of which is funded by either the return of the shares or a contingent bonus of $100. The employee purchases shares at the outset for $100 funded by the loan from the employer. Because the employee pays market value for the shares, there is no taxable income. If the shares increase in value, the employee retains the shares, receives the bonus and repays the loan. The employee then has a share worth $150 but only $100 33 of taxable income. If the shares are worth $50, the employee has the right to repay the loan by returning the shares (and receive no bonus). The table below compares the outcomes under the three scenarios discussed in this example. Remuneration type Benefit if shares worth $50 Benefit if shares worth $150 Contingent bonus $0 ($0 after-tax) $150 ($100 after-tax) 34 Contingent gift of share $0 ($0 after-tax) $150 ($100 after-tax) Employee share scheme with loan and contingent bonus $0 ($0 after-tax) $150 ($117 after-tax) Shares with contingent rights A different problem is presented by the current tax treatment of share schemes that use shares with contingent rights. An example is “flowering” shares, when employees are given shares with initially very limited rights (usually of special class with no voting or dividend rights). On specified future and uncertain events occurring (such as the company being sold to a third party for a certain value, or listed), the shares convert into ordinary shares. 33 Many share schemes using loan and bonus arrangements gross-up the bonuses for tax to ensure employees do not have to fund any of the loan repayments themselves. However, because the purpose of this example is to compare equivalent pre-tax benefits, the example assumes no gross-up. This means on an after-tax basis, the repayment of the $100 loan is funded by the $67 after-PAYE bonus plus $33 of the employee’s own money. 34 Assuming a 33% tax rate. 50 Under current law, the shares are taxable at the time of issue. As with share option plans, taxation at the time of issue will give an appropriate outcome provided the price of the share is set appropriately (based on the chance the company will be sold or listed, and the value of the ordinary shares were that to occur). However, this valuation exercise is extremely difficult. The probability of the company being sold, and the value of the shares at sale, is impossible to estimate with any level of accuracy. Due to these valuation difficulties, it is hard to determine whether such shares are being appropriately taxed at present. It is also clear that as a black letter law matter, such shares provide a similar outcome to options without giving rise to tax when the “option” is “exercised” (that is, the conversion occurs). Another way of viewing schemes that provide shares with contingent rights is as a contingent cash bonus. A flowering share plan of the type described above is very similar to a bonus (paid in shares) triggered on the sale of the company to a third party. The initial provision of the shares with limited rights is really a promise to deliver the much more valuable ordinary shares upon the sale of the company; in the same way that an employer would promise at the outset to pay a cash bonus to employees if the company was successfully sold. A contingent bonus would be taxed when (and if) it is paid – not when the prospect of the bonus is offered. This suggests it would be sensible to align the tax treatment of employee share schemes that provide flowering shares with contingent bonuses. Loans repayable out of bonuses The use of loans and bonuses by some employee share schemes creates the possibility of an inappropriate deferral of income in the absence of a contingency. Example 6: Deferral of loan repayment and bonus In this example, the employee purchases shares for their market value of $100 funded by an interest- free loan from the employer. The loan is repayable in the future, but the employer will provide a bonus to fund the repayment. Because the employee pays market value for the shares, there is no taxable income at that time and because the loan is taken to purchase shares, no FBT is payable on the interest- free loan. The cashflow under this arrangement is similar to the cashflow for an employee share purchase at a full discount, in that the employee is not out of pocket for the purchase of the shares. Ordinarily a share purchase at full discount would give rise to tax on $100 in period 1. Subject to anti-avoidance law, this structure might defer the income from the scheme until the bonus is paid to enable repayment of the loan. This could be deferred until the shares are sold or the employee leaves the company. However, the employee has the shares free of any further substantive conditions in period 1. One option to address this would be a specific anti-avoidance rule to target this type of deferral. For example, a loan which is always repaid out of a bonus could sensibly be disregarded for tax purposes. 51 APPENDIX 2 Fringe benefit tax and employee share loans A number of employee share schemes make use of interest-free loans. Interest-free loans provided to employees by their employer are generally subject to FBT. However, FBT is not payable in respect of an interest-free loan provided by an employer to enable an employee to purchase the employer’s shares, provided certain criteria are satisfied (see section CX 35 of the Income Tax Act 2007). This naturally raises the possibility that one way to correct the problems identified with some employee share schemes would be for FBT to be applied to the interest- free loans associated with an employee share scheme. However, as outlined below, the current FBT treatment is not the source of the problems, and so applying FBT to the benefit of the interest-free loan does not address the underlying issues which are the timing of taxation and the character of income. The FBT exemption is appropriate because it ensures the tax treatment of the interest- free loan is the same as if the employer had charged interest, but paid the employee extra salary to meet the interest cost (the “grossed-up transaction”). The reason interest-free employee share scheme loans are exempt from FBT, whereas other interest-free employer loans are not, is that in the case of a share scheme loan, the interest on the grossed-up loan would be deductible as there is the necessary nexus with inco me (that is, the dividends on the shares). This is the reason one of the criteria for the FBT exemption for employee share scheme loans is that the shares must maintain a dividend-paying policy. In the case of other employer interest-free loans, the money may be spent on non-deductible expenditure – for example, to buy a home. Therefore, it is not appropriate to exempt employer interest-free loans from FBT more generally. The following example illustrates this point. An employer is prepared to give an employee an interest-free loan of $1,000 to buy the employer’s shares. Suppose that the market rate of interest is 5%. The employer can either: • lend the employee $1,000, charge interest of $50, but also pay the employee $50 extra salary to meet the interest cost; or • lend the employee $1,000 interest-free (forgoing $50 of interest income). Neither the employer nor the employee has any preference between these two options. Pre-tax, the two options are obviously neutral – neither party ends up with any more or less cash. The outcome is the same once tax is taken into account. In the first case, the employee receives $50 of assessable income, but has a deduction for $50 of interest (as the loan is used to purchase dividend-generating shares). Similarly, the employer is entitled to a $50 deduction for the salary payments, but also derives $50 of assessable interest income. Accordingly, there is no tax payable as a result of this arrangement. 52 If FBT was charged in the second case, employers and employees would simply adopt the counterfactual transaction – charging interest on their employee share scheme loans, but funding it with an equivalent salary payment. It is inefficient for tax to drive the commercial arrangements between the parties. To ensure tax neutralit y between the two economically equivalent transactions described above, it is necessary to exempt the interest-free loan from FBT. 53
1 September 2016 Tax treatment of employee share schemes – further consultation On 12 May 2016, officials released an issues paper, Taxation of employee share schemes. Twenty-seven submissions were received. These submissions, and discussions with many of the submitters, have assisted us considerably in the policy formation process. The purpose of this paper is to provide an update on the proposals, and the opportunity to make a further submission on the updated proposals if you would like to do so. Summary In summary, following submissions our proposals are as follows: • Taxation of employees: The principles on which our proposals are based have not changed. However, we do want to clarify that an obligation placed on an employee to transfer an employee share scheme share for market value will not defer the taxing point. It may also be that the concept of economic ownership is a better description of at least one aspect of our proposal. • Deduction for employers: There is no change to our proposal that employers who provide employee share scheme (ESS) benefits should be entitled to a deduction that matches, in both timing and amount, the employee’s income. • Start-up companies: There was little support for the deferral proposed in Chapter 6 of the issues paper, and accordingly any benefits do not seem to be matched by the complexity that a deferral option would require. • Widely offered schemes: We propose that there continue to be a concession for widely offered schemes, but propose also that numerous changes be made so that the schemes are less restrictive and simpler to operate. • Transitional/grandparenting: We propose to extend transitional relief in a number of respects. This paper expands on these proposals, and provides some examples of the application of the proposed new rules. Submissions Submissions on the updated proposals should be made by Friday 30 September 2016, so that we can take these into account in our final advice to Ministers. Submissions can be emailed to policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz or sent to: Employee share schemes – further consultation C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 2 UPDATED EMPLOYEE SHARE SCHEME TAXATION PROPOSALS Taxation of employees General 1. No change is proposed to the general thrust of the proposals (in Chapter 5 of the issues paper) in this respect. However, there is an important point of clarification. A requirement on an employee to transfer employee share scheme (ESS) shares for market value should not of itself require the deferral of recognition of income. 2. This section sets out the broad statutory tests that we propose, and then provide some examples of their operation. These rules reflect two important principles. They are that: • ESS benefits which depend on continued employment should be taxed once that employment has occurred; • ESS benefits which are options or subject to contingencies should be taxed once the option is exercised or the contingencies are resolved. Benefits dependent on continued employment should be taxed once employment has occurred 3. Many submissions supported the continuation of the current taxing point, where employees are taxed once shares are held on their behalf by a trustee, regardless of whether the employee loses the shares if they leave their employment. They viewed any gain or loss in the shares after that point as a capital gain or loss. 4. We do not find this capital gain argument compelling, for the following reasons: • It ignores the fact that a person whose right to shares will be lost if they do not remain employed for a period is in a fundamentally different position from an ordinary investor. The employee has no entitlement to gain or loss on the shares until the period of service has been satisfied. The investor does have such an entitlement. • It creates an unjustifiable difference in tax outcomes between the tax treatment of an employee who receives a contingent interest in shares which is lost if they leave and an employee who has a right to receive shares if they stay. • It does not reflect an ordinary principle of income derivation, which is that income is taxed once it is earned. • Any payment in kind for employment services is taxed by reference to the value of the asset provided, at the time the asset is earned. If the value of the asset changes between the time the employment contract is entered into (or the time the asset is promised, if later) and the time the relevant services are provided, that change in value will affect the service provider’s income. That does not mean that we are taxing capital gains. 3 5. Some submitters also supported the current taxing point on the ground that it reflects commercial reality. It was suggested that an employer, deciding whether to conditionally provide shares to an employee in the future, would consider the current market value of the shares – not the expected future value of the shares. Similarly, an employee would value the conditional offer based on the current value of the shares. Submitters argued it was therefore appropriate to tax the conditional offer of shares based on the value of the shares when the offer is made. 6. We are not convinced by this argument. The value an asset is expected to have in the future is not the same as its current market value (unless it pays out a cash return equal to its risk-adjusted rate of return). Shares are generally expected to increase in value over time (subject of course to their expected dividend payout). Therefore, an employee will in most cases value a conditional offer of shares in the future with a current value of $10,000 more highly than a conditional offer of $10,000 cash in the future. Taxing the shares based on their market value at the time of the offer would under-tax. 7. It could be argued then that employees should be taxed on the expected future value of the shares when they are promised – rather than the actual value of the shares when received. However, there would be valuation issues with this approach. Moreover, taxing an employee on the value of the shares when they earn them – rather than the value they are expected to have – is more equitable and more in accordance with the way other remuneration is taxed. Options should be taxed on exercise 8. A number of submitters were in favour of taxing options on issue. An important point which may not have been appreciated by some of these submitters is that even if options are taxed “on issue”, consistent with the first principle discussed above, the taxing point would be deferred until the options vest, that is, there is no further service requirement. 9. We remain of the view that the current tax treatment of options should continue. Again, there are a number of reasons for this: • Option valuation is more contentious than share valuation. • Taxing the issue of options is more likely to tax in the absence of any immediate prospect of liquidity. • Taxing options on exercise taxes winners rather than losers. • Taxing on exercise and taxing on grant appear to result in the same after tax outcomes to employees in any case (see Example 3 on page 16 of the issues paper). 4 Proposed taxing point and amount 10. The test aims to identify the time at which an employee holds shares on the same basis as a non-employee shareholder. That is, the time when there are: • no put or call options; and • no downside or upside price protections, except for those that: (a) would arise in the absence of the employment relationship; or (b) do not affect the employee’s right to the economic ownership of the shares. This time can be referred to as the “taxing point”. 11. In addition, where the rights are subject to a possibility of change (for example, an option or a share, which can be reclassified if certain events occur), the taxing point will arise when there is no significant risk of further change. 12. Options, protections and changes which are triggered by events which do not have a real risk of occurring, or which for some other reason have no practical significance, will not be taken into account. 13. If a person sells their rights back to their employer or an ESS trust (or indeed to any third party) before the taxing point identified above, that sale will trigger the taxing point. 14. The amount of income will be the market value of the shares at the taxing point (or the sale price if the taxing point is triggered by sale), less any contribution required of the employee. Example 1 – Simple vesting period Facts A Co transfers shares worth $10,000 to a trustee on trust for an employee. If the employee leaves the company for any reason during the next three years, the shares are forfeited for no consideration. After three years, the shares are transferred to the employee. Result The taxing point is when the three years is up and the employee is still employed. Analysis The risk of loss of the shares for the first three years means the employee does not hold the shares on the same basis as a non-employee shareholder. 5 Example 2 – Vesting period with good leaver exception Facts As for Example 1, except that if the employee ceases employment because of death, illness, disability, redundancy or retirement within the three-year period (is a “good leaver”), they are entitled to the shares. Result The taxing point will be the end of the vesting period, or when the person leaves as a good leaver. Analysis There is a real risk that the employee will leave employment for some other reason than those listed (for example, a better opportunity presents itself) and therefore the risk of forfeiture is still relevant. Example 3 – Vesting subject to misconduct Facts As for Example 1, except that if the employee ceases employment for any reason other than being subject to disciplinary action or committing some form of employment-related misconduct during the three-year period (i.e. being a “bad leaver”), the employee is entitled to the shares. Result The taxing point is when the shares are initially transferred to the trust, and the income will be their value at that time. Analysis The risk of the employee losing their job for these “bad” reasons during the three year period is not sufficiently substantial to require deferral. Example 3A – Vesting subject to misconduct with accrual Facts As for Example 3, except that if the employee ceases employment for any reason other than being a bad leaver, they are entitled to only a pro rata portion of the shares based on completed years’ service (for example, nothing for the first year, one-third of the shares if the employee leaves between one and two years, etc.). Result There will be three taxing points – at the end of years 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The employee will be taxed at the end of each year on the value at that time of one third of the shares. Analysis Until the end of the first year, if the employee leaves for another job, they will not be entitled to any shares. Once the first year is completed, they will be entitled to one-third of the shares, provided they are not a bad leaver during the next two years. The risk that the employee will leave for another job is sufficiently real that it defers the taxing point. The risk that the employee will leave as a bad leaver is sufficiently unlikely that it does not defer the taxing point. The fact that the shares are held by the trustee until the end of year three does not of itself defer the taxing point. 6 Example 3B – Performance hurdles Facts As for Example 3A, except that the employee is not entitled to the shares at all unless a total shareholder return 1 hurdle (measured as an annual percentage) is also met. If the hurdle is met in year 1, one-third of the shares vest. If it is met in year 2, a further one-third of the shares vest. Also, if it was not met in year 1, but is met on a combined basis over years 1 and 2, a further one-third of the shares will vest. The same approach applies in year 3. Result There will be three possible taxing points – at the end of years 1, 2 and 3 respectively. The employee will be taxed at the end of each year on the value of the shares that vest at that time. Analysis Until the end of the first year, if the employee leaves for another job, they will not be entitled to any shares. Once the first year is completed, they will be entitled to retain one-third of the shares, provided they are not a bad leaver during the next two years, and provided the year 1 performance hurdle is met. The risk that the employee will be a bad leaver is sufficiently unlikely that it does not defer the taxing point. The fact that the shares are held by the trustee until the end of year 3 does not of itself defer the taxing point. Example 4 – Vesting period, with compulsory sale for market value thereafter Facts As for Example 1, except that even after the three-year period ends, the trustee retains legal ownership of the shares, and the employee must transfer their rights back to the trustee or A Co when the employee leaves. However, once the three-year period is up, the employee will receive the market value of the shares when their beneficial ownership is transferred. Result As for Example 1. Analysis Once the three-year period has expired, the employer’s or trustee’s right to acquire the beneficial interest in the shares is for market value, and therefore the taxing point is not deferred. 1 Annual “total shareholder return” is a combination of dividends paid and appreciation in share price during a year. 7 Example 5 – Insubstantial put option Facts As for Example 4, except that the employee has the right at all times to sell the shares back to the trustee for a total price of $1. Result The taxing point would be the same as in Example 4. Analysis The employee’s right to sell the shares for $1 is not a right to sell the shares at market value, and therefore has the potential to defer the taxing point. However, at the time it is granted, there is no real risk that this option will be exercised, given that there is no liability attached to the shares and that they are then worth $10,000. This right would therefore not be taken into account. Example 6 – Loan funded scheme A Facts B Co provides an employee with an interest free full recourse loan of $10,000 to acquire shares in B Co for market value, on the basis that: • the shares are held by a trustee for three years; • dividends are paid to the employee from the time the shares are acquired; • if the employee leaves within three years, the shares must be sold back to the trustee for $10,000, which must be used to repay the loan; • if the employee is still employed by B Co after three years, the employee can either sell the shares to the trustee for the loan amount, or choose to continue in the scheme; and • if the employee chooses to continue, the loan is only repayable when the shares are sold. Result The taxing point will be the earlier of when the employee leaves employment, or the expiry of the three years. Analysis Until the three years are up, B Co or the ESS trust has a right to acquire the shares for an amount that is not their market value. This right arises out of the employment relationship, and deprives the employee of the risks and rewards of ownership of the shares during that period. So the taxing point will on the face of it be when that period ends. If the employee leaves within the three-year period and is therefore required to transfer their rights, the sale price will be taxed, but since the sale price is the same as the amount contributed, there will be no gain or loss. Once the three-year period is up, the employee will either have no income (if they sell the shares back to the trustee for $10,000) or will pay tax on the difference between the value of the shares at that time and their $10,000 price (if they choose to keep the shares). 8 Example 7 – Loan funded scheme B Facts As for Example 6, except that: • the loan is limited recourse for the first three years (i.e., during that period, the amount repayable is limited to the value of the shares at the time of repayment); and • if the employee leaves within three years, or chooses at the end of the three years to sell the shares to the trustee, they must be sold back to the trustee for market value. Result As for Example 6. Analysis The limited recourse loan provides protection against a decline in the value of the shares. Accordingly the taxing point is the same as for Example 6 – that is, the end of three years (when the loan ceases to be limited recourse) or when the shares are sold to trustee. If the employee sells the shares for less than $10,000 (because that is their market value), the employee will have a deductible loss from the scheme. They will have debt forgiveness income of an equal amount. Example 8 – Loan funded scheme C Facts As for Example 6, except that: • as in Example 7, the sale back to the trustee must be for market value, whenever it occurs; • at the time of such a sale, the employer must pay the employee the amount of any decline in the value of the shares since the grant date. 2 Result As for Example 6. Analysis The employer’s promise to pay a bonus equal to the decline in the value of the shares is a form of downside protection. If the employee sells the shares for less than $10,000 they will have a deductible loss from the scheme, which will be equal to the income they will recognise due to the payment from the employer. 2 This seems an unlikely scenario, but it was put to us in the course of submissions so we have dealt with it here. 9 Example 9 – Loan funded scheme D Facts As for Example 8, except that there is no arrangement for the employer to pay the employee the amount of any decline in value of the shares. Result The taxing point is when the agreement is entered into. Analysis From the time the agreement is entered into, the employee has the full risk and reward of share ownership. Example 10 – Vesting only in the event of a sale or IPO Facts C Co transfers 1,000 shares to a trustee for an employee. The shares remain held on trust until the employee leaves, more than 50% of C Co is sold, or C Co is listed (whichever happens first). If the employee leaves first, the shares are forfeited. If more than 50% of C Co is sold, the employee’s shares must also be sold and the employee will receive the proceeds. If C Co is listed, the shares are released to the employee. Result The taxing point is when the employee leaves, or C Co is sold or listed. Analysis Because the employee forfeits the shares for no consideration if they leave, the taxing point will be deferred until the employee leaves (in which case there will be no income), the shares are sold (in which case the sale price will be taxable), or the shares are released to the employee (the market value of the shares will be taxable). Deduction for employers Submissions 15. Many submissions supported the proposal to give employers a deduction matching the employee’s income. There were also a number who said that deductions for the cost of providing ESS benefits were already available in many situations, and that these should not be disturbed. Examples were: • deductions taken by employers who are subsidiaries for payments made to their parent in consideration for the issue of ESS shares by the parent; • deductions for contributions to ESS trusts which are used to acquire shares on market; and • deductions for bonuses which are used by the employee to pay for the shares. 10 Response 16. We do not propose any change to the proposal in the issues paper, to give an employer a deduction at the same time and of the same amount as the employee’s income. We do, however, want to clarify how that would work, particularly in the situations set out above. Recharge paid to parent 17. A recharge expense in a subsidiary’s financial accounts for an amount paid to a parent for providing a deductible ESS benefit would simply be reversed in the tax calculation, in the same way as (for example) a provision for holiday pay. The issue of shares by the parent would give rise to a deduction for the subsidiary, and to additional ASC for the parent. The subsidiary’s available subscribed capital (ASC) would be increased by the amount of the deduction less the recharge (or decreased if this is a negative amount). Contribution to ESS trust 18. Contributions to an ESS trust would cease to be deductible. Nor would the trust be entitled to a deduction for the cost of acquiring the shares. This is the same treatment as applies when a company acquires its own shares. This clearly does mean that in such a case, the amount for which a deduction is claimed as a result of providing an ESS benefit will not reflect the cost to the company of acquiring the shares. This is entirely appropriate. It is no different from the situation where a company simply issues a share to satisfy its ESS obligations. In that case, there is no cash cost to the company in making the issue, yet it is appropriate for it to receive a deduction, reflecting the dilution of value for the other shareholders. 19. Where a company chooses to acquire shares on market for the purpose of providing them to employees, the company is simply choosing, for administrative reasons, to use pre-existing shares to satisfy its ESS obligations. This process requires the company in effect to reduce its capital (by paying money to the ESS trust which then uses it to acquire the ESS shares from existing shareholders). This capital reduction does not dilute the value of the other shareholders’ interest in the company. It is not appropriate to treat this as an expense. Instead it should be treated as reducing the company’s ASC. 20. For example, suppose an employer contributes $5,000 to an ESS trust, which uses the money to acquire 2,500 shares on market at $2 per share. One hundred of these shares are allocated to an employee, with vesting only if the employee is still employed in one year. One year later, when the shares are worth $2.20, 100 shares vest. Under the proposals, the initial payment of $5,000 would not be deductible. But the employer would be entitled to a deduction for $2,200 when the 100 shares vest. Bonus used to pay for shares 21. A bonus which is returned to the company to pay for shares could be simply disregarded. However, it seems to be more consistent with existing practice to recognise both the bonus and the contribution to acquire the shares. The bonus will be deductible to the company. The employee will be treated as using the bonus (less PAYE) to pay for the shares. The employee will have total taxable income equal to the bonus plus the difference between the value of the shares at the taxing point and the 11 bonus after PAYE. If this is a negative amount, the employee will be entitled to a deduction for it, and the employer will have income. 22. For example, suppose shares worth $3,000 are acquired by an ESS trustee on behalf of an employee, subject to a one year vesting period. The employee is required to pay for these shares when they vest, but is entitled to a grossed-up bonus to fund the repayment. If the employee remains employed for the year, they will receive a bonus of $4,500, of which $1,500 is paid in PAYE and $3,000 used to pay for the shares. Suppose the shares are worth $2,500 at that time. The employer will be entitled to a deduction of $4,500 for the bonus, and to a further deduction equal to the value of the shares less the amount received for them. Because that amount is negative ($2,500 – $3,000), the employer will have income of $500. The tax outcome is the same as if the employer had simply issued the shares to the employee after the one year vesting period, and paid the employee a further $1,500. This accurately reflects the commercial reality. Transitional 23. It is obviously not appropriate for the same amount to be deductible twice. Accordingly, deductions would not be permitted under the proposed rules for providing a share for which a deduction has already been claimed on a recharge or trust contribution approach. Start-up companies 24. Most submissions did not support special rules for start-up or unlisted companies, and so we do not propose any. We note that within our proposed principles, schemes can be designed which appropriately defer the taxing point until there is (or is very likely to be) either liquidity or no prospect of liquidity. For example: • an option scheme with a 10-year exercise period; or • a share scheme where the benefit of the shares is lost if there is no IPO or sale within 10 years. 25. Of course, the quid pro quo for such deferral is that the employee will not have crystallised a benefit until the taxing point arises. Widely offered schemes Submissions 26. There was considerable support in submissions for a continued exemption for benefits provided under widely offered ESS. However, submissions also criticised various restrictive aspects of the current rules, and were in most cases prepared to forego the 10% deemed deduction. Response 27. On the basis that employers are not entitled to any deduction for the cost of providing the benefit in an exempt scheme, we believe that the fiscal cost of a widely offered scheme exemption may be outweighed by the compliance savings and possible 12 intangible benefits. Accordingly, we are considering continuing with an amended exemption for widely offered ESS. We are considering an exemption along the following lines, and seek submissions on this. Availability 28. As at present, made available to all employees equally, subject to prior employment qualification of no more than three years, with a pro rata reduction for part time or seasonal workers. Vesting period 29. As at present, minimum three-year vesting period. However, if employee leaves employment due to sickness, accident, death, redundancy, retirement at normal age, or if the scheme terminates due to change in ownership of the employer, it is permissible for the employee to receive a pro rata portion of the shares (or equivalent benefit). Cost of shares to employee 30. The cost of the shares would need to satisfy three requirements. • no more than $5,000 pa; • no more than $2,000 less than the market value (so if market value is $2,000 or less, cost can be zero); and • no more than the market value. Loan requirement 31. If there is a cost to the employee to acquire the shares, the employer must provide an interest-free loan facility, which must be repayable over the vesting period – more flexibility over repayment terms than current legislation may be desirable. Dividends 32. As at present, paid to employee, not applied against loan. Deduction to employer/trust 33. No deduction for cost of providing shares, and no deemed 10% deduction. Commissioner approval 34. Registration rather than approval. Transitional 35. Existing section DC 12 schemes should meet all of these requirements. Accordingly, there does not seem to be any need for a transitional rule. The existing legislation can be repealed and replaced from the enactment date. The only exception would be to grandparent the 10% deemed interest deduction on loans made before the effective date. 13 Transition/grandparenting Issues paper proposal 36. The issues paper proposed grandparenting for benefits where the taxing point under existing law arises before the enactment date of the new law, provided the taxing point for those benefits under the new law arises before the end of the third full tax year following enactment. This proposal reflected a desire not to impose the new rules with inappropriate haste, but also not to allow the new rules to be circumvented. Submissions 37. Many submitters were happy with this proposal. Others made the point that: • for schemes with vesting periods of more than three years, this approach means that grants made before enactment date and in the ordinary course would not have grandparenting relief; and • applying the new rules from enactment would be problematic, in that employers offering schemes whose tax treatment is affected by the rules need time after enactment to ensure that their schemes work appropriately under the new rules. Response 38. In response to these submissions, we have amended our proposal for transitional relief as follows. The proposals would not apply to: • benefits granted before the date six months after enactment in accordance with the terms of any ESS in existence before the release of the issues paper on 12 May 2016; and • benefits granted before the date six months after enactment where the taxing point for the benefits under the new law is before 1 April 2022, provided that the decision to grant the benefits was made in the ordinary course of business and without a purpose of preventing the application of the new law. Provisional tax 39. A number of submitters raised the difficulty for employees in complying with the provisional tax regime. 40. We acknowledge that the provisional tax regime is seen as complex by some. However: • from 1 April 2017 employers can elect to pay PAYE on ESS benefits to ensure employees are not subject to provisional tax; • retention of tax exempt schemes will keep many employees receiving ESS benefits out of provisional tax; • in the 2016 Budget the Government announced a number of measures to simplify the application and consequences of provisional tax through an increase in the safe harbour and modifications to the standard uplift method which should reduce the impact of provisional tax to those who earn ESS benefits. 14 41. While it would be possible to exclude ESS benefits from the application of provisional tax there is an equity issue with other types of one-off income which would continue to have provisional tax implications, it would be more appropriate to consider this as part of the continuing business tax stream of Business Transformation. Accordingly, we do not recommend looking at any measures to change the application of provisional tax to ESS benefits at this time. Consequentials 42. A number of submissions asked about the flow-on consequences of our proposals. The issues raised, and our responses, are as follows: • Do the proposals mean ESS shares will be treated as always being on revenue account? No, this will depend on application of the existing law. • Would ESS shares received by an employee be treated as having a cost base if they are on revenue account? Yes, equal to the income recognised by the employee, excluding any PAYE, plus the amount paid for them, if any. For example, if the ESS shares have a taxable value of $3,000, and the employer has paid PAYE of $1,500 with respect to that benefit, the cost base for the employee would be $3,000. • Would the issue of shares by a company or trustee under an ESS give rise to ASC for the company? Yes, there will be ASC for the company equal to the amount of the deduction (less any PAYE).

This is reflected in international initiatives such as the United States’ Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (or US FATCA) initiative, and the G20/OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (or BEPS) initiative. Common themes amongst such initiatives are improving transparency frameworks, the imposition of new reporting obligations, and expectations of greater levels of cooperation between jurisdictions through exchange of information. 1.2 One particular issue in the international spotlight has been tax evasion arising from wealth held by individuals and entities in “offshore” financial accounts that goes unreported for tax purposes in the home jurisdiction. A global solut ion to this problem is needed to prevent these funds fleeing to non- complying jurisdictions. In response, G20 Leaders launched an initiative in September 2013 for the development and swift implementation of a glo bal standard for the Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters (in short, Automatic Exchange of Information, or AEOI). 1.3 As a set of rules it is referred to as the AEOI standard. The AEOI Standard is based on the US FATCA Standard, although there are significant differences between AEOI and US FATCA. The AEOI Standard comprises four distinct elements. These are: • The Common Standard on Reporting, Due Diligence and Exchange of Information on Financial Account Information (in short, the Commo n Reporting Standard or CRS). See Part IIA of the AEOI Publication. • Model Competent Authority Agreements (or CAAs). See Part IIB of the AEOI Publication. Three separate models are provided, a mult ilateral model, a bilateral model, and a non-reciprocal model (for jurisdictions that will only provide, but have no interest in receiving, information, such as those with no tax system). • Commentaries to the CRS and CAA. See Part III of the AEOI Publication. • Technical solutions to be used for exchanging the information, including minimum standards in relation to the encryption and transmission of information, data confidentiality, data safeguards. Some of these technical solutions have been finalised, but others are still being developed. 1.4 Jurisdictions that implement the AEOI Standard (participating jurisdictions) receive information on the financial assets and income from those financial assets held by their tax residents in offshore accounts. The tax authorities of those jurisdictions can then use that informat ion to verify that those residents have correctly reported their financial assets and income for tax purposes. 1 The G20 views implementation as important for all jurisdictions. However, their key targets for early implementation are developed countries and those jurisdictions that have or operate as an international finance centre. These jurisdictions are where offshore accounts will most likely be held. 1.5 The G20 called on the OECD to provide the necessary technical expertise for developing the AEOI Standard. This was finalised and published in 2014. Its published form (the AEOI Publication) can be accessed at http://www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange To ensure consistent global implementation, the G20 called on the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes (the Global Forum) wit h establishing monitoring and peer review processes. 1.6 To date, efforts to secure compliance by target jurisdictions have primarily been through dialogue and a voluntary commitment process. However, as for compliance with other international standards such as anti-mo ney laundering and countering terrorist financing, it is important that a global approach is adopted. If any target jurisdiction is allowed to lag behind in implementation, the risk is that the tax evasion problem will simply relocate to that jurisdict ion from other, complying jurisdictions. Accordingly, the G20 has imposed implementation deadlines on all target jurisdictions, to ensure that all move forward with implementation on a similar timeline. 1.7 To date, all G20 member countries, all OECD member countries, and all but three of the jurisdictions that have or operate as an international finance centre, have already entered into implementation commitments. 1.8 New Zealand made its initial co mmitment to implement AEOI on 7 May 2014 and subsequently decided that the first exchanges of informat io n with other tax authorities would be completed by 30 September 2018, in line with our international commitment. To meet this exchange deadline, AEOI obligations are to apply in New Zealand from 1 July 2017. 1.9 This issues paper specifically concerns, and seeks submissions on, decisions that need to be made regarding New Zealand’s implementation of the Common Reporting Standard, or CRS. The CRS sets out rules to be imposed on financial institutions 1 for: • the conduct of due diligence on their non-exempt accounts to identify Reportable Accounts 2 (broadly, covering certain accounts held or controlled 3 by tax residents 4 fro m reportable jurisdictions 5 ) and Undocumented Accounts; 6 1 See Chapter 2 of this issues paper, which sets out those financial institutions that will have due diligence and reporting obligations. 2 See Chapter 2 of this issues paper. 3 This applies to accounts held by passive NFEs. See the Glossary at the end of this issues paper. 4 As explained in detail in the Appendix, an account holder is sometimes treated as being resident for tax purposes in a jurisdiction based on indicia (of such residence) that is not “cured”. Furthermore, for the purposes of CRS due diligence, an Entity such as a partnership, limited liability partnership or similar legal arrangement that has no residence for tax purposes shall be treated as resident in the jurisdiction in which its place of effective management is situated. 5 See the Glossary at the end of this issues paper. 6 See the Glossary at the end of this issues paper. 2 • the collection of details of financial assets and income in relation to any reportable accounts that are identified; and • reporting the information on reportable accounts and undocumented accounts to the tax administration in the jurisdiction in which the financial institution is located (that is, for New Zealand financial institutions, to Inland Revenue). This information about Reportable accounts will then be exchanged with the relevant Reportable jurisdiction. 7 1.10 Apart from the Commentaries to the CRS, the other elements of the AEOI Standard are concerned so lely with exchange of information between jurisdictions, and are generally outside the scope of this issues paper. 1.11 The benefit to New Zealand from implementing AEOI lies in the information that it will receive from other participating jurisdictions about the financial assets and income of New Zealand residents in those jurisdictions. This information will be used to detect current tax evasion and deter future tax evasion. Perceptions of a fairer tax system can also generally be expected to enhance voluntary compliance domestically. However, AEOI implementation will impose compliance costs on financial institutions. Possible transitional measures and mitigation of compliance costs are therefore a critical part of our thinking, and we invite any suggestions in this regard. The Common Reporting Standard 1.12 The CRS contains the following categories of rules that must be implemented domestically: • Due diligence: Rules for the conduct of due diligence by financial inst itutions on their accounts to identify reportable accounts and undocumented accounts. • Collection of information: Rules for the collection of details of financial assets and income in relation to any reportable accounts that are identified. • Reporting of information: Rules for reporting information on reportable accounts and undocumented accounts to the tax administration in the jurisdiction in which the financial institution is located (that is, for New Zealand financial institutions, to Inland Revenue). 1.13 The CRS also includes important ancillary requirements. In particular: • it imposes an obligation on financial institutions to look through certain passive ent it ies 8 and report on controlling persons 9 who are from reportable jurisdictions; 10 and 7 This is subject to the potential application of the “wider” approach, which is canvassed in this issues paper. 8 These are defined in the CRS as “Passive NFEs”. See the Glossary at the end of this issues paper. 9 See the Glossary at the end of this issues paper. 3 • it requires each implementing jurisdiction to introduce a domestic compliance regime. 11 The legal basis for exchange 1.14 Because of historical international and legal principles that otherwise impose barriers to countries assisting each other in enforcing their tax laws, forms o f tax cooperation between jurisdictions such as exchange of information generally are typically conducted under tax treaties. Although bilateral tax treaties such as double tax agreements (or DTAs) and tax information exchange agreements (or TIEAs) can be used for this purpose, the joint OECD/Council of Europe Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (the Multilateral Convention) has emerged internationally as the preeminent international instrument for tax cooperation generally. 12 The Multilateral Convention has now been signed by over 100 jurisdictions. New Zealand signed the Mult ilateral Convent ion o n 26 October 2012. 1.15 It is anticipated that the majority of AEOI exchanges will take place under Article 6 of the Multilateral Convention. (Note that AEOI exchanges under the Multilateral Convention will generally apply solely between two of the parties. That is, on a bilateral basis.) Article 6 refers to automatic exchange “in accordance with procedures which shall be determined by mutual agreement”. To give effect to this requirement for mutually agreed procedures, a Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (or MCAA) has been developed internationally, 13 based on the multilateral CAA provided in the AEOI Publication. 1.16 AEOI exchanges can potentially also be made under bilateral DTAs. The majority of New Zealand’s DTA partners are also signatories to the Multilateral Convention, so for New Zealand the question of whether AEOI exchanges should be made under any of our DTAs currently only applies in the case of 15 of our DTAs with jurisdictions that are not parties to the Mult ilateral Convent ion. 14 However, resolving this question is not currently seen as a priority, especially as some of the 15 jurisdictions concerned may yet sign the Multilateral Convention. 1.17 New Zealand only has three bilateral TIEAs in force with jurisdictions that have not signed the Multilateral Convention. At present, TIEAs only provide for exchange of information on request, and automatic exchanges such as AEOI are not contemplated. However, in recognition of the fact that TIEAs do not authorise AEOI, the OECD has developed a mechanism for amending TIEAs to allow them to be extended to automatic exchanges. Again, New Zealand does not see amending our TIEAs as a current priority, as all of our TIEA partners may yet sign the Multilateral Convention. 10 See the Glossary at the end of this issues paper. 11 This represents a key difference from FATCA. A withholding tax regime applies in the United States to promote FATCA compliance. No similar international measure exists for AEOI. 12 See http://www.oecd.org/ctp/exchange-of-tax-information/conventiononmutualadministrativeassistancein taxmatters.htm 13 See http://www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange/international-framework-for-the-crs 14 We also have a 16 th DTA, with the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China, but this does not provide for automatic exchange. 4 Data confidentiality and safeguards 1.18 AEOI will involve the reporting and exchange of sensitive personal and financial information. Understandably, taxpayers and other stakeholders are likely to be concerned about any potential risks to privacy from the reporting and exchange of their financial information, and in particular, that the information reported to Inland Revenue and exchanged with other jurisdictions is subject to high standards of confidentiality and data protection. Addressing these concerns is essential if support for the initiative is to be maintained. 1.19 Domestically, that will require a clear legislative framework to govern the collection and exchange of the relevant personal and financial information, including the limits on the permissible use of that information. Officials consider that the secrecy rules under which Inland Revenue current ly operates (primarily set out at section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994) are adequate for this purpose. 1.20 Internationally, that will require a high degree of confidence in the data protection arrangements in place in other participating jurisdictions. To that end, the Global Forum will conduct peer reviews on data security and confidentiality arrangements (in addition to the general peer reviews referred to above). The results of these confidentiality reviews will be available to implementing jurisdictions to help inform their decisions as to which countries they can safely exchange information with. New Zealand can use these mechanisms to identify and (if necessary) restrict exchanges wit h jurisdictions that do not comply with the data security and confidentiality requirements. OECD documentation 1.21 In addition to the AEOI Publication, other important documentation relating to CRS implementation includes the following: • The OECD’s Implementation Handbook published on 7 August 2015 (see http://www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange). • The Multilateral Convention (see http://www.oecd.org/ctp/exchange- of-tax-information/conventiononmutualadministrativeassistancein taxmatters.htm). • The MCAA (see http://www.oecd.org/tax/automatic-exchange/ international-framework-for-the-crs). 1.22 It is important that this issues paper is read in conjunction with these documents, as they contain technical detail which cannot all be replicated in this paper. A Glossary is included at the end of this issues paper for general information. The CRS due diligence procedures referred to in this issues paper are also elaborated upon in the Appendix. Any inconsistencies between this issues paper on the one hand, and the CRS, its Commentaries, the Implementation Handbook, or any other OECD documentation on the other hand, are inadvertent. OECD documentation should be treated as authoritative. 5 Consultation questions 1.23 To ensure global consistency, the CRS rules will be applied by participating jurisdictions as designed by the OECD. (Indeed, the Global Forum will be conducting in-depth monitoring and peer reviews to ensure that jurisdictions implement the CRS correctly.) However the CRS and its Commentaries provide flexibility and require implementation decisions on certain points. This issues paper calls out these points in Chapter 5, and seeks your views. We are particularly interested in understanding how (or if) exercise of any o f the available optionality would assist in reducing compliance costs. 1.24 Given that compliance costs of implementing by 1 July 2017 are likely to be high, officials have considered the possibility of transitional arrangements for financial institutions (within the confines of what is allowable under the CRS). Such matters are dealt with in Chapters 2 through 4. 1.25 Submissions on any other implementation issue are also welcome. How to make a submission 1.26 Officials invite submissions on the suggested changes and points raised in this issues paper. Submissions should be sent to policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “Commo n Reporting Standard” in the subject line. Submissions can also be sent to: Commo n Reporting Standard C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 The closing date for submissions is 31 March 2016. 1.27 Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for Inland Revenue and Treasury officials to contact those making the submission to discuss the points raised, if required. 1.28 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their release. The withholding of particular submissions, or parts thereof, on the grounds of privacy, or commercial sensitivity, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. Those making a submission who consider that there is any part of it that should properly be withheld under the Act should clearly indicate this. 6 CHAPTER 2 Key Common Reporting Standard due diligence and reporting obligations 2.1 The CRS generally sets out the rules for: • Due diligence: The conduct of due diligence by reporting financial institutions on their non-exempt accounts to identify reportable accounts and undocumented accounts. 15 (There are different due diligence rules for pre-existing and new accounts, and individual and entity accounts. These procedures are elaborated upon in the Appendix and these terms are set out in the Glossary to this issues paper); • Collection of information: The collection by reporting financial institutions of details of financial assets and income in relation to any reportable accounts that they identify; and • Reporting of information: Reporting information on reportable accounts and undocumented accounts to the tax administration in the participating jurisdiction in which the reporting financial inst itution is located (that is, for New Zealand reporting financial inst itutions, the Inland Revenue Department). 2.2 The CRS also includes important ancillary requirements, including: • An obligation for reporting financial inst itutions to look through “passive NFEs” (this is a defined technical term in the CRS – see the Glossary at the end of this paper) and report relevant controlling persons from reportable jurisdict ions; and • Obligations on participating jurisdictions to have rules and administrative procedures in place to ensure effective implementation of, and compliance with, the CRS reporting and due diligence procedures. 2.3 Participating jurisdictions are required to translate the CRS into domestic law, and to put in place the necessary systems and processes for giving it effect. The Global Forum will conduct in-depth monitoring and peer review of participating jurisdictions to ensure that the CRS has been correctly implemented and that no shortcuts are taken that would weaken the global effectiveness of the CRS. A key element of this will be determining whether there has been effective implementation of, and compliance with, the CRS reporting and due diligence procedures. 2.4 However the CRS and its Commentaries provide flexibility, and provide participating jurisdictions with options in certain areas, and in respect of these areas participating jurisdictions need to decide which approach it will take. 15 The distinction between “Reporting” Financial Institutions and “Non-Reporting” Financial Institutions is outlined below. 7 2.5 This chapter of the issues paper highlights some key areas where New Zealand is required, or able, to make implementation decisions regarding various CRS due diligence and reporting obligations (including who will have such obligations, what accounts will be the subject of such obligations, and what non-resident jurisdictions are within the scope of CRS due diligence and reporting), and seeks feedback on the design choices to be made in these areas. (Other legislative issues or options relating to CRS due diligence and reporting obligations are set out in Chapters 4 and 5). Who must conduct due diligence? 2.6 CRS obligations apply to a broad range of entities, beyond simply banks, to include other financial institutions such as certain brokers, custodians, collective investment vehicles, managed entities, and insurance companies. The specific definition of the term “financial inst itution” in the CRS includes any: “depository inst itution”, “custodial inst itution”, “investment entity”, or “specified insurance company”. These specific categories are further defined in the CRS and its Commentaries. 2.7 New Zealand is generally required to implement CRS obligations for any “participating jurisdiction financial inst itution”. For New Zealand this will include: • Any financial institution resident in New Zealand (but excluding any of its branches located outside New Zealand); and • Any branch of a non-resident financial institution that is located in New Zealand. 2.8 The “residence” of a participating jurisdict ion financial inst itution will be determined using domestic tax residence rules. However, for trusts, or financial institutions that do not have residence for tax purposes (for example, because they are treated as fiscally transparent, or located in a jurisdiction that does not have an income tax), the CRS Commentaries specify how a participating jurisdiction is to determine residence. 2.9 Only those participating jurisdiction financial institutions that are “reporting financial institutions” will (upon implementation in New Zealand) be required to carry out CRS due diligence on their non-exempt financial accounts to identify whether they have reportable accounts or undocumented accounts. The New Zealand reporting financial institution would need to report such accounts to Inland Revenue. In this issues paper, such financial inst itutions (that have CRS due diligence and reporting obligations) will be referred to as New Zealand reporting financial inst itut ions. (Note that a New Zealand reporting financial institution may conduct due diligence on its accounts but not identify any reportable accounts or undocumented accounts). 2.10 The due diligence procedures that a participating jurisdiction must put in place for reporting financial institutions to use in determining whether a non- 8 exempt account they maintain is a reportable account (held or controlled 16 by a reportable person) or an undocumented account, are set out in Sections II to VII of the CRS. A reportable person is a non-exempt natural person or entity 17 that is tax-resident (including sometimes treated as resident based on indicia that is not “cured”) in a participating jurisdiction. 18 A reportable person can also be a non-exempt entity (such as a partnership, limited liability partnership, or similar legal arrangement) that has no jurisdiction for tax purposes, in which case the CRS looks to the participating jurisdiction in which the place of effective management is situated. For CRS purposes, these are persons resident in reportable jurisdictions. 2.11 The CRS due diligence procedures that reporting financial inst itutions need to apply to identify such reportable accounts and undocumented accounts vary depending on whether the account is a pre-existing account or a new account and whether the account is held by an individual or an entity. In broad terms, a pre-existing account will be an account maintained by a reporting financial institution immediately before the date of implementation of the CRS (for example, 30 June 2017) and a new account will be an account opened on or after the date of implementation of the CRS (for example, 1 July 2017). 2.12 The different CRS due diligence procedures for pre-existing and new accounts are largely in recognition of the fact that it may be more difficult and costly for reporting financial institutions to collect information for pre- existing accounts than when opening a new account. The different procedures for individual and entity accounts also reflect the fact that a reportable person may hold an account directly or through an entit y. There are also aggregation rules that apply where the account holder has mult iple accounts with a reporting financial institution (including a related entit y) in defined circumstances. These types of accounts and the due diligence procedures that apply to these types of accounts are set out in detail in the Appendix and Glossary. 2.13 Under the CRS, a participating jurisdiction financial institution (such as a New Zealand financial inst itution) will be a “reporting financial inst itution” if it does not fall within any of the categories of “non-reporting financial inst itution” set out in the CRS and its Commentaries. 2.14 The CRS sets out the following specific categories of non-reporting financial institution (that are not required to carry out due diligence procedures or report), together with the criteria for identifying them: • a “governmental entity”, “international organisation”, or “central bank”; 19 • a “broad participat ion retirement fund”, “narrow participatio n retirement fund”, “pensio n fund” of a governmental entity, 16 This would apply where the reportable person is a controlling person of a passive NFE account holder. 17 For this purpose, the term “entity” is to be interpreted widely. For example, it includes trusts and hybrid entities. 18 There is also scope under the “wider approach” canvassed in this paper, for all non-resident jurisdictions to be treated as being reportable jurisdictions. 19 However, the CRS excludes payments derived from an obligation held in connection with a commercial financial activity of a type engaged in by a specified insurance company, custodial institution, or depository institution. 9 international organisation, or central bank, or a “qualified credit card issuer”; • any other entity that presents a low risk of being used to evade tax, has substantially similar characteristics to the above-ment ioned ent ities, and which is defined in domestic law as a non-reporting financial institution; 20 • an “exempt collective investment vehicle”; and • a trust to the extent that the trustee of the trust is itself a reporting financial institution, and reports all required information in relation to the trust. 2.15 Each participating jurisdiction (including New Zealand) will need to identify the specific financial institutions in its jurisdiction that will qualify as non- reporting financial institutions. Those coming under the category set out in CRS Section VIII.B(1)(c) of “any other entity that presents a low risk of being used to evade tax” and that have “substantially similar characteristics” to the relevant types of entities that are mentioned in the CRS, may be defined in domestic law as non-reporting financial institutions provided they meet the specific requirements of the CRS, and their classification does not frustrate the purposes of the CRS. Therefore, the scope for New Zealand to define a financial inst itution as a New Zealand non-reporting financial institution (under this part of the definition of non-reporting financial inst itution) is limited and would need to be based on these narrow criteria being satisfied. 2.16 The Global Forum has advised that the decisions made in this regard will be subject to stringent international scrutiny to ensure that the aims of the CRS are not frustrated. The expectation is that New Zealand will be able to clearly document its reasons for exempting any particular financial institution as a New Zealand non-reporting financial institution under domestic law (and in terms of the specific requirements of the CRS). 2.17 Note that the range of New Zealand reporting financial inst itutions that will be required to carry out CRS due diligence and reporting will not necessarily be the same as those that are currently exempted under US FATCA. For example, Annex II to the New Zealand/US FATCA intergovernmental agreement (IGA) exempts New Zealand financial inst itutions wit h a local client base or which only have low value accounts. However, no similar exemptions apply under the CRS to treat these as non-reporting financial inst itutions for CRS purposes. 21 Instead, the exemption of any entity as being a New Zealand non-reporting financial institution would need to be based on the narrow CRS criteria (referred to above) being satisfied. 20 However, the CRS also provides that listing such entities under domestic law as non-reporting financial institution must not frustrate the purposes of the CRS: see CRS Section VIII.B(1)(c). 21 CRS Section VIII.B(1)(c), CRS Commentaries pp.166, and 170-173, and Implementation Handbook pp.38, 89, and 114-115. 10 Consultation question 2.18 We would appreciate your submissions regarding what entities would satisfy the CRS criteria (referred to in paragraph 2.15) for being New Zealand non- reporting financial institutions and, therefore, should be exempted from CRS due diligence and reporting obligations. • Submissions on this point should confirm that the specific criteria set out in paragraph 2.15 and in CRS Section VIII.B.1(c) of the CRS have been met, or if not, then explain any substitute requirements relied on and how they are substantially similar. Determining which financial accounts will be the subject of CRS due diligence and reporting 2.19 The CRS sets out rules for reporting financial institutions conducting due diligence on non-exempt (excluded accounts or accounts exempted by threshold) 22 financial accounts that they maintain to identify reportable accounts and undocumented accounts. 2.20 In broad terms, the point of the CRS rules is for the reporting financial institution to conduct due diligence on their non-exempt financial accounts to identify reportable accounts that are held or controlled 23 by reportable persons, who are generally non-resident individuals or entities 24 that are tax resident 25 in participating jurisdictions that New Zealand has CRS obligations to exchange information with (reportable jurisdictions). 26 2.21 However, some financial accounts are not subject to CRS due diligence or reporting, provided specific requirements are satisfied. 27 These accounts are referred to as “excluded accounts”. Examples of excluded accounts include: • certain retirement or pension accounts; • certain non-retirement regulated tax-favoured accounts; • a certain type of life insurance contract; • an account held solely by an estate if certain requirements are satisfied; • certain escrow accounts; and 22 The CRS generally does not contain threshold exemptions from due diligence and reporting (cf FATCA). However, as canvassed in this paper, there is scope for a participating jurisdiction to allow reporting financial institutions to exempt from review pre-existing entity accounts with a balance or value of less than US $250,000 at the relevant date (set in implementing legislation). 23 This applies to accounts held by passive NFEs. See the Glossary at the end of this issues paper. 24 For this purpose, the term “entity” is to be interpreted widely. For example, it includes trusts and hybrid entities. See the Glossary at the end of this issues paper. 25 As explained in detail in the Appendix, an account is sometimes treated as being resident for tax purposes in a jurisdiction based on indicia (of such residence) that is not “cured”. Furthermore, for the purposes of CRS due diligence, an entity such as a partnership, limited liability partnership or similar legal arrangement that has no residence for tax purposes shall be treated as resident in the jurisdiction in which its place of effective management is situated. 26 However, this is subject to the application of the “wider approach” which is canvassed in this paper. 27 CRS Section VIII.C.17 (Excluded Account). 11 • certain depository accounts that exist solely because a customer makes a payment in excess of a balance due with respect to a credit card or other revolving credit facility and the overpayment is not immediately returned to the customer. 2.22 The CRS also defines in CRS Section VIII.C.17 (g) an excluded account as including any other account that presents a low risk of being used to evade tax, has substantially similar characteristics to the other excluded accounts, and which is defined in domestic law as an excluded account, provided that the status of such account as an excluded account does not frustrate the purposes of the CRS. 2.23 Therefore, the scope for New Zealand to define a financial account as being an “excluded account” (under this part of the definition of excluded account) is limited and will need to be based on these narrow criteria being satisfied. 2.24 The Global Forum has advised that the decisions made in this regard will be subject to stringent international scrutiny to ensure that the aims of the CRS are not frustrated. The expectation is that New Zealand will be able to clearly document its reasons for treating any particular financial account as being an “excluded account” under domestic law (and in terms of the specific requirements of the CRS). 2.25 Note that the range of excluded accounts will not necessarily be the same as those that are currently excluded under US FATCA. Instead, treatment of any account as being an excluded account will be based on the account meeting the specific CRS criteria. Consultation questions 2.26 We would appreciate your submissions regarding which financial accounts would satisfy the CRS criteria (referred to above) for being excluded accounts, and, therefore, should be exempted from CRS due diligence and reporting. • Submissions on this point should confirm that the specific criteria set out in paragraph 2.15 and in CRS Section VIII.C.17(g) of the CRS have been met, or if not, then explain any substitute requirements relied on and how they are substantially similar. 2.27 The CRS Commentaries also specifically contemplate that a participating jurisdiction has the option, in this regard, of defining certain types of dormant accounts as being excluded accounts. The CRS provides, as an example of a low risk excluded account, any dormant account with an annual balance that does not exceed US $1,000. 28 • Should New Zealand generally include a dormant account with a balance or value that does not exceed NZ $1,000 in the definition of excluded account? 28 See CRS Commentaries on Section VIII, page 190 (paragraph 103, example 6). 12 Determining what non-resident jurisdictions are within the scope of CRS and reporting – the potential application of the “wider approach” to CRS 2.28 A potential difficulty under the CRS is that the list of reportable jurisdictions (those with which CRS reciprocal exchange obligations have been established) will not remain static. It can be expected to change over time, for example, as addit ional jurisdictions commit to become participating jurisdictions under the CRS and enter into exchange arrangements with other participating jurisdictions. For New Zealand reporting financial institutions, any updates to the list of participating jurisdictions could result in increased compliance costs, for example, as a result of having to undertake CRS due diligence and reporting each time a jurisdiction becomes a reportable jurisdiction vis-à-vis New Zealand for CRS purposes. 2.29 In recognition of this, and with a view to minimising implementation and compliance costs, the CRS Commentaries and the Implementation Handbook recommend consideration of what is described as a “wider approach” to CRS due diligence and reporting as a legislative option, and further elaboration of how this might work is provided in Annex 5 to the CRS Publication. Under the wider approach a participating jurisdiction could decide to treat all foreign jurisdictions as being reportable jurisdictions, and all non-exempt non-residents (including controlling persons of passive NFEs) as being reportable persons. 2.30 If the wider approach is adopted in New Zealand, a New Zealand reporting financial institution would be able to carry out due diligence on all of its non- resident account holders (and controlling persons of passive NFEs) to determine if it has any reportable accounts and undocumented accounts. This will help ensure that such New Zealand reporting financial institutions would not need to re-undertake CRS due diligence procedures and reporting every time that the legislative list of participating jurisdictions changes. 2.31 This option appears to offer the greatest scope for compliance cost reduction, if permitted by domestic legislation. Consultation question • Should New Zealand adopt a “wider approach” to CRS due diligence and reporting, as stated in this paper? 13 14 CHAPTER 3 Phasing of implementation 3.1 The G20 views implementation of AEOI by jurisdictions on consistent timelines as critical to the success of the multilateral effort. As noted, if any relevant jurisdictions fail to meet the implementation timetable, the risk is that the tax evasion problem will simply relocate to that jurisdiction. Accordingly, the G20 has set a deadline for first exchanges of information by 30 September 2018 at the latest. This deadline applies to all OECD member countries, G20 member countries, and any other jurisdiction that has, or that operates as, an international finance centre. 3.2 Some countries (referred to as “early adopters”) are implementing even earlier, with first exchanges planned for 2017. However, the majorit y o f countries are working towards 30 September 2018 as their ultimate deadline. 3.3 In preliminary consultation in 2014, we received a number of submissions from financial institutions that indicated a strong preference for New Zealand not to implement earlier than Australia. 3.4 The Government decided on 15 February 2016 that New Zealand will implement AEOI on a timeline that would allow Inland Revenue to start exchanging information with other tax authorities by September 2018, in line with our international obligations under AEOI. Due diligence and reporting requirements for financial institutions will begin to apply from 1 July 2017, rather than from 1 January 2018 as earlier indicated. 3.5 This timeline parallels that announced by Australia at the end of last year, and included in the Tax Laws Amendment (Implementation of the Common Reporting Standard) Bill 2015, introduced on 3 December 2015. We also understand that it is also consistent with the approach Canada is taking to implementation timing. 3.6 Officials have considered transitional arrangements for financial institutions to help reduce the compliance costs of implementing AEOI as a 1 July timeline within the constraints imposed by the CRS and with a view to international scrutiny and peer review. Officials are seeking public views on these potential transitional measures. 3.7 To that end, we are proposing phased implementation, with the following indicative timeline showing deadlines for major milestones: 1 July 2017 • New Zealand reporting financial inst itutions commence applying due diligence procedures in respect of all non-exempt new accounts. (In broad terms, “new” accounts will be accounts opened on or after 1 July 2017.) 15 Early or mid-2018 29 • New Zealand reporting financial inst itutions complete due diligence reviews of all non-exempt High Value Pre-Existing Individual Accounts. 30 Mid-2018 • Reporting financial institutions complete their reporting to Inland Revenue in respect of reportable accounts and undocumented accounts identified in respect of the due diligence carried out in the period. 30 September 2018 • Tax administrations complete the exchange 31 of information in respect of information reported during 2018. Early or mid-2019 32 • New Zealand reporting financial institutions complete due diligence reviews of all non-exempt pre-existing entity accounts. • New Zealand reporting financial institutions complete due diligence reviews of all non-exempt low value pre-existing individual accounts. Mid-2019 • New Zealand reporting financial institutions complete reporting to Inland Revenue in respect of reportable accounts and undocumented accounts identified in respect of the due diligence carried out in the period. 30 September 2019 • Tax administrations complete the exchange of information in respect of information reported during 2019. 3.8 A key point to note is that under this approach, the initial focus is solely on completing due diligence reviews of high value pre-existing individual accounts and new accounts (opened in the first period). That is, the deadline for completing due diligence reviews of pre-existing entity accounts is the same as that for completing due diligence reviews of low-value pre-existing individual accounts. The due diligence reviews of entity accounts is expected to be more complex than due diligence of individual accounts. (Please note that these procedures and terms are elaborated on in the Appendix and Glossary to this issues paper.) 29 This is an indicative time-frame. The relevant dates for the timing of due diligence and reporting will be set out in the implementing legislation. 30 The CRS sets threshold options for determining whether an account is a high value or lower value account. The threshold options are canvassed in Chapter 5 of this issues paper and the distinction between high value and lower value accounts is elaborated on in the Appendix. 31 This is subject to the potential application of the “wider” approach which is canvassed in Chapter 2 of this issues paper. 32 This will depend on the timing for due diligence and reporting to be set out in the implementing legislation. 16 3.9 A second key point under the above approach is that the deadline for completing due diligence of high value pre-existing individual accounts is itself likely to be deferred. Under the G20 indicative timing, these reviews would need to be completed by 31 December 2017. However, given that the first deadline for reporting the information is mid-2018, officials are exploring the option of allowing until mid-2018 for the completion of the due diligence reviews. We expect that this would reduce compliance costs. Consultation question 3.10 We are also interested in other possible transitional arrangements for phasing in CRS obligations and welcome your views on options. • Although the 1 July 2017 start date cannot be changed, we welcome submissions on possible transitional arrangements or options for phasing in reporting obligations that could be considered. 17 18 CHAPTER 4 Compliance framework Addressing significant non-compliance of tax authorities 4.1 The Multilateral Convention and New Zealand’s bilateral tax treaties contain strict provisions that require information exchanged to be kept confidential and limit the persons to whom the information can be disclosed and the purposes for which the information may be used. As noted, it is ant icipated that AEOI exchanges will predominantly (if not exclusively) be carried out under the Multilateral Convention. 4.2 Importantly, a mechanism exists under the MCAA that enables participating jurisdictions to determine which Multilateral Convention signatories it will actually engage in AEOI exchanges with. In this regard, New Zealand proposes basing the majorit y o f its decisio ns on which jurisdictions it will exchange information with on the outcomes of the reviews on confidentialit y and data safeguards currently being undertaken by the Global Forum. (That is, if the Global Forum assesses a jurisdiction’s confidentiality frameworks and data safeguards as satisfactory, in the absence of other factors New Zealand will include that jurisdiction as an exchange partner.) 4.3 The MCAA mechanism will also enable Inland Revenue to suspend the exchange of information with another participating jurisdiction’s tax authority if it determines that there have been breaches in in respect of matters such as: • substantial non-compliance with the information confidentiality and data safeguard provisions; • a material failure to provide timely or adequate information; or • narrowing the scope of entities or accounts covered by the CRS to such an extent the purposes of the CRS are frustrated. 4.4 Similarly, another participating jurisdiction’s tax authority would be able to suspend the exchange of information with Inland Revenue if it determined that there was significant non-compliance by New Zealand. Consultation question • We welcome any submissions on whether conducting AEOI exchanges under the Multilateral Convention in the manner outlined above raises any concerns. 19 Implementing domestic legislation 4.5 Under the CRS, a jurisdiction must have rules in place to ensure the effective implementation of, and compliance with, the reporting and due diligence procedures as set out in the CRS. 33 4.6 Such CRS domestic compliance rules include: • anti-avoidance rules designed to prevent financial inst itutions, persons, or intermediaries, from adopting practices intended to circumvent the CRS reporting and due diligence procedures; • record keeping rules requiring reporting financial inst itutions to keep CRS related records of relevant due diligence and reporting steps undertaken, including any evidence relied upon for the performance of the procedures and adequate measures used to obtain those records; and • effective enforcement provisions to address non-compliance. A critical element of compliance, in this regard, will be ensuring that rules are in place requiring that self-certifications are always obtained where required by the CRS. 34 4.7 Legislation will therefore be required to ensure that reporting financial inst itutions undertake their CRS due diligence and reporting obligations. Consultation questions 4.8 Submissions regarding how such compliance issues can best be addressed in legislation are invited. In particular, we would appreciate your views regarding: • What anti-avoidance rules should apply to prevent New Zealand reporting financial institutions, persons, or intermediaries, from adopting practices intended to circumvent the CRS reporting and due diligence procedures? • If the main CRS compliance rules were incorporated into current Part 11B (Foreign account information-sharing agreements) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, is current section 22(2)(lc) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 sufficient to ensure CRS record keeping by relevant “persons”? 35 • Should CRS related records be required to be retained for the current 7- year statutory period that relates to tax-related records? • What penalties and procedures (including timeframes and procedures for providing corrected information) should apply when a New Zealand reporting financial institution has not complied with its due diligence and reporting obligations? 33 CRS Section IX. 34 The CRS states, in this regard, that it is expected that jurisdictions have strong measures in place to ensure that valid self-certifications are always obtained for new accounts. 35 Section 22(2)(1c) of the TAA, which currently relates to FATCA record keeping, requires every person to keep sufficient records regarding their compliance with Part 11B of the TAA. 20 • Should an account holder be required to keep the New Zealand reporting financial institution (that maintains the account) informed on a timely basis about material changes in circumstances regarding the account? • What rules should be in place to ensure that self-certifications are always obtained in the circumstances where the CRS requires such certifications? • What are the ways that the CRS requirements regarding due diligence and reporting compliance can be implemented in New Zealand in a way that minimises compliance costs for reporting financial institutions and account ho lders? 21 22 CHAPTER 5 Other legislative issues or options Part A – Consultation questions and submissions on other legislative issues 5.1 In addition to the legislative issues previously covered in this paper, the CRS provides a number of options for participating jurisdictions to consider whether to incorporate into their domestic laws. 36 These options relate to CRS due diligence and reporting and can be placed into two categories: • Where the participating jurisdiction has an option to decide on a particular point that will apply to all reporting financial institutions (for example, whether to require place of birth information 37 for reportable accounts); and • Where the participating jurisdiction has the option of permitting reporting financial institutions to adopt an alternative CRS due diligence procedure at the institution’s discretion (for example, whether a reporting financial institution should have the option being able to use third party service providers to fulfil their due diligence and reporting obligations). As a general rule, we intend to adopt the approach of allowing reporting financial institutions to adopt such “discretionary” options as a way of managing compliance costs. 5.2 Part A of this chapter outlines various consultation questions related to these options, which we would appreciate your submissions on. For more information on each of the questions, please refer to Part B of this chapter. Consultation questions Defining the CRS “reporting period” 5.3 Currently US FATCA reporting in New Zealand is based on an annual “tax year” reporting period, that is year ending 31 March. Should annual CRS reporting also be based on “tax year”, or some other reporting period basis (for example, “calendar year”, “fiscal year”, etc)? Nil returns 5.4 Should New Zealand Reporting Financial institutions be able to file “nil returns” with Inland Revenue? (That is, when they have no reportable accounts or undocumented accounts to report for CRS purposes)? 36 Some of these options come from the CRS itself, while others come from the CRS Commentaries. 37 This is a type of “Reportable Account Information”, which is referred to in the Glossary. 23 Whether certain CRS terms need to be defined 5.5 Certain terms in the CRS are not defined (for example, “passive income”, “maintaining” a financial account, etc). Are there any CRS terms that need to be defined in domestic law? Currency translation rules 5.6 To reduce compliance costs, should our domestic law allow New Zealand reporting financial institutions to simply choose to treat all dollar amounts in the CRS as being in New Zealand dollars? Pre-existing accounts – Tax Identification Numbers (TINs) and date of birth 5.7 Should there be a requirement 38 under domestic law for New Zealand reporting financial inst itutions to obtain and report TINs and “date of birth” for pre-existing reportable accounts (beyond merely making reasonable efforts to obtain that information in the way referred to in the CRS)? “Place of birth” of individuals 5.8 Should there be a legislative requirement for New Zealand reporting financial institutions to obtain and report “place of birth” information for reportable accounts of individuals where such information is available in the electronically searchable data that they maintain? Reporting average monthly balances or values 5.9 Should reporting of average monthly balances or values of reportable accounts be a legislative requirement in New Zealand? Certain trades facilitated by brokers 5.10 Are any legislative provisions required so that exchange traded New Zealand reporting financial institutions are able to comply with their due diligence and reporting obligations under CRS where trades are facilitated by brokers? Service providers 5.11 Should New Zealand reporting financial institutions be able to use third party service providers to fulfil their due diligence and reporting obligations? New Zealand resident controlling persons as “reportable persons” 5.12 Should New Zealand resident controlling persons of passive NFEs be treated as reportable persons for domestic CRS purposes? Pre-existing entity accounts – using standard industry coding systems 5.13 Should New Zealand reporting financial institutions be able, with respect to pre-existing entity accounts, to use as documentary evidence for the purposes 38 Any such requirement to obtain and report a TIN would be subject to CRS Section I.D. 24 of CRS due diligence, any classification in their records with respect to the account holder that was determined based on a standard industry coding system (provided that the conditions set out in the CRS Commentaries are met)? Using the “residence address” test for lower value pre-existing individual accounts 5.14 Should New Zealand reporting financial institutions be able to use the “residence address” test (including the change in circumstance procedures) for lower value pre-existing individual accounts to identify the tax residence of the account holder (as an alternative to the “electronic records” test)? “Related entity” definition and related managed investment funds 5.15 Should an expanded definition of “related entity” be introduced into domestic law for the purposes of CRS due diligence to include related managed investment funds? Pre-existing entity accounts’ threshold 5.16 Should New Zealand reporting financial institutions have the option of excluding from due diligence procedures pre-existing entit y accounts with an aggregate account balance or value of US $250,000 or less as at the relevant CRS date? Alternative due diligence procedures 5.17 Should New Zealand reporting financial institutions be able to apply the due diligence procedures for new accounts to pre-existing accounts, and to apply the due diligence procedures for high value pre-existing individual accounts to lower value pre-existing individual accounts? New accounts opened by pre-existing customers 5.18 Should the CRS definition of “pre-existing account” be expanded to include an additional account opened by a pre-existing customer (in the circumstances set out in the CRS Commentaries)? Group cash value insurance contracts or annuity contracts 5.19 Should New Zealand reporting financial institutions be able to treat a group cash value insurance contract or annuity contract that is issued to an employer and individual employees as a financial account that is not a reportable account until the date on which an amount is payable to an employee or certificate holder or beneficiary? Custodial accounts – reporting of “gross proceeds” 5.20 Should there be a phased implementation of the reporting of “gross proceeds” of custodial reportable accounts? 25 Trust beneficiaries as controlling persons of passive NFEs 5.21 Should New Zealand reporting financial institutions be allowed to align the scope of the beneficiaries of a trust treated as controlling persons of the trust with the scope of the beneficiaries of a trust treated as reportable persons of a trust that is a financial institution? Grandparenting rule for certain bearer shares for regulated collective investment vehicles 5.22 What are the dates that should be used in the grandparenting rule for certain bearer shares (set out in CRS VIII.B(9)) regarding the non-issuing of bearer shares and ensuring that such shares are redeemed or immobilised? Part B – Background context to the consultation questions Defining the CRS “reporting period” 5.23 The information that reporting financial institutions need to report annually under the CRS must be as of the end of the relevant calendar year, or other “appropriate reporting period”, depending on the meaning of that the term under each participating jurisdiction’s reporting rules (for example, alternatives include: tax year, fiscal year, etc). 39 Nil returns 5.24 The CRS leaves it optional whether a participating jurisdiction allows a reporting financial institution to file nil returns (when the financial inst itutio n has no reportable accounts or undocumented accounts to report for CRS purposes). 40 Whether certain CRS terms need to be defined 5.25 A number of CRS terms are not defined in the CRS and may need to be defined under our domestic law. 41 Such terms include: • debt interest; • gross inco me; • maintaining an account; • passive income; and • policyholder dividend. 39 CRS Section 1.A(4)-(7), and CRS Commentaries pp.99-100. 40 CRS Commentaries p.184. 41 Implementation Handbook pp.17-18 and 40-41. 26 Currency translation rules 5.26 The CRS states that all dollar amounts to be reported are in US dollars and shall be read to include equivalent amounts in other currencies, as determined by domestic law. 42 5.27 We are interested in your submissions regarding whether reporting financial inst itutions should be able to simply apply the dollar amounts specified in the CRS in New Zealand dollars (rather than US – as referred to in the CRS). This would reduce compliance costs, in the sense that reporting financial inst itutions would not need to undertake currency conversion procedures to determine the value of financial accounts in US. 5.28 For example, a pre-existing individual account will be a high value account 43 if its balance exceeds US $1,000,000 as at the relevant date 44 or, if a reporting financial institution chooses to apply the threshold in New Zealand dollar terms (to the extent permitted by domestic law), if the account exceeds NZ $1,000,000 as at that date. Pre-existing accounts – TINs and date of birth 5.29 The CRS provides that with respect to each reportable account maintained by a reporting financial institution that is a pre-existing account, the TIN(s) and date of birth are not required to be reported 45 if such TIN(s) and date of birth are not in the records of the reporting financial institution, and are not otherwise required to be collected under domestic law. This is subject to the reporting financial institution making reasonable efforts to obtain such information by the end of the second year following the year in which such accounts are identified as reportable accounts. 46 5.30 Thus, TIN(s) and date of birth information would be required to be obtained and reported (beyond merely making such reasonable efforts to obtain such information) if, with respect to a pre-existing account, such information is required to be collected under domestic law. “Place of birth” of individuals 5.31 The CRS provides that the place of birth of an individual is not required to be reported with respect to a reportable account unless the reporting financial institution is otherwise required to obtain and report it under domestic law and it is available in the electronically searchable data maintained by the reporting financial inst itution. 47 5.32 Thus, place of birth information would be required to be reported with respect to a reportable account if the reporting financial institution is required to obtain and report it under domestic law and it is available in the 42 CRS Section VII.C.4. 43 High value accounts are explained in more detail in the Appendix. 44 The “relevant date” will be defined in the domestic legislation implementing CRS. 45 In contrast, TIN and date of birth information will generally be required to be reported for new reportable accounts, subject to CRS Section I.D. 46 CRS Section I.C, and CRS Commentaries pp.102-104. 47 CRS Section I.E, CRS Commentaries p.104. 27 electronically searchable data maintained by the reporting financial inst itution. Reporting average monthly balances or values 5.33 The CRS provides that a reporting financial institution that maintains a reportable account must report the balance or value of the account as at the end of the calendar year (or other appropriate reporting period) or, if the account was closed during the reporting period, the reporting financial institution must report the fact that the account was closed. 5.34 However, the CRS Commentaries also provide scope for a participating jurisdiction to require the reporting of average balance or average value instead of the reporting of the account balance or value as at the end of the calendar year (or other reporting period). 48 5.35 This option is directed at those participating jurisdictions that already require reporting financial institutions to report the average balance or value for US FATCA purposes instead of the reporting of the account balance or value as at the end of the calendar year or other reporting period. 5.36 New Zealand does not require reporting financial institutions to report the average balance or value for US FATCA purposes. Therefore, we do not intend to require a similar reporting of average balance or value for CRS purposes. Certain trades facilitated by brokers 5.37 Reporting financial institutions are obliged to carry out due diligence on their non-exempt accounts to identify and report reportable accounts and undocumented accounts. This extends to cover exchange traded funds that are reporting financial institutions and whose trades are facilitated by brokers. The CRS Commentaries acknowledge that this could pose difficulties where the broker may have due diligence information, but it is the reporting financial institution fund that has the CRS due diligence and reporting obligations. The Commentaries set out as an option that participating jurisdictions may address such a case, for example, by requiring the brokers to provide all the necessary information to the fund, so that it may fulfil its reporting obligations. 49 Service providers 5.38 The CRS provides that each participating jurisdiction may allow reporting financial institutions to use third-party service providers to fulfil their due diligence and reporting obligations. The reporting financial institution would remain responsible for fulfilling these requirements and the actions of the service provider would be imputed to the reporting financial inst itution. 50 48 CRS Commentaries p.98, paragraph 11. 49 This is mentioned on p.177 of the CRS Commentaries (paragraph 65). 50 CRS Section II.D, and CRS Commentaries p.108. 28 New Zealand resident controlling persons as “reportable persons” 5.39 Although not required by the CRS, it states that some participating jurisdictions may want to extend their due diligence procedures to cover their own residents that are controlling persons of passive NFEs. 51 5.40 This may be done by broadening the scope of the definition of the term “reportable person”. For example, this would (if implemented in New Zealand) require a New Zealand reporting financial institution that maintains an account held by a passive NFE to report to Inland Revenue any New Zealand controlling persons, in addition to other controlling persons from reportable jurisdict ions of the passive NFE. 52 Pre-existing entity accounts – using standard industry coding systems 5.41 A participating jurisdiction may, with respect to pre-existing entity accounts, allow reporting financial institutions to use as documentary evidence for the purposes of CRS due diligence, any classification in their records with respect to the account holder that was determined based on a standard industry coding system (provided that certain conditions are met, as set out in the CRS Commentaries). 53 Using the “residence address” test for lower value pre-existing individual accounts 5.42 The CRS provides that a participating jurisdiction may give reporting financial institutions the option to use a residence address test for Lower value pre-existing individual accounts (as an alternative to the electronic records test) to identify the tax residence of the account holder, including using an “in care of” address or post office box for the same purposes, in certain special defined circumstances. A participating jurisdiction is also able to apply the “change in circumstances” procedures to the residence address test. 54 This is explained in detail in the Appendix. “Related entity” definition and managed investment funds 5.43 This option relates to the ability of a participating jurisdiction to adopt an expanded definition of “related entity” to cover managed investment funds for the purposes of CRS due diligence. 5.44 “Related entities” are generally defined in the CRS as one entity that controls another entity, or two or more entities that are under common control. 5.45 As provided in the CRS Commentaries, most investment entity funds may not qualify as a related entity of another fund, and thus, will not be able to apply the rules for treating certain new accounts opened by pre-existing customers (referred to below) as being pre-existing accounts, or to apply the account aggregation rules to financial accounts maintained by related ent it ies. (These types of accounts and procedures are expanded upon in the Appendix and Glossary). 51 CRS Section VIII.D(1),(6) and (8), CRS Annex 5 pp.285-286, and Implementation Handbook p.94. 52 The passive NFE itself would also be reportable if it is a reportable person. 53 CRS Commentaries pp.203-204, and Implementation Handbook p.15. 54 CRS Section III.B(1), CRS Commentaries pp.111-112, and Implementation Handbook pp.13 and 17. 29 5.46 However, the CRS provides that a participat ing jurisdict ion may choose to adopt an expanded definition of “related entity” that also covers two managed investment entities that are under common management where such management fulfils the due diligence obligations of such entities. 5.47 If such an expanded definition of “related entity” is used, this will allo w managed funds to benefit from the CRS due diligence procedures that leverage off the “related entity” test, such as the ability to treat certain new accounts opened by pre-existing customers (referred to below) as being pre- existing accounts, or to apply the account aggregation rules to financial accounts maintained by related ent it ies. 55 Pre-existing entity accounts’ threshold 5.48 The CRS provides that a participating jurisdiction may give reporting financial institutions the option of excluding from due diligence and reporting a pre-existing entity account that they maintain has an aggregate balance or value of US $250,000 or less at the relevant CRS date. 56 5.49 If, at the end of a subsequent reporting period, the aggregate account balance or value of the pre-existing entity account exceeds US $250,000, then the reporting financial institution would need to apply the due diligence procedures to identify whether the account is a reportable account. 5.50 This threshold recognises compliance costs associated with reviewing pre- existing entity accounts. Alternative due diligence procedures 5.51 Each participating jurisdiction may allow reporting financial institutions the option to apply the due diligence procedures for new accounts to pre-existing accounts in defined circumstances. This means, for example, if this option is allowed, a reporting financial inst itution would be able to elect to obtain a self-certification for all pre-existing individual accounts consistent with the due diligence procedures for new individual accounts, which are explained in the Appendix. Note however, that existing CRS rules otherwise applicable to pre-existing accounts would continue to apply. 5.52 A participating jurisdiction may also allow a reporting financial institution to apply the due diligence procedures for high value pre-existing individual accounts to lower value pre-existing individual accounts in defined circumstances. 57 These types of accounts are explained in detail in the Appendix. 55 CRS Section VIII.E(4), CRS Commentaries p.183, and Implementation Handbook pp.16 and 94. 56 CRS Section V.A, CRS Commentaries p.135, and Implementation Handbook p.14. The relevant date will be set out in implementing legislation. 57 CRS Section II.E, CRS Commentaries pp.108-109, and Implementation Handbook p.95. 30 New accounts opened by pre-existing customers 5.53 For CRS purposes, a “financial account” is classified depending on the date of opening, and in terms of when the CRS is implemented in a participating jurisdiction. Thus, a financial account can be either a “pre-existing account” (broadly, an account opened prior to the implementation of CRS in New Zealand – an account open as of 30 June 2017 based on the indicative time- frame), or a “new account” (broadly, an account opened on or after the implementation of CRS in New Zealand 1 July 2017). 5.54 However, when implementing the CRS, the CRS provides that participating jurisdictions are free to modify the term “pre-existing account” in order to include certain new accounts of pre-existing customers in defined circumstances. 58 5.55 This would involve expanding the definition of “pre-existing account” to simplify the process when a reporting financial institution (or a related entity within the same participating jurisdiction) has a pre-existing customer and that customer opens a new account, whereby such account would be able to be treated as a pre-existing account in defined circumstances. Group cash value insurance contracts or annuity contracts 5.56 With respect to a group cash value insurance contract or annuity contract that is issued to an employer and individual employees, a participating jurisdiction may allow a reporting financial institution to treat such a contract as a financial account that is not a reportable account until the date on which an amount is payable to an employee or certificate holder or beneficiary provided that certain conditions are met. 59 Custodial accounts – reporting of “gross proceeds” 5.57 Under the CRS, a participating jurisdiction may provide for the gradual introduction of reporting of “gross proceeds” of custodial reportable accounts to commence in a later reporting period. 60 5.58 This recognises that it may be more difficult for reporting financial inst itutions to implement procedures to obtain the total gross proceeds from the sale or redemption of property for reportable accounts that they maintain. Trust beneficiaries as controlling persons of passive NFEs 5.59 With trusts that are passive NFEs, a participating jurisdiction may allow reporting financial institutions, that maintain financial accounts held by such trusts, to align the scope of the beneficiary(ies) of the trust treated as controlling person(s) of the trust, with the scope of the beneficiary(ies) of a trust treated as reportable persons of a trust that is a financial inst itution (that is, aligning with those beneficiaries that would have an “equity interest” in the trust if the trust was a financial inst itution). 58 CRS Section VIII.C(9) and (10), and CRS Commentaries pp.181-182. 59 CRS Section VII.B, CRS Commentaries p.153, and Implementation Handbook p.14. 60 CRS Section I.A(5)(b), I.F and VIII.C.3, and CRS Commentaries pp.73, 100-101 and 105. 31 5.60 In such a case, if allowed, the New Zealand reporting financial institution would only need to report a discretionary beneficiary in a period in which the person receives a distribution from the trust, provided that the New Zealand reporting financial institution has in place appropriate safeguards and procedures to identify whether distribution have been made by its trust account holders in a given period. 61 Grandparenting rule for certain bearer shares of collective investment vehicles 5.61 The CRS provides that a regulated collective investment vehicle (CIV) that has issued physical shares in bearer form will not fail to qualify as an exempt CIV provided that the CIV: 62 • has not issued and does not issue any physical shares in bearer form after the date provided by the participating jurisdiction; • retires all such shares upon surrender; • performs the due diligence procedures and reports (if required) with respect to such shares when presented for redemption or payment; and • has in place policies and procedures to ensure the shares are redeemed or immobilised as soon as possible and in any event prior to the date provided by the participating jurisdiction. 61 CRS Section VIII.C(4) and VIII.D(6), CRS Commentaries pp.178 and 198-199, and Implementation Handbook p.17. 62 CRS Section VIII.B(9), CRS Commentaries pp.173-174, and Implementation Handbook p.16. 32 APPENDIX Summary of CRS Due Diligence Procedures that New Zealand reporting financial institutions will need to carry out on non-exempt financial accounts that they maintain (based on the indicative implementation time-line) New Zealand reporting financial institutions need to carry out CRS due diligence on their non-exempt accounts to identify whether the accounts are either reportable accounts or undocumented accounts. These procedures vary depending on whether the account is a pre-existing account or a new account and whether the account is held by an individual or an entity. In broad terms, a pre-existing account will be an account opened immediately before the date of implementation of the CRS (30 June 2017) and a new account will be an account opened on or after the date of implementation of the CRS (1 July 2017). These procedures are summarised briefly below. (These procedures are subject to the resolution of a number of the consultation points set out in this paper – for example, the optional threshold exemption from due diligence for pre-existing entity accounts with a balance or value of US $250,000 or less and should be read in this context). Individual accounts Pre-existing individual accounts (accounts maintained as of 30 June 2017) A New Zealand reporting financial institution will need to carry out CRS due diligence on non-exempt pre-existing individual accounts that they maintain to determine whether those accounts are held by reportable persons, and, therefore, are reportable accounts (or whether the accounts are undocumented accounts). There are two types of pre-existing individual accounts (lower value accounts and high value accounts) that are subject to different due diligence procedures. Lower value accounts are pre-existing individual accounts with an aggregate balance or value that does not exceed US $1,000,000 at a date to be set out in implementing legislation. High value accounts are pre-existing individual accounts with an aggregate balance or value that exceeds US $1,000,000 at dates to be set in implementing legislation. In broad terms, these due diligence procedures will involve the New Zealand reporting financial institution applying various procedures to its financial accounts to search for defined indicia (for example, one such indicia is a current mailing or residence address in a reportable jurisdiction) that the account holder is tax resident in a reportable jurisdiction and is a reportable person. This indicia if found (including if there is a subsequent change of circumstances that results in any indicia being associated with the account) will lead to a presumption that the Individual is tax resident in each reportable jurisdiction for which an indicium is identified and is a reportable person with the account being a reportable account with respect to each reportable jurisdiction (unless this presumption is “cured” through a combination of self-certifications and documentary evidence, which applies in certain defined circumstances). These due diligence procedures are generally more extensive for hig h value accounts (as set out below) and such accounts are also subject to a special provision which applies to accounts that are assigned to a relationship manager. 33 Lower value accounts For lower value accounts there is scope for a participating jurisdiction to allow reporting financial institutions to apply a residence address test (in certain defined circumstances) as one such type of indicia to determine whether an account ho lder is tax resident in a reportable jurisdiction and is a reportable person. For example, if this approach is permitted, the New Zealand reporting financial institution would be able to review its records for a current residence address for the individual account holder based on documentary evidence and treat the individual account holder as being a resident for tax purposes of the jurisdiction in which the address is located for the purposes of determining whether they are a reportable person. If the reporting financial institution does not rely on a current residence address in this way, they will need to review electronically searchable data that they maintain for various indicia that the account holder is tax resident in a reportable jurisdiction and is a reportable person (for example, one such indicia is a current mailing or residence address in a reportable jurisdiction). This indicia (if found) will lead to a presumption that the individual is tax resident in each reportable jurisdiction for which an indicium is identified and is a reportable person with the account being a reportable account with respect to each reportable jurisdiction (unless this presumption is “cured” through a combination of self- certifications and documentary evidence to the contrary, which applies in certain defined circumstances). The New Zealand reporting financial institution will need to report such reportable accounts. If a “hold mail” instruction or “care of” address is discovered in the electronic search and no other defined indicia are identified for the account holder, the New Zealand reporting financial inst itution will need to apply various defined procedures to establish the account ho lder’s residence for tax purposes. If the New Zealand reporting financial institution is unable to do this they will need to report the account as an undocumented account. High value accounts For high value accounts the New Zealand reporting financial institution will need to review electronically searchable data that they maintain for various indicia that the account holder is tax resident in a reportable jurisdiction and is a reportable person (for example, one such indicia is a current mailing or residence address in a reportable jurisdiction). A paper-based search of further defined documents associated with the account is also required in certain circumstances. This indicia (if found) will lead to a presumption that the individual is tax resident in each reportable jurisdiction for which an indicium is identified and is a reportable person with the account being a reportable account with respect to each reportable jurisdiction (unless this presumption is “cured” through a combination of self- certifications and documentary evidence to the contrary). The New Zealand reporting financial institution will need to report such reportable accounts. 34 If a “hold mail” instruction or “in care of” address is discovered in the electronic search and no other defined indicia are identified for the account holder, the New Zealand reporting financial inst itution will need to apply various defined procedures to establish the account ho lder’s residence for tax purposes. If the New Zealand reporting financial institution is unable to do this they will need to report the account as an undocumented account. In addition to the electronic and paper record searches described above, the New Zealand reporting financial inst itution will also need to treat as a reportable account any high value account assigned to a relationship manager (including any financial accounts aggregated with that high value account) if the relationship manager has actual knowledge that the account holder is a reportable person. New individual accounts (accounts opened on or after 1 July 2017) A New Zealand reporting financial institution will also need to carry out CRS due diligence on non-exempt new individual accounts that they maintain to determine whether those accounts are held by reportable persons. New individual accounts will require self-certification upon account being opened in the account holder’s jurisdiction of residence for tax purposes and confirmation by the New Zealand reporting financial institution of the reasonableness of this self- certification based on the information that they have obtained in connection with the opening of the account, including any documentation collected pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures. (A New Zealand reporting financial inst itution will also be required to obtain a further self-certification if there is a change in circumstances that causes them to know or have reason to know that the original self-certification is incorrect or unreliable.) If the self-certification establishes that the account holder is resident for tax purposes in a reportable jurisdiction, the reporting financial institution will need to treat the account as a reportable account and report the account. Entity accounts Pre-existing entity accounts (accounts maintained as of 30 June 2017) A New Zealand reporting financial institution will also need to carry out CRS due diligence on non-exempt pre-existing ent ity accounts that they maintain to determine whether those accounts are held by reportable persons and/or are held by passive NFEs that have one or more controlling persons that are reportable persons. If an account is identified as being held and/or having one or more controlling persons that are reportable persons (in this way) the account will be a reportable account and will need to be reported. (There is scope for a participating jurisdiction to exempt from this review/reporting pre-existing accounts that have a balance or value that does not exceed US $250,000 at defined dates set out in legislation). These procedures will generally involve the New Zealand reporting financial inst itution reviewing information that they already have (and sometimes obtaining self-certifications) to determine whether the account is a reportable account. 35 New entity accounts (accounts maintained as of 1 July 2017) A New Zealand reporting financial inst itution will also need to carry out CRS due diligence on non-exempt new entit y accounts that they maintain to determine whether those accounts are held by reportable persons and/or are held by passive NFEs that have one or more controlling persons that are reportable persons. If an account is identified as being held and/or having one or more controlling persons that are reportable persons (in this way) the account will be a reportable account. These procedures will generally involve the New Zealand reporting financial institution obtaining a self-certification from the account holder (or controlling person, in the case of a passive NFE) of their tax residence, albeit that there is scope for the reporting financial institution to sometimes reasonably determine the status of the account based on information in their possession or that is publicly available in defined circumstances. 36 GLOSSARY Compliance Reporting Standard terms Account holder The “person” (individual or entity) listed or identified as the holder of a financial account by the reporting financial institution that maintains the account. There is also a look-through rule that applies where a person (other than a financial institution) holds a financial account for another person as agent or nominee (or similar), where that other person is treated as the account holder. AEOI “Automatic Exchange of Information”: refers to the automatic exchange of information between tax authorities. Aggregation rules For purposes of determining the aggregate balance or value of financial accounts held an individual or entity, a reporting financial institution is required to aggregate all financial accounts that it (or a related entity) maintains on that individual or entity, but only to the extent that its computerised systems link the financial accounts by reference to a common data element such as client number or TIN, that allows account balances or values to be aggregated. Special aggregation rules also apply to jointly held financial accounts, and to pre-existing individual high value accounts with relationship managers. AML/KYC “Anti-Money Laundering / Know Your Client” procedures means the customer due diligence procedures of a reporting financial institution per the anti-money laundering or similar requirements. Information exchanged in the CRS often leverages off information obtained under such procedures. Controlling person Usually refers to controlling persons of passive NFEs, being a natural person who exercises control over an entity that is a legal person (for example, company) or a legal arrangement (for example, trust). Where no natural person(s) is identified as exercising control, the controlling person(s) of the entity are the natural person(s) who hold the position of senior managing official. For a trust, this means: any settlor(s), trustee(s), protector(s), beneficiary(ies) or class(es) of beneficiaries, and any other natural person(s) exercising ultimate effective control over the trust. Such persons must always be treated as controlling persons of a trust, regardless of who exercises actual control over the trust. Commissioner The Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Competent authority In the context of international tax treaties and AEOI, the Competent Authority is usually the head (or delegate) of the tax authority of the relevant contracting state. The Competent Authority in New Zealand is the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (or his or her delegate). CRS The Common Standard on Reporting, Due Diligence and Exchange of Information on Financial Account Information (in short, the Common Reporting Standard) that forms part of the global standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters. CRS Commentaries OECD’s Commentaries on the CRS. 37 CRS schema OECD’s approved XML schema for CRS electronic exchange of information. Custodial institution Any entity that holds, as a substantial portion of its business (generally 20% or more of its annual gross income), financial assets of others. Depository institution Any entity that accepts deposits in the ordinary course of a banking or similar business. Documentary evidence Documentary evidence for CRS includes: • a certificate of residence issued by an authorised government body of the jurisdiction in which the payee claims to be a resident; • for individuals, any valid identification issued by an authorised government body that includes the individual’s name and is typically used for identification purposes; • for entities, any official documentation issued by an authorised government body that includes the name of the entity and either the address of its principal office in the jurisdiction in which it claims to be a resident or the jurisdiction in which the entity was incorporated or organised; and • any audited financial statement, third-party credit report, bankruptcy filing, or securities regulator’s report. Due diligence Processes and procedures required for reporting financial institutions to identify reportable accounts and undocumented accounts. This involves determining tax residence (generally based on indicia, account information, or self-certifications, depending on the type of account) of account holders and controlling persons (in the context of passive NFEs) and collecting reportable account information about reportable accounts. Entity Includes a “legal person” (for example, company,) or a “legal arrangement” (for example, trust). Does not include an individual. Excluded accounts Financial accounts that are not subject to due diligence or reporting under the CRS. Usually this is because the type of financial account presents a low risk of being used to evade tax and comes within a defined category of excluded account. FATCA Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act: United States law for global automatic exchange of information with the United States. Financial account An account maintained by a reporting financial institution and includes certain: depository accounts; custodial accounts; equity and debt interests; cash value insurance contracts; and annuity contracts. Financial asset Includes financial securities (for example, shares and other equity interests; notes, bonds, debentures, and other debt interests; partnership interests, commodities, swaps, insurance contracts, annuity contracts, or any other interest (including a futures or forward contract or option) in a security, partnership interest, commodity, swap, insurance contract, or annuity contract. The term does not include a non-debt, direct interest in real property. Financial institution (FI) The definition includes: a “Depository Institution”; a “Custodial Institution”; an “Investment Entity”; or a “Specified Insurance Company”. Apart from the more obvious entities, such as banks, this definition includes other financial institutions such as certain brokers, custodians, collective investment vehicles, managed entities, and insurance companies. 38 GIIN The Global Intermediary Identification Number is the US FATCA registration and reporting number issued by the United States’ Internal Revenue Service to foreign financial institutions. IGA An Inter-Governmental Agreement between a jurisdiction and the United States for US FATCA reporting purposes. Implementation Handbook OECD Implementation Handbook. Indicia Defined indications that an individual or entity may be tax resident in another jurisdiction (for example, physical or mailing address, phone numbers, standing instructions, etc relating to that jurisdiction). Individual A natural person. Investment entity Any entity that primarily conducts a business of specified investment activities for customers or is managed by a certain type of financial institution and derives income primarily from investing, reinvesting, or trading in financial assets (and is not a type of active NFE that is specifically excluded from the definition of investment entity). MCAA Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement. Multilateral Convention Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters. Natural person A natural person (that is, an individual, as opposed to an entity). New accounts Includes new financial accounts opened on or after the date of implementation of the CRS. NFE A non-financial entity: generally covers any entity other than a financial institution. NFEs are classified as “active” or “passive”. Passive NFEs (and any of their controlling persons who are reportable persons) are the only NFEs that are subject to CRS reporting. Non-reporting financial institution A financial institution that is not required to carry out due diligence on its financial accounts nor report for CRS purposes. This is usually because the type of financial institution presents a low risk of being used to evade tax and comes within a category of non-reporting financial institution. OECD Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Participating jurisdiction A jurisdiction with which an agreement is in place with another jurisdiction by which they will exchange CRS information and which is identified in a published list. Passive income Passive income generally includes non-trading investment income in the form of: interest or equivalents, dividends, annuities, other financial arrangements’ income, and rents and royalties. This term may be modified by domestic law. Passive NFE A NFE is generally treated as “passive” if, in the preceding reporting period, 50% or more of its gross income is passive income, or 50% or more of its financial assets held produce passive income. A passive NFE also includes certain investment entities that are not participating jurisdiction financial institutions. Note, certain entities (for example, registered charities) are treated as active NFEs irrespective of whether they derive predominantly passive income from passive assets. 39 Related entity An entity is a “related entity” of another entity if either controls the other, or the entities are under common control. “Control” includes direct or indirect ownership of more than 50% of the voting and value in an entity. There is scope for participating jurisdictions to adopt an expanded definition of “related entity”. Reportable account Certain financial accounts held or controlled by non-resident persons that are resident in a reportable jurisdiction, including those held by a reportable person (individual or entity); and those held by a passive NFE with one or more controlling persons that is a reportable person. Reportable account information Information which reporting financial institutions are generally required to report with respect to each reportable account which comprises of personal data (for example, name, address, residence, TIN, etc) and financial data (for example, interest or dividend income and balances, values of certain insurance products, sales proceeds fr om financial assets, etc). Reporting financial institution Generally any Financial Institution that is not a non-reporting financial institution, and is therefore required to carry out due diligence on its non- exempt financial accounts and report under th e CRS if it has any reportable accounts or undocumented accounts. Reportable jurisdiction An overseas jurisdiction that has an agreement with New Zealand to exchange CRS information and is identified in a published list. There is also scope for a participating jurisdiction to treat any non- resident jurisdiction as being a “reportable jurisdiction”. This is known as the “wider approach” to CRS, which is one of the issues consulted upon in this issues paper. Reportable person Is a reportable jurisdiction person other than: a company the shares of which are regularly traded on an established securities market (including any related company); a governmental entity; an international organisation; a central bank; or a financial institution. There is also scope for a participating jurisdiction to treat a controlling person of a passive NFE account holder that is resident in that Jurisdiction as also being a “reportable person”, which is also one of the issues consulted upon in this issues paper. Reportable jurisdiction person Generally an individual or entity that is resident in a reportable jurisdiction under the tax laws of such Jurisdiction, or an estate of a decedent that was resident of a reportable jurisdiction. An exception is an entity such as a partnership, limited liability partnership or similar legal arrangement that has no residence for tax purposes which shall be treated as resident in the jurisdiction in which its place of effective management is situated. Self-certification A reporting financial institution requesting an account holder (and in certain circumstances a controlling person) to certify their identity and tax residency and obtaining such a certification. Specified insurance company Any entity that is an insurance company (or the holding company of one) that issues, or is obligated to make payments with respect to, a cash value insurance contract or an annuity contract. TAA Tax Administration Act 1994. Tax residency This is based on where an individual or entity is tax resident under the law of a jurisdiction. 40 TIN “Taxpayer Identification Number” (or functional equivalent in the absence of a TIN). A TIN is assigned and used by a jurisdiction to identify an individual or an entity. Undocumented account Undocumented accounts generally arise when a reporting financial institution is unable to obtain information from an account holder regarding pre-existing accounts. This can result from inadequate procedures implemented by a reporting Financial Institution to obtain the necessary information, or from non-compliance by the account holder. 41

Inland Revenue is now seeking feedback to assist with advising the Government on the implementation of this package. This issues paper discusses the technical detail of the proposals and seeks feedback on some design decisions. BACKGROUND All businesses benefit from an environment which gives them confidence to invest and grow. Through the Business Growth Agenda, the Government is working to create a competitive and productive economic environment which supports both export and domestically focused businesses. One way Government can help businesses is by reducing their compliance costs, saving them time and providing more opportunities to run and grow their businesses. Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme is part of the Government’s investment in a productive environment for businesses. A well-functioning, modern revenue system should make it easy for businesses to get things right and difficult to get wrong, and reduce compliance costs. Research shows that tax compliance costs are relatively high for small businesses. It is important to consistently ask whether these costs are excessive. In particular, for small businesses, there is the question of whether ‘close enough is good enough’ and whether there are ways of reducing compliance costs without providing tax concessions. Of course it is important, where possible, to reduce compliance costs for all businesses. Business in New Zealand Approximately 97% of enterprises in New Zealand are small businesses. Small businesses, like all businesses, make a significant contribution to the New Zealand labour market. Around 597,000 people, comprising around 30% of the workforce, are employed in small businesses. These figures do not include the self-employed, which number more than 391,000. CHAPTER 1 OVERVIEW 6 NUMBER OF ENTERPRISES BY EMPLOYEE SIZE GROUP & THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO GDP 338,745 Zero employees 98,030 1-5 employees 3 7, 0 7 1 6-19 employees 9,18 6 20-49 employees 4,843 50 or more employees $56,785m contributed to GDP by these size groups $ 4 5,17 1m Excluded industries/ other items $13,791m contributed to GDP by this size group $94,506m contributed to GDP by this size group Data source: Statistics New Zealand, Business Demography Feb 2014 & National Accounts Mar 2012 69% of enterprises have zero employees. 97% of enterprises have fewer than 20 employees (473,846 enterprises). 30% of employees in New Zealand are employed by enterprises with fewer than 20 employees (597,500). 27% of New Zealand’s GDP is estimated to be produced by enterprises with fewer than 20 employees. 96% of enterprises with fewer than 20 employees are independent operations not owned by others. 7 Both small businesses and the self- employed are spread across the full range of industries. Small businesses play a critical role in the New Zealand economy. They often provide a means of entry into business for new entrepreneurial talent and a career for those who value economic independence. Small businesses often act as specialist suppliers of parts and services to large companies. They contribute to variety and consumer choice by serving niche, rather than mass, markets. Small businesses also provide an important source of innovation and invention, something that all economies require. A particular challenge for small businesses is the relative level of compliance costs they face. The Government has been considering measures to reduce compliance costs for all businesses, recognising that these are a particular concern for small businesses. Making Tax Simpler In a March 2015 public consultation document, Making Tax Simpler: A Government Green Paper on Tax Administration (the Green Paper), the Government sought feedback on the overall direction of the modernisation of the revenue system. A substantial amount of feedback was received about business tax, particularly about issues faced by small businesses. Recognising the importance of small businesses to the economy, and taking into account the feedback received, the Government has announced a package of tax proposals to help businesses. The package reflects several key themes:  Changes to provisional tax to increase certainty;  More timely payment of provisional tax for some taxpayers;  Self-management and integrity;  Making the system fairer;  Improving the operation of markets through greater tax transparency; and  Making the system simpler. The Government intends to introduce legislation in August to implement this package. Inland Revenue is now seeking feedback to assist with advising the Government on its implementation. This issues paper discusses the technical details of the proposals and seeks feedback on some design decisions. With the exception of the proposals in Chapter 3, the measures all have a proposed implementation date of 1 April 2017. The new methods for paying provisional tax set out in Chapter 3 have a proposed implementation date of 1 April 2018. 8 SUMMARY OF ANNOUNCEMENTS Changes to provisional tax to increase certainty  Increase the current safe harbour threshold from use of money interest from $50,000 to $60,000 of residual income tax and extend the safe harbour to non-individual taxpayers; and  Remove use of money interest for the first two provisional tax instalments for all taxpayers who use the standard uplift option, as long as the payments required under that option are made. More timely payment of provisional tax for some taxpayers  Introduction of another option for calculating provisional tax, the accounting income method, which allows some taxpayers to pay tax as they earn their income; and  Allow a company to pay tax as agent for shareholder- employees in respect of their shareholder-employee salary with a view to reducing the impact of provisional tax on them. Self-management and integrity  Allowing contractors to elect their own withholding tax rate to more accurately reflect the tax payable on income earned and reduce the impact of provisional tax;  Extending withholding tax to cover contractors working for labour-hire firms to better reflect the working arrangements with those firms; and  Introducing voluntary withholding agreements where contractors and principals can agree to withholding tax as income is earned to reduce the impact of provisional tax on contractors. Making the system fairer  Removal of the incremental late payment penalty for new debt for goods and services tax, income tax and working for families tax credits. Improving the operation of markets through greater tax transparency  Allow the credit reporting of significant tax debts to credit reporting agencies, to provide greater transparency for other businesses; and  Information sharing with the Registrar of Companies to assist with compliance with company laws to protect other businesses. 9 Making the system simpler  Various measures designed to make tax easier to comply with and reduce compliance costs:  Allow small companies providing motor vehicles to shareholder-employees to make private use adjustments instead of paying fringe benefit tax;  Increase the threshold for taxpayers to correct errors in returns from $500 to $1,000;  Simplify the calculation of deductions for dual use vehicles and premises;  Removal of the requirement to renew resident withholding tax exemption certificates annually;  Increasing the threshold for annual fringe benefit tax returns from $500,000 to $1m of PAYE/ESCT; and  Modifying the 63 day rule on employee remuneration to reduce costs of complying with that rule.

For businesses, the most well-known, is provisional tax. For others interim payments are made through withholding taxes. The principle underlying interim payments is that tax should be paid as income is earned. This better aligns the payment of tax with cashflow, ensures a more even flow of revenue to the Crown, and reduces the risk of non-payment. Interim payment systems can also assist taxpayers who find it difficult to budget for tax, by providing for deduction at source (e.g. PAYE or withholding tax) or for more frequent, smaller payments, such as provisional tax. The tax system needs to be as fair and efficient as possible in raising the revenue required to meet society’s needs. New Zealand, like most other countries, faces long- term fiscal pressures stemming from an aging population, coupled with an increasing demand for high quality public services. As a result it is important to ensure high levels of tax compliance are maintained and, where possible, improved. The proposals in this chapter are intended to provide businesses with more flexibility and certainty in managing their provisional tax obligations. PROVISIONAL TAX Where income is earned and is not subject to any withholding taxes, or the withholding taxes are not sufficient to cover the total liability, the provisional tax rules apply if a threshold is met.1 In practice, most business taxpayers will be subject to the provisional tax rules as there are few other options to allow businesses to pay tax as they earn their income. Broadly speaking, the current provisional tax rules generally require a taxpayer to meet their annual income tax liability by making three interim payments during the year. Interest applies to compensate taxpayers or the Crown in the event of over or underpayments. CHAPTER 2 CHANGES TO PROVISIONAL TAX TO INCREASE CERTAINTY 11 Instalments can be calculated in the following ways:  Standard (or “uplift”) method – provisional tax instalments are based on 105% of the prior year’s residual income tax (RIT) or 110% of the year before the prior year if the taxpayer has not filed their prior year’s tax return;  Estimation method – the taxpayer estimates their provisional tax liability and pays instalments on that basis;2 or  GST ratio method – provisional tax payments are based on a ratio of residual income tax to GST taxable supplies. This method is only available to a subset of provisional taxpayers. A significant proportion of Government revenue is collected through provisional tax, making up almost a quarter of collections. There are approximately 300,000 provisional taxpayers, three quarters of whom are individuals. However, when considering the tax collected, three quarters of provisional tax revenue is collected from companies. The top 5% of companies represent OF GOVERNMENT REVENUE COMES FROM PROVISIONAL TAX 24% 300k PROVISIONAL TAXPAYERS 25% OF PROVISIONAL TAXPAYERS ARE 74% OF PROVISIONAL TAX 26% OF PROVISIONAL TAX WHICH PAYW H O PAY COMPANIESINDIVIDUALS 75% OF PROVISIONAL TAXPAYERS ARE (and other entities) 12 approximately 43% of the total provisional tax collected. Previous feedback indicates that, while provisional tax works well for some taxpayers, for others, small businesses in particular, provisional tax is a source of stress. This is chiefly because of the uncertainty or unpredictability of income. Use of money interest has been effective at encouraging accurate payment of provisional tax, and has allowed removal of other measures that would otherwise be necessary, such as underestimation penalties. However, submissions on the Green Paper make it clear that the interest and penalty rules also impose costs and stress on many taxpayers. Further, the assumptions that underlie the interest rules, such as income being evenly earned throughout the year, are often incorrect and seen as unfair. While the use of money interest rules are intended to act as compensation for over or underpayments, rather than act as a penalty, they can be seen as having a penal effect. In particular, where a taxpayer has not paid sufficient tax for the year due to an unexpected or unpredictable event. Example 1: Mustang Limited (Mustang) is a bloodstock auction house that has one major sales event each year. Over the course of this three day sale, held in February, Mustang makes 95% of its annual taxable income. Mustang has a March balance date. In the 2018 income year Mustang makes $1.5 million taxable income. It had estimated this exact amount for provisional tax purposes and paid $420,000 in three equal instalments of $140,000 in August, January and May. Two of these instalments were paid before Mustang had actually earned any income for the year. Example 1B: As in Example 1, Mustang estimated their provisional tax at $1.5 million and paid the three instalments as outlined above. However, due to an unexpectedly large price obtained for a standout colt at the sales, Mustang’s taxable income was in fact $2 million for the year. Therefore instead of three instalments of $140,000, Mustang should have paid three instalments of $186,666. While Mustang can correct its position from the third instalment, it has underpaid the first two instalments by $46,666 each. Mustang will be charged interest on these amounts until the outstanding amounts and interest have been paid. At the point that the first two instalments were required, Mustang had not yet earned any income for the year. Mustang also had no idea at that time that they would obtain such a high price for one colt at the sales. While the Mustang example is somewhat extreme, similar issues exist for many businesses with seasonal or volatile income-earning patterns. These issues can especially impact smaller businesses that do not necessarily have the means to fund tax payments prior to earning their income. 13 The Government has therefore announced measures to change some of the aspects of provisional tax that cause particular stress, while maintaining the underlying principle that tax is paid as income is earned. The measures are:  Increasing the current residual income tax limit of $50,000 before use of money interest is imposed (commonly known as the “safe harbour”) to $60,000 and extending this safe harbour rule to non-individual taxpayers;  Removing use of money interest for the first two provisional tax instalments for all taxpayers who use the standard method to calculate and pay provisional tax (commonly referred to as the “uplift method”);  Introducing an accounting income method for smaller taxpayers which uses accounting results to determine provisional tax payments; and  Allowing a closely held company to pay provisional tax as agent of its shareholder-employees in order to remove them from the provisional tax rules. The remainder of this chapter discusses the first two measures. The accounting income method and paying tax as agent measures are discussed in Chapter 3. EXTENDING AND INCREASING THE CURRENT SAFE HARBOUR By far the most popular method for calculating provisional tax is the standard method, which is used by approximately 92% of provisional taxpayers. It is the most straightforward method, however, it can result in outcomes that can be seen as adverse. The most obvious is where the method underestimates the final liability and the taxpayer is subject to use of money interest. It can also result in taxpayers paying too much or having to pay before they have earned any income (the seasonal fluctuations as in examples 1 and 1B). Use of money interest applies to both the standard and estimation methods. It applies from the first instalment date where the payments made do not equal those that should have been made based on the taxpayer’s total liability for the year. Example 2: Viper Limited (Viper) has residual income tax for the 2016 year of $200,000. Viper bases its 2017 provisional tax payments on 105% of the 2016 liability ($210,000) and makes three payments of $70,000 during the 2017 year. On completing its 2017 tax return, Viper calculates its actual liability at $300,000 and as a consequence should have made three payments of $100,000. Viper will be liable for use of money interest on the shortfall of $30,000 from each provisional tax payment date until the tax and use of money interest is paid. 14 A key simplification measure, that has previously been introduced to the provisional tax rules, is the inclusion of a safe harbour rule to remove smaller taxpayers from the application of use of money interest, provided they use the standard method to calculate their payments. This safe harbour rule3 provides that where a taxpayer:  Is a natural person, other than in their capacity as a trustee;  Has residual income tax of less than $50,000 for the tax year;⁴  Has not estimated their residual income tax for the tax year;  Has not used the GST ratio method for the tax year; and  Has not held, at any time during the tax year, a RWT certificate of exemption; their provisional tax is deemed to be due and payable in one instalment, on their terminal tax date. Therefore use of money interest will not apply to that taxpayer, unless they do not pay by the terminal tax date, in which case use of money interest will apply from that date. The safe harbour was restricted to individuals, due to concern about taxpayers switching income between related parties to eliminate paying use of money interest and provisional tax altogether. Example 3: Challenger Limited (Challenger) is a consulting firm owned by Reginald Dodge. Reginald undertakes all the work for Challenger as a shareholder-employee and payments from Challenger to him are not subject to PAYE. In the 2016 year Challenger has residual income tax (RIT) of $45,000 as all the income was held in the company that year. Reginald had no residual income tax. Over the next two years, assuming the same income level, but shifting it between Challenger and Reginald, and alternating provisional tax calculation methods, no provisional tax is paid by either party, and there is no exposure to use of money interest: Ye a r2 0172018 Method Provisional amount RITMethod Provisional amount RIT ChallengerEstimateNilNilStandardNil$45,000 Reginald Dodge Not liableNil$45,000EstimateNilNil 15 Therefore any extension of the safe harbour rule to include non- individuals will require some safeguards \[see pages 17 to 20\]. The Government will extend the safe harbour rule by:  Increasing the threshold from $50,000 to $60,000; and  Allowing non-individuals to use it. This will mean that all taxpayers, whether they are an individual, company, trust, or other entity, who calculate and pay provisional tax using the standard method, will not be subject to use of money interest, provided they have residual income tax below $60,000 and meet the other criteria listed \[see page 15\]. For these taxpayers, any use of money interest will apply from their terminal tax date. This change is expected to remove approximately 67,000 taxpayers from the use of money interest rules, at least 63,000 of which are non- individuals. SAFE HARBOUR FOR ALL TAXPAYERS USING THE STANDARD METHOD Currently taxpayers who use the standard method but exceed the safe harbour threshold are liable to comprehensive use of money interest applied to any over or underpayments. This applies from the first instalment date where the amount paid differs from the amount of residual income tax subsequently calculated. The Government considers that this may not provide taxpayers with certainty. A taxpayer who bases their current year provisional tax payments on the previous year’s tax amount for simplicity, should not be subject to use of money interest when, by chance, that turns out to have resulted in an underpayment of tax. Taxpayers who fall outside the safe harbour are generally larger and more sophisticated, and therefore have a better understanding of their tax position at any point in time. It is highly likely that by the date of the last provisional tax instalment, which is after their balance date, these taxpayers will be well placed to more accurately work out their total tax payable for the year. This should allow them to compare the actual liability to the provisional payments already made and make up any shortfall to avoid any use of money interest. The Government has therefore announced that it will introduce legislation to apply use of money interest only from the last instalment date for taxpayers using the standard method and falling outside the new $60,000 safe harbour. Taxpayers using the standard method are committing to making a minimum level of provisional tax payments during the year. It may be that these payments are ultimately more or less than their actual final liability, but this will depend on factors that may be outside the taxpayer’s control. The standard method is designed to approximate a taxpayer’s current liability using the best information 16 available (other than a comprehensive estimate by the taxpayer). A taxpayer who wishes to, can use the estimation method where they consider the standard method does not produce a reasonable approximation of their liability for the year. Applying use of money interest only from the final instalment date will allow a taxpayer to pay all their tax without use of money interest being imposed. Thunderbolt pays the full $125,000 it will have satisfied its income tax obligation for the year and will not be subject to any use of money interest. If Thunderbolt pays $87,500, it will incur use of money interest on the shortfall of $37,500 from the third instalment date until the outstanding tax and interest is paid. Example 4: Thunderbolt Limited (Thunderbolt) a manufacturer of clapping devices for sports fans, has residual income tax of $250,000 in the 2016 year. Thunderbolt has trouble estimating its provisional tax due to volatility in its income. Sales volumes are highly dependent on the success of local sports teams – the more successful the teams, the more clapping devices are sold. Therefore Thunderbolt decides to use the standard method to calculate its provisional tax payments, reducing the risk of use of money interest applying if it estimates and the estimate is incorrect. For the 2017 year Thunderbolt makes two provisional tax payments of $87,500 per payment. At the third instalment date Thunderbolt has calculated that its actual annual liability is $300,000, due to the success of the local football team, the Fords. Thunderbolt could now either pay a third instalment of $87,500 or pay the full year balance of $125,000. If Example 4B: Returning to the Thunderbolt example, but assuming the Fords have a poor season, resulting in Thunderbolt’s residual income tax for the 2017 year being $230,000. Thunderbolt could pay the final instalment of $87,500 and be paid use of money interest from the third instalment date until the amount was refunded, or it could make a final payment of $55,000 with no use of money implications. When a taxpayer has overpaid their liability using the standard method, use of money interest will apply to any overpaid balance at the third instalment date until that tax is refunded or otherwise applied. Consistency requirements The measures announced by the Government are intended to reduce the potential negative impacts of the current provisional tax and use of money interest rules. However, in attempting to address these issues and provide taxpayers with greater certainty there is the potential for people to take advantage of the rules. 17 As detailed in example 3, extending the safe harbour to non-individuals could lead to some undesirable practices such as switching income between parties and switching between the estimation and standard methods. This could result in no provisional tax payments being made by these taxpayers. In addition, it will be important to ensure that taxpayers pay the instalments required under the standard method. Officials consider rules to reduce the ability of taxpayers to switch between methods could address the first issue. Taxpayers would still be permitted to switch methods during and between years, but some restrictions will apply. Switching income between parties Related parties would be required to use the same method of calculating provisional tax within an income year (with the exception of taxpayers using the GST ratio method). This will apply to companies in a group of companies⁵ and to companies and shareholder-employees who do not have PAYE deducted from payments of salary. tax calculation method as Charger for that income year Example 5: Charger Limited (Charger) is owned equally and run by its two shareholders Macintyre and Alistair Craig. Both draw shareholder-employee salaries from the company from which no PAYE is deducted. Charger chooses to use the standard method to calculate provisional tax. Macintyre and Alistair will be required to use the same provisional Example 6: Coronet Super Bee Limited (CSBL) produces honey from a special breed of bee. It has two subsidiary companies, Hummer Limited (Hummer) that operates the hives and Bel Air Limited (Bel Air) that bottles the honey. Hummer is 100% owned by CSBL but Bel Air is only 50% owned by CSBL with the other 50% owned by Pacer Limited, another honey producer who is unrelated to CSBL. CSBL and Hummer would be required to use the same provisional tax calculation method during a year. The requirement for related parties to use the same method to calculate provisional tax should largely prevent switching income between parties. However, it is proposed that a specific anti-avoidance provision be included within the rules to ensure that taxpayers cannot manipulate incomes to avoid being subject to the provisional tax rules. The result of such an anti-avoidance provision being applied will be that the taxpayers will be deemed to be estimated taxpayers and subject to full use of money interest for the period of the manipulation. In addition, officials envisage that the general anti-avoidance provision will also apply to any manipulation of income to avoid the application of the provisional tax rules. 18 Switching between methods A taxpayer who has chosen the standard method could subsequently switch to the estimation method within an income year. However, any related parties would also be deemed to have switched. A taxpayer choosing to switch will be subject to use of money interest from the first instalment – the same treatment as under the current rules. If a taxpayer selects the standard method but does not make the minimum payments, use of money interest will apply to the lower of the difference between the amount paid and the required standard method instalment or one third of the taxpayer’s RIT for the year. They will also be liable for late payment penalties on the same basis. This rule will also apply to taxpayers falling within the expanded $60,000 safe harbour. If Camaro’s RIT for the 2017 year was $600,000, then three instalments of $200,000 should have been paid. Camaro will be liable for use of money interest and late payment penalties on $57,500 for each instalment (the difference between the required standard instalment and the payment made). Example 7: Camaro Limited (Camaro) elects to use the standard method for its 2017 provisional tax calculation. Camaro’s residual income tax for the 2016 year was $450,000 and therefore its 2017 liability will be three instalments of $157,500. On each instalment date Camaro only pays $100,000. If Camaro’s RIT for the 2017 year was $330,000, three provisional tax instalments of $110,000 should have been paid. Camaro will be liable for use of money interest and late payment penalties on $10,000 for each instalment (the difference between Camaro’s RIT “instalments” and the payment made). Another issue that could arise is switching between methods, to extend the period use of money interest is payable to the taxpayer when an overpayment has been made. Under the current rules, interest is payable from the first instalment date under either method. However, under the new rules a taxpayer who subsequently discovers they have overpaid using the standard method might seek to switch to the estimation method to maximise the use of money interest payable. Example 8: Caballero Limited (Caballero) manufactures staple removers. In the 2016 income year its residual income tax was $350,000. Caballero decides to pay its 2017 provisional tax using the standard method. Under this method it is required to pay three instalments of $12 2 , 50 0 . After paying the first two instalments, and due to a downturn in people using paper, Caballero now believes it will only have a total tax liability of $100,000 for 2017. This is less than the provisional tax instalments already paid. Caballero’s accountant, Mr Edsel, suggests that Caballero switch to the estimation method to calculate 19 provisional tax. This would enable them to earn use of money interest on the overpaid amount back to the first instalment date, instead of only from the third instalment date under the standard method. The first option, applying use of money interest in full, recognises that there is a cost to the government in not having the right amount of tax in the right period. The second option would mean that if a taxpayer had calculated and paid their provisional tax using the standard method, use of money interest (if any) would only have applied from the final instalment date for the year in question. If a taxpayer had used the estimation method, use of money interest would apply from the first instalment date. It is proposed that the second option is adopted. This recognises that taxpayers have still, during the relevant year, made the provisional tax payments they were required to under the standard method. If anything, the only provisional tax amount that would have been underpaid was the final instalment which should have captured the amount of the reassessment. Therefore use of money interest should only apply from that date. This defeats the intention of simplifying and reducing the application of the use of money interest rules. Therefore a restriction to prevent this form of switching is required. Officials suggest that taxpayers can only switch from the standard method to the estimation method prior to the payment of the second provisional tax instalment. Reassessments From time to time it is necessary for reassessments of a particular year or years to be made. Under the current rules, use of money interest would apply back to the first instalment of provisional tax for the year subject to the reassessment. Removing use of money interest for those who use the standard provisional tax calculation method raises a question about how to apply interest to reassessments. There are two options:  Continue to apply use of money interest to reassessments as is currently the case (i.e. from the first instalment date); or  Apply use of money interest on the basis it would have been applied had the reassessed amount been correctly accounted for in the year concerned. Example 9: Escalade Limited (Escalade) is a furniture retailer. Escalade calculated and paid its 2017 provisional tax using the standard method. In November 2017 Escalade discovered that it had omitted to include, in its closing stock, some stand up desks with built in treadmills that were being stored offsite. This resulted in a tax shortfall for the 31 March 2017 year of $30,000. 20 Escalade makes a voluntary disclosure and is reassessed for the 2017 year. Escalade will be subject to use of money interest on the $30,000 shortfall from the last instalment date of the 2017 income year (7 May 2017) until November 2017 when they pay the shortfall (plus interest and any shortfall penalties). 2018 year. Inland Revenue reassess Caprice for an additional $14,000 tax in the 2017 year. Caprice’s residual income tax now exceeds the $60,000 limit for the safe harbour to apply. However, because Caprice used the standard method to calculate and pay its provisional tax, it would have been eligible for the standard method safe harbour. Therefore use of money interest will only apply from the third instalment date for the 2017 year. For taxpayers who fall within the new “under $60,000 safe harbour” rule and who receive a reassessment, officials consider that use of money interest should apply in the same way as it would have had the reassessment been dealt with in the year in question. If a reassessment places a taxpayer above the safe harbour limit of $60,000, the interest position will default to the standard safe harbour rule. That is, use of money interest will apply from the third instalment rather than the terminal tax date. Example 10: Caprice Limited (Caprice) is a small business that advises corporate clients on integrating pets within the workplace. They have used the standard method and have residual income tax of $50,000 for the 2017 year. Caprice met all the other requirements to qualify for the under $60,000 safe harbour, therefore use of money interest, should it apply, will not apply until the terminal tax date. In 2019 Inland Revenue audits Caprice and finds that they did not declare income of $50,000 from a client who was invoiced in the 2017 year but did not pay until the Tax pooling Currently many taxpayers use tax pooling intermediaries as a way to reduce their exposure to use of money interest. Tax pooling intermediaries are able to reduce the amount of use of money interest incurred by taxpayers by offsetting these tax shortfalls with surplus payments by other taxpayers within the “pool”. Taxpayers who have surplus payments can also derive higher credit interest where that surplus can be “sold” to another member of the pool. The new safe harbour rule will reduce the impact of use of money interest on taxpayers. However, taxpayers may wish to continue using pooling intermediaries to make tax payments. Tax pooling will continue to be available for taxpayers who wish to use the new safe harbour option. 21 Tax payments within group companies It is common in a group of companies for one entity to make all the tax payments for all members of the group, and then transfer those payments once the group’s tax returns are completed. One issue that arises with the proposed safe harbour rule is that, although in total the group may have paid provisional tax instalments based on the standard method, individual entities may have short paid as they make no provisional tax payments during the year. It is proposed that group companies continue to be able to make tax payments in one entity within the group and be able to make transfers to other group members at the end of the year. 1 For a taxpayer to be subject to provisional tax they must have had a residual income tax (RIT) liability of greater than $2,500. RIT is calculated by subtracting any tax credits and PAYE which have been deducted during the year from the total tax liability. 2 A taxpayer is able to re-estimate during an income year and alter their instalments as required. 3 Section 120 KE of the Tax Administration Act 1994. ⁴ The safe harbour rule was increased from $35,000 to $50,000 with effect from 1 April 2009, for the 2009-10 income year. When the safe harbour was reconsidered in 2007, lifting the threshold to $50,000, meant about 243,000, or 97% of all individual provisional taxpayers, could potentially rely on the use of money interest safe harbour threshold. See Reducing tax compliance costs for small and medium-sized enterprises: a Government discussion document (2007) at paragraph 2.33. ⁵ As defined in section IC 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 22 A key principle underlying the tax system is that generally taxpayers should pay tax as their income is earned. Pay as you earn (PAYE), resident withholding tax (RWT) and withholding taxes are examples of this principle. Provisional tax aims to ensure those who do not have tax deducted at source also pay tax as income is earned, although it starts with the presumption that income is earned evenly over the year. This presumption does not work well for businesses with seasonal or volatile incomes, as demonstrated in the extreme example of Mustang Limited (see Example 1 in Chapter 2). The Government has therefore announced two new methods for paying provisional tax that seek to better deal with seasonality and volatility by allowing income tax to be paid on a more ‘pay as you go’ basis:  An ‘Accounting Income Method’; and  Paying provisional tax on behalf of related parties. These two proposals also simplify the taxation of the total income of closely related parties by removing some parties from provisional tax and allowing more freedom around balance dates. THE ACCOUNTING INCOME METHOD (AIM) More information and detailed questions relating to AIM can also be found online at aim.makingtaxsimpler.ird.govt.nz. Use of cloud based software Indications are that greater numbers of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are ensuring that they have up-to-date accounting information to enable them to make sound business decisions based on their trading history and current position. This is particularly evident in the increasing take-up of digital business systems, including accounting software systems. Integration between accounting software and Inland Revenue’s systems and processes has been requested by taxpayers. SMEs use tools, like their accounting software, often in conjunction with a professional advisor, to track how CHAPTER 3 MORE ACCURATE AND TIMELY PAYMENT OF PROVISIONAL TAX 23 their business is performing at various times during the year. The timing of these interactions are often driven by outside events such as preparing GST returns. This same information might, therefore, also be used to make provisional tax payments on an actual results basis. The AIM measure announced by the Government proposes that, accounting information prepared by a taxpayer for a period, be used as a basis for calculating the tax liability of the business for that period. The resulting amount would be payable by the taxpayer as a provisional tax instalment. AIM payments will be generated by the accounting software and authorised by the user, whether a business or its advisors. The user will confirm the amount to pay and then activate the payment for both GST and provisional tax. The calculation and payment of provisional tax will become part of running the business instead of an extra process. For accounting income to be the basis for provisional tax calculations, accounting information would need to be regularly updated, including clarification of the tax treatment of some transactions. Some users are already operating on this real-time basis, whereas others may need to update their records more regularly. Eligibility criteria for AIM The AIM method will be available to all provisional taxpayers with a turnover of $5 million or less. AIM is most likely to suit the SME market rather than larger corporate taxpayers because of the size and nature of tax adjustments required to accounting profits in the large corporate market. While the Government has restricted the use of AIM to SMEs, officials are interested in submissions from larger taxpayers on whether they would consider using this method and whether they would be willing to make the required tax adjustments throughout the year by, for example, completing monthly tax calculations. Calculation methods An interim tax calculation is needed to calculate provisional tax payments under AIM. This would be done through accounting software by either using the information prepared for GST returns and making some adjustments for non-GST items such as wages and salaries, interest and tax depreciation; or using a “tax” profit and loss statement for the period as the basis for a provisional tax instalment. 24 Example 11: Road Runner Industries Limited (Road Runner) manufactures the Coyote rod - an integral part in electric cars. It files GST on a two monthly cycle and this is its first GST return for the year. Since it prepares this information for GST purposes anyway it decides to pay provisional tax using AIM. Road Runner prepares a taxable income figure from its accounting system for the two month period based on the transactions included in its GST return and makes adjustments for capital asset purchases, wages and salaries paid (excluding shareholder salaries), interest and tax depreciation as follows: GST taxable supplies (excl. GST)$200,000 GST expenditure (excl. GST)$100,000 Net of GST “income”$100,000 Add back: Assets purchased during the period $50,000(excl. GST) Deduct: Wages and salaries (excl. s/h salaries)$30,000 Interest for period$10,000 Tax depreciation on assets⁶$25,000 Net “taxable” profit$85,000 Tax on net profit (28%)$24,000 Alternatively, if Road Runner is not registered for GST or its accounting system can create a profit and loss schedule based on actual results adjusted for tax depreciation and interest, it could use those figures to calculate the “taxable income” for the period as follows: Gross sales$200,000 Less: Rent$30,000 Wages and salaries (excl. s/h salaries)$30,000 Interest$10,000 Tax depreciation on assets⁶$25,000 Other expenses$20,000 Net profit before tax$85,000 Tax on net profit (28%)$24,000 Under either calculation method Road Runner pays tax of $24,000 for the period to Inland Revenue as a provisional tax instalment. 25 Making provisional tax payments more frequently For those using AIM, provisional tax payments will be made monthly for businesses registered for monthly GST returns. Payments will be made two monthly for businesses on a two-monthly or six-monthly GST filing option, and for those not registered for GST. The Government expects more regular payments of provisional tax will enable a better fit between when income is earned and tax paid, while assisting with financial planning and budgeting. Small businesses are generally very aware of their tax liability and it is often a source of stress for them. Consultation indicates that being able to pay tax on a more regular basis will reduce this stress. Seasonal and Volatile businesses AIM is intended to help businesses with seasonal or volatile incomes as it allows them to pay tax as income is earned rather than in equal instalments spread across the year. Example 12: Consider a ski field, Rubicon Limited (Rubicon) which earns all its income over the winter period. Rubicon has a 30 September balance date and decides to use AIM for calculating provisional tax to better reflect the seasonality of its income. There would be no payments during the start of the year, with payments only at the end of the year.

Officials understand that software companies want to offer this to the market place. Inland Revenue will work with software providers to develop an acceptable calculation method that gives both Inland Revenue and taxpayers confidence in the calculation of their tax liability. Inland Revenue will develop the basic specifications it requires from a software program before this service can be offered to the market place. 26 As the amounts paid are on a cumulative basis, any corrections to prior provisional tax periods can be reflected by the software in the current payment. Therefore a tax advisor can make adjustments retrospectively and the software will reflect this for the current period and remember this treatment for next time (for example, if a percentage of an expense relates to private non- deductible use, then the software will apportion and remember this for the future). Ultimately, under a self-assessment model, the taxpayer is always responsible for calculating and assessing their tax liability. Software is a tool to assist a taxpayer, however, self-assessment will continue to require them to turn their mind to the liability calculated by the software. Submissions are invited on the ability of software providers to build this capability. Officials also seek submissions on what specifications software developers consider appropriate to ensure Inland Revenue and small businesses can have confidence in the provisional tax payments. Submission of information to Inland Revenue Taxpayers using AIM will be required to submit information with their provisional tax payments to enable the calculation to be verified. The option being considered is a subset of the information in the IR10 (an “interim 10”), provided electronically. This would include information that The specifications might include the following:  Meets minimum prescribed accounting requirements;  Can file electronically to Inland Revenue;  Can accurately map a trial balance to the prescribed IR10⁷ style form;  Can calculate profit figures on a regular basis;  Has the ability to calculate a tax liability (including tax adjustments); and  Supports the relationship between the tax advisor and client through shared communication, alerts and dual access. The calculation of provisional tax payments will not be an additional workload for taxpayers. There is additional work to input and code data on a more regular basis. The software will pull relevant accounts into the tax calculation, so taxpayers will need to code their income and expenses to the right accounts (i.e. profit and loss or balance sheet accounts). The software will use up-to-date figures where they are available, and a mix of prior year figures and current year estimates where this is not the case. For example, home office expenses are traditionally steady so software will use last year’s amount and apportion it over the current year until any corrections are made at year end. 27 supports the calculation of provisional tax (for example, cost of goods sold) but not information that can wait until end of the year (for example, rates). It may include GST related information so that the two payments can be cross-referenced. Software packages will automatically map this information and forward it to Inland Revenue at the time of the provisional tax payment. Inland Revenue will not access the raw data held within the software itself. More regular provision of information during the year may also provide opportunities to simplify the end of year tax return process in the future. Submissions are invited on what level of financial information should be submitted, and whether there is interest in exploring options to further reduce the end of year tax return process. Taxpayers not using software Although the use of software is increasing, there will be taxpayers who prefer to use their own software or not to use software at all, for example, a spreadsheet or manual cashbook. As actual trading results are used to calculate the provisional tax payment it would be necessary to have minimum accounting requirements for taxpayers opting to use AIM manually. A standard of reasonable care would be expected to be taken when calculating provisional tax. At a minimum to use AIM officials anticipate that a taxpayer should maintain a double entry accounting system. Officials are interested in whether AIM should be available to those using a manual system and, if so, what minimum accounting requirements should be expected. Officials are also seeking views on what level of accuracy would be considered acceptable for tax adjustments, and whether a spreadsheet or manual cashbook would be suitable (as long as there is some reconciliation between the business bank account and the accounting records). Potential issues with the use of AIM Loading income in latter part of year To protect the tax base and the integrity of the tax system in general, consideration must be given to the possibility of taxpayers manipulating the timing of tax payments. GST returns create a natural audit trail, however, there is a risk that a taxpayer could seek to load income into the latter part of the income year even though the income may actually be earned earlier. It is possible there could be slippage from one payment period for income and/or expenses. Where these correct themselves within two periods it is likely this would be considered reasonable. Inland Revenue expects a taxpayer to take reasonable care in entering and coding their income and expenses to calculate their AIM payments. If a taxpayer is found to have deliberately 28 manipulated the timing of their income and tax payments, they would no longer be eligible to use AIM. Instead, they would be placed into the estimate method where penalties and use of money interest apply. Shareholder-employee payments There is the risk that accounting income could be manipulated through shareholder-employee payments. The calculation of AIM payments will be based on accounting income before shareholder salaries are paid, and deductions for such payments can only be taken if the salary is paid within the period that the tax payment relates to. Overpayments of tax that relate to shareholder salary accruals can then be transferred to meet the shareholders’ tax liability at the end of the year. Use of Tax Pooling Provisional tax pooling was introduced to manage taxpayers’ uncertainty around provisional tax payments and their exposure to use of money interest. Consistent with this objective, pooling is not currently available for payments of tax types where a taxpayer has certainty of their liability at the time of payment (for example, GST). As the payments made under AIM are calculated on actual accounting income, taxpayers will have certainty about their payments. Therefore it is not appropriate to allow pooling for provisional tax payments based on AIM. Fluctuations between income and loss Although AIM does provide an actual results-based pay as you go system for businesses, unlike salary and wage payments, business income can fluctuate. If income is always positive, the cumulative tax position will always be positive, however, where income fluctuates between profit and loss for particular periods, issues may arise with using AIM. This is most likely to be an issue where profits are earned at the beginning of an income year and losses are incurred at the end. In some situations this issue could be resolved by a change in balance date. 29 Example 13: Atlanta Limited (Atlanta) is a commercial breeder of falcons. It sells these falcons to farmers to help eliminate rabbits on farms. Due to the breeding cycle of a falcon Atlanta sells all its falcons in the month of June. Atlanta has a 31 March balance date and decides to use AIM to calculate provisional tax to attempt to better reflect the seasonality of its income. Atlanta has the following calculation of income for each two month period: DAT E31 M AY31 J U LY30 SEP30 NOV31 JA N31 M A RTOTAL Net income (loss)(2,000)10,000(1,000)(1, 50 0)(500)(2,500)2,500 Cumulative income (loss) (2,000)8,0007,0005,5005,0002,500– Tax payment (refund)02, 240(280)(420)(14 0)(700)700 Using AIM, Atlanta would significantly overpay its annual tax liability in the second period and gradually receive that back as refunds over the remaining periods. However, if Atlanta were to adopt a June balance date, to fit with the natural cycle of falcon breeding, AIM might better fit its business. Overpayments of tax may also occur where a taxpayer’s income profile fluctuates between profit and loss multiple times throughout an income year, albeit over a shorter period than in the example of Atlanta above. Example 14: The Pitt Company Limited (Pitt) manufactures steel components of wind turbines. As their income fluctuates throughout the income year they want to adopt AIM to more closely match their tax payments to their income earning cycle. Pitt has a 31 March balance date. Pitt has the following income profile for a year: DAT E31 M AY31 J U LY30 SEP30 NOV31 JA N31 M A RTOTAL Net income (loss)150,000(50,000)300,000(60,000)250,000100,000690,000 Cumulative income (loss) 150,000100,000400,000340,000590,000690,000— Tax payment (refund)42,000(14,000)84,000(16 , 8 0 0)70,00028,000193 , 20 0 Although not as prominent as the Atlanta example above, Pitt does end up overpaying tax in two of the six two-monthly instalments because of the way the income of the company fluctuates throughout the year, however, these “overpaid” amounts are required to be repaid later in the same year. This method would still provide a better outcome for Pitt than the current provisional tax rules, which would see them pay three even instalments of $64,400 each in August, January and May. 30 Refunds Using AIM when a business fluctuates between profit and loss throughout a year may require Inland Revenue to refund amounts of overpaid tax in some periods, much the same as is currently the case for GST. A taxpayer would be given the option of not having that amount refunded. Where a taxpayer would need to pay these amounts back to Inland Revenue in the following period (i.e. have a profit in the next period), they might choose not to take the short-term refund. If a taxpayer did wish to receive a refund, the process would be similar to the current GST refund process. This would be an automated process. The ability to have overpaid tax refunded is a significant advantage over the current system. Officials are interested in submitters’ views on this mechanism and whether they would use it. Would submitters consider options to refund and/or transfer excess provisional tax paid to GST, and are there other approaches that would deal with these situations. Use of money interest and penalties If a business, using AIM to calculate and pay provisional tax, does not pay its full annual liability during the year, it will not be subject to use of money interest unless it has failed to pay the full instalments calculated under AIM. It is expected that taxpayers who use AIM will either no longer have terminal tax liabilities (as their tax payments will be made in near real-time, and based on actual results), or have very small variations to their tax liability for the year. Continuing to have the last tax instalment after balance date should allow any shortfall to be identified and paid by the final instalment. However, if a taxpayer pays less than the amount prescribed by the software for any instalment, use of money interest will apply from the relevant payment dates. Late payments of tax may also attract late payment penalties. Inland Revenue expects reasonable care to be taken in calculating AIM payments. If Inland Revenue considers that reasonable care hasn’t been taken, then the taxpayer could be liable for penalties of 20% of the resulting tax shortfall. A taxpayer will be removed from AIM when they do not provide the information required in the interim 10. The consequence of this will be that a taxpayer will be placed back into an estimate method, with the usual use of money interest and penalties applying. 31 Suitability of AIM for different types of taxpayers The list below outlines the types of taxpayers best suited to AIM, along with some groups of taxpayers to whom it may not be well suited. AIM may suit:  Taxpayers who update their cloud based software accounting systems to manage their business throughout the year.  Taxpayers whose income does not fluctuate significantly.  Taxpayers with income concentrated in the latter part of the income year.  Taxpayers with an annual steady accumulating income (that is, the business continues to make profit month to month, rather than fluctuating between profit and loss). AIM may not suit:  Taxpayers who do not have robust accounting processes (using software, spreadsheets or manual accounting records).  Taxpayers with seasonal income concentrated in the beginning of an income year.  Taxpayers with large amounts of overseas income resulting in large end of year income adjustments.  Taxpayers with complex tax adjustments that require year end calculations. 32 SUBMITS PAYM E NT DIRECTLY TO IR TA X STATEMENT TA X STATEMENT SOFTWARE You need to pay $XXXX.XX tax to Inland Revenue on XX-XX-XX EXPENSES INCOMEASSETSLIABILITY Software calculates provisional tax due based on accounting information in software.

MARCH 20XX HOW AIM MIGHT WORK FOR A BUSINESS 33 QUESTIONS FOR READERS Officials invite submissions on the AIM proposal, in particular:  How often records are updated in accounting software;  Whether larger taxpayers would be interested in using AIM;  With regard to tax calculations, what level of accuracy taxpayers can expect from software such as in the treatment of tax adjustments;  What software specifications are appropriate to ensure Inland Revenue and small businesses can have confidence in the provisional tax payment calculations;  What level of financial information should be submitted in the interim 10;  Whether there is interest in further exploring options to reduce the end of year tax return process;  Whether AIM should be available to businesses using manual systems and, if so, what minimum accounting requirements should be required;  Whether submitters see any issues with how use of money interest might apply to AIM;  Whether submitters would use the options to refund and transfer excess provisional tax paid to GST payments; and  Any other technical issues that submitters wish to raise. PAYING TAX AS AGENT FOR SHAREHOLDER-EMPLOYEES The second measure the Government has announced to provide for more accurate and timely payment of provisional tax, is to allow a company which does not use AIM to make tax payments on behalf of shareholder- employees. This will potentially enable these shareholder-employees to be removed from provisional tax. In some instances an entity making payment to a taxpayer has a close relationship with that taxpayer. In these cases it may be possible to have the entity pay tax on behalf of the associated parties to minimise compliance costs. An example of a close relationship providing a low cost tax payment system is a trustee and a beneficiary. Currently, a trustee can pay provisional tax on the total income of the trust (that is, both trustee and beneficiary income). At the end of the year the provisional tax paid by the trustee can be allocated, along with beneficiary income, to the beneficiaries of the trust as part of the trust’s tax return process. If the tax paid is sufficient, the beneficiaries have no provisional tax liability for that income. Without this process, beneficiaries, with no other non-source deducted income, could end up within the provisional tax rules. The Government has announced that this mechanism will be extended to cover companies. Under this approach shareholder-employees in a company could be removed from the provisional tax rules for their salaries from the company. Tax credits would be received by the shareholder- employees to meet their tax liability. Tax payments made on behalf of the shareholder-employees would be paid on the company’s provisional tax dates, not any provisional tax dates the shareholder-employees might have had. The diagram below shows the current and future state for a company electing to pay tax as agent for its shareholder-employees. CURRENT STATE GROSS INCOME $300,000 Company pays provisional tax on $100,000 Shareholder pays provisional tax $60,000 Shareholder salary cash $200,000 SUBURBAN LTD Ian Thompson GROSS INCOME $300,000 FUTURE STATE Ian Thompson Shareholder salary $200,000 – cash $140,000 & tax credits $60,000 Company pays provisional tax on $300,000 SUBURBAN LTD 34 Example 15: Suburban Ltd (Suburban) is a consulting business which has one shareholder-employee, Ian Thompson. At the beginning of the 2018-19 year they both elected that Suburban would pay tax on Ian’s behalf. Suburban has gross income of $300,000 and no expenses during 2018-19. During the course of the year, Ian took $140,000 in cash out of the company by way of drawings debited to a current account, and Suburban made provisional tax payments of $90,000. At the end of the year:  Suburban pays Ian a salary of $200,000 by crediting the current account for $200,000, $140,000 cash and $60,000 of its provisional tax payments to Ian as a tax credit. The $60,000 tax credit meets Ian’s tax liability on the $200,000 income, and he has no further liability.  After payment of Ian’s salary of $200,000, Suburban’s net income for the year is $100,000. It has $30,000 remaining in its provisional tax account after the transfer to Ian. That amount of $30,000 meets its tax liability on its net income⁸. companies to pay the right amount of tax on behalf of their shareholder- employees. Use of this method Paying tax on behalf of shareholder- employees in relation to their salaries will be optional. It would also only be practical when the same person deals with tax for the entity and the owners – although this is a decision for those involved to make. As with the standard method safe harbour \[see pages 17 to 20\], rules will be required to prevent entities from switching in and out of this option in alternate years to avoid the on-going obligations of provisional tax. Proposed mechanism A company and its shareholder- employees would be required to elect to have the company paying tax as agent by the company’s first provisional tax payment date. The following rules would then apply:  During the course of the year, the company would be expected to add to its own provisional tax payments, amounts equal to any provisional tax the shareholder- employees would have had in relation to their salaries, if they had not elected into paying tax as agent.  At the end of the income year the various tax returns will be prepared for the company and its shareholder-employees. At this stage the company will be able This measure is intended to reduce business compliance costs by removing shareholder-employees from provisional tax. However, tax calculations, similar to provisional tax calculations made now, will still be required to be made to enable 35 to look at the total provisional tax paid, and allocate these amounts between the company’s tax liability and the shareholder- employees. This allocation may differ from the initial calculation.  From a shareholder-employee’s point of view, amounts allocated to them will be treated as a tax credit (just like a tax credit for PAYE or RWT). The ordinary rules will then apply – if that tax credit (along with any other tax credits and amounts paid) are less than the shareholder-employee’s total tax liability, the shareholder-employee will have a terminal tax liability and potentially an interest liability. If the total amount of tax credits and other payments exceeds the shareholder-employee’s total tax liability, then a refund will be available. Rate of tax paid on behalf of shareholder-employees Where the company uses the uplift basis, no rate calculation is required – the company’s obligation is simply to pay uplift amounts on shareholder- employees’ salaries as well as on its own income. However, where the company uses the estimation method, the company will need to reflect the shareholder-employee’s tax rate in the amount it pays on the shareholder- employee’s behalf, not the company rate. For shareholder-employees for whom their salary is their primary income it will be their average tax rate; for shareholder-employees for whom it is a smaller part of their income, it may be their marginal rate. This is the same calculation which is made now for shareholders who pay provisional tax using the estimation method. Other types of income, and other types of taxpayer The main source of income paid without source deduction to related parties is the payment of salaries to shareholder-employees at irregular intervals, where the PAYE rules do not apply. This proposal is initially intended to be available for these transactions. However, a progressive extension to other forms of income subject to tax at source could be considered if this proposal is popular with taxpayers. One possibility would be to allow companies to use it where they make other payments where no tax is deducted at source to related parties. The payment of rent is a prime example. This would allow a further group to be removed from provisional tax. A second possibility would be to allow it to be used in place of resident withholding tax (RWT) for those companies liable to pay it on interest and dividends paid to related parties. This would simplify compliance by removing the need for a company to comply with RWT requirements. This proposal could also be made available to partnerships. Payment of partnership profits from a partnership out to its partners is not subject to deduction of tax at source. Under current rules each partner is likely to be subject to provisional tax on 36 their share of partnership income. A partnership could pay tax for each of its partners so they would no longer be subject to provisional tax. Suitability of paying tax as agent to different types of taxpayers The list below outlines the types of taxpayers to whom paying provisional tax on behalf of related parties may be best suited. May be suited to:  Taxpayers where a single person prepares returns for both the company and its shareholder- employees. May not be suited to:  Companies with a large number of shareholder-employees who have different people preparing their tax returns.  Companies where the shareholder- employees have significant other non-source deducted income and are subject to provisional tax any way. Potential use of this measure to provide greater balance date flexibility While most businesses have a balance date of 31 March, Inland Revenue can allow businesses to have a different balance date. A high threshold applies to allowing companies to have early balance dates because it can be used as a tax deferral mechanism. Where income is initially derived in a company with an early balance date and then paid out to its standard balance date shareholder-employees by way of salary, tax will be paid on the shareholder-employees’ later provisional and terminal tax dates. The high threshold for allowing early balance dates can disadvantage companies that would benefit from one, and accountants whose workload is unevenly spread. Allowing a company to pay tax on behalf of its shareholder-employees could be used to enable a greater proportion of companies to have early balance dates without fiscal risk. A company that wished to have an early balance date would be required to pay tax on behalf of its shareholder- employees on its own provisional tax dates, so ensuring that the early balance date was being used for genuine business reasons and not as a tax deferral mechanism. Officials invite submissions on whether this proposal should be used to enable greater availability of early balance dates. It would be helpful if these submissions discussed how important balance date flexibility is. QUESTIONS FOR READERS Officials invite submissions on the paying tax as agent proposal, in particular:  Whether submitters who are involved in companies that pay salaries to shareholder- employees would use this measure;  Whether it would be useful to extend this measure to other income paid by companies to related parties, such as rents, and interest and dividends (in place of RWT);  Whether this measure could be usefully extended to partners in partnerships;  Whether increased availability of early balance dates to businesses which used this measure would be valuable; and  Any other comments or concerns on the implementation of this measure. ⁶ For this example it is assumed that Road Runner uses the Commissioner’s economic rates of depreciation for accounting and tax purposes. For businesses that have separate accounting and tax depreciation rates an adjustment would be required to substitute accounting with tax depreciation. We understand it is reasonably common for SMEs to use tax depreciation rates for accounting purposes. ⁷ The Financial statements summary (IR10) form is designed to collect information for statistical purposes and to assist in the administration of the tax system. It isn't designed to replace financial records. The form is a general summary of information relating to the customer's business and operations that is filed with a company tax return. ⁸ Numbers rounded up for simplicity – in fact Suburban has more tax than it needs to meet its liability, and would be entitled to a refund. 37 Withholding at source systems are widely considered to be the foundation of an effective tax system. Such systems impose an obligation on an independent third party (for example, an employer or financial institution) to withhold an amount of tax from a payment of income. Withholding at source systems:  Remove taxpayers from provisional tax obligations or at least reduce them to a level where safe harbour from use of money interest may apply;  Are a more cost-effective way for both taxpayers and the revenue agency to interact;  Provide a timely flow of income to the government;  Reduce the likelihood of non- payment that might otherwise arise where the taxpayer reports the income but is unable to pay some or all of the tax assessed; and  Can significantly reduce the ability for taxpayers to understate their income. New Zealand has a number of domestic withholding taxes, most notably PAYE and RWT. The “schedular payments” rules are another example of withholding, however they have significant issues. They are neither comprehensive in scope nor simple to apply, and require a flat rate withholding tax to be deducted from certain classes of payments which are not salary or wages but are largely payments for services (rather than goods). Although the withholding tax rules for schedular payments have not changed for many years, the labour market has undergone significant shifts. While the proportion of people who are self-employed (with no employees) has not changed much over the last 20 years, the industries they work in have changed. There has been a decrease in those working in industries such as agriculture and manufacturing, and an increase in the construction, professional, scientific, technical and administrative and support services, as shown in the diagram below. This means more self-employed people are working in industries not covered by the withholding tax rules.

In addition, using a company structure has become increasingly popular with contractors as shown in the diagram on page 40. Payments to companies are generally not subject to withholding tax under the schedular payments rules.1⁰ As the current rules are both out-of-date and narrow in application there may be opportunities for SMEs to supress income and operate totally or partially in the hidden economy. Such businesses will have a competitive advantage over those who are compliant with their tax obligations. This tax advantage may also impact on small business hiring decisions. 20141996 100% 80% 60% 40% 20% 0 2 7. 6 % Other 12. 5% Professional, scientific, technical, administrative & support services 13.0% Retail trade, & accomodation & food services 10.0% Manufacturing 23.3% Agriculture, forestry & fishing 15. 3% Agriculture, forestry & fishing 13.6% Construction 15.9% Construction 6.6% Manufacturing 12. 2% Retail trade, & accomodation & food services 19.5% Professional, scientific, technical, administrative & support services 30.5% Other 39 200020022004200620082010201220142016 COMPANIES INDIVIDUALS BUSINESS VEHICLE OF CHOICE 300,000 250,000 200,000 150,000 100,000 50,000 0 Example 16: Sandra is a Management Consultant. She was a salaried employee until 2009 when she started working as an independent contractor and worked for several large organisations from 2009-2010. Inland Revenue commenced an audit of Sandra which revealed that she had only declared a small proportion of her contracting income and that she was charging GST but not filing GST returns. Sandra now has a tax debt of $360,000. Many workers are moving from being employees to being self-employed and operating through a company structure. This means that payments to them are made without PAYE or withholding tax applying. This can create issues for those individuals who are not used to dealing with their tax obligations directly and have previously relied on their employer to deal with those obligations. In addition, the current rules are not designed to make it easy for people to self-manage their affairs. Business Demography Statistics. This work is based on/ includes customised Statistics New Zealand’s data which are licenced by Statistics New Zealand for re-use under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 New Zealand licence. 40 Example 18: Codeit Limited is a large New Zealand company that designs software. It has a workforce of programmers who are all contractors. Within this group there are 15 contractors who exhibit the characteristics of being employees. To challenge this Inland Revenue needs to work through each employee and apply the tests to determine their employment status for tax purposes. Example 17: Candytasters Limited employs five people to test new types of confectionary. Willy, the owner of Candytasters, tells his employees he wants them all to become contractors and work through company structures. The five employees do this. Candytasters Limited no longer has to deal with PAYE and other deductions on behalf of the individual tasters. The tax obligations have shifted to people who may never have had to look after their own tax obligations other than as an employee. SELF-MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK Both individuals and businesses live and operate in often complex environments. Meeting various tax obligations can also be complex. Historically the tax system has not allowed a high degree of flexibility to enable people to address these complexities and manage their obligations in a way that works for them. The goal of the future is to design a system where people are empowered to self-manage. This involves providing more flexibility for businesses and minimising the degree of complexity in managing their tax affairs so that it is easy for businesses to get their tax affairs right. At the same time the system should make it hard for people to get their tax affairs wrong and Inland Revenue should have the ability to quickly identify areas of concern and take action to ensure things get back on track. MODERNISING THE WITHHOLDING RULES The schedular payment withholding rules need modernising to ensure that they keep pace with modern society, make it easy for people to comply and self-manage their obligations, and to minimise costs to the system. The Government has announced a first step towards modernising the rules, providing increased flexibility and addressing an area where compliance issues have arisen. Enforcement of the employee- contractor boundary is also an inefficient mechanism to bring contractors into the withholding rules. Audit activity in this area can be expensive, as it is generally determined on an individual contractor basis, rather than for groups of taxpayers. 41 The measures announced are:  Pay as you go for contractors – electing own withholding rate;  Pay as you go for contractors – labour-hire firms; and  Voluntary withholding agreements. The initial measures provide a foundation for future reform. A wider review of the rules is necessary to address the issues outlined at the start of this chapter more comprehensively, and is likely to be included in a later discussion document on improving the tax system for businesses. ELECTING OWN WITHHOLDING R AT E Electing your own withholding rate aims to assist contractors to better match their tax payments to their income. The current rules specify flat rates of withholding. This will often not accurately match the contractor’s actual income tax liability. Contractors can obtain a special tax code to alter their rate, however the process can be cumbersome, requiring them to apply to Inland Revenue and provide supporting information. The Government has announced it intends to amend the rules, to allow contractors to select their own withholding rate, without needing to make an application to Inland Revenue. This will mean an application for a special tax code will no longer be needed to alter the rate applied to a schedular payment. Example 19: Ben is a building contractor. Ben earns $120,000 each year from his building contracts with several major building companies. The payments to Ben are subject to the current withholding rules and the building companies deduct 20% withholding tax from payments they make to Ben. Ben predominantly provides labour services and has minimal deductions. At year end he has an additional $6,000 of income tax to pay over and above what has been withheld. This also means Ben will have to pay provisional tax the following year. $24,000 WITHHELD (20%) $6,000 PROVISIONAL TA X INCOME $120,000 TAX $30,000 BEN 42 Under the new rules Ben can elect a higher withholding rate of 25% (without needing to apply for a special tax code). Ben’s withholding now matches his final tax liability, he no longer has to pay provisional tax and his end of year tax bill is minimal. Prescribed rates of withholding In some cases a contractor will be unable to select their own rate as they will be subject to withholding at a rate prescribed by the Commissioner. It is intended that, in some circumstances, the Commissioner will be able to give notice to a payer that they are required to withhold at a higher rate than that selected by the contractor. This would occur where the contractor is non-compliant with their tax obligations. Prescribing a higher rate will assist the contractor to become compliant and repay any outstanding debt. The Commissioner prescribed rate would be similar to the existing power in section 157 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which enables the Commissioner to require deductions by notice. However, the ability to prescribe rates would be more flexible and practical than the existing provision. Section 157 deductions must be a flat amount and are required to be paid separately to the employer monthly schedule. This process would vary the deduction rate applied to the payment to the contactor, and be reported and paid through the employer monthly schedule and employer deductions processes. Minimum rates Allowing contractors to elect their own withholding rate creates a fiscal risk. This risk arises because contractors may use the proposal to attempt to defer or avoid paying their tax through choosing artificially low withholding rates. This also creates additional administration costs for Inland Revenue in collection of unpaid tax debt. To address this fiscal risk and ensure the integrity of the withholding system, a minimum rate of withholding will be imposed on contractors. NO PROVISIONAL TAX INCOME $120,000 TAX $30,000 $30,000 WITHHELD (25%) 43 A minimum rate addresses these risks as it decreases the ability for contractors to defer or avoid paying their tax. For example, with a minimum rate of 10%, Ben in the previous example would only be able to defer paying $18,000 of tax rather than $30,000. Example 19B (if no minimum rate): After previously electing a 25% rate in 2017, Ben the builder now decides to pick a rate of 0% for the 2018 year. His income and expenses remain the same and therefore his withholding does not match his final income tax liability. Ben now has a terminal tax bill of $30,000 which he will need to pay in 2019. In 2019 Ben has a terminal tax bill of $30,000 (for income earned in 2018). As a result, he is also now required to pay provisional tax from 2019 onwards (which, if accurate, will mean he has no further terminal tax payments to make). If Ben does not pay his terminal and provisional tax, the Commissioner may increase his withholding rate to 50% to ensure his obligations are met. $0 WITHHELD (0%) TERMINAL TAX BILL OF $30,000 INCOME $120,000 TAX $30,000 $0 WITHHELD (0%) $30,000 PROVISIONAL TA X INCOME $120,000 TAX $30,000 No further terminal tax payments $30,000 DEBT $60,000 WITHHOLDING $30,000 TAX 44 Example 19C (if minimum rate of 10%): After previously electing a 25% rate in 2017, Ben the builder now decides to pick a lower rate of 10% for the 2018 year. His income and expenses remain the same and therefore his withholding does not match his final income tax liability. Ben now has a terminal tax bill of $18,000 which he will need to pay in 2019. In 2019 Ben has a terminal tax bill of $18,000 (for income earned in 2018). As a result, he is also now required to pay provisional tax from 2019 onwards (which, if accurate, will mean he has no further terminal tax payments to make). If Ben does not pay his terminal and provisional tax, the Commissioner may increase his withholding rate to 40% to ensure his obligations are met. However, a minimum rate does have some disadvantages. It is a departure from the self-management framework and may prevent contractors from picking the means of paying tax that works for them. For example, if a contractor would find paying tax easier through provisional tax rather than through withholding, then a minimum rate removes this choice. $12,000 WITHHELD (10%) TERMINAL TAX BILL OF $18,000 INCOME $120,000 TAX $30,000 $12,000 WITHHELD (10%) $18,000 PROVISIONAL TA X INCOME $120,000 TAX $30,000 No further terminal tax payments $48,000 WITHHELD (40%) $18,000 TA X DEBT INCOME $120,000 TAX $30,000 45 In addition, a contractor whose “correct” withholding rate is below the minimum must apply for a special tax code to get the correct rate. This imposes a compliance cost on these contractors. These costs and benefits are finely balanced. The Government favours a minimum rate of 10% for resident contractors because it is concerned about the fiscal risks, but welcomes submissions on this issue. Non-resident minimum rate The Government also favours having a higher minimum rate of 15% for non-resident contractors. This higher minimum rate is favoured because if a non-resident avoids paying their tax it can be difficult for Inland Revenue to collect the unpaid tax if the contractor has returned overseas. In addition to non-resident contractors, it may be appropriate to have a higher minimum rate for contractors who are on temporary work visas as they are likely to return overseas and pose a fiscal risk. However, determining whether a higher minimum rate should apply could be difficult for employers. Officials seek submissions as to whether the greater avoidance risk justifies having a different minimum rate for non-resident contractors and contractors with temporary work visas. Default and non-declaration rates When a contractor does not specify a rate, a default rate will apply. For contractors working through labour-hire firms (see page 49) the default rate proposed is 20%. This rate would ensure that the majority of labour-hire contractors that do not select a rate have no end of year tax bill and do not have to pay provisional tax. For contractors not operating through labour-hire firms, the proposed default rate is the same rate that currently applies under Schedule 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007. This helps reduce transitional costs as businesses currently withholding will not need to change the rates for all their contractors. Under the current schedular payments rules, a contractor subject to withholding is required to provide their name, IRD number and tax code. The IRD number is necessary to ensure that the income information and tax withheld is matched to the contractor, and the contractor is not able to avoid their obligations. Currently, if a contractor does not provide this information, payments to them must have tax deducted at 15% above the rate that applies under Schedule 4. This non-declaration rate will be replaced with a similar rule to the no notification rule for PAYE whereby there will be a flat rate for non-declaration of 45%. 46 Non-resident entertainers Non-resident entertainers currently have a flat withholding rate of 20%. These entertainers can choose to treat this withholding as a final tax and if they do so they are not required to file an end of year income tax return. This treatment helps reduce compliance costs for non-resident entertainers. Officials propose that non-resident entertainers continue to have a flat rate of withholding of 20% and are not able to elect their own withholding rate. This will mean that these entertainers can continue to have withholding treated as a final tax and will not have to file returns. Consent of withholder There may be a concern that the proposal to require the consent of the withholder could increase overall compliance costs. The cost of changing a withholding rate for a withholder could be greater than the benefit to the contractor of having tax correctly withheld. This problem arises because when a contractor makes a decision to change their withholding rate, there can be a cost to the withholder which the contractor does not personally bear. As a result, a contractor may decide to change their rate in circumstances when it provides them with marginal benefit but imposes relatively larger costs on the withholder. To resolve this issue, stakeholders proposed that contractors should only be able to change their withholding rate if the withholder consents to the change. Officials view Officials consider that if the proposal to allow contractors to elect their own withholding rate required the consent of the withholder it would create the inverse issue. Withholders would be able to refuse to change contractors rates without bearing the impact that refusing to change rates would have on the contractor. This would mean overall compliance costs would be greater when the benefit to the contractor of changing the rate is greater than the cost to the withholder of changing it. Officials consider that in the majority of situations the decision to change withholding rates will decrease overall compliance costs. As a result, officials generally prefer allowing contractors to decide their withholding rate without requiring the consent of the withholder. However, when a contractor repeatedly changes their withholding rates this assumption does not hold. Instead it is likely that repeatedly changing rates will impose excessive compliance costs on withholders for little benefit. As a result, officials propose that the consent of the withholder will be required to change a contractor’s withholding rate if the contractor has previously changed their withholding rate twice in the income year. 47 THE PROCESS FOR SELECTING A R AT E This diagram sets out how the process of electing a rate would apply.11 Withhold 45% of payment Withhold at prescribed rate Withhold at default rates Withhold at minimum rate Withhold at selected rate Schedular payment rules apply Has the contractor provided an IRD number? YES NO Has the contractor selected a rate? YES NO Is the selected rate greater than minimum rate? YES NO Do they have a special tax code? NO Has the Commissioner given you a prescribed rate? NO YES YES 48 LABOUR-HIRE FIRMS As set out earlier, the withholding rules are out-of-date and do not cover changing employment practices and modern industries. Over the last two decades there has been a large growth in the labour-hire firm industry. However, the withholding rules do not adequately address contractors working for this industry. Labour-hire firms provide workers to perform services to clients. The labour-hire firm engages these workers either as employees or as contractors. While contractors and employees do similar work, the withholding rules that apply to them are quite different. For employees engaged by labour-hire firms, the current PAYE rules mean that withholding applies to payments made to them so they generally have low compliance costs as a result. However, current withholding rules do not generally apply to contractors engaged by labour-hire firms. This means these contractors are required to manage their own tax obligations and have to deal with provisional tax. It also means that these contractors have opportunities for non- compliance (whether deliberate or accidental). The following examples are based on Inland Revenue audits of labour-hire firm contractors. IT contractor Amy is an IT consultant who operates through a company. An audit of her revealed that she had over $100,000 of undeclared income from 2010- 2 013 . The audit also revealed that Amy was claiming Working for Families over this period and received $16,000 of family assistance payments she wasn't entitled to. Management accountant Ben is a management accountant. From 2009-2014 he worked as an independent contractor but did not file tax returns. After being audited it was discovered he had significant undeclared income, and he did not have money to pay for it. During 2009-2010 Ben was also receiving the unemployment benefit. Child support evasion Carl is an IT contractor. From 2013- 2014 he worked as an independent contractor. An audit revealed Carl had undeclared income of over $300,000 over this period. Carl originally had his child support liability assessed at $70 per month. Carl should have been paying in excess of $2,000 per month instead. 49 To address these issues the Government has announced that the withholding rules will be extended to specifically cover all contractors operating through labour-hire firms. This means that the labour-hire firm will be required to withhold from any payment it makes to its contractors. Extending the withholding rules in this way provides an initial measure to address one set of contractors where there are demonstrated issues. The proposed approach is consistent with that in Australia, where labour-hire withholding rules have applied since 2000. In Australia, approximately 54,000 labour-hire contractors are subject to withholding and over $400m in tax is withheld annually.12 When withholding will apply A labour-hire arrangement is one where a firm arranges for workers to do work for clients. The labour-hire firm receives payment from the client and pays the worker themselves. It is proposed that withholding will apply where:  There is a labour-hire arrangement (as set out in the diagram above);  The payer is in the business of providing labour-hire services; and  The payment is made for that business (that is, the labour-hire arrangement is not incidental to another business). Consistent with the rules set out on pages 42-48, labour-hire contractors will be able to elect their own withholding rates. Withholding will apply to a labour-hire contractor regardless of the form in which the contractor structures their business. This removes the ability for the contractor to avoid withholding by structuring as a company. Contractors subject to the labour-hire rules must have their income reported to Inland Revenue via the employer monthly schedule. This means that a labour-hire contractor would not generally be able to get a certificate of exemption to remove themselves from the rules and the requirement to have their income reported to Inland Revenue.13 In circumstances where withholding is inappropriate, or where the minimum withholding rate is too high, the contractor will be able to obtain a special tax code to reduce their withholding rate. These contractors would still have their income reported to Inland Revenue via the employer monthly schedule.

X Co. asks IT Solutions Ltd for IT workers to assist with an upgrade of their systems. IT Solutions Ltd provides one of their contractors (Steve, a New Zealand resident) to assist X Co. The payment from Ben to Tara is part of a labour-hire arrangement. However, Ben is not required to withhold from these payments because he is not in the business of providing labour-hire arrangements. The payment is incidental to his business of providing legal services. IT Solutions Ltd are in a labour-hire arrangement with Steve and X Co. and this arrangement is part of their labour-hire business. As a result, IT Solutions Ltd will be required to withhold tax from any payments to Steve. Steve can specify the rate of withholding, but it must be at least 10%. Example 21: Ben is Jane’s solicitor. Jane is engaged in litigation and requires a barrister to represent her in court. For this purpose, Ben instructs Tara and pays Tara on Jane’s behalf. IT SOLUTIONS LTD STEVE, IT CONTRACTOR X Co. PaymentPayment (less withholding) Work BEN (solicitor) TAR A (barrister) JANE Payment Work Payment 52 VOLUNTARY WITHHOLDING Contractors not covered by the schedular payment withholding rules are not currently able to have tax withheld on a payday basis. The Government has announced new rules to allow contractors to opt in to voluntary withholding agreements. This will allow those contractors who are not covered by any other withholding provision to opt in and obtain greater flexibility to manage their tax obligations. A voluntary withholding agreement will require mutual agreement – that is the payer must also agree to withhold. This means that compliance costs will be minimised, as those payers who do not have the systems in place to easily withhold do not have to agree to withhold. However, the requirement for mutual agreement does mean that some contractors who want a voluntary withholding agreement may not be able to obtain one, as the payer does not agree. ⁹ Based on customised Statistics New Zealand data from the Household Labour Force Survey 1996-2014. 1⁰ Companies in the agricultural, horticultural and viticulture industries and non-resident contractor companies are subject to withholding under the schedular payments rules. 11 This diagram does not apply to non-resident entertainers. 12 Figures taken from data for the 2012/2013 year. See https://data.gov.au/dataset/taxation-statistics-2012-13/ resource/233cbf28-6fda-4e53-bbe9-3a37a65fb742. 13 Except where there is a specific rule allowing for non- residents to obtain a certificate of exemption due to the effect of a double tax agreement. 53 As foreshadowed in the discussion document Making Tax Simpler – Towards a new Tax Administration Act, a different approach to penalties may be required. This chapter outlines changes the Government has announced to late payment penalties. LATE PAYMENT PENALTIES The late payment of tax is currently subject to a series of late payment penalties, which are imposed from the first day the tax is overdue and accrue incrementally and indefinitely thereafter. Overdue tax incurs an initial 1% penalty one day after the due date, another one off 4% penalty seven days after, and an incremental penalty of 1% for each month thereafter. Use of money interest (UOMI) is also imposed to compensate the government for not having the money available to them. It is applied one day after the due date and is calculated on a daily basis and does not compound. The longer the tax is outstanding, the more financial penalties are imposed. After two years, the penalties and use of money interest can accumulate to more than 50% of the original tax owed. Current penalties compound and are imposed over the outstanding tax, with use of money interest imposed over outstanding tax and penalties. With the current use of money interest underpayment rate of 9.21%, the combined penalty and interest rate aggregates to approximately 27% per annum (in the first year). In some years the use of money interest rate has been higher, resulting in a higher effective rate. The late payment penalty does not effectively encourage all taxpayers to comply. For some taxpayers, late payment penalties can be seen as ineffective if they are imposed on people who did not pay due to an administrative error (as they have underdeveloped business processes), cannot pay (as they do not have the resources) or will not pay (as they have the resources, but choose not to pay). The first group feel Inland Revenue is penalising them for an honest mistake and will grudgingly pay the penalty. The second cannot pay the initial amount and so will not be able to pay the penalty. The third is unlikely to be motivated by a financial penalty and so other tools would be more effective. CHAPTER 5 MAKING THE SYSTEM FAIRER 54 In recent years, Inland Revenue has conducted research to learn more about the relationship between penalty and interest rates and compliance behaviour. This research has revealed that the existence of financial penalties is important as they encourage most taxpayers to comply, but high penalty rates may not be essential to encourage all taxpayers to comply. Many surveyed taxpayers commented that it was the existence of possible financial penalties that was the reason they would always file and pay on time. However, beyond the existence of penalties many taxpayers surveyed did not have a complete understanding of the financial consequences of getting into tax debt. When the current late payment penalty rules were explained, over 86% of taxpayers surveyed said that they would be sufficiently encouraged to pay their debt, once the debt had incurred a combined penalty and use of money interest rate of 5.2% (this currently occurs with the debt being outstanding for approximately 8 days).1⁴ While late payment penalties encourage on time payment, there is a point when the accumulated penalties and interest overwhelm taxpayers. Taxpayers surveyed suggested that this tipping point is approximately $10,000 of tax debt for small and medium sized businesses. At this point, taxpayers may struggle to see a way forward and become less engaged in resolving their debt. Consequently, imposing more penalties will not encourage repayment. In addition, for many small businesses, the total amount outstanding quickly becomes so big it cannot be repaid using expected future cash flows. At this point, any repayments mostly go to reducing the interest and penalties, with little being left over to pay the outstanding tax itself. Over the years, the current rules have resulted in a significant amount of unpaid tax, penalties and use of money interest being added to the government tax debt book. The debt book for non-social policy tax debt is currently above $5 billion,1⁵ with Inland Revenue in recent years being required to write off and impair approximately $800 million to $1 billion of uncollectible debt per annum.1⁶ The Government has announced that it will introduce legislation to reform the late payment penalty by no longer imposing the 1% monthly incremental late payment penalty from new GST, income tax and Working for Families Tax Credit (WfFTC) overpayment debt. The proposed change will benefit approximately 65,000 taxpayers with income tax debt, 67,000 taxpayers with GST debt and 23,000 taxpayers with WfFTC debt. Other tax types may be considered for similar treatment in the future as they transition to START.1⁷ New tax debt incurred on or after the application date will incur the initial late payment penalty and use of money interest. This will reduce the effective rate of penalties and interest imposed in the first year, from 27% per annum, to approximately 15% per annum.1⁸ This combined 55 penalty and interest rate is more in line with established commercial (unsecured) lenders and will lead to less uncollectible debt, which over time will reduce the write-off of uncollectible late payment penalties. There is a risk that some taxpayers may view the removal of the incremental late payment penalty as a reduction in the ‘cost of borrowing’ from Inland Revenue, and decide that it is financially worthwhile to delay their tax payments. While the effective rate has been reduced, given Inland Revenue’s other recovery and enforcement tools, it is unlikely a reasonable person would consider it prudent to borrow from Inland Revenue, if they could otherwise borrow at a similar rate from a commercial lender. Also, it is important to note that Inland Revenue has a number of non-financial tools available (including the proposed ability to disclose tax debt to credit reporting agencies, discussed in Chapter 6) to address the issue of some taxpayers deciding not to resolve their tax debt. WfFTC shares the same late payment penalty rules as income tax. Therefore WfFTC recipients face similar issues regarding the fast accumulation of penalties and interest on outstanding WfFTC debt. The major cause of WfFTC debt is Inland Revenue’s lack of accurate information on families’ household income and circumstances during the year. Approximately 200,000 (half of all) WfFTC recipients choose to receive their entitlement during the year in weekly or fortnightly instalments. However, many of these recipients are paid more than they are entitled to receive during the year. This is because the WfFTC instalments are either based on a default, rudimentary estimate of recipients’ projected end of year entitlement, or rely on the recipient notifying Inland Revenue of changes and asking for their instalments to be changed accordingly. At the end of the tax year when WfFTC recipients’ entitlements are finalised (through square-ups with their income tax returns) these overpayments are treated as a debt. If the debt remains unpaid after the due date, late payment penalties are imposed. Much of this debt is incurred by low income families, many of whom are the least likely to have the financial ability to repay it. Imposing high late payment penalties is unlikely to further encourage WfFTC recipients to repay their debt. No longer imposing the incremental 1% penalties (leaving just the initial late payment penalties of 1% and 4%) will provide WfFTC recipients a better opportunity to repay any debt that arises. Inland Revenue intends to address the cause of WfFTC debt as part of the review of social policy in a subsequent discussion document about the administration of social policy. For example, collecting and using better, more real time information about recipients to ensure they receive the correct entitlement should prevent and reduce debt. 56 The application of this measure will be staggered as tax products begin to be administered by START. This provides the most cost-effective transition option. However, the staggered approach means that, in the future, some indebted taxpayers will continue to have incremental late payment penalties imposed on them, depending on whether the debt is administered in FIRST or START. This will be the case until all GST, income tax and WfFTC debt is being administered in START. 1⁴ Material relating to the research undertaken by Inland Revenue will be released two weeks after the release of this issues paper. 1⁵ Inland Revenue Annual Report, 2015.

This system is based on the GenTax platform supplied by FAST Enterprises as part of the Business Transformation programme. 1⁸ Based on initial penalties of 1% and 4% and the current use of money interest rate. 57 Critical to compliance is taxpayer trust that their information will not be disclosed inappropriately. However, the need to keep tax information secret should be balanced against supporting economic efficiency and growth, and wider government outcomes. Accordingly, there are a number of specific exceptions in the tax secrecy legislation to enable tax information to be disclosed. An example is the provision of tax information to the New Zealand Police relating to serious crime. The Government has announced two new measures to share information to better protect the New Zealand business community. These measures will disclose information relating to taxpayers with significant tax debts and information relating to taxpayers who may have committed serious offences against the Companies Act 1993. Both measures, while primarily focused on protecting the wider community, also carry tax administration benefits. CREDIT REPORTING OF TAX DEBT Information about tax debt, like all tax information, is subject to the tax secrecy rule set out in section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the TAA). Inland Revenue does not disclose information about a taxpayer’s tax debt to others (except where a claim is lodged in court for recovery of the debt). However, there is, in essence, little difference between a tax debt and any other debt a taxpayer may have. The lack of visibility of tax debt can have a significant impact on other businesses, as they may have made different decisions about dealing with someone had they been aware of the debt. In addition, the non-payment of tax debt can allow non-compliant businesses to unfairly compete against those who are compliant. The Government has announced that it will introduce legislation to permit the disclosure of tax debt information for the most serious cases of non-compliance to credit reporting agencies. This will apply to significant income tax and GST debt, and to employers’ unpaid PAYE, child support, student loan and KiwiSaver deductions from employees’ salary and wages. Disclosure will enable businesses contemplating providing CHAPTER 6 IMPROVING THE OPERATION OF MARKETS THROUGH GREATER TAX TRANSPARENCY 58 credit to make more informed commercial decisions, as including tax debt information in a credit check would provide a more comprehensive picture of a business’s total position. In addition to contributing to economic efficiency, this will reduce opportunities for non-compliant taxpayers to continually fail to address growing tax debt. Criteria for disclosure of tax debt It is proposed that legislation will set out the criteria to be met before Inland Revenue shares information with credit reporting agencies, including that:  The debt is significant;  The debt is not disputed;  Reasonable efforts have been made to collect the debt;  The taxpayer does not qualify for serious financial hardship relief; and  The taxpayer has been personally served notice of the Commissioner’s intention to disclose debt information to credit reporting agencies, and given 30 days to repay the debt or arrange for repayment. “Significant debt” is proposed to be defined in regulation as debt relating to income tax, GST or an employer’s PAYE, child support, student loan or KiwiSaver deductions, where the debt is either:  Overdue by a certain period of months (for example, 18 months) and greater than a set percentage of a taxpayer’s:  Gross income; or  Unencumbered assets; or  Non tax third party liabilities; or  New debt that is greater than a certain dollar threshold, (for example, $150,000) and there is a high risk the debt will not be repaid. The criteria outlined above will ensure that only cases of serious non- compliance are disclosed to the credit reporting agencies. The inclusion of percentage measures and a fixed dollar threshold will allow reporting only when it would be a proportionate response, given the particular taxpayer and the risk their tax debt represents to other businesses. Officials welcome submissions on the criteria, including the appropriate setting of the thresholds and percentages. It is proposed that the significant debt criteria be set out in, and able to be varied by, Order-in- Council. The Commissioner will be responsible for ensuring the criteria are applied consistently. It is proposed that annual summaries will be published including levels of information that have been shared with credit reporting agencies. 59 Who will tax debt be disclosed to? New Zealand has a number of experienced credit reporting agencies. These agencies source credit data and package and provide it either directly to requesting businesses, or to other businesses that provide credit reporting services. The agencies obtain data from a range of sources including private businesses such as banks and other lending institutions, utility and telecommunications providers, and some government agencies including the Ministry of Justice (court fines) and the New Zealand Transport Agency (licence status and demerit point history). As a result of their experience and access to a wide range of other credit information, the credit reporting agencies are best placed to provide the most comprehensive picture of a business’s credit history. They are therefore considered the most appropriate channel through which to disclose tax debt information. As part of the implementation of this proposal, Inland Revenue will work with credit reporting agencies interested in receiving significant tax debt information to ensure they have the capability to deal with the information securely and effectively. What will be disclosed? Three categories of information are proposed for disclosure:  Identity information – this is required to ensure the credit reporting agency can accurately identify a particular taxpayer and ensure any accompanying debt information is attached to the correct taxpayer. This might include information such as the taxpayer’s name and address, the business’s trading name (if applicable), a company’s date of incorporation, and New Zealand Business Number.  Existence of tax debt – this information could be presented as a yes/no indicator and would include the date the information was provided to show how current it is.  Information about the tax debt – this could include tax types, the age of the debt and the total amount represented as a band, for example “$150,000-$175,000”. The first two categories of information are essential. However, the third category may not be necessary to make other businesses aware of the existence of significant tax debt. Submitters’ views are welcomed on whether additional detail on the amount of tax debt would be beneficial. Similar to other Inland Revenue information sharing arrangements, a memorandum of understanding will be entered into with each participating credit reporting agency before any information is shared. This will require the agencies to screen Inland Revenue information before it is incorporated into a credit file, to ensure it is matched to the correct file. The credit reporting agencies keep a record of who requests and receives 60 information, and have established processes for updating information. Credit reporting agencies are already required to provide individuals with copies of their own credit information free of charge, upon request.1⁹ Privacy implications Officials have been working with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner to understand the privacy implications of disclosing individuals’ personal information held by Inland Revenue to credit reporting agencies, and by credit reporting agencies to members of the business community. Credit reporting agencies in New Zealand are subject to a code of practice, the Credit Reporting Privacy Code 2004 (the Code). The Code prescribes privacy standards for the industry to follow when dealing with personal information. Officials continue to consult with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner on the interaction of this measure with the Code. Despite repeated requests for payment Mr Stutz, the owner of Olds Mobile has not responded to correspondence from Inland Revenue. On 1 August Olds Mobile is issued a final 30 day demand for payment of the outstanding amount. On 31 August Mr Stutz has still not made contact with Inland Revenue regarding payment. On 1 September Inland Revenue provide information regarding Olds Mobile to the credit reporting agencies. On 2 September La Salle Finance Limited does a credit check on Olds Mobile Limited for a loan of $300,000. It finds that in addition to a number of other debts Olds Mobile has a tax debt of between $200-225,000 which has not been disclosed on its loan documentation. This extra debt indicates that Olds Mobile is insolvent and could not have repaid any loan from La Salle. Credit reporting has assisted La Salle in not making what would have turned out to be a bad loan to Olds Mobile. Example 22: Olds Mobile Limited (Olds Mobile) is a transport company that provides transport for retirement villages to take residents on day trips and excursions. It runs a fleet of ten vans and has 15 employees. Olds Mobile has faced a downturn in bookings over the last few years. This has resulted in the company getting behind on its taxes. Specifically, the company has around $200,000 of GST arrears that is older than 18 months and exceeds 20% of Olds Mobile’s gross income.2⁰ Officials welcome submissions on the measure generally, and in particular are interested in submitters’ views on:  The criteria for credit reporting;  The definition of significant debt; and  The level of information to be disclosed. 61 INFORMATION SHARING WITH THE REGISTRAR OF COMPANIES The Companies Office administers a number of public business registers. In so doing, it oversees some important regulatory requirements which ensure business accountability and responsibility. The Companies Office aims to:21  Promote confidence in the New Zealand business environment by ensuring integrity of registered information;  Ensure that those who are responsible for fulfilling the statutory duties of registered bodies or individuals comply with those responsibilities; and  Hold to account those who abuse the privileges of the corporate structure. The Registrar of Companies (sometimes under various statutory titles such as the Registrar of Friendly Societies or the Registrar of Incorporated Societies) is the statutory officer responsible for establishing and maintaining the various registers, and for taking compliance and enforcement action against those who fail to comply with or breach their statutory obligations. The Registrar of Companies has the power to collect information in order to administer the Companies Act 1993 (Companies Act),22 verify compliance and to detect breaches of that Act.23 Inland Revenue has, on occasion, information that would assist the Registrar of Companies to detect and enforce serious offences under the Companies Act, and assist with the prosecution of these offences. Currently Inland Revenue is unable to share this information and this can mean that non-compliant companies are able to continue to trade and receive a commercial advantage over other compliant businesses. This may cause harm to members of the public, businesses and the New Zealand economy generally when these breaches continue undiscovered for periods of time. The Government has announced that Inland Revenue will enter into an agreement to provide information to the Registrar of Companies. Inland Revenue will be permitted to share information with the Registrar of Companies where:  There is reasonable suspicion that a serious offence has been, is being, or will be committed;  Inland Revenue considers the information will prevent, detect, or provide evidence of, a serious offence that has been, is being, or will be committed; and  Inland Revenue is satisfied that the information is readily available, it is reasonable and practicable to communicate it, and communication is in the public interest. This agreement will improve the Registrar of Companies’ ability to enforce serious offences under the Companies Act and hold 62 non-compliant businesses and directors accountable for breaching their corporate responsibilities. This, in turn, will prevent harm to other businesses and individuals, and promote public confidence in the integrity of New Zealand’s business environment. Improved enforcement of serious Companies Act offences is expected to also provide tax administration benefits. Research undertaken by Inland Revenue into habitual non-compliance has found non- compliance with other government obligations to be a strong predictor of non-compliance with tax obligations.2⁴ Directors who are seriously non-compliant with their obligations under the Companies Act may also be non-compliant with tax obligations for which they also have responsibility, including the obligations of their company and its employees. This measure has similar objectives to Inland Revenue’s current information sharing agreement with the New Zealand Police, which enables the sharing of information relating to serious criminal offences. It is intended that the principles reflected in that agreement are incorporated as much as possible into the new agreement with the Registrar of Companies.2⁵ Offences regarding which information will be shared Information sharing arrangements between Inland Revenue and enforcement agencies should balance public interest with tax secrecy and, in the case of information about individuals, privacy interests. It is proposed that, as is the case for Inland Revenue’s information sharing with the New Zealand Police, information sharing with the Registrar of Companies is limited to “serious offences” with a potential maximum penalty of at least 4 years imprisonment. Inland Revenue has consulted with the Companies Office regarding the serious offences it would most benefit from receiving information about. As a result of these discussions it is proposed that Inland Revenue shares information about the following:  Serious breach of director’s duty to act in good faith and in best interests of company.2⁶ This offence is intended to prevent directors acting in bad faith and in a way that harms the interests of a company. A director commits this offence by exercising powers or performing duties as director in bad faith toward the company, believing that the conduct is not in the best interests of the company, and knowing that the conduct will cause serious loss to the company;  A person authorising or making false statements.2⁷ This is intended to prevent directors and other persons from knowingly making statements that are materially false or misleading, or from knowingly omitting material information, with regard to required documents and statements and reports relating to company affairs; 63 prevent directors of companies that have been removed from the register for failing to confirm or correct information, providing inaccurate information or persistently and seriously failing to comply with the requirements of the Companies Act or Financial Reporting Act 2011 from being a director or promoter of a company for up to 10 years; and  Director of failed company being a director of or managing a phoenix company. This prevents directors of failed companies from going on (without the permission of the court) to participate in the management of a phoenix company, or a company with the same or similar name as the failed company.3⁴ The penalty for the above offences is a sentence of up to 5 years’ imprisonment or a fine of up to $200,000.3⁵ What information will be shared? Examples of information that Inland Revenue could share include:  Information Inland Revenue holds on a specified person: This may include their IRD number, entity information, the taxes for which they are registered, income history, tax payment history (including any compliance issues), types of income, expenses, asset and liability information, and actions taken or planned to be taken in relation to the specified person.  Breach of statutory prohibition from managing company.2⁸ Prohibition is automatic for a person convicted of an offence in connection with promoting, forming or managing a company or of being convicted of several specified offences.2⁹ It is a serious offence to breach a statutory prohibition. This offence is intended to prevent prohibited persons from causing further harm to others;  Breach of a court order disqualifying a person from managing a company.3⁰ Court orders are intended to prevent directors who have failed to comply with relevant legislation, who have committed fraud, or who have previously behaved recklessly or incompetently as a director from promoting or managing a company for the specified period (these can be permanent or for a period up to 10 years);  Breach of prohibition by Registrar or Financial Markets Authority (FMA)31 from managing a company.32 The Registrar or FMA may prohibit a person from managing a company for up to 10 years. This power may be exercised in respect of directors or persons who took part in management of a failed company, where the Registrar is satisfied that the way in which the company was managed was wholly or partly responsible for its failure;  Breach of prohibition by Registrar or FMA from managing a company (additional power).33 Such prohibitions are intended to 64  Information Inland Revenue holds on other persons or entities that are associated with, or related to, the specified person: This may include information necessary to understand beneficial ownerships or the nature of the structures the specified person is involved with.  Information Inland Revenue holds that is aggregated, derived or inferred that is relevant to the specified person (or associated or related persons): This may include judgements about compliance behaviour, and judgements on possible approaches by the specified person to compliance with tax and other legal obligations. Information shared would include documents Inland Revenue may have that would support another agency’s enforcement action. How will information be shared? Inland Revenue will share information in response to a request from the Registrar of Companies relating to the enforcement of the offences described above. In the case of offences involving breach of a prohibition or disqualification order, Inland Revenue will also be able to share information proactively that it discovers in the course of its day-to- day operations, which would be of interest to the Registrar of Companies in relation to those offences. In either case, the party initiating the sharing must have reasonable grounds to suspect that one of the specified serious offences has been, is being, or will be committed. The agency sharing or requesting information must also have reasonable grounds to suspect that the information shared or requested is relevant to the prevention, detection or investigation, or is evidence of, the serious offence or non-compliance. Inland Revenue will also need to ensure any information shared is readily available, and that is practicable and in the public interest that the information is provided to the Registrar of Companies. Information will be transferred on a case-by-case basis (bulk information transfer is not proposed). The provision of information will use existing administrative mechanisms that provide information regarding serious crime to the New Zealand Police and tax information to other jurisdictions under Double Tax Agreements. A central point in each agency will be responsible for dealing with all requests for information. A memorandum of understanding between the agencies will be required before any information sharing commences. This will outline the process for requesting and providing information, the protections available and requirements regarding security and use of information. If the information provided by Inland Revenue is subsequently used in a prosecution, at the time criminal disclosure obligations are triggered, the alleged offender must be informed that information was provided by Inland Revenue. This would enable the affected taxpayer 65 (the alleged offender) to challenge the decision to release the information if they wish. At this point the Court may consider the evidence is inadmissible, either due to a problem with the release of the information or on other Evidence Act 2006 grounds (as is standard in the existing criminal disclosure and evidence admissibility processes). This approach would have three benefits:  Preserving the affected person’s privacy interests and rights under section 21 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990;  Ensuring there is judicial scrutiny when the information provided is used, but not burdening the judiciary with every information request or provision; and  Providing a mechanism to ensure that decisions to release information are robust and appropriate by allowing for decisions to be reviewed. In addition, should an individual have concerns about how their information has been treated they will be able to either use the internal complaint procedures of Inland Revenue and/ or the Companies Office or seek assistance from the Office of the Privacy Commissioner. 1⁹ Rule 6, Credit Reporting Privacy Code 2004. 2⁰ The 18 months and 20% of gross income are used for illustrative purposes only and do not form part of the proposals. These are still to be determined. 21 Companies Office enforcement policy guidelines, 1 July 2013 - https://www.business.govt.nz/companies/about-us/ enforcement/policy-guidelines. 22 The sections referred to in the remainder of this chapter relate to the Companies Act unless otherwise stated. 23 Section 365. 2⁴ Habitual Non Complier Tier 1 Analysis, Inland Revenue 2012. 2⁵ While the current agreement with Police is an Approved Information Sharing Agreement (AISA) under part 9A of the Privacy Act, it is not intended that this will be the case for the agreement with the Registrar of Companies. Tax secret information about a company cannot currently be shared under an AISA. 2⁶ Section 138A. 2⁷ Section 377. 2⁸ Section 382. 2⁹ Sections 377-380 and dishonesty offences contained in the Crimes Act 1961. 3⁰ Section 383. 31 Information sharing with the Financial Markets Authority is not currently proposed; however further extensions of serious offence information sharing with other enforcement agencies will likely be considered following the introduction of this measure. 32 Section 385. 33 Section 385A. 3⁴ Section 386A. 3⁵ See section 373(4) and the sections referred to therein. 66 The Government has announced a number of proposals to simplify the tax rules for businesses to allow them to spend less time on tax compliance and more time on running their business. The measures outlined in this chapter comprise:  Fringe benefit tax (FBT) simplification for close companies;  Increasing the threshold for self- correction of minor errors;  Simplified calculation of deductions for dual use vehicles and premises;  Removing the requirement to renew resident withholding tax exemption certificates annually;  Increasing the threshold for annual FBT returns from $500,000 to $1 million of PAYE/ESCT; and  Modifying the 63 day rule on employee remuneration. FRINGE BENEFIT TAX CALCULATION FOR CLOSE COMPANIES Close companies that provide their shareholder-employees with a motor vehicle for private use are required to register and pay FBT on that benefit, with some exemptions. On the other hand, sole-traders and partners of a partnership who use a motor vehicle as part of their business are not required to register and pay FBT on that motor vehicle. Rather, they apportion expenditure incurred in relation to that vehicle between business and private use.3⁶ The amounts relating to private use are not deductible for tax purposes. This differing treatment for similar businesses arises purely because of the type of entity the business has chosen to trade through. Close companies are required to calculate the availability of a vehicle for private use to work out the amount of FBT to pay. Often this is calculated on an annual basis as these taxpayers pay FBT annually. This creates an additional compliance burden when they are providing a single fringe benefit, when compared to similar CHAPTER 7 MAKING THE SYSTEM SIMPLER 67 businesses being run as a partnership or a sole trader. The Government has announced that it will align the treatment of motor vehicles for these particular types of entities. This will remove the compliance costs incurred by a close company having to register for and pay FBT for no other reason than the provision of a motor vehicle to one or two shareholder-employees. The rules for motor vehicle expenditure contained in subpart DE for sole traders and partnerships will be extended to apply to close companies. This will be optional as there may be some close companies that are comfortable with the current treatment. There are three methods for apportioning business and private use:3⁷  Actual records - showing the reason and distance travelled for all business purposes;  Logbook records – maintained for a test period of at least 90 days to establish the extent of business use. This can then provide the basis for determining the business use of the motor vehicle for a three year period; or  Mileage rates – this method can only be used for less than 5,000 km of business travel - the actual business mileage is used multiplied by Inland Revenue mileage rates.3⁸ Taxpayers who use this option will no longer have to file and pay FBT on the single benefit they provide to their shareholder-employees. Instead they can use one of these methods to claim motor vehicle expenditure. For the avoidance of doubt, the private non-deductible portion of the expenditure will not be treated as a deemed dividend to the shareholder- employee. It is proposed that the option would be available to close companies who qualify for the close company option in the FBT rules3⁹ on the basis that the only fringe benefit they provide is the availability of 1 or 2 motor vehicles for the private use of their shareholder- employees. These taxpayers will have a choice on how to account for the private use of a motor vehicle provided to a shareholder-employee. One consideration for taxpayers is that in some circumstances there could be some GST adjustments required to reflect the change in how private use of the motor vehicle is calculated. These GST adjustments don’t currently arise for close companies under the FBT regime as GST is accounted for on the value of the benefit for FBT purposes. In addition, further calculations will be required when the vehicle is disposed of to reflect the private element of any gain or loss made. 68 Example 23: Mary is the controlling shareholder of Percyville Books Ltd which has a 31 March balance date. She is the only employee of her company. The company provides Mary with a vehicle for both business and unlimited private use. During the 2017 income year Mary’s business use of the vehicle was 40% of the running. The total costs relating to the vehicle for the year were $3,250. The cost price of the vehicle was $20,000. The company will have the choice of paying FBT on the availability for private use of the vehicle using the cost price of the vehicle as a basis and multiplying by 20% to get the value of the fringe benefit ($4,000) and pay FBT of $1,970. Alternatively, Mary could use the actual business use of the vehicle to apportion the costs related to the vehicle using the actual use records from a logbook she maintains fastidiously. This would result in the business not claiming 60% of the total running costs of $3,250 (i.e. $1,950). In addition, there will be differing adjustments required for GST purposes under each method. There is a question as to whether making this proposal optional provides an opportunity for taxpayers to cherry pick methods to pay the least amount year-by-year. Officials propose restricting the ability for taxpayers to do this if the proposal remains optional. Officials are interested in submissions on how changing methods could be restricted and also whether this proposal should be compulsory for close companies that meet the criteria. In addition, given the requirement to make adjustments for GST based on changes in actual use and when the motor vehicle is disposed of, officials consider the compliance cost savings of this proposal may be marginal. Officials would be interested in submitters’ views on this. INCREASING THE THRESHOLD FOR SELF-CORRECTION OF MINOR ERRORS Section 113A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 permits a person to correct an error in a return in the subsequent return where:  The return contains one or more errors for income tax, FBT or GST; and  The error was caused by a clear mistake, simple oversight or mistaken understanding by the person; and  The total discrepancy is $500 or less. Whilst in this example the option of measuring actual business use results in a deduction amount slightly less than the FBT amount to be paid, it does provide a more accurate measure of the business and private cost of the vehicle. It also aligns the treatment with other similar taxpayers who are not structured as a company. 69 If the error results in more than a $500 tax difference, then the taxpayer must ask the Commissioner to correct the error either through a voluntary disclosure or an application to amend the assessment under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Interest and penalties may be payable on a shortfall corrected by the Commissioner. The Government has announced that the self-correction threshold will increase from $500 to $1,000 of tax. This will allow taxpayers to correct simple errors of up to $1,000 (tax effect) in their next return. The proposal will remove the compliance costs of having to apply to the Commissioner for relatively small amounts, and help ensure that interest and penalties do not discourage voluntary disclosure. The $1,000 limit represents a maximum adjustment of income or deductions of $3,571 for a company, $3,030 for an individual and $7,667 for GST. These are relatively low values, particularly for larger businesses. Consequently, while the higher threshold will apply to all taxpayers, it will likely be of greatest benefit to small and medium businesses. This resulted in shortfall of GST of $652.17. Previously Ms Studebaker would have had to file a voluntary disclosure or section 113 application to amend Starliner’s February GST return. Now she is able to self-correct this error in Starliner’s March GST return without the worry of interest or penalties, and it saves her time by not having to contact Inland Revenue. Example 24: Starliner Limited (Starliner) produces drawer liners with celebrity pictures. Ms Studebaker owns Starliner and does all the tax filing for the company. In March she realises that she omitted to include taxable supplies of $5,000 (incl. GST) on her February GST return, because she miscoded it to a liability account in her accounting system. It is possible that taxpayers are already self-correcting these errors without making an application to the Commissioner. While changing the threshold may not have much immediate impact, it will provide more certainty to taxpayers. Consideration has been given to whether the self-correction threshold should be a percentage of the taxpayer’s tax or turnover rather than a flat amount. A percentage would result in a proportionate scale of self-correction (that is, the larger the business the larger the self- correction could be). However, this could allow large taxpayers to make significant corrections by dollar value, without review by Inland Revenue. For example, a taxpayer with a $50 million tax liability could make a $1 million adjustment if the threshold for self-correction was set at 2%. This represents $3.57 million of income or $7.67 million for GST. These are significant amounts, and for this reason a percentage threshold was not considered to be appropriate. 70 SIMPLIFIED CALCULATION OF DEDUCTIONS FOR DUAL USE VEHICLES AND PREMISES Small business owners often use their personal vehicles and homes for both business and private purposes. Because there are numerous expenses for these items, allocating them between business and personal use can create a large compliance obligation compared to the amount of tax at stake. In an effort to simplify the calculation of deductions and reduce compliance costs of calculating deductions for dual use home premises and vehicles, the Government has announced that taxpayers can use standard values rather than calculating actual costs. This proposal will generally only apply to small enterprises, as there is typically no private use of a larger enterprise’s assets. Vehicles It is proposed to extend and modify the current per kilometre option for calculating business use so it can be used regardless of kilometres travelled (the current rules only allow the method to be used if the business use is less than 5,000 km). Under this proposal, taxpayers would deduct a fixed amount per kilometre travelled for business purposes based on rates published by Inland Revenue. This would be instead of deducting actual costs. The rates would:  Be set by reference to industry figures, and based on the average per kilometre cost for the average vehicle;  Assume a fixed amount of private use in respect of the fixed cost element, so no apportionment between actual business and private use would be required;  Be divided into two tiers. The first tier would provide for the recovery of both the vehicle’s fixed costs and per kilometre costs. The second tier would provide for the recovery of the per kilometre costs only (as the fixed costs of vehicle ownership would be over- deducted as usage increased if a single fixed rate was used); and  Be published by Inland Revenue and updated each year to ensure they are accurate. Taxpayers would keep a logbook for a three month representative test period to determine the vehicle’s proportion of business use for the next three years. Alternatively the taxpayer could elect to maintain a logbook for the entire year and record the actual distance travelled for business purposes. The method would be optional to provide compliance cost savings for those who wish to use it. This is because there is a wide variance in the actual costs of car ownership, so a single rate would not be acceptably accurate for many taxpayers. 71 A more accurate compulsory method could be considered, but this would potentially erode the compliance cost savings. A disadvantage of making the method optional is that some taxpayers will calculate their deductions under both options and claim whichever results in the greater amount. However, an optional method will still provide compliance cost savings for those who wish to use it. A taxpayer would, however, be prevented from changing methods for a particular vehicle to reduce their ability to game the methods on the same vehicle. Example 25: Impala Limited (Impala) sells highly detailed model cars to collectors. As part of its business the owner of Impala, Chev Rolet, uses his personal car to deliver the models to various model shops around the city and also to the post office to send the models both within New Zealand and to international markets. At the end of each year Chev has traditionally tried to work out the total running costs of the vehicle, which means he has had to keep private receipts, for petrol, insurance, maintenance etc. In addition, he has had to keep a logbook to determine his business versus private running of the vehicle. Chev is keen to reduce the time it takes him to calculate the deduction for his vehicle and so begins using the new reimbursement rates set by Inland Revenue. The rates that Inland Revenue has calculated⁴⁰ are 74 cents per km for the first 5,000km and 20 cents for every km thereafter. Chev has kept a logbook for the first three months of the year which results in a ratio of business to total kilometres of 47%. Over the entire year Chev has driven 20,000km of which 9,400km (20,000 x 47%) have therefore been business related. Impala therefore claims $4,580 (5,000 x 74 cents + 4,400 x 20 cents) in its tax return for motor vehicle expenses which it, in turn, reimburses to Chev. 5,000km0 km 74 cents per km 20 cents for every kilometre after 5,000km First 5,000 km Additional 4,400 km 0.74c Inland Revenue rate for first 5,000km 0.20c Inland Revenue rate for after 5,000km $4,580 CLAIMED BY IMPALA 72 the method than their actual costs. Such taxpayers may consequently regard a compulsory measure as a cap on their deductions rather than a simplification. Introducing a new option will prompt some taxpayers to undertake both sets of calculations, in order to determine which gives the best result, and thereby undermine the compliance savings. It is unlikely that taxpayers would do this every year as premises expenses would likely remain fairly stable and so a reassessment of the calculation options would not be necessary. Officials recommend only allowing a deduction for rent, rates and mortgage interest under this method where there is a separately identifiable part of the house which is primarily used for business purposes. This is because a house is used primarily for domestic purposes, so some threshold of business use should be required before the house can be regarded as used for dual purposes. It is also more difficult to apportion expenses where no identifiable part of the house is used for business purposes. Currently this is not a strict requirement, although apportionment is usually made on this basis. Submitters’ views on this point are welcomed. Home premises It is proposed that the deduction for business use of home premises be calculated by multiplying the number of square metres used primarily for business purposes by a single rate. The rate would be:  Set by an Inland Revenue determination, based on the average cost of items such as utilities per square metre, but excluding rental or rates and mortgage interest costs;  Updated each year to ensure it is not eroded by inflation;  Different depending on whether the taxpayer owned or rented their premises; and  Reasonably accurate for most taxpayers, as there is less variance in the cost of utilities etc. per square metre than there is for vehicle costs. Taxpayers would also be able to claim a deduction for their actual mortgage interest, rates or rental costs, based on the percentage of the premises used primarily for business purposes. Officials consider there is too much variability in these costs for them to be included in a single representative rate. The method will be optional. While the method should produce a fairly accurate measure for most taxpayers, some taxpayers will be entitled to smaller deductions under 73 Example 26: Adventurer Limited (Adventurer) arranges adventure tourism activities in New Zealand for foreign tourists. George De Soto owns the company with his wife Flo and because of the timing of phone and video conference calls with foreign tour operators they have set up an office at home that is totally dedicated to the business. Flo does all the tax compliance for Adventurer and finds it takes a significant amount of time to calculate the deduction that relates to the home office. She has to work out the costs of electricity and other utilities to get to a final figure to claim in Adventurer’s tax return. Flo is keen to use the Inland Revenue rates instead to save her the hassle of doing this each year. She has worked out that the office space is 5.8% of the total floor area of 240 square metres of the house. She also knows that her interest and rates costs in relation to the mortgage on the property are $12,300. Inland Revenue has published the rate⁴1 that can be reimbursed in relation to a home office being $80 per square metre. Flo has calculated that the office takes up 13.92 square metres so takes a deduction in the tax return of Adventurer for $1,827 ($12,300 x 5.8% + 13.92 x $80). This calculation takes Flo a fraction of the time it used to take and works out to approximately the same amount. $12, 300 interest costs in relation to mortage on the property 13.92 sq m office space $80 reimbursement rate set by Inland Revenue 5.8% percentage of office space in the 240 sq m house $1,827 TAX DEDUCTION 240 sq m house 5.8% of the house $12, 300 interest and rates cost in relation to the mortage on the propery KITCHEN BEDROOM 1BATHROOM OFFICE GARAGE DINING AREA BEDROOM 2 74 REMOVING THE REQUIREMENT TO RENEW RESIDENT WITHHOLDING TAX EXEMPTION CERTIFICATES ANNUALLY Some taxpayers who hold a certificate of exemption from resident withholding tax (RWT) must renew their certificate annually. This is an Inland Revenue, rather than, a legislative requirement. Annual renewal is currently required if the applicant is applying for a RWT exemption certificate on the grounds that it has tax losses, a refund of over $500 RWT or estimated annual gross income of over $2 million. Applications on other grounds (such as actual annual gross income over $2 million in the prior year) do not require annual renewal. Taxpayers have indicated that this is creating compliance costs for relatively little value to the overall system. The Government wishes to reduce these compliance and administrative costs by legislatively requiring RWT exemption certificates to be issued for an unlimited period. This would apply for all the available grounds of exemption, except for the taxpayer income estimation option. Inland Revenue would have the discretion to issue exemption certificates for a shorter period in exceptional circumstances. Taxpayers will still be required to surrender their exemption certificates when they fail to meet the basis for eligibility on which it was granted. Inland Revenue will also retain its ability to cancel an exemption certificate. There is a concern that as renewal is not required, Inland Revenue may be unaware that a taxpayer might no longer be eligible for a RWT certificate. Officials consider that this can be adequately mitigated by including a simple “tick the box” declaration on a taxpayer’s tax return. This would require the taxpayer to confirm that they are still eligible to hold their exemption certificate on the basis on which it was granted. Example 27: Rambler Limited (Rambler) is owned by Bob Nash and arranges self-guided hiking trips. Rambler has not been doing well in the last few years due to people using phone apps to find their way on hikes rather than using the services of Rambler. Bob has created his own app that he hopes will turn the business around in the next five years. Until then Bob is keen for Rambler to obtain a certificate of exemption from RWT to get the funds back into Rambler. He applies for a certificate of exemption from RWT on the basis of the company being in tax losses. The Commissioner issues the exemption certificate to Rambler. At the end of the year when filing its tax return Bob ticks the box which states that Rambler still meets the criteria to hold the certificate of exemption as it continues to be in a loss position. Five years later, however, Rambler’s business has turned around and it is no longer in a tax loss position. At that point Bob returns the certificate of exemption to Inland Revenue as Rambler no longer meets the requirements to hold the certificate. 75 INCREASING THE THRESHOLD FOR ANNUAL FBT RETURNS FROM $500,000 TO $1 MILLION OF PAYE/ ESCT Most businesses are required to calculate and return FBT on a quarterly basis. However businesses with combined pay as you earn (PAYE) and employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) obligations of no more than $500,000 per year are currently allowed to calculate and return FBT on an annual basis.⁴2 Where a smaller business becomes larger and employs more staff, it may exceed the $500,000 threshold and be required to calculate and pay FBT on a quarterly basis. This can impose compliance costs which are still significant relative to the size of the business and can act as a disincentive to employing extra staff. The Government has announced an increase to this threshold which will allow a business with combined PAYE and ESCT of between $500,000 and $1m to continue accounting for FBT annually rather than changing to quarterly filing. This is intended to simplify compliance obligations for these businesses and lower their compliance costs. It is estimated this change will benefit approximately 1,500 taxpayers who currently fall between the current and proposed thresholds and who file FBT returns. Example 28: Eldorado Limited (Eldorado) is owned by Mr and Mrs Brougham and is a manufacturer of tacos. Because of the high quality of their tacos they are in demand and Eldorado needs more staff. They currently have 20 staff and have combined PAYE and ESCT obligations of $450,000 but need to double their employee count to 40. This will result in PAYE and ESCT obligations of $900,000. Eldorado provides fringe benefits to staff including medical and life insurance and unlimited supplies of taco seconds. The Broughams undertake the tax compliance work for the business with the assistance of a local accounting firm Cady Limited. They are not looking forward to having to prepare FBT returns quarterly and the costs of having Cady Limited review and file the returns for them. They also do not want to stop providing fringe benefits to staff as they are well received. Under the proposed change in the threshold for annual filing, Eldorado would not have to increase the frequency of filing until they tipped over the $1m threshold of combined PAYE and ESCT saving them both time and money they can instead devote to making tacos. 76 MODIFYING THE 63 DAY RULE ON EMPLOYEE REMUNERATION Section EA 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007 contains rules regarding the deferral of deductions for employee remuneration. This rule is commonly referred to as the “63 day adjustment” or “63 day rule”. The 63 day adjustment overrides the ordinary “incurred” test for deductibility. The rule provides that a deduction for accrued employee remuneration can be claimed in the year it is incurred only if the remuneration is paid by the end of the 63rd day⁴3 after the end of that income year. Employee remuneration covers all types of payments of employment income including salaries and wages, retirement leave, holiday pay and bonuses. The 63 day adjustment is intended to prevent taxpayers from claiming deductions for amounts of employee remuneration that have been accrued but not paid. It was introduced to specifically target deferred payment bonus schemes where employers were claiming large deductions for deferred bonus payments to staff and yet never paying those bonuses. This change is not intended to alter this fundamental principle. Currently, in order to comply with this deferred payment rule, taxpayers need to work out what employee remuneration has been paid during the 63 day period that relates to items accrued at the end of the previous income year. This can create an additional compliance burden for taxpayers because they need to track payments accrued at year end and paid within 63 days of the end of the income year. The current wording of the provision essentially imposes this compliance obligation on the taxpayer as they do not have a choice as to whether to take a deduction or defer this to the following income year. The Government has announced it intends altering this rule to make the deduction for payments made within 63 days of the income year optional for taxpayers. For those taxpayers that do not wish to undertake the exercise, it would not be required and the deduction for those payments can be claimed in the following year. Example 29: Skylark Limited (Skylark) is an airline that provides international passenger and freight services. It has a large workforce that comprises approximately 7,000 employees. At 30 June 2017, the end of Skylark’s income year, it has accrued employee remuneration of $58m, including accrued holiday pay of $12,000 for Bob Buick, representing 15 days annual leave. At the end of the 63 day period (2 Sept 2017) the tax manager at Skylark asks the payroll team to calculate the 63 day rule adjustment for the company. The payroll clerks have to determine the amount of employee remuneration that was accrued at year end but paid out within the 63 days. Bob was lucky enough to be able to have a holiday to the United States to visit the extended Buick family. 77 He made the 13 hour flight worth it by taking 18 days annual leave from 5-31 August. The payroll clerk has to match Bob’s 18 days of leave taken against his accrual at year end of 15 days and determine that for Bob, Skylark can only deduct $12,000 as the remaining 3 days leave was accrued after year end. The payroll clerk has to also do this for the 6,999 other employees. At the end of the exercise, because the month of August is not a popular time for people to take leave from Skylark, Skylark claims $250,000 as a deduction for employee remuneration accrued at year end and paid within 63 days. This results in a reduction in Skylark’s residual income tax of $70,000, however it cost Skylark $30,000 to calculate. Skylark decides that it will no longer undertake the 63 day rule calculation and instead will align the deductions with the payments made during the year to save the compliance costs of calculating the deduction. For some taxpayers this will result in a simpler rule than the current 63 day rule deducting payments of employee remuneration incurred and paid up to the end of the income year. The proposed change will not affect those who wish to continue to undertake the work to determine the deduction based on the existing rule as the existing rule will be optional. The current provision in section EA 4 will be modified to allow taxpayers to choose whether to apply the 63 day rule or not. Officials are interested in submitters’ views on the legislative aspects of this proposal. 3⁶ In accordance with the rules in subpart DE of the Income Tax Act 2007. 3⁷ See subpart DE 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 3⁸ See page 72 for proposed changes to this method. 3⁹ See subpart RD 60 of the Income Tax 2007. ⁴⁰ These rates are used for illustrative purposes only and do not represent actual or proposed rates. ⁴1 Again this rate is for illustrative purposes only.
