Appendix 5.1 myIR format and layout This section specifies the file format and layout that will be sent through the myIR system. 5.1.1 File format The file format for all myIR file transfer services is ASCII comma delimited format. 5.1.2 Location The output file must be placed in a directory that is easily accessible from the desktop. Depending on the file size, it can either be placed in a local or a LAN drive. 5.1.3 File naming suggestions There is no standard file naming required. However, for easier identification we suggest the following: • A unique, income tax period-based name. • Inclusion of the type of return to differentiate it from other returns, which may be required to be filed electronically in the future. • A CSV extension to indicate the file type. 5.1.4 Trailer record There is no trailer record required. File Upload Specification - Estate or trust beneficiary details V1.0 11 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5.2 Data attributes The following is a list of valid attributes accepted by the myIR system: Data type Description ALPHA Alphabetic characters only. Alphabetic: Any letter or space (“a” to “z”, “A” to “Z” and space). Leading and trailing spaces must be trimmed; field values must not be enclosed in quotes; blank values must have a format of comma comma i.e.,, NUM A positive integer of a given length. No ‘+’ sign (unless being used for a phone number). ANAM Alphabetic and numeric characters from a standard 101/102 keyboard except commas, square brackets, backslashes and quotation marks (“). Leading and trailing spaces must be trimmed; embedded spaces left as is; all spaces are invalid. PDEC Money in cents. The number should be a non-negative decimal integer. For example, if the amount is $547.98, the output format should be ‘54798’. No padding is required. Nil values should be represented by zero, i.e. 0. CURR Money in cents; the decimal point is implied; the number can be positive or negative. E.g. $102.67 is entered as 10267 DATE Any valid date in the format CCYYMMDD. IRD A valid 9 digit IRD number. It must be modulus 11 checked (see IRD number validation). Note that IRD numbers can contain eight or nine digits. From June 2008, IR introduced an extended number range for IRD numbers to include a new 9 digit range. When entering eight digit IRD numbers, you will need to add a leading zero (0), or they will be rejected by the data validation check. RANGE This field may only contain the values within the given range. Blank values must have a format of comma comma, i.e. ,, EMAIL This field will contain the email address. Email addresses must follow the RFC 5322 email standard. The full technical specification for this standard can be found here: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322 File Upload Specification - Estate or trust beneficiary details V1.0 12 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] 5.3 Inland Revenue (IRD) Number validation The IRD number format used by Inland Revenue is an eight- or nine-digit number consisting of the following parts – • A seven or eight digit base number • A trailing check digit Check digit validation The following steps are to be performed - 1. Check the valid range • If the IRD number is < 10-000-000 or > 150-000-000 then the number is invalid. This step ensures that the IRD number is in the already issued range or is in the range expected to be issued in the next 10 years. 2. Form the eight-digit base number: • Remove the trailing check digit. • If the resulting number is seven digits long, pad to eight digits by adding a leading zero. 3. Calculate the check digit: • To each of the base number’s eight digits a weight factor is assigned. From left to right these are: 3, 2, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2. • Sum together the products of the weight factors and their associated digits. • Divide the sum by 11. If the remainder is 0, the calculated check digit is 0. • If the remainder is not 0, subtract the remainder from 11, giving the calculated check digit. • If the calculated check digit is in the range 0 to 9, go to step 5. • If the calculated check digit is 10, continue with step 4. 4. Re-calculate the check digit : • To each of the base number’s eight digits a secondary weight factor is assigned. From left to right these are: 7, 4, 3, 2, 5, 2, 7, 6. • Sum together the products of the weight factors and their associated digits. • Divide the sum by 11. If the remainder is 0, the calculated check digit is 0. • If the remainder is not 0 then subtract the remainder from 11, giving the calculated check digit. • If the calculated check digit is 10, the IRD number is invalid. 5. Compare the check digit : • Compare the calculated check digit to the last digit of the original IRD number. If they match, the IRD number is valid. Example 1 IR number 49091850. The base number is 4909185 and the supplied check digit is 0. The number is greater than 10,000,000. Using the weightings above: (0\*3) + (4\*2) + (9\*7) + (0\*6) + (9\*5) + (1\*4) + (8\*3) + (5\*2) = 154. 154 / 11 = 14 remainder 0 (i.e. mod (154,11) = 0) The remainder (0) = check digit (0), so no further calculation is necessary. File Upload Specification - Estate or trust beneficiary details V1.0 13 \[UNCLASSIFIED\] Example 2 IR number 35901981. The base number is 3590198 and the supplied check digit is 1. The number is greater than 10,000,000. Using the weightings above: (0\*3) + (3\*2) + (5\*7) + (9\*6) + (0\*5) + (1\*4) + (9\*3) + (8\*2) = 142. 142 / 11 = 12 remainder 10 (i.e. mod (142,11) = 10) 11 – 10 = 1 which matches the check digit. The number is valid. Example 3 IR number 49098576. The base number is 4909857 and the supplied check digit is 6. The number is greater than 10,000,000. Using the weightings above: (0\*3) + (4\*2) + (9\*7) + (0\*6) + (9\*5) + (8\*4) + (5\*3) + (7\*2) = 177 . 177 / 11 = 16 remainder 1 (i.e. mod(177,11) = 1) 11 – 1 = 10 so perform the secondary calculation. (0\*7) + (4\*4) + (9\*3) + (0\*2) + (9\*5) + (8\*2) + (5\*7) + (7\*6) = 181 181 / 11 = 16 remainder 5 (i.e. mod(181,11) = 5) 11 – 5 = 6, this matches the check digit. The number is valid. Example 4 (9 digit IRD number) IR number 136410132. The base number is 13641013 and the supplied check digit is 2. The number is greater than 10,000,000. Using the weightings above: (1\*3) + (3\*2) + (6\*7) + (4\*6) + (1\*5) + (0\*4) + (1\*3) + (3\*2) = 89 . 89 / 11 = 8 remainder 1 (i.e. mod (89,11) = 1) 11 – 1 = 10 so perform the secondary calculation. (1\*7) + (3\*4) + (6\*3) + (4\*2) + (1\*5) + (0\*2) + (1\*7) + (3\*6) = 75 75 / 11 = 6 remainder 9 (i.e. mod (75,11) = 9) 11 – 9 = 2 which matches the check digit. The number is valid. Example 5 (9 digit IRD number) IR number 136410133. The base number is 13641013 and the supplied check digit is 3. The number is greater than 10,000,000. Using the weightings above: (1\*3) + (3\*2) + (6\*7) + (4\*6) + (1\*5) + (0\*4) + (1\*3) + (3\*2) = 89 . 89 / 11 = 8 remainder 1 (i.e. mod (89,11) = 1) 11 – 1 = 10 so perform the secondary calculation. (1\*7) + (3\*4) + (6\*3) + (4\*2) + (1\*5) + (0\*2) + (1\*7) + (3\*6) = 75 75 / 11 = 6 remainder 9 (i.e. mod (75,11) = 9) 11 – 9 = 2, this does not match the check digit (3). The number is invalid. Example 6 IR number 9125568. The number is less than 10,000,000 so fails the first validation. The number is invalid.

If you are a trustee of a trust, or the executor or administrator of a deceased person's estate you need to file an IR6 to account for income the estate or trust earns. In this guide we use "trustee" or "you" to refer to the person or persons administering an estate or trust. The word trust also refers to estates unless we've stated otherwise. This guide provides general information about how to complete the IR6 return. There are references throughout the guide to our other publications which may help you. If you still need help please call us on one of the telephone numbers listed under "Services you may need" at the back of this guide or contact a tax advisor. How income of an estate or trust is taxed in general In general, income of an estate or trust will be subject to income tax in New Zealand if it has a source in New Zealand regardless of the residency of the trustee. The trustee is also liable for New Zealand income tax on income derived outside New Zealand where any settlor of the trust is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year, or if the estate has a New Zealand trustee and the deceased was resident in New Zealand. Allocations Income of a trust is either trustee or beneficiary income. The trustee can allocate income as beneficiary income, provided the income either: • vests absolutely in the beneficiary in the income year, or • is paid or applied for the benefit of the beneficiary during that income year or within a specified period from the end of the income year. For more information see Question 18A on page 31. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE6 Trust income allocated as beneficiary income is taxable income, except as covered below under the special rules for allocations to minor beneficiaries. Distributions In addition to allocating beneficiary income, a trustee can make distributions to beneficiaries. A distribution can be made up of: (a) tax-paid profits (trustee income or beneficiary income) (b) capital gains of the trust (c) corpus of the trust (the capital contributed to set up the trust) (d) (for a foreign trust) non-taxed profits such as foreign- sourced income. The tax position of a distribution from a trust depends on the type of trust making the distribution and the residency of the beneficiary. See pages 11 to 12 of this guide. Generally, a distribution to a New Zealand resident beneficiary from: (a) a complying trust is not taxable (b) a foreign trust is taxable, to the extent it is not part of the corpus or capital gains (c) a non-complying trust is taxable at 45 cents in the dollar, to the extent it is not part of the corpus. Allocations of beneficiary income to a minor A minor is defined as a New Zealand resident under the age of 16 years on the balance date of the trust. Allocations of beneficiary income that the minor beneficiary rule applies to are treated as trustee income. This means they are: • taxed at 33% • included in the trustee's tax calculation in the IR6 return, and • included in the trustees' provisional tax calculations. The minor beneficiary should not include this income in their Individual income tax return (IR3). www.ird.govt.nz 7 Exceptions to the minor beneficiary rule The following exceptions allow income allocated to a minor beneficiary to be treated as beneficiary income if the income: • is derived by a minor for whom a child disability allowance is paid under the Social Security Act 1964, or • is derived directly from either a group investment fund, the Māori trustee or a Māori authority, or • the amount allocated to the minor from the trust is $1,000 or less in an income year. If the $1,000 threshold is exceeded, the total income allocated to the minor beneficiary is taxed as trustee income. For example, if a minor beneficiary is allocated $1,200, the total allocation of $1,200 is taxed at 33%. The general anti-avoidance rule may apply if a person establishes multiple trusts to increase the number of exemptions. See Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 19, No 4 (May 2007) for further information. Note There are further exceptions to the minor beneficiary rule that relate to the nature of the settlements on the trust. For further information, please see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001). Return due date If the estate or trust has a 31 March balance date you have until 7 July 2018 to send in the return, unless you have been granted an extension of time. If you have a balance date other than 31 March, the due date may be different. Call us on 0800 377 774 if you’re not sure. If the estate or trust is the client of an agent, it may have until 31 March 2019 to file the return. Contact your agent for more information. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE8 International obligations You may also need to provide information about a trust to comply with the following international obligations. The Common Reporting Standard (CRS) For further information see: • IR Guidance on the CRS (IR1048) section 11 • CRS: Is the Trust a Reporting NZ Financial Institution (IR1052) • Family Trust obligations under the CRS (IR1053) • or go to www.ird.govt.nz/crs Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) For further information see: • FATCA Trusts Guidance (IR1087) • FATCA status of NZ trusts that are not US person (IR1086) • go to www.ird.govt.nz/fatca www.ird.govt.nz 9 Questions Questions 1 to 6 The information in Questions 1 to 6 of the return helps us to be sure that any correspondence we send goes to the right person at the right address. Fill in these questions only if the correct information is not printed on the return. Question 1 IRD number If the estate or trust does not have an IRD number complete an IRD number application - resident non-individual (IR596) and send it in with the return. Question 2 Name of estate or trust If the estate or trust has changed its name since the last time a return was filed, please provide proof of the change so we can update our records, eg, trustee resolution. Questions 3 and 4 Postal address and phone number If you have a new postal address, write the details at Question 3. If your new postal address is a PO Box number, please show your box lobby if you have one. If you're unsure please contact New Zealand Post. If the estate or trust uses its tax agent's postal address, leave this panel blank. Your tax agent will let us know of any change of address when updating their client list. We ask for your daytime phone number at Question 4 in case we need to call you with questions about the return. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE10 Question 5 Business industry classification (BIC) code We're required to supply the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) with a code for your business or trading activity, for levy classification and calculation. If your BIC code isn't pre-printed on the return or is different from the pre-printed one, please enter the correct code. To work out your main business or trading activity and its code, go to www.businessdescription.co.nz or call ACC on 0800 222 776. It's important that you choose the code which most accurately reflects your main business or trading activity. Please provide the code only. Don't provide a description. Note Question 6 Bank account number The fastest and safest way to get any refund is to have it direct credited to your New Zealand bank account or other deposit account, eg, a building society account. If your bank account number isn't preprinted on the return form, please include it at Question 6. If your suffix has only two digits, enter them in the first two squares of the suffix box. Question 7A Has the estate or trust ceased? If the estate or trust has ceased, include accounts showing the distribution of all assets and liabilities to the date the estate or trust was finalised. If the estate or trust is registered for GST or as an employer, you'll need to complete a Business cessation (IR315) form to finalise your records. www.ird.govt.nz 11 Question 7B Nil trust returns If the trust receives any income, eg, interest, the trustee must file a return regardless of the amount of income derived. Where a trust has no prospect or intention of deriving any income in a given financial year, please call us on 0800 377 774 with the name and IRD number of the trust so we can record that a return isn't required for that year. If the trust subsequently derives income in a future year, the trust must send in a return. This only applies to trust returns. Estates are still required to file a return of income regardless of whether they have derived income. Note A complying trust that is non-active and doesn’t want to file an income tax return can complete and send the Non-active trust declaration (IR633): The complying trust needs to declare: • It hasn’t derived or been deemed to have derived any gross income from any source. • It has no deductions. • It has not been party to, or continued with, any transactions with assets of the trust that give rise to any of the following during the tax year: a. Income or deemed income in any person’s hand. b. Fringe benefits to any employee or former employee. Question 8 Types of estates and trusts The type of trust determines the way certain distributions are taxed in the hands of beneficiaries. There are three types of estates or trusts for income tax purposes: • complying • foreign • non-complying. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE12 Complying trust In general a complying trust is one that has been taxed in New Zealand on all its trustee income since the date it began and the trustee has met all it's tax obligations. Complying trusts include: • trusts settled by New Zealand residents with New Zealand trustees and New Zealand beneficiaries • estates of people who were New Zealand residents when they died • foreign trusts that have elected to become complying trusts. The trust can still be a complying trust if the trustee was not liable for New Zealand income tax because: • the trust earned no income, or • the income was exempt, or • the trust was in a loss situation. Foreign trust A foreign trust is one where no settlor of the trust has been resident in New Zealand since: • 17 December 1987, or the date the trust was first settled, whichever is later, and on the date of distribution. Non-complying trust A trust that isn't a complying trust or a foreign trust is a non- complying trust. Non-complying trusts include: • trusts with a New Zealand-resident settlor, but non- resident trustees, that haven't been liable for or haven't paid New Zealand income tax on all trustee income since first being settled • foreign trusts where the settlor has become a New Zealand resident and an election hasn't been made to be a complying trust • all the beneficiaries are non-residents and all the income is passive income such as interest, dividends, and royalties. www.ird.govt.nz 13 Election to change category of trust for tax purposes New residents or former residents who have settled a trust before coming to New Zealand may elect to pay New Zealand tax on future trustee income. Making this election will mean the trust becomes a complying trust for income derived on or after the date on which the election is made. An election can be made by a settlor, trustee or beneficiary using an Election to pay income tax on trustee income (IR463) form. If an election isn't made the trust will become a non- complying trust. Elections must be made within 12 months of a new resident ceasing to be a transitional resident, and within 12 months of the arrival for a former resident. Unit trust A unit trust is treated as a company for tax purposes. If you're preparing a tax return for a unit trust, please complete a Companies income tax return (IR4). Group investment fund If the income is: • solely from Category B income, an IR6 must be completed • solely from Category A income, an IR4 must be completed • a combination of both Category A and Category B income, an IR4 and IR44E must be completed. Please read the notes on the IR44E for further information. Superannuation schemes A superannuation scheme that isn't registered with the Financial Markets Authority and doesn't allow investors to contribute will be treated as a trust for tax purposes and must file an IR6 return. Income and credits section Income received by a trust retains its character as it passes through the trust. For this reason we ask that you return different types of income in certain boxes. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE14 Question 9 New Zealand interest Include interest from all New Zealand sources at Question 9. The interest payer will usually send you an RWT withholding certificate (IR15), or similar statement, showing the gross interest paid and the amount of RWT deducted. Write the total of all RWT deducted in Box 9A. Add up all the gross interest amounts (before the deduction of any tax) and write the total in Box 9B. If expenses are deductible against the interest income (eg, commission), claim them at Question 19. Read about expenses on page 33. Don't send in any interest statements or IR15 certificates with your return, but keep them in case we ask for them later. Note Interest on broken term deposits If you've broken a term deposit during the year, you may have to account for "negative interest". This is interest repaid on a term deposit and may reduce the amount of interest to declare in your return. If the term deposit was broken in full, or it was business related, deduct the negative interest from the gross interest shown on the IR15 or equivalent statement. Deduct the allowable negative interest component, using the worksheet below, before entering the gross amount at Box 9B on your return. In all other cases, the negative interest is deductible in a future income year when the term deposit matures. Worksheet Copy your gross interest from your RWT withholding certificate to Box 1. 1 Print any negative interest you've paid in Box 2. 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the answer in Box 3. Copy this amount to Box 9B of your tax return. 3 www.ird.govt.nz 15 Interest paid or charged by Inland Revenue If we paid you interest, include it in Box 9B for the income year the trust received the interest. If the trust paid us interest, include it as a deduction in Box 19 of the return for the income year the interest is paid. Interest from overseas If the trust received interest from overseas, convert your overseas interest and tax credits to New Zealand dollars and show the amounts at Question 13. Please read the notes about overseas income on pages 20 to 24. Income from financial arrangements The financial arrangement rules generally require income or expenditure from financial arrangements to be spread over the term of the arrangement. Financial arrangements include term deposits, government stock, local authority stock, mortgage bonds, futures contracts and deferred property settlements. Trustees are required to use a spreading method unless they are a cash basis person. A person is a cash basis person if: • the value of all financial arrangements together is less than $1 million, or • the value of the income or expenditure from the financial arrangement is less than $100,000, and • the deferral of income or expenditure using the cash method rather than the actual method is less than $40,000. A special rule applies for deceased persons. If the deceased person was a cash basis person at the date of death, the concession applies in the year of death and up to four succeeding years. Any RWT from a financial arrangement will be deducted on a cash basis. Different rules apply for financial arrangements entered into prior to 20 May 1999. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE16 Sale or maturity of financial arrangements Whether or not the exemption from the spreading methods explained earlier applies, when a financial arrangement matures or is sold, remitted, or transferred, a "wash-up" calculation known as a base-price adjustment must be carried out. Cash basis persons can use the Sale or disposal of financial arrangements (IR3K) to perform the calculation. This form could be used, for example, to calculate the amount you need to account for if you have broken a term deposit in full. For further information about the financial arrangements rules, please see Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 11, No 6 (July 1999), page 3. Any RWT will be deducted on a cash basis. Question 10 New Zealand dividends Dividends are the part of a company's profits that it passes on to its shareholders. Unit trusts are treated as companies for income tax purposes. Distributions from unit trusts will generally be taxable and are treated as dividends. All the trust's cash and taxable bonus issue dividends derived from a qualifying company must be distributed by the trustees as beneficiary income to the beneficiaries who are not trustees or companies that are not qualifying companies. Note Complete Question 10 if you received any New Zealand dividends, including dividends from your local electricity or gas supplier. Don't include a dividend that's a distribution of the trust's capital and is tax free. The company or unit trust that paid you the dividend will send you a dividend statement. Don't send any dividend statements with the return, but keep them in case we ask for them later. www.ird.govt.nz 17 If expenses are deductible against the dividend income, claim them at Question 19. Note Credits attached to dividends "Imputation credits" are credits for part of the tax the company has already paid on its profits, which means the dividends aren't taxed twice. RWT is deducted from your dividend to bring the total credits withheld up to 33% of the gross dividend. What to show in your return Your dividend statements show the amount: • you received (net dividend) • of any imputation credits • of any RWT credits. Add all these amounts together to work out your total gross dividends and enter this in Box 10B. Add up all the imputation credits and print the total in Box 10. Add any dividend RWT credits and print the total in Box 10A. Shares instead of dividends If the trust received shares instead of dividends, include them as income at Question 10B. Write the amount as if you received dividends instead of shares. Dividends from overseas Please read about overseas income on pages 19 to 23 of this guide. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE18 Question 11 Māori authority distributions Māori authorities can make various types of distributions. Fill in Question 11 if you received any taxable Māori authority distributions. The Māori authority that paid you the distribution will send you a Māori authority distribution statement. Credits attached to distributions The Māori authority may attach a credit to the distribution it makes to members. This credit will be classified as a "Māori authority credit". It is usually part of the tax the Māori authority has already paid on its profits, which means the distributions aren't taxed twice. What to show in your return Your Māori authority distribution statement shows the amount of: • the distribution made to you, including what portion is taxable and what portion is non-taxable • Māori authority credit. Transfer these amounts, leaving out any non-taxable distributions, to the relevant boxes at Question 11. Non-taxable distribution You don't need to include in the IR6 return any other distributions received from a Māori authority that aren't taxable in the hands of a Māori authority member. These amounts are non-taxable distributions and can't have credits attached. For more information read our Māori authorities guide (IR487). www.ird.govt.nz 19 Question 12 Partnership, estate or trust income Partnership If the estate or trust received any income from a partnership, write the details at Question 12. Don't include: • interest and RWT (include these at Question 9) • any dividends, imputation credits or dividend RWT (include these at Question 10) • any Māori authority dividends and Māori authority credits (include these at Question 11) • any overseas income and qualifying tax credits attached (include these at Question 13). Estate or trust If the estate or trust has received income from a foreign or non-complying trust, complete a Schedule of beneficiary's estate or trust income (IR307) and attach it to the return. Add up all the other income from partnerships, complying and foreign trusts, and write the total in Box 12B. Add up any other tax credits and write the total in Box 12A. Don't include: • interest and RWT (include these at Question 9) • any dividends, imputation credits or dividend RWT (include these at Question 10) • any Māori authority dividends and Māori authority credits (include these at Question 11) • any overseas income and qualifying tax credits attached (include these at Question 13). If the estate or trust has received a taxable distribution from a non-complying trust do not include the amount as income. Calculate tax on the taxable distribution at 45 cents in the dollar and add it to the amount in Box 25B. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE20 You can use a loss to reduce the amount of the taxable distribution. Net losses brought forward from an earlier income year and losses incurred in the 2017 income year can be used to reduce the amount. If a loss is used in this way it is no longer available to offset other income. The reduction is calculated using the following formula: (Tax loss × 0.33) ÷ 0.45 Losses from limited partnerships If the estate or trust is claiming a loss from a limited partnership and you need help working out the amount that can be claimed, go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: limited partnership loss deduction calculator). Question 13 Overseas income If the trust received overseas income, eg, interest or financial arrangements, show this at Question 13. Convert all overseas income and qualifying overseas tax paid to New Zealand dollars. You can do this by: • using the rates available on www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: overseas currency) • contacting the overseas section of a trading bank and asking for the exchange rate for the day you received your overseas income. Include any overseas income and credits which you received from a partnership, Look-through company (LTC), estate or trust here. Include gross income before deducting any tax credits at Box 13B. Credit for tax paid overseas will be limited to the amount of New Zealand tax payable on that income. How overseas income of an estate or trust is taxed In New Zealand, overseas income is taxed according to the residency of the settlor. The rules for the three most common situations are described over the page. www.ird.govt.nz 21 New Zealand resident trustees and income derived outside New Zealand As a general rule, where a trustee is resident in New Zealand, and the trustee derives an amount from outside New Zealand, that income will be income of the trustee. The amount will be exempt income of the trustee if: • no settlor of the trust except a transitional resident is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year, • that trust is not a testamentary trust (trust created by a person under their will) or an inter vivos trust (trust created by the settlor during their lifetime) where any settlor of the trust died resident in New Zealand, whether in that income year or otherwise. Non-resident trustees and income derived outside of New Zealand A non-resident trustee is also liable for New Zealand income tax on income derived from outside New Zealand where: • any settlor is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year, or • any settlor of an inter vivos or a testamentary trust died while they were resident in New Zealand, and a trustee is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year. Exceptions to the general rule for non-resident trustees and income derived outside New Zealand There are two situations in which a non-resident trustee is not liable for income tax on trustee income derived from outside New Zealand. These apply where the trustee is resident outside New Zealand at all times during the income year and either: • no settlement has been made on the trust since 17 December 1987, or • the only settlements made on the trust were by settlors who were not resident in New Zealand at the time of settlement and who have not been residents in New Zealand since 17 December 1987. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE22 Neither exception applies where an election to pay tax on trustee income has been made by the trustee. These exceptions do not affect the liability to income tax for any settlor of the trust, for example, where the settlor elects to pay tax on trustee income. The trustee income remains liable for income tax for the purpose of determining whether the trust is a complying trust (formerly qualifying trust). Overseas dividends If you are a New Zealand resident trustee and at any time during the 2018 income year you held rights such as shares, units or an entitlement to benefit in any foreign company, foreign trust, foreign superannuation scheme, or foreign life insurance policy, you may be required to calculate foreign investment fund (FIF) income or loss on those investments and include this amount in Box 13B. Generally, you will use the fair dividend rate to calculate FIF income. The trustees may also need to file an additional FIF disclosure form. For more information read the guide to Question 23 on page 36. You will not need to do this if the investment is covered by an exclusion. The main exclusions from an interest in an FIF are: • investments in certain Australian resident companies listed on approved indices on the Australian stock exchange, that maintain franking accounts. Investments covered in the list are available in the Australian share exemption list (IR871) • interest in certain Australian units • limited exemptions for interests in certain venture capital • limited exemptions for interests in certain venture capital interests that move offshore (for 10 or more income years from the income year in which the company migrates from New Zealand) • a 10% or greater interest in a controlled foreign company (CFC). www.ird.govt.nz 23 A limited number of trusts are also excluded from the rules if the attributing interests are below $50,000. These are: • a testamentary trust • a compensatory trust • where the settlor of the trust is the Accident Compensation Corporation. If the exclusions apply and the trust is under the threshold, include dividends received in Box 13B and any qualifying overseas tax credits in Box 13A. If your dividend exceeds your FIF income, the amount of imputation credit you can claim is calculated on the basis of your FIF income. If your FIF income exceeds your dividend, you can claim the entire imputation credit attached to the dividend. Any excess imputation credit can't be carried forward to the next year or coverted to a loss. Note Please note you can't claim Australian franking credits. For more information about the FIF rules read A guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate (IR461), Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 19, No 3 (April 2007) page 28, Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 20, No 3 (April 2008) page 110, or go to www.ird.govt.nz/toii/fif CFC income or loss If at any time during the 2018 income year the trust has attributed CFC income or loss, the trustees or beneficiaries may be required to calculate this in their own income tax return(s). A loss from a CFC can't be used to offset domestic income or be included in domestic losses that are carried forward to the 2019 income year. Generally, these losses can only offset income or future income from CFCs that are resident in the same country as the CFC that incurred the loss. The trustees may also need to file an additional CFC disclosure form. See Question 23 on page 36. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE24 Investments in portfolio investment entities (PIEs) and portfolio investor attributed income/loss If you receive dividends from a PIE that is a listed company and doesn't use your prescribed investor rate (PIR), you may choose whether to include the dividends in your return. The attributed PIE income/loss is included in the estate or trust's return for the period that includes the end of the PIE's income year. PIEs usually have a 31 March balance date. The amount of income derived by the estate or trust as a distribution by a PIE is excluded income of the estate or trust other than fully imputed dividends from a PIE that is a listed company and doesn't use your PIR. Further information is available in our guide Information for trustees who invest in PIEs (IR856). Question 14 Look-through company (LTC) income If the estate or trust received any tax credits and/or income from an LTC write the details at Question 14. Don't include any of the following types of income received from an LTC at Question 14: • interest and RWT (include these at Question 9) • any dividends, imputation credits, and dividend RWT (include these at Question 10) • Māori authority distributions and credits (include these at Question 11) • any overseas income and qualifying tax credits attached (include these at Question 13) • rental income (include this at Question 15). The loss limitation rule limits the amount of deductions an LTC owner (shareholder) can claim if the amount exceeds the owner’s “owner’s basis” (equity) in the LTC. For the 2017-18 and later income years, the loss limitation rule only applies to an LTC which is in a partnership or joint venture which includes another LTC. www.ird.govt.nz 25 The estate or trust can now claim the full amount of prior years’ non-allowable deductions brought forward this year. This won’t apply if the loss limitation rule continues to apply to limit the amount claimable. The LTC will normally supply information about the non- allowable deductions and any other information required to complete your return. Trust A is an owner of an LTC which is not in a partnership or joint venture that includes another LTC. For the 2017-18 income year Trust A has a net loss of $4,000.00 from the LTC. Trust A also has prior years’ non-allowable deductions brought forward of $5,000.00. Trust A had no tax credits from the LTC for the year. Trust A’s tax return should show the following amounts in the following boxes: • 14A: $0.00 • 14B: $4,000.00 - • 14C: $0.00 • 14D: $5,000.00 • 14E: $9,000.00 - Example What to show on your return Add up all other tax credits received from the LTC and print the total in Box 14A. Add up all LTC income, deduct expenses not already included elsewhere and print in Box 14B. If a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Add up all non-allowable deductions this year and print in Box 14C. There shouldn’t be non-allowable deductions this year unless the loss limitation rule applies. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE26 Add up all prior year non-allowable deductions claimable this year and print the amount in Box 14D. You’ll be able to claim the full amount of non-allowable deductions brought forward from last year if the loss limitation rule no longer applies. If you have an amount in Box 14C, add this to Box 14B and put the total in Box 14E. If you have an amount in Box 14D, subtract this from Box 14B and put the total in Box 14E. If you don't have any amounts in Box 14C or Box 14D, copy the amount from Box 14B to 14E. Box 14E is your adjusted LTC income. You can find more information about LTCs in the Look- through companies (IR879) guide. Question 15 Business or rental income If the estate or trust has business or rental income, you must attach either: • a fully completed Financial statements summary (IR10) form, or • a set of the estate or trust's financial accounts for the year. The IR10 summarises the information we need from the financial accounts. If you complete an IR10 you don't need to send us your financial accounts, but you still need to complete and keep them. Business income Write the net profit in Box 15B. This is the amount of income or net loss after all allowable business expenditure has been deducted. If the total is a loss, put a minus sign in the last box at Box 15B. When calculating business income, you can use the Schedule of business income (IR3B) form. www.ird.govt.nz 27 Rental income If there is rental income, print the net profit or loss (total rents minus expenses) in Box 15B. When calculating rental income you can use the Rental income (IR3R) form. Attribution rule Under the attribution rule, anyone whose actions cause an associated person (company, trust or partnership) to earn income, can be personally liable for tax on that income. If this rule applies to persons associated with your estate or trust, it will affect the amount of taxable income in this return. For more information read our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 12, No 12 (December 2000) page 49 and TIB, Vol 13, No 11 (November 2001). Question 16 Other income At Question 16 show any other income received by the estate or trust, eg, income from: • any undertaking or scheme • sale of land and/or buildings • sale of shares or other property • sale or disposal of assets • any schedular payments received by a trust • certain settlements on a trust • forgiveness of debt. Read the following sections for more information on the above items. Income from any undertaking or scheme Profits made from any undertaking or scheme entered into for the purpose of making a profit, are taxable to the estate or trust. On a separate sheet of paper write down what the undertaking or scheme was and list the details of income and expenses from these undertakings and schemes. Staple it to page 3 of the return and include the total profit in Box 16B. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE28 Income from sale of land and/or buildings Profits from the sale of land and/or buildings will be taxable if the estate or trust: • buys a property for resale • buys and sells land and/or buildings as a business • trades as a builder and improves a property before selling it. • purchased a property on or after 1 October 2015 and sold/disposed of it within two years, whether the intention at the time of purchase was for resale or not. These profits may be taxable if the estate or trust: • subdivides land and sells sections, or • has a change in designation on its property under the Resource Management Act 1991 and sells it within 10 years of buying. If the estate or trust is a New Zealand tax resident it will need to pay tax on its worldwide income under New Zealand tax law. This includes any property sales worldwide whether caught under the bright-line test for residential property sales or the other property rules. Complete a Property sale information (IR833) form for each property sold/disposed of and include it with the return. The form explains how to calculate and correctly return the resulting profit or loss. The form can be downloaded from our website www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword: IR833). Complete the form even if the details have been included in a Financial statements summary (IR10) or set of accounts. Include total profits in Box 16B. Income from sale of shares or other property Profits from the sale of shares or other property are taxable if the estate or trust: • buys and sells shares or other property as a business • buys shares or other property for the purpose of resale • buys shares or property to make a profit. List the details of income and expenses from these sales on a sheet of paper and staple it to page 3 of the return. Include the total profit in Box 16B. www.ird.govt.nz 29 Sale or disposal of assets There are a number of rules that apply to the sale or disposal of assets. For further information read Part 3 of our guide Depreciation - a guide for businesses (IR260). Losses from sale of land, buildings, shares that aren't FIFs, or other property If the estate or trust has made a loss and can show that if it had made a profit it would have been taxable, it may be able to claim the loss as a deduction. If the property was purchased on or after 1 October 2015 with no intention to sell and it was sold/disposed of within two years, any excess deductions can't be claimed unless they can be offset against net income from other property sales. The Property sale information (IR833) form has more information on this. For more information on property sales see our guide Buying and selling residential property (IR313). Show the loss with a minus sign in the the last box at Box 16B. PAYE income accrued to date of death The following types of PAYE income must be returned by the estate if it is accrued to the date of death and subsequently received by the estate: • salary or wages • holiday pay or other leave payments • director's fees • any other PAYE income (includes schedular payments). Include the total gross amount in Box 16B and any tax credits in Box 16A. This income is assessed as trustee income. Certain settlements on a trust The following settlements of property on a trust are deemed to be trustee income. This means that these settlements of property are excluded from the definition of corpus: • property settled by a trustee of another trust, so long as it would have counted as income if that trust had distributed the property to one of its beneficiaries instead. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE30 • a settlement of a property on a trust, which, if not for the settlement, would have constituted: - income of the settlor, or - a dividend for which the settlor would have been liable to deduct an FDP (foreign dividend payment), formerly dividend witholding payment, if the settlor is currently resident or had been resident in New Zealand and subject to income tax at that time. Forgiveness of debt The financial arrangements rules treat debts that do not have to be repaid because they have been forgiven as income to the debtor. There is an exception in the case of trusts if the creditor is a natural person and forgives the debt: • due to "natural love and affection" for natural persons who are beneficiaries of the trust, or • of a trust that was established mainly for the benefit of charitable organisations. If the debt forgiven is distributed to a non-qualifying beneficiary, the trustee can be liable for tax. For further information, please see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 11, No 6 (July 1999) page 20. Question 16AA - Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) credit The estate or trust can claim a credit for RLWT deducted from the sale of a property. If more than one amount was deducted, show the combined amount. Show the amount of RLWT deducted, less any RLWT paid back to the estate or trust and/or transferred to outstanding amounts. Show the name of the the estate or trust's withholder(s) in the "Name of payer" box. Question 17 • Add up Boxes 9B to 13B, 14E, 15B and 16B and write the total in Box 17B. If there is a loss write a minus sign in the last box. Add up Boxes 9A to 16A and write the total in Box 17A. Do not include Box 10 in this total. www.ird.govt.nz 31 Question 18 Income allocation Income derived by a trustee must be allocated between beneficiary income and trustee income in boxes 18A and 18B respectively. Question 18A - Beneficiary income excluding minor beneficiaries Beneficiary income is income of an estate or trust that vests in a beneficiary during the year or is paid to a beneficiary (or credited to them or dealt with in their interest or on their behalf) during the year or within a certain period after the end of the year. The rest of the income generated by an estate or trust will be trustee income. The income available to allocate to beneficiaries may be the income in Box 17B but it is important to note that Box 17B is a total of various amounts of estate or trust income. Some of the amounts, such as income from rental activities, are net amounts ie after deductions. Some of the deductions may be for non-cash outgoings, such as depreciation. This may result in there being income that can be distributed to beneficiaries despite Box 17B showing a loss, and providing the trust deed for the trust allows it. This means there may be amounts that vest in or are paid to beneficiaries that have to be treated as beneficiary income. Identify any such vesting or payment and include the amount in Box 18A. The total must reconcile with the combined totals of Boxes 24H on the IR6B after deducting any taxable distributions included in Box 24G. Timing of allocation of beneficiary income Allocation of income to a beneficiary must be made within the income year, or by the later of the following: • six months after balance date, or • the earlier of: - the date on which the trustee files the return of income for the income year, or - the date by which the trustee must file a return for the income year. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE32 A family trust is allocating income to beneficiaries for the year ended 31 March 2018. The trust return is due on 7 July 2018 and the trust plans to file by 30 June. The income should be allocated by the later of the following: • 30 September 2018, or • the earlier of: - 30 June 2018, or - 7 July 2018. In this case the income must be allocated by September 2018. Example If the trust has a tax agent, the extension of time for filing income tax returns may apply. Question 18B - Trustee income including minor beneficiaries Trustee income is any income generated by an estate or trust that isn't beneficiary income, see "Question 18A - Beneficiary income" on page 31. It includes income accrued to date of death and received afterwards. Where Box 17B shows a loss, there will be no trustee income and Box 18B should be left blank. The loss in Box 17B will be taken into account by us in calculating the loss to carry forward. Accrued income and non-apportionment clauses As a general rule, accrued income to date of death is retained by the trustee and becomes part of the capital of the estate. This income is treated as trustee income. However, where the will of the deceased taxpayer contains a non-apportionment clause, the beneficiary is entitled to receive the income accrued to date of death. So, if the accrued income is paid to the beneficiary, it's treated as beneficiary income. www.ird.govt.nz 33 Question 19 Expenses The estate or trust may have incurred expenses in generating its income, for example: • commission deducted from interest or dividends • expenses for return preparation • deductible trustee charges • interest paid to Inland Revenue. If these expenses haven't been claimed elsewhere in the return, write the amount claimed in Box 19. Certain expenditure is not deductible and this includes: • private expenditure • capital expenditure penalties may apply if it is claimed incorrectly. Note Question 20 Net losses brought forward There are two types of losses the estate or trust can bring forward. Specified activity net losses These are net losses from before the 1991 income year, which were limited to $10,000. If the estate or trust made a profit from a specified activity, the estate or trust can offset it without limitation against net losses brought forward from this activity. If the net losses exceed the profit, the estate or trust can offset up to $10,000 against other income in the return. Other net losses All losses incurred from the 1991 income year onwards and other net losses that weren't limited before 1991 (including any net loss resulting from excess imputation credits) are "other net losses". Enter the total of all specified activity net losses and other net losses the estate or trust can bring forward to 2018 in Box 20A. Enter the amount the estate or trust has offset against 2018 income in Box 20B. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE34 You'll find the amount of net loss the estate or trust has to bring forward on the loss notice we sent you with the 2017 income tax assessment. If you don't have a loss notice, call us to obtain the figure. Note Losses cannot be transferred from the deceased's return to the estate's return. Any such losses lapse. Trust losses cannot be passed to beneficiaries. They remain in the trust to be offset against future trustee income. If the estate or trust can't offset any losses in 2018, enter "0.00" in Box 20B. Questions 21 and 22 Distributions to beneficiaries by foreign and non- complying trusts Question 21 - Distributions At Question 21 print the total amount of distributions made to beneficiaries during the year. A distribution is any income or property of the trust that vests in the beneficiary or is paid or applied for a beneficiary's benefit. It includes any property or service disposed of or provided to: • a beneficiary for less than market value, or • the trust by a beneficiary for greater than market value. Attach a separate schedule to page 3 of the return showing the source and the amount of each distribution. Distributions are considered to have come from different sources in the following order: • beneficiary income • accumulated trustee income • capital profits or gains realised in the current income year • capital profits or gains realised in previous years that have been accumulated by the trust • the corpus of the trust. www.ird.govt.nz 35 The ordering establishes if the distribution is a taxable distribution - see Question 22. Capital gains and corpus distributed only after income derived by trustees in the year of distribution and in prior years has been distributed. Further information about the ordering and taxability of distributions can be found in our Trusts' and estates' income tax rules (IR288) guide. Question 22 - Taxable distributions A taxable distribution is one made to a beneficiary by a foreign or non-complying trust that isn't beneficiary income. For a foreign trust taxable distributions also do not include capital gains profits that aren't included in the taxable income of the trust except when derived from transactions with associated persons or a distribution from the corpus. For non-complying trusts they do not include distributions from the corpus. Write the total taxable distributions made to beneficiaries during the year in Box 22. Where to include taxable distributions Include the amount of the taxable distribution made to each beneficiary in the beneficiary's panel of the IR6B: • in Box 24G if the trust is a foreign trust, or • in Box 24J if the trust is a non-complying trust. For tax payable on taxable distributions see Question 24J on page 39. Schedule of beneficiary's estate or trust income Each beneficiary (excluding minor beneficiaries) must attach a completed Schedule of beneficiary's estate or trust income (IR307) to their individual tax return if they receive income from a foreign or non-complying trust. It's helpful if the trustee or agent also provides a completed IR307 when advising beneficiaries of their share of trust income. Beneficiaries don't then need to contact the trustee or agent when completing their own returns. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE36 Question 23 Additional disclosure of foreign investments If you calculated CFC or FIF income at Question 13 you may be required to complete an additional disclosure form for that investment. If the trust is not widely held or a PIE, you may not require an additional disclosure if the investments are in countries New Zealand has a double tax agreement with as at 31 March 2013, and have used the fair dividend rate or comparative value method. If the trust is widely held or a PIE you are required to file an additional disclosure. Go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: international tax disclosure) for full details of the disclosure requirements and the appropriate form(s). If you need assistance making a CFC or FIF disclosure please call 0800 443 773. www.ird.govt.nz 37 IR6B Estate or trust beneficiary details Question 24 Beneficiary income and calculation of tax, excluding minor beneficiaries See Question 18A on pages 31 and 32 for the definition of beneficiary income. Complete the details on the IR6B for each beneficiary and ensure an IRD number is shown for each. If you don't have the beneficiary's IRD number contact the beneficiary. Due to our privacy obligations under section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 we cannot provide it to you. Question 24B Non-resident beneficiaries Please make sure you answer Question 24B about residency. This lets us work out correctly how the beneficiary income should be taxed. Include all beneficiary income allocated to each non-resident beneficiary in Boxes 24C, 24D, 24E, 24F and 24G. Remember, the combined totals at Boxes 24H, less any taxable distributions from foreign trusts included at Box 24G must reconcile with the total of Box 18A. Non-resident passive income Non-resident passive income is interest, dividends and royalties for the supply of scientific, technical, industrial or commercial knowledge. These types of income are subject to non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) if the income has a New Zealand source. This tax is deducted when the non-resident passive income is paid or credited to a non-resident beneficiary. The rates and methods of calculating the tax on a non-resident beneficiary's share of income differ according to the type of income derived and the country the beneficiary is resident in. Include all income derived by each non-resident beneficiary in Boxes 24C, 24D, 24E, 24F and 24G. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE38 Paying NRWT When paying non-resident passive income to a non-resident beneficiary, the trust must complete certain forms and pay N RW T. If you need more help, see our NRWT - payer's guide (IR291). When calculating the amount of income liable for income tax at the ordinary rates, don't include non-resident passive income or any overseas income in the taxable income figure in Box 24H for non-resident beneficiaries. Question 24C New Zealand interest If the allocation of beneficiary income includes any New Zealand interest, write the amount in Box 24C. Question 24D New Zealand dividends If the allocation of beneficiary income includes any New Zealand dividends, write the amount in Box 24D. Question 24E Māori authority distributions If the allocation of beneficiary income includes any Māori authority distributions, write the amount in Box 24E. Question 24F Overseas income If the allocation of beneficiary income includes any overseas income, write the amount in Box 24F. Question 24G Other income and taxable distributions from a foreign trust Add the remainder of any beneficiary income allocated to the beneficiary to any taxable distributions from a foreign trust and write the total in Box 24G. Question 24H Taxable income of beneficiary from the estate or trust Add up boxes 24C to 24G and write the total in Box 24H. www.ird.govt.nz 39 Question 24I Paying the tax on beneficiary income, excluding minor beneficiaries The trustee must pay tax on behalf of the beneficiary for all income allocated to the beneficiary. However, the Trustee and the beneficiary can agree not to have tax deducted from Trust/Estate income before the beneficiary receives it. This might be done where the beneficiary has losses available to offset income. The trustees will be liable if the beneficiary defaults on payment of the tax obligations on trust income. Note Tick 'Yes' if the estate or trust is paying the tax on behalf of beneficiaries, then complete all boxes 24A to 24S. 'Yes' means the trust/estate will retain any excess tax credits (except overseas credits and Imputation credits) for the trust/estate. The beneficiary must then show the gross income allocated to them as trust income and can only claim the amount of tax paid by the Trust at key point 24K, in the key point for Tax Paid by Trustees of their own income tax return. Tick 'No' if the estate or trust is not paying the tax on behalf of beneficiaries. Then complete boxes 24A to 24J, and boxes 24L, 24N and 24P only. Question 24J Taxable distributions by non-complying trust Show taxable distributions to each beneficiary in Box 24J and the tax in Box 24R. Taxable distributions by a non-complying trust are taxable to the beneficiary at a flat rate of 45 cents in the dollar. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE40 Question 24K Calculation of tax Do not fill out Box 24K if you ticked "No" in Box 24I. Note If the estate or trust is paying tax on behalf of the beneficiaries calculate tax on taxable income of beneficiaries using the rates below. 2018 annual tax rates income range Ta x r a t e Income to $14,00010.5% $14,001 - $48,00017.5% $48,001 - $70,00030.0% $70,001 and over33.0% Question 24L Beneficiary's share of overseas tax paid Allocate any tax paid overseas to beneficiaries on the same basis as the allocation of income. Minor beneficiaries' share of overseas tax is to be offset against tax payable on trustee income. A New Zealand resident who receives a taxable distribution is not allowed a tax credit in relation to any income tax paid unless the tax is the same as non-resident withholding tax (NRWT). The amount of any credit is equal to: taxable income × foreign tax paid total distribution Question 24M Calculation Subtract Box 24L from Box 24K. Do not fill out Box 24M if you ticked "No" in Box 24I. Note Subtract Box 24L from Box 24K. If the overseas tax paid (Box 24L) allocated to a beneficiary is greater than the tax payable in Box 24K, print 0.00 at Box 24M. www.ird.govt.nz 41 Question 24N Beneficiary's share of dividend imputation credits If dividends have been allocated to a beneficiary, use the following formula to work out the credits attached to those dividends: a × ( b ) c a is the total of all dividend imputation credits attached to all dividends distributed to beneficiaries during the income year b is the total distribution, including capital distributions made to the particular beneficiary during the year c is the total distribution, including capital distributions made to all beneficiaries during the year. Show the beneficiary's share of imputation credits in Box 24N. Question 24O Calculation Do not fill out Box 24O, if you ticked "No" in Box 24I. Note Subtract Box 24N from Box 24M. If the beneficiary's share of the imputation credits is larger than their tax payable in Box 24M, the excess credit cannot be refunded to the trust. Write 0.00 in Box 24O. The beneficiary should claim the balance of the unused imputation credits in their own tax return. Minor beneficiaries' share of dividend imputation credits is to be offset against tax payable on trustee income in box 25E of the IR6. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE42 Question 24P Beneficiary's allocation of RWT and other credits Minor beneficiaries' allocation of RWT and other credits is to be offset against tax payable on trustee income. Ensure that you include the following amounts in Box 24P for each beneficiary: • allocation of RWT (Boxes 9A and 10A) • share of Māori authority credits (Box 11A) • share of partnership, estate or trust tax credits (Box 12A) • share of LTC tax credits (Box 14A) • share of other income credits (Box 16A) • If income from a property sale is treated as beneficiary income show their share of any residential land withholding tax credit (Box 16AA). Don't include any amounts already shown in either Boxes 24L or 24N of the IR6B. Note Questions 24Q & 24S Do not fill out 24Q or 24S if you ticked 'No' in Box 24I. Note Question 24R Calculate tax on taxable distribution by non-complying trust in 24J at 45 cents in the dollar and print in this box. www.ird.govt.nz 43 Trustee income and calculation of tax Question 25A Calculation of taxable income If the result is negative the amount will be taken into account in the loss carried forward to the following year. Question 25B Calculation of tax and tax on taxable distributions If the trust has received a taxable distribution and tax has not been paid, calculate tax at 33 cents in the dollar and add it to the total. Question 25C Credit for tax paid overseas The amount of the credit for tax paid overseas on trustee income is limited to the amount of New Zealand tax on that income. Remember to attach evidence of payment to page 3 of your return. Question 25E Dividend imputation credits If the trustee's share of the imputation credit exceeds the tax on trustee income at Box 25D, the excess credit can't be refunded. Write 0.00 in Box 25F. The excess credit is converted to a net loss to carry forward to the following year. To calculate the net loss to carry forward to 2019, use the worksheet on page 44. We'll send you a notice confirming the amount of loss to carry forward. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE44 In this example the net loss to carry forward to the income year ending 31 March 2019 is $151.00 in Box 4.

Don't include any amounts already shown in either Boxes 24L or 24N of the IR6B. www.ird.govt.nz 45 Question 27 Refunds and/or transfers Please be careful to copy the amount from Box 26E to Box 27 correctly. Direct credit If you choose direct credit you get your refund faster and you can withdraw your money as soon as it's credited because there's no clearance time. We pay any refund direct into your New Zealand bank account or other deposit account, eg, a building society account as soon as we've processed your return. Make sure your correct account number is printed at Question 6 on the front page of your return. Question 27A Overpaid provisional tax If you've made payments towards your 2019 provisional tax and, after completing this return, find you have less or no provisional tax to pay, the overpayment can be included in the amount we refund or transfer. Print the overpaid amount in Box 27A. Question 27C Transferring a refund to pay provisional tax If you're entitled to a refund you can transfer all or part of it to your 2019 provisional tax. If you want to do this print the amount of the transfer in Box 27C. Questions 27D to 27F Transfers to another taxpayer's income tax account If you'd like your refund transferred to another account you'll need to tell us what date you'd like it transferred. The date you choose depends on what tax has been overpaid and whose account you want the credit transferred to. Different rules apply if the other taxpayer is associated to you. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE46 Associated taxpayers When transferring overpaid tax, associated taxpayers are: • a company you're a shareholder-employee in • a partner in the same partnership • a relative (eg, child, parent, spouse, or partner) • a trustee of a family trust you're a beneficiary of. You can ask for your credit to be transferred at any date as long as it's not before the relevant date shown below. Tick "Yes" or "No" at Box 27D to indicate whether the other taxpayer is associated and write their name in the boxes provided. Write the IRD number of the other taxpayer at Box 27E. Write the amount you wish to transfer at Box 27F. Transfer dates For refunds transferred to your account or an associated taxpayers account: • If the credit is from excess tax deducted (eg, PAYE deducted), it's the day after your balance date (or 1 April if your balance date is before 31 March). • If the credit is from overpaid provisional tax, it's the day you overpaid it. Special rules apply if the return period has had tax pooling refunds transferred in. Note For credit transferred to a non-associated person's account, it's the later of the day you requested the transfer, or the day after you file your return. Future transfer dates If you'd like your credit transferred at a date in the future, attach a note to the front of your return with details of: • the amount you want transferred • the account you want it transferred to, and if it's the account of the associated person • the date you'd like it transferred. www.ird.govt.nz 47 If you don't tell us the date you'd like your credit transferred, we'll transfer it at a date we think gives you the greatest advantage. Contact us if you'd like to change the transfer date and tell us if this transfer is to cover a debt. For further information on transfers, read Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 14, No 11 (November 2002). Refunds of less than $5 If your refund is less than $5 it will be carried forward to your next tax assessment. We'll offset it against any amount you may owe us or add it to any refund. If you don't want it carried forward, please call us on 0800 377 774. Question 28 Initial provisional tax liability If this is the first year the estate or trust started to derive gross income from a taxable activity, print the start date in Box 28. Provisional tax isn't payable if the residual income tax (RIT) for the previous year was $2,500 or less. Most new businesses don't pay provisional tax in their first year of operation because there's no RIT from the previous year to base the calculation on. However, a special rule requires you to pay interest if you have an initial provisional tax liability. The estate or trust has an initial provisional tax liability if: • it starts to derive gross income from a taxable activity, and • it had not derived income from a taxable activity within the preceding four years • you have RIT of $60,000 or more in the current year. The interest cost can be reduced or eliminated by making voluntary provisional tax payments on the instalment due dates. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE48 Interest rules for taxpayers with an initial provisional tax liability Taxpayers with an initial provisional tax liability may be charged interest from the first, second or third instalment date. The instalment date that interest applies from is determined by the taxable activity's start date. For estates and trusts whose balance date is 31 March, the start date for interest will be: • 29 August, if the taxable activity started before 30 July of the same year • 16 January, if the taxable activity started between 31 July and 16 December of the previous year • 8 May, if the taxable activity started on or after 17 December of the previous year. An estate or trust with a balance date other than 31 March generally pays provisional tax on the 28th day of the 5th, 9th and 13th months after the balance date, unless filing 6 monthly GST returns. If you need help to work out whether the estate or trust has an initial provisional tax liability, read our guide Provisional tax (IR289). Question 29 2019 provisional tax 2019 provisional tax is charged for income the estate or trust will earn in the 2019 income year. It is payable in two, three or six equal instalments. There are three options for paying provisional tax - standard, estimation and ratio. If the estate or trust's 2018 RIT is: • $2,500 or less it doesn't have to pay provisional tax, although it can make voluntary payments • more than $2,500 but expected to be $2,500 or less for 2018, it may estimate 2019 provisional tax at nil (read "Estimation option" on page 49) • more than $2,500 and expected to be more than $2,500 for 2018, it must pay 2019 provisional tax. If you anticipate your RIT will exceed $2,500 for the 2019 year, see "Interest" on page 51. You may be liable for interest from your first provisional tax instalment date. www.ird.govt.nz 49 Which option to use Estates or trusts can use either the standard or estimation options to pay their provisional tax. If they're registered for GST they may also be able to use the ratio option. Standard option Using the standard option, the estate or trust's 2019 provisional tax will be equal to its 2018 RIT plus 5%. If you use this option enter S in Box 29A on the return and the amount of 2019 provisional tax in Box 29B. • If the estate or trust’s 2018 return hasn’t been filed by the first instalment date of 2019 provisional tax, the provisional tax instalments payable is based on 2017 RIT plus 10% (divided by 3 or 2, depending on how many instalments are payable). Estimation option Estates or trusts can estimate their 2019 provisional tax. Trustees must include distributions to minor beneficiaries in their estimate. They can re-estimate any number of times up to and including their final instalment due date. If the estate or trust's 2019 RIT is expected to be less than its 2018 RIT, estimating may prevent the estate or trust from paying more tax than it has to. An estimate must be "fair and reasonable" at each instalment it applies to. If you use this option, see page 51 on "Not taking reasonable care penalty" and "Interest". If you estimate your provisional tax, your instalments should be one-third of your estimation. Note Use the worksheet on page 50 to calculate provisional tax using the estimation option. If you use this option enter E in Box 29A and the amount of 2019 provisional tax in Box 29B. Estimating provisional tax on beneficiary income When working out the tax on estimated beneficiary income, calculate the tax separately for each beneficiary, including estimated tax credits where applicable. The table below shows the 2019 individual tax rates for provisional tax. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE50 2018 annual tax rates income range Ta x r a t e Income to $14,00010.5% $14,001 - $48,00017.5% $48,001 - $70,00030.0% $70,001 and over33.0% When using these tax rates to calculate 2019 provisional tax, you'll also need to estimate the tax credits the beneficiary may be entitled to. Use this worksheet to calculate the estate or trust's 2019 provisional tax using the estimation option. Print the estate or trust's estimated 2019 income to be allocated in Box 1. 1 Estimated allocation of income: • Beneficiary income 2 • Trustee income 3 Work out the tax on the amount in Box 2, using the rates above. Print your answer in Box 4. 4 Multiply the amount in Box 3 by 0.33 (33%). Print your answer in Box 5. 5 If the estate or trust is non- complying, multiply the estimated taxable distributions, if any, by 0.45 (45%). Print your answer in Box 6. 6 Add Boxes 4, 5 and 6. Print your answer in Box 7. 7 Print the estimated 2019 credits (trustees' share only) in Box 8. 8 Subtract Box 8 from Box 7. Print your answer in Box 9. 9 Box 9 is the estate or trust's 2019 provisional tax. Copy it to Box 29B of the return and print E in Box 29A. Divide the amount in Box 9 by three to get the amount to pay for each instalment. If you need more help read our guide Provisional tax (IR289). www.ird.govt.nz 51 Ratio option If the trust is GST registered you may qualify to use the ratio option to calculate your provisional tax. Only enter R at Box 29A if you've already elected to use the ratio option. Your application to use the ratio option must be made by phone or in writing before the beginning of the income year you want to use it in. If you've already elected to use the ratio option and want to continue using it, enter R at Box 29A. More information about the ratio option is in our guide Provisional tax (IR289). Not taking reasonable care penalty When you estimate the estate or trust's 2019 provisional tax, your estimate must be fair and reasonable. If the 2019 RIT is greater than the provisional tax paid, you may be liable for a not taking reasonable care penalty of 20% of the underpaid provisional tax. Interest If the estate or trust has paid too much provisional tax on trustee income we may pay interest, or if it hasn't paid enough, we may charge interest. Interest for estates or trusts is calculated only on the tax payable on trustee income. Interest isn't calculated if all income is distributed to the beneficiaries. Interest the estate or trust pays is generally tax-deductible, while interest we pay is taxable income. For more information about interest and penalties read our guide Penalties and interest (IR240). If we pay interest, it continues to accrue until the date we refund the overpaid tax, or apply it to another liability. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE52 Election to be a provisional tax payer An estate or trust is a provisional tax payer for the 2019 year if its RIT for 2018 is more than $2,500. If the 2018 RIT is $2,500 or less, and • the estate or trust made provisional tax payments for that tax year, and • payments were made under the estimation method (other than using the estimation method for its final instalment only), It may elect to be a provisional tax payer for 2019. This may affect the interest it may be entitled to for that year. To elect to be a provisional tax payer for the 2019 year, attach a letter to the front of the return. Change in balance date There are special rules about when provisional tax is due and how interest is calculated if there has been a change in balance date. Read our Provisional tax (IR289) guide for more information. Tax pooling Tax pooling allows taxpayers to pool provisional tax payments, offsetting underpayments by overpayments within the same pool. This reduces their possible exposure to late payment penalties and use-of-money interest. The pooling arrangement is made through a commercial intermediary, who arranges for participating taxpayers to be charged or compensated for the offset. For more information about tax pooling, including a list of intermediaries, go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: tax pooling). www.ird.govt.nz 53 Payment dates 2019 provisional tax Generally, an estate or trust with a 31 March balance date pays provisional tax by the following due dates: • First instalment 28 August 2018 • Second instalment 15 January 2019 • Third instalment 7 May 2019 An estate or trust with a balance date other than 31 March pays provisional tax on the 28th day of the 5th, 9th and 13th months after the balance date. Where payments would otherwise be due on 28 December or 28 April the due date is extended to 15 January or 7 May. These dates will alter if: • the estate or trust is registered for GST, and • the GST filing frequency is six-monthly, or • provisional tax is paid by the ratio option. If either of these situations apply to you, read our guide Provisional tax (IR289). 2018 end-of-year income tax Estates or trusts that have an agent and an extension of time may have until 7 April 2019 to pay their tax. If you think this applies to you contact your agent for more information. Otherwise, an estate or trust with a balance date between 1 March and 30 September must pay its end-of-year income tax and any interest by 7 February 2019. An estate or trust with a balance date between 1 October and 28 February must pay its end-of-year income tax by the 7th day of the month before the following year's balance date.

If you are a trustee of a trust, or the executor or administrator of a deceased person's estate you need to file an IR6 to account for income the estate or trust earns. In this guide we use "trustee" or "you" to refer to the person or persons administering an estate or trust. The word trust also refers to estates unless we've stated otherwise. This guide provides general information about how to complete the IR6 return. There are references throughout the guide to our other publications which may help you. If you still need help please call us on one of the telephone numbers listed under "Services you may need" at the back of this guide or contact a tax advisor. How income of an estate or trust is taxed in general In general, income of an estate or trust will be subject to income tax in New Zealand if it has a source in New Zealand regardless of the residency of the trustee. The trustee is also liable for New Zealand income tax on income derived outside New Zealand where any settlor of the trust is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year, or if the estate has a New Zealand trustee and the deceased was resident in New Zealand. Allocations Income of a trust is either trustee or beneficiary income. The trustee can allocate income as beneficiary income, provided the income either: • vests absolutely in the beneficiary in the income year, or • is paid or applied for the benefit of the beneficiary during that income year or within a specified period from the end of the income year. For more information see Question 18A on page 31. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE6 Trust income allocated as beneficiary income is taxable income, except as covered below under the special rules for allocations to minor beneficiaries. Distributions In addition to allocating beneficiary income, a trustee can make distributions to beneficiaries. A distribution can be made up of: (a) tax-paid profits (trustee income or beneficiary income) (b) capital gains of the trust (c) corpus of the trust (the capital contributed to set up the trust) (d) (for a foreign trust) non-taxed profits such as foreign- sourced income. The tax position of a distribution from a trust depends on the type of trust making the distribution and the residency of the beneficiary. See pages 11 to 12 of this guide. Generally, a distribution to a New Zealand resident beneficiary from: (a) a complying trust is not taxable (b) a foreign trust is taxable, to the extent it is not part of the corpus or capital gains (c) a non-complying trust is taxable at 45 cents in the dollar, to the extent it is not part of the corpus. Allocations of beneficiary income to a minor A minor is defined as a New Zealand resident under the age of 16 years on the balance date of the trust. Allocations of beneficiary income that the minor beneficiary rule applies to are treated as trustee income. This means they are: • taxed at 33% • included in the trustee's tax calculation in the IR6 return, and • included in the trustees' provisional tax calculations. The minor beneficiary should not include this income in their Individual income tax return (IR3). www.ird.govt.nz 7 Exceptions to the minor beneficiary rule The following exceptions allow income allocated to a minor beneficiary to be treated as beneficiary income if the income: • is derived by a minor for whom a child disability allowance is paid under the Social Security Act 2018, or • is derived directly from either a group investment fund, the Māori trustee or a Māori authority, or • the amount allocated to the minor from the trust is $1,000 or less in an income year. If the $1,000 threshold is exceeded, the total income allocated to the minor beneficiary is taxed as trustee income. For example, if a minor beneficiary is allocated $1,200, the total allocation of $1,200 is taxed at 33%. The general anti-avoidance rule may apply if a person establishes multiple trusts to increase the number of exemptions. See Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 19, No 4 (May 2007) for further information. Note There are further exceptions to the minor beneficiary rule that relate to the nature of the settlements on the trust. For further information, please see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001). ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE8 Return due date If the estate or trust has a 31 March balance date you have until 7 July 2019 to send in the return, unless you have been granted an extension of time. If you have a balance date other than 31 March, the due date may be different. Call us on 0800 377 774 if you’re not sure. If the estate or trust is the client of an agent, it may have until 31 March 2020 to file the return. Contact your agent for more information. International obligations You may also need to provide information about a trust to comply with the following international obligations. The Common Reporting Standard (CRS) For further information see: • IR Guidance on the CRS (IR1048) section 11 • CRS: Is the Trust a Reporting NZ Financial Institution (IR1052) • Family Trust obligations under the CRS (IR1053) • or go to www.ird.govt.nz/crs Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) For further information see: • FATCA Trusts Guidance (IR1087) • FATCA status of NZ trusts that are not US person (IR1086) • go to www.ird.govt.nz/fatca www.ird.govt.nz 9 Questions Questions 1 to 6 The information in Questions 1 to 6 of the return helps us to be sure that any correspondence we send goes to the right person at the right address. Fill in these questions only if the correct information is not printed on the return. Question 1 IRD number If the estate or trust does not have an IRD number complete an IRD number application - resident non-individual (IR596) and send it in with the return. Question 2 Name of estate or trust If the estate or trust has changed its name since the last time a return was filed, please provide proof of the change so we can update our records, eg, trustee resolution. Questions 3 and 4 Postal address and phone number If you have a new postal address, write the details at Question 3. If your new postal address is a PO Box number, please show your box lobby if you have one. If you're unsure please contact New Zealand Post. If the estate or trust uses its tax agent's postal address, leave this panel blank. Your tax agent will let us know of any change of address when updating their client list. We ask for your daytime phone number at Question 4 in case we need to call you with questions about the return. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE10 Question 5 Business industry classification (BIC) code We're required to supply the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) with a code for your business or trading activity, for levy classification and calculation. If your BIC code isn't pre-printed on the return or is different from the pre-printed one, please enter the correct code. To work out your main business or trading activity and its code, go to www.businessdescription.co.nz or call ACC on 0800 222 776. It's important that you choose the code which most accurately reflects your main business or trading activity. Please provide the code only. Don't provide a description. Note Question 6 Bank account number The fastest and safest way to get any refund is to have it direct credited to your New Zealand bank account or other deposit account, eg, a building society account. If your bank account number isn't preprinted on the return form, please include it at Question 6. If your suffix has only two digits, enter them in the first two squares of the suffix box. Question 7A Has the estate or trust ceased? If the estate or trust has ceased, include accounts showing the distribution of all assets and liabilities to the date the estate or trust was finalised. If the estate or trust is registered for GST or as an employer, you'll need to complete a Business cessation (IR315) form to finalise your records. www.ird.govt.nz 11 Question 7B Nil trust returns If the trust receives any income, eg, interest, the trustee must file a return regardless of the amount of income derived. Where a trust has no prospect or intention of deriving any income in a given financial year, please call us on 0800 377 774 with the name and IRD number of the trust so we can record that a return isn't required for that year. If the trust subsequently derives income in a future year, the trust must send in a return. This only applies to trust returns. Estates are still required to file a return of income regardless of whether they have derived income. Note A complying trust that is non-active and doesn’t want to file an income tax return can complete and send the Non-active trust declaration (IR633): The complying trust needs to declare: • It hasn’t derived or been deemed to have derived any gross income from any source. • It has no deductions. • It has not been party to, or continued with, any transactions with assets of the trust that give rise to any of the following during the tax year: a. Income or deemed income in any person’s hand. b. Fringe benefits to any employee or former employee. Question 8 Types of trusts The type of trust determines the way certain distributions are taxed in the hands of beneficiaries. There are three types of estates or trusts for income tax purposes: • complying • foreign • non-complying. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE12 Complying trust In general a complying trust is one that has been taxed in New Zealand on all its trustee income since the date it began and the trustee has met all it's tax obligations. Complying trusts include: • trusts settled by New Zealand residents with New Zealand trustees and New Zealand beneficiaries • estates of people who were New Zealand residents when they died • foreign trusts that have elected to become complying trusts. The trust can still be a complying trust if the trustee was not liable for New Zealand income tax because: • the trust earned no income, or • the income was exempt, or • the trust was in a loss situation. Foreign trust A foreign trust is one where no settlor of the trust has been resident in New Zealand since: • 17 December 1987, or the date the trust was first settled, whichever is later, and on the date of distribution. Non-complying trust A trust that isn't a complying trust or a foreign trust is a non- complying trust. Non-complying trusts include: • trusts with a New Zealand-resident settlor, but non- resident trustees, that haven't been liable for or haven't paid New Zealand income tax on all trustee income since first being settled • foreign trusts where the settlor has become a New Zealand resident and an election hasn't been made to be a complying trust • all the beneficiaries are non-residents and all the income is passive income such as interest, dividends, and royalties. www.ird.govt.nz 13 Election to change category of trust for tax purposes New residents or former residents who have settled a trust before coming to New Zealand may elect to pay New Zealand tax on future trustee income. Making this election will mean the trust becomes a complying trust for income derived on or after the date on which the election is made. An election can be made by a settlor, trustee or beneficiary using an Election to pay income tax on trustee income (IR463) form. If an election isn't made the trust will become a non- complying trust. Elections must be made within 12 months of a new resident ceasing to be a transitional resident, and within 12 months of the arrival for a former resident. Unit trust A unit trust is treated as a company for tax purposes. If you're preparing a tax return for a unit trust, please complete a Companies income tax return (IR4). Group investment fund If the income is: • solely from Category B income, an IR6 must be completed • solely from Category A income, an IR4 must be completed • a combination of both Category A and Category B income, an IR4 and IR44E must be completed. Please read the notes on the IR44E for further information. Superannuation schemes A superannuation scheme that isn't registered with the Financial Markets Authority and doesn't allow investors to contribute will be treated as a trust for tax purposes and must file an IR6 return. Income and credits section Income received by a trust retains its character as it passes through the trust. For this reason we ask that you return different types of income in certain boxes. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE14 Question 9 New Zealand interest Include interest from all New Zealand sources at Question 9. The interest payer will usually send you an RWT withholding certificate (IR15), or similar statement, showing the gross interest paid and the amount of RWT deducted. Write the total of all RWT deducted in Box 9A. Add up all the gross interest amounts (before the deduction of any tax) and write the total in Box 9B. If expenses are deductible against the interest income (eg, commission), claim them at Question 19. Read about expenses on page 33. Don't send in any interest statements or IR15 certificates with your return, but keep them in case we ask for them later. Note Interest on broken term deposits If you've broken a term deposit during the year, you may have to account for "negative interest". This is interest repaid on a term deposit and may reduce the amount of interest to declare in your return. If the term deposit was broken in full, or it was business related, deduct the negative interest from the gross interest shown on the IR15 or equivalent statement. Deduct the allowable negative interest component, using the worksheet below, before entering the gross amount at Box 9B on your return. In all other cases, the negative interest is deductible in a future income year when the term deposit matures. Worksheet Copy your gross interest from your RWT withholding certificate to Box 1. 1 Print any negative interest you've paid in Box 2. 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the answer in Box 3. Copy this amount to Box 9B of your tax return. 3 www.ird.govt.nz 15 Interest paid or charged by Inland Revenue If we paid you interest, include it in Box 9B for the income year the trust received the interest. If the trust paid us interest, include it as a deduction in Box 19 of the return for the income year the interest is paid. Interest from overseas If the trust received interest from overseas, convert your overseas interest and tax credits to New Zealand dollars and show the amounts at Question 13. Please read the notes about overseas income on pages 20 to 24. Income from financial arrangements The financial arrangement rules generally require income or expenditure from financial arrangements to be spread over the term of the arrangement. Financial arrangements include term deposits, government stock, local authority stock, mortgage bonds, futures contracts and deferred property settlements. Trustees are required to use a spreading method unless they are a cash basis person. A person is a cash basis person if: • the value of all financial arrangements together is less than $1 million, or • the value of the income or expenditure from the financial arrangement is less than $100,000, and • the deferral of income or expenditure using the cash method rather than the actual method is less than $40,000. A special rule applies for deceased persons. If the deceased person was a cash basis person at the date of death, the concession applies in the year of death and up to four succeeding years. Any RWT from a financial arrangement will be deducted on a cash basis. Different rules apply for financial arrangements entered into prior to 20 May 1999. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE16 Sale or maturity of financial arrangements Whether or not the exemption from the spreading methods explained earlier applies, when a financial arrangement matures or is sold, remitted, or transferred, a "wash-up" calculation known as a base-price adjustment must be carried out. Cash basis persons can use the Sale or disposal of financial arrangements (IR3K) to perform the calculation. This form could be used, for example, to calculate the amount you need to account for if you have broken a term deposit in full. For further information about the financial arrangements rules, please see Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 11, No 6 (July 1999), page 3. Any RWT will be deducted on a cash basis. Question 10 New Zealand dividends Dividends are the part of a company's profits that it passes on to its shareholders. Unit trusts are treated as companies for income tax purposes. Distributions from unit trusts will generally be taxable and are treated as dividends. All the trust's cash and taxable bonus issue dividends derived from a qualifying company must be distributed by the trustees as beneficiary income to the beneficiaries who are not trustees or companies that are not qualifying companies. Note Complete Question 10 if you received any New Zealand dividends, including dividends from your local electricity or gas supplier. Don't include a dividend that's a distribution of the trust's capital and is tax free. The company or unit trust that paid you the dividend will send you a dividend statement. Don't send any dividend statements with the return, but keep them in case we ask for them later. www.ird.govt.nz 17 If expenses are deductible against the dividend income, claim them at Question 19. Note Credits attached to dividends "Imputation credits" are credits for part of the tax the company has already paid on its profits, which means the dividends aren't taxed twice. RWT is deducted from your dividend to bring the total credits withheld up to 33% of the gross dividend. What to show in your return Your dividend statements show the amount: • you received (net dividend) • of any imputation credits • of any RWT credits. Add all these amounts together to work out your total gross dividends and enter this in Box 10B. Add up all the imputation credits and print the total in Box 10. Add any dividend RWT credits and print the total in Box 10A. Shares instead of dividends If the trust received shares instead of dividends, include them as income at Question 10B. Write the amount as if you received dividends instead of shares. Dividends from overseas Please read about overseas income on pages 19 to 23 of this guide. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE18 Question 11 Māori authority distributions Māori authorities can make various types of distributions. Fill in Question 11 if you received any taxable Māori authority distributions. The Māori authority that paid you the distribution will send you a Māori authority distribution statement. Credits attached to distributions The Māori authority may attach a credit to the distribution it makes to members. This credit will be classified as a "Māori authority credit". It is usually part of the tax the Māori authority has already paid on its profits, which means the distributions aren't taxed twice. What to show in your return Your Māori authority distribution statement shows the amount of: • the distribution made to you, including what portion is taxable and what portion is non-taxable • Māori authority credit. Transfer these amounts, leaving out any non-taxable distributions, to the relevant boxes at Question 11. Non-taxable distribution You don't need to include in the IR6 return any other distributions received from a Māori authority that aren't taxable in the hands of a Māori authority member. These amounts are non-taxable distributions and can't have credits attached. For more information read our Māori authorities guide (IR487). www.ird.govt.nz 19 Question 12 Partnership, estate or trust income Partnership If the estate or trust received any income from a partnership, write the details at Question 12. Don't include: • interest and RWT (include these at Question 9) • any dividends, imputation credits or dividend RWT (include these at Question 10) • any Māori authority dividends and Māori authority credits (include these at Question 11) • any overseas income and qualifying tax credits attached (include these at Question 13). Estate or trust If the estate or trust has received income from a foreign or non-complying trust, complete a Schedule of beneficiary's estate or trust income (IR307) and attach it to the return. Add up all the other income from partnerships, complying and foreign trusts, and write the total in Box 12B. Add up any other tax credits and write the total in Box 12A. Don't include: • interest and RWT (include these at Question 9) • any dividends, imputation credits or dividend RWT (include these at Question 10) • any Māori authority dividends and Māori authority credits (include these at Question 11) • any overseas income and qualifying tax credits attached (include these at Question 13). If the estate or trust has received a taxable distribution from a non-complying trust do not include the amount as income. Calculate tax on the taxable distribution at 45 cents in the dollar and add it to the amount in Box 25B. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE20 You can use a loss to reduce the amount of the taxable distribution. Net losses brought forward from an earlier income year and losses incurred in the 2017 income year can be used to reduce the amount. If a loss is used in this way it is no longer available to offset other income. The reduction is calculated using the following formula: (Tax loss × 0.33) ÷ 0.45 Losses from limited partnerships If the estate or trust is claiming a loss from a limited partnership and you need help working out the amount that can be claimed, go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: limited partnership loss deduction calculator). Question 13 Overseas income If the trust received overseas income, eg, interest or financial arrangements, show this at Question 13. Convert all overseas income and qualifying overseas tax paid to New Zealand dollars. You can do this by: • using the rates available on www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: overseas currency) • contacting the overseas section of a trading bank and asking for the exchange rate for the day you received your overseas income. Include any overseas income and credits which you received from a partnership, Look-through company (LTC), estate or trust here. Include gross income before deducting any tax credits at Box 13B. Credit for tax paid overseas will be limited to the amount of New Zealand tax payable on that income. How overseas income of an estate or trust is taxed In New Zealand, overseas income is taxed according to the residency of the settlor. The rules for the three most common situations are described over the page. www.ird.govt.nz 21 New Zealand resident trustees and income derived outside New Zealand As a general rule, where a trustee is resident in New Zealand, and the trustee derives an amount from outside New Zealand, that income will be income of the trustee. The amount will be exempt income of the trustee if: • no settlor of the trust except a transitional resident is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year, • that trust is not a testamentary trust (trust created by a person under their will) or an inter vivos trust (trust created by the settlor during their lifetime) where any settlor of the trust died resident in New Zealand, whether in that income year or otherwise. Non-resident trustees and income derived outside of New Zealand A non-resident trustee is also liable for New Zealand income tax on income derived from outside New Zealand where: • any settlor is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year, or • any settlor of an inter vivos or a testamentary trust died while they were resident in New Zealand, and a trustee is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year. Exceptions to the general rule for non-resident trustees and income derived outside New Zealand There are two situations in which a non-resident trustee is not liable for income tax on trustee income derived from outside New Zealand. These apply where the trustee is resident outside New Zealand at all times during the income year and either: • no settlement has been made on the trust since 17 December 1987, or • the only settlements made on the trust were by settlors who were not resident in New Zealand at the time of settlement and who have not been residents in New Zealand since 17 December 1987. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE22 Neither exception applies where an election to pay tax on trustee income has been made by the trustee. These exceptions do not affect the liability to income tax for any settlor of the trust, for example, where the settlor elects to pay tax on trustee income. The trustee income remains liable for income tax for the purpose of determining whether the trust is a complying trust (formerly qualifying trust). Overseas dividends If you are a New Zealand resident trustee and at any time during the 2019 income year you held rights such as shares, units or an entitlement to benefit in any foreign company, foreign trust, foreign superannuation scheme, or foreign life insurance policy, you may be required to calculate foreign investment fund (FIF) income or loss on those investments and include this amount in Box 13B. Generally, you will use the fair dividend rate to calculate FIF income. The trustees may also need to file an additional FIF disclosure form. For more information read the guide to Question 23 on page 36. You will not need to do this if the investment is covered by an exclusion. The main exclusions from an interest in an FIF are: • investments in certain Australian resident companies listed on approved indices on the Australian stock exchange, that maintain franking accounts. Investments covered in the list are available in the Australian share exemption list (IR871) • interest in certain Australian units • limited exemptions for interests in certain venture capital • limited exemptions for interests in certain venture capital interests that move offshore (for 10 or more income years from the income year in which the company migrates from New Zealand) • a 10% or greater interest in a controlled foreign company (CFC). www.ird.govt.nz 23 A limited number of trusts are also excluded from the rules if the attributing interests are below $50,000. These are: • a testamentary trust • a compensatory trust • where the settlor of the trust is the Accident Compensation Corporation. If the exclusions apply and the trust is under the threshold, include dividends received in Box 13B and any qualifying overseas tax credits in Box 13A. If your dividend exceeds your FIF income, the amount of imputation credit you can claim is calculated on the basis of your FIF income. If your FIF income exceeds your dividend, you can claim the entire imputation credit attached to the dividend. Any excess imputation credit can't be carried forward to the next year or coverted to a loss. Note Please note you can't claim Australian franking credits. For more information about the FIF rules read A guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate (IR461), Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 19, No 3 (April 2007) page 28, Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 20, No 3 (April 2008) page 110, or go to www.ird.govt.nz/toii/fif CFC income or loss If at any time during the 2019 income year the trust has attributed CFC income or loss, the trustees or beneficiaries may be required to calculate this in their own income tax return(s). A loss from a CFC can't be used to offset domestic income or be included in domestic losses that are carried forward to the 2020 income year. Generally, these losses can only offset income or future income from CFCs that are resident in the same country as the CFC that incurred the loss. The trustees may also need to file an additional CFC disclosure form. See Question 23 on page 36. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE24 Investments in portfolio investment entities (PIEs) and portfolio investor attributed income/loss If you receive dividends from a PIE that is a listed company and doesn't use your prescribed investor rate (PIR), you may choose whether to include the dividends in your return. The attributed PIE income/loss is included in the estate or trust's return for the period that includes the end of the PIE's income year. PIEs usually have a 31 March balance date. The amount of income derived by the estate or trust as a distribution by a PIE is excluded income of the estate or trust other than fully imputed dividends from a PIE that is a listed company and doesn't use your PIR. Further information is available in our guide Information for trustees who invest in PIEs (IR856). Question 14 Look-through company (LTC) income If the estate or trust received any tax credits and/or income from an LTC write the details at Question 14. Don't include any of the following types of income received from an LTC at Question 14: • interest and RWT (include these at Question 9) • any dividends, imputation credits, and dividend RWT (include these at Question 10) • Māori authority distributions and credits (include these at Question 11) • any overseas income and qualifying tax credits attached (include these at Question 13) • rental income (include this at Question 15). The loss limitation rule limits the amount of deductions an LTC owner (shareholder) can claim if the amount exceeds the owner’s “owner’s basis” (equity) in the LTC. For the 2017-18 and later income years, the loss limitation rule only applies to an LTC which is in a partnership or joint venture which includes another LTC. www.ird.govt.nz 25 The estate or trust can now claim the full amount of prior years’ non-allowable deductions brought forward this year. This won’t apply if the loss limitation rule continues to apply to limit the amount claimable. The LTC will normally supply information about the non- allowable deductions and any other information required to complete your return. Trust A is an owner of an LTC which is not in a partnership or joint venture that includes another LTC. For the 2018-19 income year Trust A has a net loss of $4,000.00 from the LTC. Trust A also has prior years’ non-allowable deductions brought forward of $5,000.00. Trust A had no tax credits from the LTC for the year. Trust A’s tax return should show the following amounts in the following boxes: • 14A: $0.00 • 14B: $4,000.00 - • 14C: $0.00 • 14D: $5,000.00 • 14E: $9,000.00 - Example What to show on your return Add up all other tax credits received from the LTC and print the total in Box 14A. Add up all LTC income, deduct expenses not already included elsewhere and print in Box 14B. If a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Add up all non-allowable deductions this year and print in Box 14C. There shouldn’t be non-allowable deductions this year unless the loss limitation rule applies. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE26 Add up all prior year non-allowable deductions claimable this year and print the amount in Box 14D. You’ll be able to claim the full amount of non-allowable deductions brought forward from last year if the loss limitation rule no longer applies. If you have an amount in Box 14C, add this to Box 14B and put the total in Box 14E. If you have an amount in Box 14D, subtract this from Box 14B and put the total in Box 14E. If you don't have any amounts in Box 14C or Box 14D, copy the amount from Box 14B to 14E. Box 14E is your adjusted LTC income. You can find more information about LTCs in the Look- through companies (IR879) guide. Question 15 Business or rental income If the estate or trust has business or rental income, you must attach either: • a fully completed Financial statements summary (IR10) form, or • a set of the estate or trust's financial accounts for the year. The IR10 summarises the information we need from the financial accounts. If you complete an IR10 you don't need to send us your financial accounts, but you still need to complete and keep them. Business income Write the net profit in Box 15B. This is the amount of income or net loss after all allowable business expenditure has been deducted. If the total is a loss, put a minus sign in the last box at Box 15B. When calculating business income, you can use the Schedule of business income (IR3B) form. www.ird.govt.nz 27 Rental income If there is rental income, print the net profit or loss (total rents minus expenses) in Box 15B. When calculating rental income you can use the Rental income (IR3R) form. Attribution rule Under the attribution rule, anyone whose actions cause an associated person (company, trust or partnership) to earn income, can be personally liable for tax on that income. If this rule applies to persons associated with your estate or trust, it will affect the amount of taxable income in this return. For more information read our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 12, No 12 (December 2000) page 49 and TIB, Vol 13, No 11 (November 2001). Question 16 Other income At Question 16 show any other income received by the estate or trust, eg, income from: • any undertaking or scheme • sale of land and/or buildings • sale of shares or other property • sale or disposal of assets • any schedular payments received by a trust • certain settlements on a trust • forgiveness of debt. Read the following sections for more information on the above items. Income from any undertaking or scheme Profits made from any undertaking or scheme entered into for the purpose of making a profit, are taxable to the estate or trust. On a separate sheet of paper write down what the undertaking or scheme was and list the details of income and expenses from these undertakings and schemes. Staple it to page 3 of the return and include the total profit in Box 16B. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE28 Income from sale of land and/or buildings The profits are taxable if the estate or trust purchased a property for the purpose of reselling it or are in the business of buying and selling land and/or buildings. If the estate or trust purchased a residential property on or after 1 October 2015 and sold/disposed of it within certain period of time, any profit will be taxable, even if it wasn’t intend to sell when you purchased it. This is called the bright- line test, The bright-line test applies to: • properties purchased/acquired on or after 1 October 2015 through to 28 March 2018 inclusive and sold/ disposed of within two years, and • properties purchased/acquired on or after 29 March 2018 and sold within five years. The profits may also be taxable if the estate or trust: • is in the business of building and improved a property before selling it • developed or subdivided land and sold sections • had a change of zoning on the property and sold it within ten years of buying it. Disposals by a beneficiary, executor or administrator of residential land transferred to them on the death of a person are specifically excluded from the bright-line test. However, the disposals may still be subject to tax under the current land sale rules. If the estate or trust is a New Zealand tax resident it will need to pay tax on its worldwide income under New Zealand tax law. This includes any property sales worldwide whether caught under the bright-line test for residential property sales or the other property rules. Complete a Property sale information (IR833) form for each property sold/disposed of and include it with the return. The form explains how to calculate and correctly return the resulting profit or loss. The form can be downloaded from our website www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword: IR833). Complete the form even if the details have been included in a Financial statements summary (IR10) or set of accounts. Include total profits in Box 16B. www.ird.govt.nz 29 Income from sale of shares or other property Profits from the sale of shares or other property are taxable if the estate or trust: • buys and sells shares or other property as a business • buys shares or other property for the purpose of resale • buys shares or property to make a profit. List the details of income and expenses from these sales on a sheet of paper and staple it to page 3 of the return. Include the total profit in Box 16B. Sale or disposal of assets There are a number of rules that apply to the sale or disposal of assets. For further information read Part 3 of our guide Depreciation - a guide for businesses (IR260). Losses from sale of land, buildings, shares that aren't FIFs, or other property If the estate or trust has made a loss and can show that if it had made a profit it would have been taxable, it may be able to claim the loss as a deduction. If the property was purchased on or after 1 October 2015 with no intention to sell and it was sold/disposed of within two years, any excess deductions can't be claimed unless they can be offset against net income from other property sales. The Property sale information (IR833) form has more information on this. For more information on property sales see our guide Buying and selling residential property (IR313). Show the loss with a minus sign in the the last box at Box 16B. PAYE income accrued to date of death The following types of PAYE income must be returned by the estate if it is accrued to the date of death and subsequently received by the estate: • salary or wages • holiday pay or other leave payments • director's fees • any other PAYE income (includes schedular payments). Include the total gross amount in Box 16B and any tax credits in Box 16A. This income is assessed as trustee income. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE30 Certain settlements on a trust The following settlements of property on a trust are deemed to be trustee income. This means that these settlements of property are excluded from the definition of corpus: • property settled by a trustee of another trust, so long as it would have counted as income if that trust had distributed the property to one of its beneficiaries instead. • a settlement of a property on a trust, which, if not for the settlement, would have constituted: - income of the settlor, or - a dividend for which the settlor would have been liable to deduct an FDP (foreign dividend payment), formerly dividend witholding payment, if the settlor is currently resident or had been resident in New Zealand and subject to income tax at that time. Forgiveness of debt The financial arrangements rules treat debts that do not have to be repaid because they have been forgiven as income to the debtor. There is an exception in the case of trusts if the creditor is a natural person and forgives the debt: • due to "natural love and affection" for natural persons who are beneficiaries of the trust, or • of a trust that was established mainly for the benefit of charitable organisations. If the debt forgiven is distributed to a non-qualifying beneficiary, the trustee can be liable for tax. For further information, please see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 11, No 6 (July 1999) page 20. Question 16AA - Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) credit The estate or trust can claim a credit for RLWT deducted from the sale of a property. If more than one amount was deducted, show the combined amount. Show the amount of RLWT deducted, less any RLWT paid back to the estate or trust and/or transferred to outstanding amounts. Show the name of the the estate or trust's withholder(s) in the "Name of payer" box. www.ird.govt.nz 31 Question 17 • Add up Boxes 9B to 13B, 14E, 15B and 16B and write the total in Box 17B. If there is a loss write a minus sign in the last box. Add up Boxes 9A to 16A and write the total in Box 17A. Do not include Box 10 in this total. Question 18 Income allocation Income derived by a trustee must be allocated between beneficiary income and trustee income in boxes 18A and 18B respectively. Question 18A - Beneficiary income excluding minor beneficiaries Beneficiary income is income of an estate or trust that vests in a beneficiary during the year or is paid to a beneficiary (or credited to them or dealt with in their interest or on their behalf) during the year or within a certain period after the end of the year. The rest of the income generated by an estate or trust will be trustee income. The income available to allocate to beneficiaries may be the income in Box 17B but it is important to note that Box 17B is a total of various amounts of estate or trust income. Some of the amounts, such as income from rental activities, are net amounts ie after deductions. Some of the deductions may be for non-cash outgoings, such as depreciation. This may result in there being income that can be distributed to beneficiaries despite Box 17B showing a loss, and providing the trust deed for the trust allows it. This means there may be amounts that vest in or are paid to beneficiaries that have to be treated as beneficiary income. Identify any such vesting or payment and include the amount in Box 18A. The total must reconcile with the combined totals of Boxes 24H on the IR6B after deducting any taxable distributions included in Box 24G. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE32 Timing of allocation of beneficiary income Allocation of income to a beneficiary must be made within the income year, or by the later of the following: • six months after balance date, or • the earlier of: - the date on which the trustee files the return of income for the income year, or - the date by which the trustee must file a return for the income year. A family trust is allocating income to beneficiaries for the year ended 31 March 2019. The trust return is due on 7 July 2019 and the trust plans to file by 30 June. The income should be allocated by the later of the following: • 30 September 2019, or • the earlier of: - 30 June 2019, or - 7 July 2019. In this case the income must be allocated by September 2019. Example If the trust has a tax agent, the extension of time for filing income tax returns may apply. Question 18B - Trustee income including minor beneficiaries Trustee income is any income generated by an estate or trust that isn't beneficiary income, see "Question 18A - Beneficiary income" on page 31. It includes income accrued to date of death and received afterwards. Where Box 17B shows a loss, there will be no trustee income and Box 18B should be left blank. The loss in Box 17B will be taken into account by us in calculating the loss to carry forward. Accrued income and non-apportionment clauses As a general rule, accrued income to date of death is retained by the trustee and becomes part of the capital of the estate. This income is treated as trustee income. www.ird.govt.nz 33 However, where the will of the deceased taxpayer contains a non-apportionment clause, the beneficiary is entitled to receive the income accrued to date of death. So, if the accrued income is paid to the beneficiary, it's treated as beneficiary income. Question 19 Expenses The estate or trust may have incurred expenses in generating its income, for example: • commission deducted from interest or dividends • expenses for return preparation • deductible trustee charges • interest paid to Inland Revenue. If these expenses haven't been claimed elsewhere in the return, write the amount claimed in Box 19. Certain expenditure is not deductible and this includes: • private expenditure • capital expenditure penalties may apply if it is claimed incorrectly. Note Question 20 Net losses brought forward There are two types of losses the estate or trust can bring forward. Specified activity net losses These are net losses from specified activities incurred before the 1991 income year. Any loss balance in relation to a specified activity that remained at the end of the 2018 income year must be offset against net income for the 2019 income year, before taking into account other losses. The amount of this offset cannot exceed the net income. If the loss balance from specified activities incurred before the 1991 income year exceeds the net income for the 2019 income year, that excess amount is added to the tax loss for the year. Any remaining tax loss is then carried forward to further income years. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE34 Other net losses All losses incurred from the 1991 income year onwards and other net losses that weren't limited before 1991 (including any net loss resulting from excess imputation credits) are "other net losses". Enter the total of all specified activity net losses and other net losses the estate or trust can bring forward to 2019 in Box 20A. Enter the amount the estate or trust has offset against 2019 income in Box 20B. You'll find the amount of net loss the estate or trust has to bring forward on the loss notice we sent you with the 2018 income tax assessment. If you don't have a loss notice, call us to obtain the figure. Note Losses cannot be transferred from the deceased's return to the estate's return. Any such losses lapse. Trust losses cannot be passed to beneficiaries. They remain in the trust to be offset against future trustee income. If the estate or trust can't offset any losses in 2018, enter "0.00" in Box 20B. Questions 21 and 22 Distributions to beneficiaries by foreign and non- complying trusts Question 21 - Distributions At Question 21 print the total amount of distributions made to beneficiaries during the year. A distribution is any income or property of the trust that vests in the beneficiary or is paid or applied for a beneficiary's benefit. It includes any property or service disposed of or provided to: • a beneficiary for less than market value, or • the trust by a beneficiary for greater than market value. Attach a separate schedule to page 3 of the return showing the source and the amount of each distribution. www.ird.govt.nz 35 Distributions are considered to have come from different sources in the following order: • beneficiary income • accumulated trustee income • capital profits or gains realised in the current income year • capital profits or gains realised in previous years that have been accumulated by the trust • the corpus of the trust. The ordering establishes if the distribution is a taxable distribution - see Question 22. Capital gains and corpus distributed only after income derived by trustees in the year of distribution and in prior years has been distributed. Further information about the ordering and taxability of distributions can be found in our Trusts' and estates' income tax rules (IR288) guide. Question 22 - Taxable distributions A taxable distribution is one made to a beneficiary by a foreign or non-complying trust that isn't beneficiary income. For a foreign trust taxable distributions also do not include capital gains profits that aren't included in the taxable income of the trust except when derived from transactions with associated persons or a distribution from the corpus. For non-complying trusts they do not include distributions from the corpus. Write the total taxable distributions made to beneficiaries during the year in Box 22. Where to include taxable distributions Include the amount of the taxable distribution made to each beneficiary in the beneficiary's panel of the IR6B: • in Box 24G if the trust is a foreign trust, or • in Box 24J if the trust is a non-complying trust. For tax payable on taxable distributions see Question 24J on page 39. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE36 Schedule of beneficiary's estate or trust income Each beneficiary (excluding minor beneficiaries) must attach a completed Schedule of beneficiary's estate or trust income (IR307) to their individual tax return if they receive income from a foreign or non-complying trust. It's helpful if the trustee or agent also provides a completed IR307 when advising beneficiaries of their share of trust income. Beneficiaries don't then need to contact the trustee or agent when completing their own returns. Question 23 Additional disclosure of foreign investments If you calculated CFC or FIF income at Question 13 you may be required to complete an additional disclosure form for that investment. If the trust is not widely held or a PIE, you may not require an additional disclosure if the investments are in countries New Zealand has a double tax agreement with as at 31 March 2013, and have used the fair dividend rate or comparative value method. If the trust is widely held or a PIE you are required to file an additional disclosure. Go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: international tax disclosure) for full details of the disclosure requirements and the appropriate form(s). Find out more about the base erosion profit shifting (BEPS) hybrid mismatch rules at www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: hybrid mismatch). If you need assistance making a CFC or FIF disclosure please call 0800 443 773. www.ird.govt.nz 37 IR6B Estate or trust beneficiary details Question 24 Beneficiary income and calculation of tax, excluding minor beneficiaries See Question 18A on pages 31 and 32 for the definition of beneficiary income. Complete the details on the IR6B for each beneficiary and ensure an IRD number is shown for each. If you don't have the beneficiary's IRD number contact the beneficiary. Due to our privacy obligations under section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 we cannot provide it to you. Question 24B Non-resident beneficiaries Please make sure you answer Question 24B about residency. This lets us work out correctly how the beneficiary income should be taxed. Include all beneficiary income allocated to each non-resident beneficiary in Boxes 24C, 24D, 24E, 24F and 24G. Remember, the combined totals at Boxes 24H, less any taxable distributions from foreign trusts included at Box 24G must reconcile with the total of Box 18A. Non-resident passive income Non-resident passive income is interest, dividends and royalties for the supply of scientific, technical, industrial or commercial knowledge. These types of income are subject to non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) if the income has a New Zealand source. This tax is deducted when the non-resident passive income is paid or credited to a non-resident beneficiary. The rates and methods of calculating the tax on a non-resident beneficiary's share of income differ according to the type of income derived and the country the beneficiary is resident in. Include all income derived by each non-resident beneficiary in Boxes 24C, 24D, 24E, 24F and 24G. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE38 Paying NRWT When paying non-resident passive income to a non-resident beneficiary, the trust must complete certain forms and pay N RW T. If you need more help, see our NRWT - payer's guide (IR291). When calculating the amount of income liable for income tax at the ordinary rates, don't include non-resident passive income or any overseas income in the taxable income figure in Box 24H for non-resident beneficiaries. Question 24C New Zealand interest If the allocation of beneficiary income includes any New Zealand interest, write the amount in Box 24C. Question 24D New Zealand dividends If the allocation of beneficiary income includes any New Zealand dividends, write the amount in Box 24D. Question 24E Māori authority distributions If the allocation of beneficiary income includes any Māori authority distributions, write the amount in Box 24E. Question 24F Overseas income If the allocation of beneficiary income includes any overseas income, write the amount in Box 24F. Question 24G Other income and taxable distributions from a foreign trust Add the remainder of any beneficiary income allocated to the beneficiary to any taxable distributions from a foreign trust and write the total in Box 24G. Question 24H Taxable income of beneficiary from the estate or trust Add up boxes 24C to 24G and write the total in Box 24H. www.ird.govt.nz 39 Question 24I Paying the tax on beneficiary income, excluding minor beneficiaries The trustee must pay tax on behalf of the beneficiary for all income allocated to the beneficiary. However, the Trustee and the beneficiary can agree not to have tax deducted from Trust/Estate income before the beneficiary receives it. This might be done where the beneficiary has losses available to offset income. The trustees will be liable if the beneficiary defaults on payment of the tax obligations on trust income. Note Tick 'Yes' if the estate or trust is paying the tax on behalf of beneficiaries, then complete all boxes 24A to 24S. 'Yes' means the trust/estate will retain any excess tax credits (except overseas credits and Imputation credits) for the trust/estate. The beneficiary must then show the gross income allocated to them as trust income and can only claim the amount of tax paid by the Trust at key point 24K, in the key point for Tax Paid by Trustees of their own income tax return. Tick 'No' if the estate or trust is not paying the tax on behalf of beneficiaries. Then complete boxes 24A to 24J, and boxes 24L, 24N and 24P only. Question 24J Taxable distributions by non-complying trust Show taxable distributions to each beneficiary in Box 24J and the tax in Box 24R. Taxable distributions by a non-complying trust are taxable to the beneficiary at a flat rate of 45 cents in the dollar. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE40 Question 24K Calculation of tax Do not fill out Box 24K if you ticked "No" in Box 24I. Note If the estate or trust is paying tax on behalf of the beneficiaries calculate tax on taxable income of beneficiaries using the rates below. 2019 annual tax rates income range Ta x r a t e Income to $14,00010.5% $14,001 - $48,00017.5% $48,001 - $70,00030.0% $70,001 and over33.0% Question 24L Beneficiary's share of overseas tax paid Allocate any tax paid overseas to beneficiaries on the same basis as the allocation of income. Minor beneficiaries' share of overseas tax is to be offset against tax payable on trustee income. A New Zealand resident who receives a taxable distribution is not allowed a tax credit in relation to any income tax paid unless the tax is the same as non-resident withholding tax (NRWT). The amount of any credit is equal to: taxable income × foreign tax paid total distribution Question 24M Calculation Subtract Box 24L from Box 24K. Do not fill out Box 24M if you ticked "No" in Box 24I. Note Subtract Box 24L from Box 24K. If the overseas tax paid (Box 24L) allocated to a beneficiary is greater than the tax payable in Box 24K, print 0.00 at Box 24M. www.ird.govt.nz 41 Question 24N Beneficiary's share of dividend imputation credits If dividends have been allocated to a beneficiary, use the following formula to work out the credits attached to those dividends: a × ( b ) c a is the total of all dividend imputation credits attached to all dividends distributed to beneficiaries during the income year b is the total distribution, including capital distributions made to the particular beneficiary during the year c is the total distribution, including capital distributions made to all beneficiaries during the year. Show the beneficiary's share of imputation credits in Box 24N. Question 24O Calculation Do not fill out Box 24O, if you ticked "No" in Box 24I. Note Subtract Box 24N from Box 24M. If the beneficiary's share of the imputation credits is larger than their tax payable in Box 24M, the excess credit cannot be refunded to the trust. Write 0.00 in Box 24O. The beneficiary should claim the balance of the unused imputation credits in their own tax return. Minor beneficiaries' share of dividend imputation credits is to be offset against tax payable on trustee income in box 25E of the IR6. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE42 Question 24P Beneficiary's allocation of RWT and other credits Minor beneficiaries' allocation of RWT and other credits is to be offset against tax payable on trustee income. Ensure that you include the following amounts in Box 24P for each beneficiary: • allocation of RWT (Boxes 9A and 10A) including any RWT credits reallocated under the RWT substitution payment rules • share of Māori authority credits (Box 11A) • share of partnership, estate or trust tax credits (Box 12A) • share of LTC tax credits (Box 14A) • share of other income credits (Box 16A) • If income from a property sale is treated as beneficiary income show their share of any residential land withholding tax credit (Box 16AA). Don't include any amounts already shown in either Boxes 24L or 24N of the IR6B. Note Questions 24Q & 24S Do not fill out 24Q or 24S if you ticked 'No' in Box 24I. Note Question 24R Calculate tax on taxable distribution by non-complying trust in 24J at 45 cents in the dollar and print in this box. www.ird.govt.nz 43 Trustee income and calculation of tax Question 25A Calculation of taxable income If the result is negative the amount will be taken into account in the loss carried forward to the following year. Question 25B Calculation of tax and tax on taxable distributions If the trust has received a taxable distribution and tax has not been paid, calculate tax at 33 cents in the dollar and add it to the total. Question 25C Credit for tax paid overseas The amount of the credit for tax paid overseas on trustee income is limited to the amount of New Zealand tax on that income. Remember to attach evidence of payment to page 3 of your return. Question 25E Dividend imputation credits If the trustee's share of the imputation credit exceeds the tax on trustee income at Box 25D, the excess credit can't be refunded. Write 0.00 in Box 25F. The excess credit is converted to a net loss to carry forward to the following year. To calculate the net loss to carry forward to 2020, use the worksheet on page 44. We'll send you a notice confirming the amount of loss to carry forward. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE44 In this example the net loss to carry forward to the income year ending 31 March 2020 is $151.00 in Box 4. Trustee's share of imputation credits from Box 25E of the return. 1 350 00 Tax on trustee income from Box 25D of the return. 2 300 00 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1. Print your answer here. 3 50 00 Divide Box 3 by 0.33 (33%). Print your answer here. 4 (151 00) Example Worksheet Trustee's share of imputation credits from Box 25E of the return. 1 Tax on trustee income from Box 25D of the return. 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1. Print your answer here. 3 Divide Box 3 by 0.33 (33%). Print your answer here. 4 The amount in Box 4 is the net loss to carry forward to 2020. Question 25G Trustee's share of RWT and other credits The following amounts should be added together and printed in Box 25G: • the trustee's allocation of RWT (Boxes 9A and 10A) • the trustee's share of Māori authority credits (Box 11A) • the trustee's share of partnership, estate or trust tax credits (Box 12A) • the trustee's share of LTC tax credits (Box 14A) • the total from Box 16A • the trustee's share of any residential land withholding tax credit (Box 16AA). Don't include any amounts already shown in either Boxes 24L or 24N of the IR6B. www.ird.govt.nz 45 Question 27 Refunds and/or transfers Please be careful to copy the amount from Box 26E to Box 27 correctly. Direct credit If you choose direct credit you get your refund faster and you can withdraw your money as soon as it's credited because there's no clearance time. We pay any refund direct into your New Zealand bank account or other deposit account, eg, a building society account as soon as we've processed your return. Make sure your correct account number is printed at Question 6 on the front page of your return. Question 27A Overpaid provisional tax If you've made payments towards your 2020 provisional tax and, after completing this return, find you have less or no provisional tax to pay, the overpayment can be included in the amount we refund or transfer. Print the overpaid amount in Box 27A. Question 27C Transferring a refund to pay provisional tax If you're entitled to a refund you can transfer all or part of it to your 2020 provisional tax. If you want to do this print the amount of the transfer in Box 27C. Questions 27D to 27F Transfers to another taxpayer's income tax account If you'd like your refund transferred to another account you'll need to tell us what date you'd like it transferred. The date you choose depends on what tax has been overpaid and whose account you want the credit transferred to. Different rules apply if the other taxpayer is associated to you. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE46 Associated taxpayers When transferring overpaid tax, associated taxpayers are: • a company you're a shareholder-employee in • a partner in the same partnership • a relative (eg, child, parent, spouse, or partner) • a trustee of a family trust you're a beneficiary of. You can ask for your credit to be transferred at any date as long as it's not before the relevant date shown below. Tick "Yes" or "No" at Box 27D to indicate whether the other taxpayer is associated and write their name in the boxes provided. Write the IRD number of the other taxpayer at Box 27E. Write the amount you wish to transfer at Box 27F. Transfer dates For refunds transferred to your account or an associated taxpayers account: • If the credit is from excess tax deducted (eg, PAYE deducted), it's the day after your balance date (or 1 April if your balance date is before 31 March). • If the credit is from overpaid provisional tax, it's the day you overpaid it. Special rules apply if the return period has had tax pooling refunds transferred in. Note For credit transferred to a non-associated person's account, it's the later of the day you requested the transfer, or the day after you file your return. Future transfer dates If you'd like your credit transferred at a date in the future, attach a note to the front of your return with details of: • the amount you want transferred • the account you want it transferred to, and if it's the account of the associated person • the date you'd like it transferred. www.ird.govt.nz 47 If you don't tell us the date you'd like your credit transferred, we'll transfer it at a date we think gives you the greatest advantage. Contact us if you'd like to change the transfer date and tell us if this transfer is to cover a debt. For further information on transfers, read Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 14, No 11 (November 2002). Refunds of less than $1 If your refund is less than $1 it will be carried forward to your next tax assessment. We'll offset it against any amount you may owe us or add it to any refund. If you don't want it carried forward, please call us on 0800 377 774. Question 28 Initial provisional tax liability If this is the first year the estate or trust started to derive gross income from a taxable activity, print the start date in Box 28. Provisional tax isn't payable if the residual income tax (RIT) for the previous year was $2,500 or less. Most new businesses don't pay provisional tax in their first year of operation because there's no RIT from the previous year to base the calculation on. However, a special rule requires you to pay interest if you have an initial provisional tax liability. The estate or trust has an initial provisional tax liability if: • it starts to derive gross income from a taxable activity, and • it had not derived income from a taxable activity within the preceding four years • you have RIT of $60,000 or more in the current year. The interest cost can be reduced or eliminated by making voluntary provisional tax payments on the instalment due dates. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE48 Interest rules for taxpayers with an initial provisional tax liability Taxpayers with an initial provisional tax liability may be charged interest from the first, second or third instalment date. The instalment date that interest applies from is determined by the taxable activity's start date. For estates and trusts whose balance date is 31 March, the start date for interest will be: • 29 August, if the taxable activity started before 30 July of the same year • 16 January, if the taxable activity started between 31 July and 16 December of the previous year • 8 May, if the taxable activity started on or after 17 December of the previous year. An estate or trust with a balance date other than 31 March generally pays provisional tax on the 28th day of the 5th, 9th and 13th months after the balance date, unless filing 6 monthly GST returns. If you need help to work out whether the estate or trust has an initial provisional tax liability, read our guide Provisional tax (IR289). Question 29 2020 provisional tax 2019 provisional tax is charged for income the estate or trust will earn in the 2019 income year. It is payable in two, three or six equal instalments. There are three options for paying provisional tax - standard, estimation and ratio. If the estate or trust's 2019 RIT is: • $2,500 or less it doesn't have to pay provisional tax, although it can make voluntary payments • more than $2,500 but expected to be $2,500 or less for 2018, it may estimate 2020 provisional tax at nil (read "Estimation option" on page 49) • more than $2,500 and expected to be more than $2,500 for 2019, it must pay 2020 provisional tax. If you anticipate your RIT will exceed $2,500 for the 2020 year, see "Interest" on page 51. You may be liable for interest from your first provisional tax instalment date. www.ird.govt.nz 49 Which option to use Estates or trusts can use either the standard or estimation options to pay their provisional tax. If they're registered for GST they may also be able to use the ratio option. Standard option Using the standard option, the estate or trust's 2020 provisional tax will be equal to its 2019 RIT plus 5%. If you use this option enter S in Box 29A on the return and the amount of 2020 provisional tax in Box 29B. • If the estate or trust’s 2019 return hasn’t been filed by the first instalment date of 2020 provisional tax, the provisional tax instalments payable is based on 2018 RIT plus 10% (divided by 3 or 2, depending on how many instalments are payable). Estimation option Estates or trusts can estimate their 2020 provisional tax. Trustees must include distributions to minor beneficiaries in their estimate. They can re-estimate any number of times up to and including their final instalment due date. If the estate or trust's 2020 RIT is expected to be less than its 2019 RIT, estimating may prevent the estate or trust from paying more tax than it has to. An estimate must be "fair and reasonable" at each instalment it applies to. If you use this option, see page 51 on "Not taking reasonable care penalty" and "Interest". If you estimate your provisional tax, your instalments should be one-third of your estimation. Note Use the worksheet on page 50 to calculate provisional tax using the estimation option. If you use this option enter E in Box 29A and the amount of 2020 provisional tax in Box 29B. Estimating provisional tax on beneficiary income When working out the tax on estimated beneficiary income, calculate the tax separately for each beneficiary, including estimated tax credits where applicable. The table below shows the 2020 individual tax rates for provisional tax. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE50 2020 annual tax rates income range Ta x r a t e Income to 14,00010.5% 14,001 - 48,00017.5% 48,001 - 70,00030.0% $70,001 and over33.0% When using these tax rates to calculate 2020 provisional tax, you'll also need to estimate the tax credits the beneficiary may be entitled to. Use this worksheet to calculate the estate or trust's 2020 provisional tax using the estimation option. Print the estate or trust's estimated 2020 income to be allocated in Box 1. 1 Estimated allocation of income: • Beneficiary income 2 • Trustee income 3 Work out the tax on the amount in Box 2, using the rates above. Print your answer in Box 4. 4 Multiply the amount in Box 3 by 0.33 (33%). Print your answer in Box 5. 5 If the estate or trust is non- complying, multiply the estimated taxable distributions, if any, by 0.45 (45%). Print your answer in Box 6. 6 Add Boxes 4, 5 and 6. Print your answer in Box 7. 7 Print the estimated 2020 credits (trustees' share only) in Box 8. 8 Subtract Box 8 from Box 7. Print your answer in Box 9. 9 Box 9 is the estate or trust's 2020 provisional tax. Copy it to Box 29B of the return and print E in Box 29A. Divide the amount in Box 9 by three to get the amount to pay for each instalment. If you need more help read our guide Provisional tax (IR289). www.ird.govt.nz 51 Ratio option If the trust is GST registered you may qualify to use the ratio option to calculate your provisional tax. Only enter R at Box 29A if you've already elected to use the ratio option. Your application to use the ratio option must be made by phone or in writing before the beginning of the income year you want to use it in. If you've already elected to use the ratio option and want to continue using it, enter R at Box 29A. More information about the ratio option is in our guide Provisional tax (IR289). Not taking reasonable care penalty When you estimate the estate or trust's 2020 provisional tax, your estimate must be fair and reasonable. If the 2020 RIT is greater than the provisional tax paid, you may be liable for a not taking reasonable care penalty of 20% of the underpaid provisional tax. Interest If the estate or trust has paid too much provisional tax on trustee income we may pay interest, or if it hasn't paid enough, we may charge interest. Interest for estates or trusts is calculated only on the tax payable on trustee income. Interest isn't calculated if all income is distributed to the beneficiaries. Interest the estate or trust pays is generally tax-deductible, while interest we pay is taxable income. For more information about interest and penalties read our guide Penalties and interest (IR240). If we pay interest, it continues to accrue until the date we refund the overpaid tax, or apply it to another liability. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE52 Election to be a provisional tax payer An estate or trust is a provisional tax payer for the 2019 year if its RIT for 2019 is more than $2,500. If the 2019 RIT is $2,500 or less, and • the estate or trust made provisional tax payments for that tax year, and • payments were made under the estimation method (other than using the estimation method for its final instalment only), It may elect to be a provisional tax payer for 2019. This may affect the interest it may be entitled to for that year. To elect to be a provisional tax payer for the 2019 year, attach a letter to the front of the return. Change in balance date There are special rules about when provisional tax is due and how interest is calculated if there has been a change in balance date. Read our Provisional tax (IR289) guide for more information. Tax pooling Tax pooling allows taxpayers to pool provisional tax payments, offsetting underpayments by overpayments within the same pool. This reduces their possible exposure to late payment penalties and use-of-money interest. The pooling arrangement is made through a commercial intermediary, who arranges for participating taxpayers to be charged or compensated for the offset. For more information about tax pooling, including a list of intermediaries, go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: tax pooling). www.ird.govt.nz 53 Payment dates 2020 provisional tax Generally, an estate or trust with a 31 March balance date pays provisional tax by the following due dates: • First instalment 28 August 2019 • Second instalment 15 January 2020 • Third instalment 7 May 2020 An estate or trust with a balance date other than 31 March pays provisional tax on the 28th day of the 5th, 9th and 13th months after the balance date. Where payments would otherwise be due on 28 December or 28 April the due date is extended to 15 January or 7 May. These dates will alter if: • the estate or trust is registered for GST, and • the GST filing frequency is six-monthly, or • provisional tax is paid by the ratio option. If either of these situations apply to you, read our guide Provisional tax (IR289). 2019 end-of-year income tax Estates or trusts that have an agent and an extension of time may have until 7 April 2020 to pay their tax. If you think this applies to you contact your agent for more information. Otherwise, an estate or trust with a balance date between 1 March and 30 September must pay its end-of-year income tax and any interest by 7 February 2020. An estate or trust with a balance date between 1 October and 28 February must pay its end-of-year income tax by the 7th day of the month before the following year's balance date.

The changes include: • • limits to the amount of deductions you can claim if your residential rental property makes a loss • • inability to offset excess deductions/rental loss against other income. They are now generally carried forward and offset against future residential property income • • what happens to excess deductions when disposing of residential property • • limits on the amount of interest you can claim for an investment in an entity that rents out residential property.

If you are a trustee of a trust, or the executor or administrator of a deceased person's estate you need to file an IR6 to account for income the estate or trust earns. In this guide we use "trustee" or "you" to refer to the person or persons administering an estate or trust. The word trust also refers to estates unless we've stated otherwise. This guide provides general information about how to complete the IR6 return. There are references throughout the guide to our other publications which may help you. If you still need help please call us on one of the telephone numbers listed under "Services you may need" at the back of this guide or contact a tax advisor. How income of an estate or trust is taxed in general In general, income of an estate or trust will be subject to income tax in New Zealand if it has a source in New Zealand regardless of the residency of the trustee. The trustee is also liable for New Zealand income tax on income derived outside New Zealand where any settlor of the trust is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year, or if the estate has a New Zealand trustee and the deceased was resident in New Zealand. Allocations Income of a trust is either trustee or beneficiary income. The trustee can allocate income as beneficiary income, provided the income either: • • vests absolutely in the beneficiary in the income year, or • • is paid or applied for the benefit of the beneficiary during that income year or within a specified period from the end of the income year. For more information see Question 18A on page 35. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE6 Trust income allocated as beneficiary income is taxable income, except as covered below under the special rules for allocations to minor beneficiaries. Distributions In addition to allocating beneficiary income, a trustee can make distributions to beneficiaries. A distribution can be made up of: (a) tax-paid profits (trustee income or beneficiary income) (b) capital gains of the trust (c) corpus of the trust (the capital contributed to set up the trust) (d) (for a foreign trust) non-taxed profits such as foreign- sourced income. The tax position of a distribution from a trust depends on the type of trust making the distribution and the residency of the beneficiary. See pages 11 to 13 of this guide. Generally, a distribution to a New Zealand resident beneficiary from: (a) a complying trust is not taxable (b) a foreign trust is taxable, to the extent it is not part of the corpus or capital gains (c) a non-complying trust is taxable at 45 cents in the dollar, to the extent it is not part of the corpus. Allocations of beneficiary income to a minor A minor is defined as a New Zealand resident under the age of 16 years on the balance date of the trust. Allocations of beneficiary income that the minor beneficiary rule applies to are treated as trustee income. This means they are: • • taxed at 33% • • included in the trustee's tax calculation in the IR6 return, and • • included in the trustees' provisional tax calculations. The minor beneficiary should not include this income in their Individual income tax return (IR3). ird.govt.nz 7 Exceptions to the minor beneficiary rule The following exceptions allow income allocated to a minor beneficiary to be treated as beneficiary income if the income: • • is derived by a minor for whom a child disability allowance is paid under the Social Security Act 2018, or • • is derived directly from either a group investment fund, the Māori trustee or a Māori authority, or • • the amount allocated to the minor from the trust is $1,000 or less in an income year. Note If the $1,000 threshold is exceeded, the total income allocated to the minor beneficiary is taxed as trustee income. For example, if a minor beneficiary is allocated $1,200, the total allocation of $1,200 is taxed at 33%. The general anti-avoidance rule may apply if a person establishes multiple trusts to increase the number of exemptions. See Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 19, No 4 (May 2007) for further information. There are further exceptions to the minor beneficiary rule that relate to the nature of the settlements on the trust. For further information, please see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001). ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE8 Return due date If the estate or trust has a 31 March balance date you have until 7 July 2020 to send in the return, unless you have been granted an extension of time. If you have a balance date other than 31 March, the due date may be different. Call us on 0800 377 774 if you're not sure. If the estate or trust is the client of an agent, it may have until 31 March 2021 to file the return. Contact your agent for more information. International obligations You may also need to provide information about a trust to comply with the following international obligations. The Common Reporting Standard (CRS) For further information see: • • IR Guidance on the CRS - IR1048 section 11 • • CRS: Is the Trust a Reporting Financial Institution - IR1052 • • Family Trust obligations under the CRS - IR1053 • • or go to ird.govt.nz (search keyword: CRS). Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) For further information see: • • FATCA Trusts Guidance - IR1087 • • FATCA status of NZ trusts that are not US person - IR1086 • • go to ird.govt.nz (search keyword: FATCA). ird.govt.nz 9 Questions Questions 1 to 6 The information in Questions 1 to 6 of the return helps us to be sure that any correspondence we send goes to the right person at the right address. Fill in these questions only if the correct information is not printed on the return. Question 1 IRD number If the estate or trust does not have an IRD number complete an IRD number application - resident non-individual (IR596) and send it in with the return. Question 2 Name of estate or trust If the estate or trust has changed its name since the last time a return was filed, please provide proof of the change so we can update our records, eg, trustee resolution. Questions 3 and 4 Postal address and phone number If you have a new postal address, write the details at Question 3. If your new postal address is a PO Box number, please show your box lobby if you have one. If you're unsure please contact New Zealand Post. If the estate or trust uses its tax agent's postal address, leave this panel blank. Your tax agent will let us know of any change of address when updating their client list. We ask for your daytime phone number at Question 4 in case we need to call you with questions about the return. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE10 Question 5 Business industry classification (BIC) code We're required to supply the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) with a code for your business or trading activity, for levy classification and calculation. If your BIC code isn't pre-printed on the return or is different from the pre-printed one, please enter the correct code. To work out your main business or trading activity and its code, go to www.businessdescription.co.nz or call ACC on 0800 222 776. It's important that you choose the code which most accurately reflects your main business or trading activity. Note Please provide the code only. Don't provide a description. Question 6 Bank account number The fastest and safest way to get any refund is to have it direct credited to your New Zealand bank account or other deposit account, eg, a building society account. If your bank account number isn't preprinted on the return form, please include it at Question 6. If your suffix has only two digits, enter them in the first two squares of the suffix box. Question 7A Has the estate or trust ceased? If the estate or trust has ceased, include accounts showing the distribution of all assets and liabilities to the date the estate or trust was finalised. If the estate or trust is registered for GST or as an employer, you'll need to complete a Business cessation (IR315) form to finalise your records. ird.govt.nz 11 Question 7B Nil trust returns If the trust receives any income, eg, interest, the trustee must file a return regardless of the amount of income derived. Where a trust has no prospect or intention of deriving any income in a given financial year, please call us on 0800 377 774 with the name and IRD number of the trust so we can record that a return isn't required for that year. If the trust subsequently derives income in a future year, the trust must send in a return. Note This only applies to trust returns. Estates are still required to file a return of income regardless of whether they have derived income. A complying trust that is non-active and doesn't want to file an income tax return can complete and send the Non-active trust declaration (IR633): The complying trust needs to declare: • • It hasn't derived or been deemed to have derived any gross income from any source. • • It has no deductions. • • It has not been party to, or continued with, any transactions with assets of the trust that give rise to any of the following during the tax year: a. Income or deemed income in any person's hand. b. Fringe benefits to any employee or former employee. Question 8 Types of trusts The type of trust determines the way certain distributions are taxed in the hands of beneficiaries. There are three types of estates or trusts for income tax purposes: • • complying • • foreign • • non-complying. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE12 Complying trust In general a complying trust is one that has been taxed in New Zealand on all its trustee income since the date it began and the trustee has met all it's tax obligations. Complying trusts include: • • trusts settled by New Zealand residents with New Zealand trustees and New Zealand beneficiaries • • estates of people who were New Zealand residents when they died • • foreign trusts that have elected to become complying trusts. The trust can still be a complying trust if the trustee was not liable for New Zealand income tax because: • • the trust earned no income, or • • the income was exempt, or • • the trust was in a loss situation. Foreign trust A foreign trust is one where no settlor of the trust has been resident in New Zealand since: • • 17 December 1987, or the date the trust was first settled, whichever is later, and on the date of distribution. Non-complying trust A trust that isn't a complying trust or a foreign trust is a non- complying trust. Non-complying trusts include: • • trusts with a New Zealand-resident settlor, but non- resident trustees, that haven't been liable for or haven't paid New Zealand income tax on all trustee income since first being settled • • foreign trusts where the settlor has become a New Zealand resident and an election hasn't been made to be a complying trust • • all the beneficiaries are non-residents and all the income is passive income such as interest, dividends, and royalties. ird.govt.nz 13 Election to change category of trust for tax purposes New residents or former residents who have settled a trust before coming to New Zealand may elect to pay New Zealand tax on future trustee income. Making this election will mean the trust becomes a complying trust for income derived on or after the date on which the election is made. An election can be made by a settlor, trustee or beneficiary using an Election to pay income tax on trustee income (IR463) form. If an election isn't made the trust will become a non- complying trust. Elections must be made within 12 months of a new resident ceasing to be a transitional resident, and within 12 months of the arrival for a former resident. Unit trust A unit trust is treated as a company for tax purposes. If you're preparing a tax return for a unit trust, please complete a Companies income tax return (IR4). Group investment fund If the income is: • • solely from Category B income, an IR6 must be completed • • solely from Category A income, an IR4 must be completed • • a combination of both Category A and Category B income, an IR4 and IR44E must be completed. Please read the notes on the IR44E for further information. Superannuation schemes A superannuation scheme that isn't registered with the Financial Markets Authority and doesn't allow investors to contribute will be treated as a trust for tax purposes and must file an IR6 return. Income and credits section Income received by a trust retains its character as it passes through the trust. For this reason we ask that you return different types of income in certain boxes. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE14 Question 9 New Zealand interest Include interest from all New Zealand sources at Question 9. The interest payer will usually send you an RWT withholding certificate (IR15), or similar statement, showing the gross interest paid and the amount of RWT deducted. Write the total of all RWT deducted in Box 9A. Add up all the gross interest amounts (before the deduction of any tax) and write the total in Box 9B. Note If expenses are deductible against the interest income (eg, commission), claim them at Question 19. Read about expenses on page 41. Don't send in any interest statements or IR15 certificates with your return, but keep them in case we ask for them later. Interest on broken term deposits If you've broken a term deposit during the year, you may have to account for "negative interest". This is interest repaid on a term deposit and may reduce the amount of interest to declare in your return. If the term deposit was broken in full, or it was business related, deduct the negative interest from the gross interest shown on the IR15 or equivalent statement. Deduct the allowable negative interest component, using the worksheet below, before entering the gross amount at Box 9B on your return. In all other cases, the negative interest is deductible in a future income year when the term deposit matures. Worksheet Copy your gross interest from your RWT withholding certificate to Box 1. 1 Print any negative interest you've paid in Box 2. 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the answer in Box 3. Copy this amount to Box 9B of your tax return. 3 ird.govt.nz 15 Interest paid or charged by Inland Revenue If we paid you interest, include it in Box 9B for the income year the trust received the interest. If the trust paid us interest, include it as a deduction in Box 19 of the return for the income year the interest is paid. Interest from overseas If the trust received interest from overseas, convert your overseas interest and tax credits to New Zealand dollars and show the amounts at Question 13. Please read the notes about overseas income on pages 20 to 23. Income from financial arrangements The financial arrangement rules generally require income or expenditure from financial arrangements to be spread over the term of the arrangement. Financial arrangements include term deposits, government stock, local authority stock, mortgage bonds, futures contracts and deferred property settlements. Trustees are required to use a spreading method unless they are a cash basis person. A person is a cash basis person if: • • the value of all financial arrangements together is less than $1 million, or • • the value of the income or expenditure from the financial arrangement is less than $100,000, and • • the deferral of income or expenditure using the cash method rather than the actual method is less than $40,000. A special rule applies for deceased persons. If the deceased person was a cash basis person at the date of death, the concession applies in the year of death and up to four succeeding years. Any RWT from a financial arrangement will be deducted on a cash basis. Different rules apply for financial arrangements entered into prior to 20 May 1999. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE16 Sale or maturity of financial arrangements Whether or not the exemption from the spreading methods explained earlier applies, when a financial arrangement matures or is sold, remitted, or transferred, a "wash-up" calculation known as a base-price adjustment must be carried out. Cash basis persons can use the Sale or disposal of financial arrangements (IR3K) to perform the calculation. This form could be used, for example, to calculate the amount you need to account for if you have broken a term deposit in full. For further information about the financial arrangements rules, please see Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 11, No 6 (July 1999), page 3. Any RWT will be deducted on a cash basis. Question 10 New Zealand dividends Dividends are the part of a company's profits that it passes on to its shareholders. Unit trusts are treated as companies for income tax purposes. Distributions from unit trusts will generally be taxable and are treated as dividends. Note All the trust's cash and taxable bonus issue dividends derived from a qualifying company must be distributed by the trustees as beneficiary income to the beneficiaries who are not trustees or companies that are not qualifying companies. Complete Question 10 if you received any New Zealand dividends, including dividends from your local electricity or gas supplier. Don't include a dividend that's a distribution of the trust's capital and is tax free. The company or unit trust that paid you the dividend will send you a dividend statement. Don't send any dividend statements with the return, but keep them in case we ask for them later. ird.govt.nz 17 Note If expenses are deductible against the dividend income, claim them at Question 19. Credits attached to dividends "Imputation credits" are credits for part of the tax the company has already paid on its profits, which means the dividends aren't taxed twice. RWT is deducted from your dividend to bring the total credits withheld up to 33% of the gross dividend. What to show in your return Your dividend statements show the amount: • • you received (net dividend) • • of any imputation credits • • of any RWT credits. Add all these amounts together to work out your total gross dividends and enter this in Box 10B. Add up all the imputation credits and print the total in Box 10. Add any dividend RWT credits and print the total in Box 10A. Shares instead of dividends If the trust received shares instead of dividends, include them as income at Question 10B. Write the amount as if you received dividends instead of shares. Dividends from overseas Please read about overseas income on pages 20 to 23 of this guide. Question 11 Māori authority distributions Māori authorities can make various types of distributions. Fill in Question 11 if you received any taxable Māori authority distributions. The Māori authority that paid you the distribution will send you a Māori authority distribution statement. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE18 Credits attached to distributions The Māori authority may attach a credit to the distribution it makes to members. This credit will be classified as a "Māori authority credit". It is usually part of the tax the Māori authority has already paid on its profits, which means the distributions aren't taxed twice. What to show in your return Your Māori authority distribution statement shows the amount of: • • the distribution made to you, including what portion is taxable and what portion is non-taxable • • Māori authority credit. Transfer these amounts, leaving out any non-taxable distributions, to the relevant boxes at Question 11. Non-taxable distribution You don't need to include in the IR6 return any other distributions received from a Māori authority that aren't taxable in the hands of a Māori authority member. These amounts are non-taxable distributions and can't have credits attached. For more information read our Māori authorities guide (IR487). Question 12 Partnership, estate or trust income Partnership If the estate or trust received any income from a partnership, write the details at Question 12. Don't include: • • interest and RWT (include these at Question 9) • • any dividends, imputation credits or dividend RWT (include these at Question 10) • • any Māori authority dividends and Māori authority credits (include these at Question 11) • • any overseas income and qualifying tax credits attached (include these at Question 13). ird.govt.nz 19 Estate or trust If the estate or trust has received income from a foreign or non-complying trust, complete a Schedule of beneficiary's estate or trust income (IR307) and attach it to the return. Add up all the other income from partnerships, complying and foreign trusts, and write the total in Box 12B. Add up any other tax credits and write the total in Box 12A. Don't include: • • interest and RWT (include these at Question 9) • • any dividends, imputation credits or dividend RWT (include these at Question 10) • • any Māori authority dividends and Māori authority credits (include these at Question 11) • • any overseas income and qualifying tax credits attached (include these at Question 13). If the estate or trust has received a taxable distribution from a non-complying trust do not include the amount as income. Calculate tax on the taxable distribution at 45 cents in the dollar and add it to the amount in Box 27B. You can use a loss to reduce the amount of the taxable distribution. Net losses brought forward from an earlier income year and losses incurred in the 2019 income year can be used to reduce the amount. If a loss is used in this way it is no longer available to offset other income. The reduction is calculated using the following formula: (Tax loss × 0.33) ÷ 0.45 Losses from limited partnerships If the estate or trust is claiming a loss from a limited partnership and you need help working out the amount that can be claimed, go to ird.govt.nz (search keywords: limited partnership loss deduction calculator). ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE20 Question 13 Overseas income If the trust received overseas income, eg, interest or financial arrangements, show this at Question 13. Convert all overseas income and qualifying overseas tax paid to New Zealand dollars. You can do this by: • • using the rates available on ird.govt.nz (search keywords: overseas currency) • • contacting the overseas section of a trading bank and asking for the exchange rate for the day you received your overseas income. Include any overseas income and credits which you received from a partnership, Look-through company (LTC), estate or trust here. Include gross income before deducting any tax credits at Box 13B. Credit for tax paid overseas will be limited to the amount of New Zealand tax payable on that income. How overseas income of an estate or trust is taxed In New Zealand, overseas income is taxed according to the residency of the settlor. The rules for the three most common situations are described over the page. New Zealand resident trustees and income derived outside New Zealand As a general rule, where a trustee is resident in New Zealand, and the trustee derives an amount from outside New Zealand, that income will be income of the trustee. The amount will be exempt income of the trustee if: • • no settlor of the trust except a transitional resident is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year, • • that trust is not a testamentary trust (trust created by a person under their will) or an inter vivos trust (trust created by the settlor during their lifetime) where any settlor of the trust died resident in New Zealand, whether in that income year or otherwise. ird.govt.nz 21 Non-resident trustees and income derived outside of New Zealand A non-resident trustee is also liable for New Zealand income tax on income derived from outside New Zealand where: • • any settlor is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year, or • • any settlor of an inter vivos or a testamentary trust died while they were resident in New Zealand, and a trustee is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year. Exceptions to the general rule for non-resident trustees and income derived outside New Zealand There are two situations in which a non-resident trustee is not liable for income tax on trustee income derived from outside New Zealand. These apply where the trustee is resident outside New Zealand at all times during the income year and either: • • no settlement has been made on the trust since 17 December 1987, or • • the only settlements made on the trust were by settlors who were not resident in New Zealand at the time of settlement and who have not been residents in New Zealand since 17 December 1987. Neither exception applies where an election to pay tax on trustee income has been made by the trustee. These exceptions do not affect the liability to income tax for any settlor of the trust, for example, where the settlor elects to pay tax on trustee income. The trustee income remains liable for income tax for the purpose of determining whether the trust is a complying trust (formerly qualifying trust). Overseas dividends If you are a New Zealand resident trustee and at any time during the 2020 income year you held rights such as shares, units or an entitlement to benefit in any foreign company, foreign trust, foreign superannuation scheme, or foreign life insurance policy, you may be required to calculate foreign investment fund (FIF) income or loss on those investments and include this amount in Box 13B. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE22 Generally, you will use the fair dividend rate to calculate FIF income. The trustees may also need to file an additional FIF disclosure form. For more information read the guide to Question 23 on pages 42 to 43. You will not need to do this if the investment is covered by an exclusion. The main exclusions from an interest in an FIF are: • • investments in certain Australian resident companies listed on approved indices on the Australian stock exchange, that maintain franking accounts. Investments covered in the list are available in the Australian share exemption list (IR871) • • interest in certain Australian units • • limited exemptions for interests in certain venture capital • • limited exemptions for interests in certain venture capital interests that move offshore (for 10 or more income years from the income year in which the company migrates from New Zealand) • • a 10% or greater interest in a controlled foreign company (CFC). A limited number of trusts are also excluded from the rules if the attributing interests are below $50,000. These are: • • a testamentary trust • • a compensatory trust • • where the settlor of the trust is the Accident Compensation Corporation. If the exclusions apply and the trust is under the threshold, include dividends received in Box 13B and any qualifying overseas tax credits in Box 13A. Note If your dividend exceeds your FIF income, the amount of imputation credit you can claim is calculated on the basis of your FIF income. If your FIF income exceeds your dividend, you can claim the entire imputation credit attached to the dividend. Any excess imputation credit can't be carried forward to the next year or coverted to a loss. ird.govt.nz 23 Please note you can't claim Australian franking credits. For more information about the FIF rules read A guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate - IR461, Tax Information BulletinVol 19, No 3 (April 2007) page 28, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 20, No 3 (April 2008) page 110, or go to ird.govt.nz (search keyword: FIF). CFC income or loss If at any time during the 2020 income year the trust has attributed CFC income or loss, the trustees or beneficiaries may be required to calculate this in their own income tax return(s). A loss from a CFC can't be used to offset domestic income or be included in domestic losses that are carried forward to the 2021 income year. Generally, these losses can only offset income or future income from CFCs that are resident in the same country as the CFC that incurred the loss. The trustees may also need to file an additional CFC disclosure form. See Question 23 on pages 42 to 43. Investments in portfolio investment entities (PIEs) and portfolio investor attributed income/loss If you receive dividends from a PIE that is a listed company and doesn't use your prescribed investor rate (PIR), you may choose whether to include the dividends in your return. The attributed PIE income/loss is included in the estate or trust's return for the period that includes the end of the PIE's income year. PIEs usually have a 31 March balance date. The amount of income derived by the estate or trust as a distribution by a PIE is excluded income of the estate or trust other than fully imputed dividends from a PIE that is a listed company and doesn't use your PIR. Further information is available in our guide Information for trustees who invest in PIEs - IR856. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE24 Question 14 Look-through company (LTC) income If the estate or trust received any tax credits and/or income from an LTC write the details at Question 14. Don't include any of the following types of income received from an LTC at Question 14: • • interest and RWT (include these at Question 9) • • any dividends, imputation credits, and dividend RWT (include these at Question 10) • • Māori authority distributions and credits (include these at Question 11) • • any overseas income and qualifying tax credits attached (include these at Question 13) • • residential rental income (include this at Question 15). The loss limitation rule limits the amount of deductions an LTC owner (shareholder) can claim if the amount exceeds the owner's "owner's basis" (equity) in the LTC. For the 2017-18 and later income years, the loss limitation rule only applies to an LTC which is in a partnership or joint venture which includes another LTC. The estate or trust can now claim the full amount of prior years' non-allowable deductions brought forward this year. This won't apply if the loss limitation rule continues to apply to limit the amount claimable. The LTC will normally supply information about the non- allowable deductions and any other information required to complete your return. ird.govt.nz 25 Example Trust A is an owner of an LTC which is not in a partnership or joint venture that includes another LTC. For the 2018-19 income year Trust A has a net loss of $4,000.00 from the LTC. Trust A also has prior years' non-allowable deductions brought forward of $5,000.00. Trust A had no tax credits from the LTC for the year. Trust A's tax return should show the following amounts in the following boxes: • • 14A: $0.00 • • 14B: $4,000.00 - • • 14C: $0.00 • • 14D: $5,000.00 • • 14E: $9,000.00 - What to show on your return Add up all other tax credits received from the LTC and print the total in Box 14A. Add up all LTC income, deduct expenses not already included elsewhere and print in Box 14B. If a loss, put a minus sign in the last box.

Add up all prior year non-allowable deductions claimable this year and print the amount in Box 14D. You'll be able to claim the full amount of non-allowable deductions brought forward from last year if the loss limitation rule no longer applies. If you have an amount in Box 14C, add this to Box 14B and put the total in Box 14E. If you have an amount in Box 14D, subtract this from Box 14B and put the total in Box 14E. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE26 If you don't have any amounts in Box 14C or Box 14D, copy the amount from Box 14B to 14E. Box 14E is your adjusted LTC income. You can find more information about LTCs in the Look- through companies - IR879 guide. Question 15 Income and expenditure from residential property This question applies to owners of residential rental property, including overseas property subject to the residential property deduction rules in subpart EL of the Income Tax Act 2007. Most residential rental properties are subject to the residential property deduction rules (also known as the ring-fencing rules). When they apply, your residential rental deductions generally cannot be more than your residential property income. If your deductions are more than your income, the difference must be carried forward to the next year you earn residential income, including income from properties held on revenue account. There are two levels of exclusions from the rules. Any rental income or loss and net income or loss from a taxable disposal is fully excluded from the new rules if the property is: • • the main home; • • property subject to the mixed-use asset rules (holiday home rented out part-time); • • certain employee accommodation. For these types of property, the existing rules apply with the rental income or loss shown at box 16 and net income or net loss from a taxable disposal shown in box 17. ird.govt.nz 27 Any rental net loss and net loss from a taxable disposal is partially excluded from the new rules if it is for: • • property that will always be taxed on sale, being revenue account property of a person in the business of building, developing or dealing in land; • • other revenue account property the person has notified us they want the exclusion to apply to. For these types of property any rental net loss is shown at box 16 and taxable disposal net loss shown at Box 17. Net rental income and net income from a taxable disposal plus any depreciation recovered is shown as residential income Box 15A. All other residential property income is to be included in Box 16B. Income or loss from the sale/disposal of residential property that is outside the rules is included in Box 17B. Refer to the Rental income - IR264 guide for information on when the rules apply, how to calculate your income, the amount of deductions you can claim for this year, and the amount of any excess deductions that must be carried forward. The residential property deduction rules also apply to a trust that has borrowed money to acquire an interest in certain entities with significant rental property holdings - a residential land-rich entity -and has interest expenditure on the borrowed money. Residential land-rich entity - a close company, partnership or look-through company that holds more than 50% of its assets by value in residential land directly or indirectly. They come under the interposed entities rules as part of the residential property deduction rules. For more information about the interposed entity rules, see page 60 of the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No.8 September 2019. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE28 Completing Question 15 in your return Tick the method you have used to calculate your residential property income and deductions. You can use one of the following methods: • • Portfolio basis - combine the income and deductions for all rental properties in the portfolio. • • Individual, property-by-property basis - income and deductions of individual property calculated separately to other property. You need to maintain separate records for each property to choose this option. • • Combination of the property-by-property basis and portfolio basis - choose to apply different methods to different property. Some properties are held in a portfolio and others are held on property-by-property basis. If you are an owner of a look-through company (LTC) and have attributed residential income or residential rental deductions you need to use the same method the LTC used to attribute the income and deductions. Calculate and identify the amounts for Boxes 15A to 15F using your chosen method/s. Calculate your rental income and deductions as usual, as shown at boxes 4 and 14 on the Rental income - IR3R form. You can then enter these figures in the Residential property deductions worksheets - IR1226 to help calculate the figures required to be entered in your return. You can print a copy off our website ird.govt.nz Write the total residential income in Box 15A. This is the total of: (a) all rental income from the portfolio (and/or individual property); (b) all depreciation recovery income for assets disposed of from the portfolio (or individual property); (c) net income from the taxable sale/disposal of a property in your portfolio (or individual property); and (d) all net rental income, depreciation recovery income and net income from the taxable disposal of the property from residential property excluded because it is held on revenue account. ird.govt.nz 29 Only include the net income from a disposal once. If you are a partner in a partnership or owner of a look- through company and have been attributed residential income Box 26G on the IR7P or IR7L include that here. Write the total residential rental deductions for residential rental properties in Box 15B. This is the total deductions for the current year - Box 14 on the Rental income - R3R if completed. If you are a partner in a partnership or owner of a look- through company and have been attributed residential rental deductions Box 26M on the IR7P or IR7L include that here. Do not include purchase costs, capital improvements or costs incurred when disposing of the property here. They are included when calculating the net income for taxable disposals. Include the amount of any interest paid on an investment in a land rich entity that relates to the rental activity in Box 15B. Include the amount of interest paid that doesn’t relate to the rental property in Box 16. Write the total excess deductions brought forward from last year in Box 15C. This Box cannot be completed for the tax year ending 31 March 2020. Calculate the amount of allowable deductions you can claim this year adjusting for excess deductions. Write the total residential rental deductions claimed this year in Box 15D. This should equate to Box 15B plus Box 15C less the amount of excess deductions for each property and/or property portfolio calculations shown in Box 15F. The amount cannot exceed total residential income at Box 19A, unless there was a taxable sale/disposal of a rental property. Combine the net income results (after adjusting for any excess deductions) for each property and or property portfolio calculations in Box 15E. Your total Net residential income in Box 15E cannot be a loss, unless the rental property or all the properties in the portfolio have been disposed of as taxable sales. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE30 Any losses are counted as zero unless the loss is the results of either: • • excess deductions released as the result of the taxable disposal of the rental property or all portfolio properties. • • claimable interest paid on your investment in a residential land-rich entity. Refer to the Rental income - IR264 guide. Write the amount of all excess deductions for the year to be carried forward to next year in Box 15F. This is calculated as Residential rental deductions Box 15B plus 15C minus Residential rental deductions claimed this year Box 15D. Include the amount of any excess deductions to be carried forward for interest paid on an investment in a land rich entity in Box 15F. NOTES Note 1 If you sell/dispose of an individual property and the sale is not taxable; or you sell/dispose of the last property in a portfolio and at least one of the sales in the portfolio was not taxable, any excess deductions will transfer to another property or portfolio and carried forward to a future year in which you earn income from a residential rental property (including properties on revenue account). Note 2 If you sell/dispose of an individual property and the sale is taxable, or you sell/dispose of the last rental property in a portfolio, and the sale of all your rental properties in a portfolio were taxable, any remaining loss/excess deductions are released and can be offset against other income. However, this does not include any excess deductions transferred to the portfolio/property. ird.govt.nz 31 Note 3 If you want to claim that a property is held on revenue account where the sale may be taxable, you need to tell us the property details of the property. You will be stating the sale will be a taxable sale when the property is disposed of. You must be able to separately identify the deductions relating to the property. Refer to the Rental income - IR264 guide. Question 16 Business or rental income If the estate or trust has business or rental income (other than residential rental income see question 15), you must attach either: • • a fully completed Financial statements summary - IR10 form, or • • a set of the estate or trust's financial accounts for the year. The IR10 summarises the information we need from the financial accounts. If you complete an IR10 you don't need to send us your financial accounts, but you still need to complete and keep them. Business income Write the net profit in Box 15B. This is the amount of income or net loss after all allowable business expenditure has been deducted. If the total is a loss, put a minus sign in the last box at Box 16B. When calculating business income, you can use the Schedule of business income - IR3B. Rental income If there is rental income other than residential rental income, print the net profit or loss (total rents minus expenses) in Box 16B. When calculating rental income you can use the Rental income - IR3R. Attribution rule Under the attribution rule, anyone whose actions cause an associated person (company, trust or partnership) to earn income, can be personally liable for tax on that income. If this rule applies to persons associated with your estate or trust, it will affect the amount of taxable income in this return. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE32 For more information read our Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 12 (December 2000) page 49 and TIB, Vol 13, No 11 (November 2001). Question 16AA - Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) credit The estate or trust can claim a credit for RLWT deducted from the sale of a property. If more than one amount was deducted, show the combined amount. Show the amount of RLWT deducted, less any RLWT paid back to the estate or trust and/or transferred to outstanding amounts. Show the name of the the estate or trust’s withholder(s) in the “Name of payer” box. Question 17 income from taxable sale/ disposals of property Income from the sale of land and/or buildings Include all income from land sales that are excluded from the residential property deduction rules. Tax losses from disposals of residential property are also included under this question. Net income from a bright-line sale is included under Residential income at Question 15. The sale of the main home and holiday home taxed under the mixed-use asset rules are also included here. The profits are taxable if you bought a property for the purpose of reselling it or are in the business of buying and selling land and/or buildings. If you purchased a residential property on or after 1 October 2015 and sold/disposed of it within a certain period of time, any profit will be taxable, even if you didn't intend to sell when you purchased it. This is called the bright-line test. The bright-line test applies to: • • properties purchased/acquired on or after 1 October 2015 through to 28 March 2018 inclusive and sold/ disposed of within two years, and • • properties purchased/acquired on or after 29 March 2018 and sold within five years. ird.govt.nz 33 The profits may also be taxable if you: • • are a builder and improved a property before selling it • • developed or subdivided land and sold sections • • had a change of zoning on your property and sold it within ten years of buying it. The bright-line test needs to be considered when none of the other land sale rules apply to the disposal of the property. Disposals by a beneficiary, executor or administrator of residential land transferred to them on the death of a person are specifically excluded from the bright-line test. However, the disposals may still be subject to tax under the current land sale rules. Show the total profit from other property in Box 18. If the property was taxable under the bright-line test and made a loss, any excess deductions cannot be claimed unless they can be offset against net income from other residential property sales. For more information on property sales see our guide Buying and selling residential property - IR313. Complete a Property sale information - IR833 for each property sold/disposed of and include it with your return. The form explains how to calculate and correctly return the resulting profit or loss. You can download the form from ird.govt.nz Complete the form even if the details have been included in a Financial statements summary - IR10 or set of accounts. Question 18 Other income At Question 18 show any other income received by the estate or trust, eg, income from: • • any undertaking or scheme • • sale of shares or other property • • sale or disposal of assets • • any schedular payments received by a trust • • certain settlements on a trust • • forgiveness of debt. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE34 Note If the estate or trust has a 2020 loss it wants to carry back to 2019, enter the loss amount in box 18B (Other income) in the 2020 income tax return. See ‘Loss carry-back’ at Question 22 on page 40. Read the following sections for more information on the above items. Income from any undertaking or scheme Profits made from any undertaking or scheme entered into for the purpose of making a profit, are taxable to the estate or trust. On a separate sheet of paper write down what the undertaking or scheme was and list the details of income and expenses from these undertakings and schemes. Staple it to page 3 of the return and include the total profit in Box 18B. Income from sale of land and/or buildings other than residential The profits are taxable if the estate or trust purchased a property for the purpose of reselling it or are in the business of buying and selling land and/or buildings. If the estate or trust is a New Zealand tax resident it will need to pay tax on its worldwide income under New Zealand tax law. This includes any property sales worldwide. Complete a Property sale information - IR833 for each property sold/disposed of and include it with the return. The form explains how to calculate and correctly return the resulting profit or loss. You can download the form from ird.govt.nz Complete the form even if the details have been included in a Financial statements summary - IR10 or set of accounts. Include total profits in Box 16B. Income from sale of shares or other property Profits from the sale of shares or other property are taxable if the estate or trust: • • buys and sells shares or other property as a business • • buys shares or other property for the purpose of resale • • buys shares or property to make a profit. ird.govt.nz 35 List the details of income and expenses from these sales on a sheet of paper and staple it to page 3 of the return. Include the total profit in Box 16B. Sale or disposal of assets There are a number of rules that apply to the sale or disposal of assets. For further information read Part 3 of our guide Depreciation - a guide for business - IR260. Losses from sale of land, buildings, shares that aren't FIFs, or other property If the estate or trust has made a loss and can show that if it had made a profit it would have been taxable, it may be able to claim the loss as a deduction. If the property was purchased on or after 1 October 2015 with no intention to sell and it was sold/disposed of within two years, any excess deductions can't be claimed unless they can be offset against net income from other property sales. The Property sale information - IR833 form has more information on this. For more information on property sales see our guide Buying and selling residential property - IR313. Show the loss with a minus sign in the last box at Box 16B. PAYE income accrued to date of death The following types of PAYE income must be returned by the estate if it is accrued to the date of death and subsequently received by the estate: • • salary or wages • • holiday pay or other leave payments • • director's fees • • any other PAYE income (includes schedular payments). Include the total gross amount in Box 16B and any tax credits in Box 16A. This income is assessed as trustee income. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE36 Certain settlements on a trust The following settlements of property on a trust are deemed to be trustee income. This means that these settlements of property are excluded from the definition of corpus: • • property settled by a trustee of another trust, so long as it would have counted as income if that trust had distributed the property to one of its beneficiaries instead. • • a settlement of a property on a trust, which, if not for the settlement, would have constituted: - income of the settlor, or - a dividend for which the settlor would have been liable to deduct an FDP (foreign dividend payment), formerly dividend withholding payment, if the settlor is currently resident or had been resident in New Zealand and subject to income tax at that time. Forgiveness of debt The financial arrangements rules treat debts that do not have to be repaid because they have been forgiven as income to the debtor. There is an exception in the case of trusts if the creditor is a natural person and forgives the debt: • • due to "natural love and affection" for natural persons who are beneficiaries of the trust, or • • of a trust that was established mainly for the benefit of charitable organisations. If the debt forgiven is distributed to a non-qualifying beneficiary, the trustee can be liable for tax. For further information, please see our Tax Information Bulletin Vol 11, No 6 (July 1999) page 20. Question 19 Add up Boxes 9B to 13B, 14E, 15E, and 16B to 18B. Write the total in Box 19B. Add up Boxes 9A to 14A, 17A and 18A. Write the total in Box 19A. Do not include Box 10 in this total. ird.govt.nz 37 Question 20 Income allocation Income derived by a trustee must be allocated between beneficiary income and trustee income in boxes 20A and 20B respectively. Question 20A - Beneficiary income excluding minor beneficiaries Beneficiary income is income of an estate or trust that vests in a beneficiary during the year or is paid to a beneficiary (or credited to them or dealt with in their interest or on their behalf) during the year or within a certain period after the end of the year. The rest of the income generated by an estate or trust will be trustee income. The income available to allocate to beneficiaries may be the income in Box 19B but it is important to note that Box 19B is a total of various amounts of estate or trust income. Some of the amounts, such as income from rental activities, are net amounts ie after deductions. Some of the deductions may be for non-cash outgoings, such as depreciation. This may result in there being income that can be distributed to beneficiaries despite Box 19 showing a loss, and providing the trust deed for the trust allows it. This means there may be amounts that vest in or are paid to beneficiaries that have to be treated as beneficiary income. Identify any such vesting or payment and include the amount in Box 20A. The total must reconcile with the combined totals of Boxes 26H on the IR6B after deducting any taxable distributions included in Box 26G. Timing of allocation of beneficiary income Allocation of income to a beneficiary must be made within the income year, or by the later of the following: • • six months after balance date, or • • the earlier of: - the date on which the trustee files the return of income for the income year, or - the date by which the trustee must file a return for the income year. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE38 Example A family trust is allocating income to beneficiaries for the year ended 31 March 2020. The trust return is due on 7 July 2020 and the trust plans to file by 30 June. The income should be allocated by the later of the following: • • 30 September 2020, or • • the earlier of: - 30 June 2020, or - 7 July 2020. In this case the income must be allocated by September 2020. If the trust has a tax agent, the extension of time for filing income tax returns may apply. Question 20B - Trustee income including minor beneficiaries Trustee income is any income generated by an estate or trust that isn't beneficiary income, see "Question 20A - Beneficiary income" on page 39. It includes income accrued to date of death and received afterwards. Where Box 19B shows a loss, there will be no trustee income and Box 20B should be left blank. The loss in Box 19B will be taken into account by us in calculating the loss to carry forward. Accrued income and non-apportionment clauses As a general rule, accrued income to date of death is retained by the trustee and becomes part of the capital of the estate. This income is treated as trustee income. However, where the will of the deceased taxpayer contains a non-apportionment clause, the beneficiary is entitled to receive the income accrued to date of death. So, if the accrued income is paid to the beneficiary, it's treated as beneficiary income. ird.govt.nz 39 Question 21 Expenses The estate or trust may have incurred expenses in generating its income, for example: • • commission deducted from interest or dividends • • expenses for return preparation • • deductible trustee charges • • interest paid to Inland Revenue. If these expenses haven't been claimed elsewhere in the return, write the amount claimed in Box 21. Note Certain expenditure is not deductible and this includes: • • private expenditure • • capital expenditure penalties may apply if it is claimed incorrectly. Question 22 Net losses brought forward There are two types of losses the estate or trust can bring forward. Specified activity net losses These are net losses from specified activities incurred before the 1991 income year. Any loss balance in relation to a specified activity that remained at the end of the 2019 income year must be offset against net income for the 2020 income year, before taking into account other losses. The amount of this offset cannot exceed the net income. If the loss balance from specified activities incurred before the 1991 income year exceeds the net income for the 2020 income year, that excess amount is added to the tax loss for the year. Any remaining tax loss is then carried forward to further income years. Other net losses All losses incurred from the 1991 income year onwards and other net losses that weren't limited before 1991 (including any net loss resulting from excess imputation credits) are "other net losses". ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE40 Enter the total of all specified activity net losses and other net losses the estate or trust can bring forward to 2020 in Box 22A. Enter the amount the estate or trust has offset against 2020 income in Box 22B. Note You'll find the amount of net loss the estate or trust has to bring forward on the loss notice we sent you with the 2019 income tax assessment. If you don't have a loss notice, call us to obtain the figure. Losses cannot be transferred from the deceased's return to the estate's return. Any such losses lapse. Trust losses cannot be passed to beneficiaries. They remain in the trust to be offset against future trustee income. If the estate or trust can't offset any losses in 2020, enter "0.00" in Box 22B. Loss carry-back Where on the estate or trust return to claim a loss carried back You must let us know if the estate or trust is going to use the loss carry-back scheme. You can do this in the ‘I want to’ section of the estate or trusts income tax account in myIR and selecting “Opt-in to carry-back loss”. Claiming a loss carried back to 2019 from 2020 If the estate or trust has a 2020 loss it wants to carry back to 2019, enter the loss amount in box 18B (Other income) in the 2020 income tax return. You will then need to amend the estate or trusts 2019 income tax return (if already filed) to include the loss. In myIR choose amendment reason “loss carry-back”. Select income type “you are claiming net losses brought forward” and enter the amount of the loss carried-back in box 20B (Amount claimed this year). ird.govt.nz 41 Claiming a loss carry-back in 2020 from 2021 If the estate or trust is claiming a loss carry-back in 2020, based on an estimated loss in 2021, enter the amount of the estimated loss carry-back in box 22B (Amount claimed this year) in the 2020 income tax return. Questions 23 and 24 Distributions to beneficiaries by foreign and non- complying trusts Question 23 - Distributions At Question 23 print the total amount of distributions made to beneficiaries during the year. A distribution is any income or property of the trust that vests in the beneficiary or is paid or applied for a beneficiary's benefit. It includes any property or service disposed of or provided to: • • a beneficiary for less than market value, or • • the trust by a beneficiary for greater than market value. Attach a separate schedule to page 3 of the return showing the source and the amount of each distribution. Distributions are considered to have come from different sources in the following order: • • beneficiary income • • accumulated trustee income • • capital profits or gains realised in the current income year • • capital profits or gains realised in previous years that have been accumulated by the trust • • the corpus of the trust. The ordering establishes if the distribution is a taxable distribution - see Question 22. Capital gains and corpus distributed only after income derived by trustees in the year of distribution and in prior years has been distributed. Further information about the ordering and taxability of distributions can be found in our Trusts’ and estates’ income tax rules - IR288 guide. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE42 Question 24 - Taxable distributions A taxable distribution is one made to a beneficiary by a foreign or non-complying trust that isn't beneficiary income. For a foreign trust taxable distributions also do not include capital gains profits that aren't included in the taxable income of the trust except when derived from transactions with associated persons or a distribution from the corpus. For non-complying trusts they do not include distributions from the corpus. Write the total taxable distributions made to beneficiaries during the year in Box 24. Where to include taxable distributions Include the amount of the taxable distribution made to each beneficiary in the beneficiary's panel of the IR6B: • • in Box 26G if the trust is a foreign trust, or • • in Box 26J if the trust is a non-complying trust. For tax payable on taxable distributions see Question 26J on page 47. Schedule of beneficiary's estate or trust income Each beneficiary (excluding minor beneficiaries) must attach a completed Schedule of beneficiary’s estate or trust income - IR307 to their individual tax return if they receive income from a foreign or non-complying trust. It's helpful if the trustee or agent also provides a completed IR307 when advising beneficiaries of their share of trust income. Beneficiaries don't then need to contact the trustee or agent when completing their own returns. ird.govt.nz 43 Question 25 Additional disclosure of foreign investments If you calculated CFC or FIF income at Question 13 you may be required to complete an additional disclosure form for that investment. If the trust is not widely held or a PIE, you may not require an additional disclosure if the investments are in countries New Zealand has a double tax agreement with as at 31 March 2013, and have used the fair dividend rate or comparative value method. If the trust is widely held or a PIE you are required to file an additional disclosure. Go to ird.govt.nz (search keywords: international tax disclosure) for full details of the disclosure requirements and the appropriate form(s). Find out more about the base erosion profit shifting (BEPS) hybrid mismatch rules at ird.govt.nz (search keywords: hybrid mismatch). If you need assistance making a CFC or FIF disclosure please call 0800 443 773. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE44 IR6B Estate or trust beneficiary details Question 26 Beneficiary income and calculation of tax, excluding minor beneficiaries See Question 18A on pages 39 to 40 for the definition of beneficiary income. Complete the details on the IR6B for each beneficiary and ensure an IRD number is shown for each. If you don't have the beneficiary's IRD number contact the beneficiary. Due to our privacy obligations under section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 we cannot provide it to you. Question 26B Non-resident beneficiaries Please make sure you answer Question 26B about residency. This lets us work out correctly how the beneficiary income should be taxed. Include all beneficiary income allocated to each non-resident beneficiary in Boxes 26C, 26D, 26E, 26F and 26G. Remember, the combined totals at Boxes 26H, less any taxable distributions from foreign trusts included at Box 26G must reconcile with the total of Box 20A. Non-resident passive income Non-resident passive income is interest, dividends and royalties for the supply of scientific, technical, industrial or commercial knowledge. These types of income are subject to non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) if the income has a New Zealand source. This tax is deducted when the non-resident passive income is paid or credited to a non-resident beneficiary. The rates and methods of calculating the tax on a non-resident beneficiary's share of income differ according to the type of income derived and the country the beneficiary is resident in. Include all income derived by each non-resident beneficiary in Boxes 26C, 26D, 26E, 26F and 26G. ird.govt.nz 45 Paying NRWT When paying non-resident passive income to a non-resident beneficiary, the trust must complete certain forms and pay N RW T. If you need more help, see our NRWT - payer’s guide - IR291. When calculating the amount of income liable for income tax at the ordinary rates, don't include non-resident passive income or any overseas income in the taxable income figure in Box 26H for non-resident beneficiaries. Question 26C New Zealand interest If the allocation of beneficiary income includes any New Zealand interest, write the amount in Box 26C. Question 26D New Zealand dividends If the allocation of beneficiary income includes any New Zealand dividends, write the amount in Box 26D. Question 26E Māori authority distributions If the allocation of beneficiary income includes any Māori authority distributions, write the amount in Box 26E. Question 26F Overseas income If the allocation of beneficiary income includes any overseas income, write the amount in Box 26F. Question 26G Other income and taxable distributions from a foreign trust Add the remainder of any beneficiary income allocated to the beneficiary to any taxable distributions from a foreign trust and write the total in Box 26G. Question 26H Taxable income of beneficiary from the estate or trust Add up boxes 26C to 26G and write the total in Box 26H. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE46 Question 26I Paying the tax on beneficiary income, excluding minor beneficiaries The trustee must pay tax on behalf of the beneficiary for all income allocated to the beneficiary. However, the Trustee and the beneficiary can agree not to have tax deducted from Trust/Estate income before the beneficiary receives it. This might be done where the beneficiary has losses available to offset income. Note The trustees will be liable if the beneficiary defaults on payment of the tax obligations on trust income. Tick 'Yes' if the estate or trust is paying the tax on behalf of beneficiaries, then complete all boxes 26A to 26S. 'Yes' means the trust/estate will retain any excess tax credits (except overseas credits and Imputation credits) for the trust/estate. The beneficiary must then show the gross income allocated to them as trust income and can only claim the amount of tax paid by the Trust at key point 26K, in the key point for Tax Paid by Trustees of their own income tax return. Tick 'No' if the estate or trust is not paying the tax on behalf of beneficiaries. Then complete boxes 26A to 26J, and boxes 26L, 26N and 26P only. Question 26J Taxable distributions by non-complying trust Show taxable distributions to each beneficiary in Box 26J and the tax in Box 26R. Taxable distributions by a non-complying trust are taxable to the beneficiary at a flat rate of 45 cents in the dollar. ird.govt.nz 47 Question 26K Calculation of tax Note Do not fill out Box 26K if you ticked "No" in Box 26I. If the estate or trust is paying tax on behalf of the beneficiaries calculate tax on taxable income of beneficiaries using the rates below. 2020 annual tax rates income range Ta x r a t e Income to $14,00010.5% $14,001 - $48,00017.5% $48,001 - $70,00030.0% $70,001 and over33.0% Question 26L Beneficiary's share of overseas tax paid Allocate any tax paid overseas to beneficiaries on the same basis as the allocation of income. Minor beneficiaries' share of overseas tax is to be offset against tax payable on trustee income. A New Zealand resident who receives a taxable distribution is not allowed a tax credit in relation to any income tax paid unless the tax is the same as non-resident withholding tax (NRWT). The amount of any credit is equal to: taxable income × foreign tax paid total distribution Question 26M Calculation Subtract Box 26L from Box 26K. Note Do not fill out Box 26M if you ticked "No" in Box 26I. Subtract Box 26L from Box 26K. If the overseas tax paid (Box 26L) allocated to a beneficiary is greater than the tax payable in Box 26K, print 0.00 at Box 26M. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE48 Question 26N Beneficiary's share of dividend imputation credits If dividends have been allocated to a beneficiary, use the following formula to work out the credits attached to those dividends: a × ( b ) c a is the total of all dividend imputation credits attached to all dividends distributed to beneficiaries during the income year b is the total distribution, including capital distributions made to the particular beneficiary during the year c is the total distribution, including capital distributions made to all beneficiaries during the year. Show the beneficiary's share of imputation credits in Box 26N. Question 26O Calculation Note Do not fill out Box 26O, if you ticked "No" in Box 26I. Subtract Box 26N from Box 26M. If the beneficiary's share of the imputation credits is larger than their tax payable in Box 26M, the excess credit cannot be refunded to the trust. Write 0.00 in Box 26O. The beneficiary should claim the balance of the unused imputation credits in their own tax return. Minor beneficiaries' share of dividend imputation credits is to be offset against tax payable on trustee income in Box 26E of the IR6. ird.govt.nz 49 Question 26P Beneficiary's allocation of RWT and other credits Minor beneficiaries' allocation of RWT and other credits is to be offset against tax payable on trustee income. Ensure that you include the following amounts in Box 26P for each beneficiary: • • allocation of RWT (Boxes 9A and 10A) including any RWT credits reallocated under the RWT substitution payment rules • • share of Māori authority credits (Box 11A) • • share of partnership, estate or trust tax credits (Box 12A) • • share of LTC tax credits (Box 14A) • • share of other income credits (Box 16A) • • If income from a property sale is treated as beneficiary income show their share of any residential land withholding tax credit (Box 17A). Note Don't include any amounts already shown in either Boxes 26L or 26N of the IR6B. Questions 26Q & 26S Note Do not fill out 26Q or 26S if you ticked 'No' in Box 26I. Question 26R Calculate tax on taxable distribution by non-complying trust in 26J at 45 cents in the dollar and print in this box. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE50 Trustee income and calculation of tax Question 27A Calculation of taxable income If the result is negative the amount will be taken into account in the loss carried forward to the following year. Question 27B Calculation of tax and tax on taxable distributions If the trust has received a taxable distribution and tax has not been paid, calculate tax at 33 cents in the dollar and add it to the total. Question 27C Credit for tax paid overseas The amount of the credit for tax paid overseas on trustee income is limited to the amount of New Zealand tax on that income. Remember to attach evidence of payment to page 3 of your return. Question 27E Dividend imputation credits If the trustee's share of the imputation credit exceeds the tax on trustee income at Box 27D, the excess credit can't be refunded. Write 0.00 in Box 27F. The excess credit is converted to a net loss to carry forward to the following year. To calculate the net loss to carry forward to 2021, use the worksheet on page 52. We'll send you a notice confirming the amount of loss to carry forward. ird.govt.nz 51 Example In this example the net loss to carry forward to the income year ending 31 March 2021 is $151.00 in Box 4. Trustee's share of imputation credits from Box 27E of the return. 1 350 00 Tax on trustee income from Box 27D of the return. 2 300 00 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1. Print your answer here. 3 50 00 Divide Box 3 by 0.33 (33%).

Question 27G Trustee's share of RWT and other credits The following amounts should be added together and printed in Box 27G: • • the trustee's allocation of RWT (Boxes 9A and 10A) • • the trustee's share of Māori authority credits (Box 11A) • • the trustee's share of partnership, estate or trust tax credits (Box 12A) • • the trustee's share of LTC tax credits (Box 14A) • • the total from Box 18A • • the trustee's share of any residential land withholding tax credit (Box 17A). Don't include any amounts already shown in either Boxes 26L or 26N of the IR6B. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE52 Question 29 Refunds and/or transfers Please be careful to copy the amount from Box 28E to Box 29 correctly. Direct credit If you choose direct credit you get your refund faster and you can withdraw your money as soon as it's credited because there's no clearance time. We pay any refund direct into your New Zealand bank account or other deposit account, eg, a building society account as soon as we've processed your return. Make sure your correct account number is printed at Question 6 on the front page of your return. Question 29A Overpaid provisional tax If you've made payments towards your 2021 provisional tax and, after completing this return, find you have less or no provisional tax to pay, the overpayment can be included in the amount we refund or transfer. Attach a separate note to your return to request this. Print the overpaid amount in Box 29A. Question 29C Transferring a refund to pay provisional tax If you're entitled to a refund you can transfer all or part of it to your 2021 provisional tax. If you want to do this print the amount of the transfer in Box 29C. Questions 29D to 29F Transfers to another taxpayer's income tax account If you'd like your refund transferred to another account you'll need to tell us what date you'd like it transferred. The date you choose depends on what tax has been overpaid and whose account you want the credit transferred to. Different rules apply if the other taxpayer is associated to you. ird.govt.nz 53 Associated taxpayers When transferring overpaid tax, associated taxpayers are: • • a company you're a shareholder-employee in • • a partner in the same partnership • • a relative (eg, child, parent, spouse, or partner) • • a trustee of a family trust you're a beneficiary of. You can ask for your credit to be transferred at any date as long as it's not before the relevant date shown below. Tick "Yes" or "No" at Box 29D to indicate whether the other taxpayer is associated and write their name in the boxes provided. Write the IRD number of the other taxpayer at Box 29E. Write the amount you wish to transfer at Box 29F. Transfer dates For refunds transferred to your account or an associated taxpayers account: • • If the credit is from excess tax deducted (eg, PAYE deducted), it's the day after your balance date (or 1 April if your balance date is before 31 March). • • If the credit is from overpaid provisional tax, it's the day you overpaid it. Note Special rules apply if the return period has had tax pooling refunds transferred in. For credit transferred to a non-associated person's account, it's the later of the day you requested the transfer, or the day after you file your return. Future transfer dates If you'd like your credit transferred at a date in the future, attach a note to the front of your return with details of: • • the amount you want transferred • • the account you want it transferred to, and if it's the account of the associated person • • the date you'd like it transferred. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE54 If you don't tell us the date you'd like your credit transferred, we'll transfer it at a date we think gives you the greatest advantage. Contact us if you'd like to change the transfer date and tell us if this transfer is to cover a debt. For further information on transfers, read Tax Information Bulletin Vol 14, No 11 (November 2002). Refunds of less than $1 If your refund is less than $1 it will be carried forward to your next tax assessment. We'll offset it against any amount you may owe us or add it to any refund. If you don't want it carried forward, please call us on 0800 377 774. Question 30 Initial provisional tax liability If this is the first year the estate or trust started to derive gross income from a taxable activity, print the start date in Box 30. Provisional tax isn't payable if the residual income tax (RIT) for the previous year was $5,000 or less. Most new businesses don't pay provisional tax in their first year of operation because there's no RIT from the previous year to base the calculation on. However, a special rule requires you to pay interest if you have an initial provisional tax liability. The estate or trust has an initial provisional tax liability if: • • it starts to derive gross income from a taxable activity, and • • it had not derived income from a taxable activity within the preceding four years • • you have RIT of $60,000 or more in the current year. The interest cost can be reduced or eliminated by making voluntary provisional tax payments on the instalment due dates. ird.govt.nz 55 Interest rules for taxpayers with an initial provisional tax liability Taxpayers with an initial provisional tax liability may be charged interest from the first, second or third instalment date. The instalment date that interest applies from is determined by the taxable activity's start date. For estates and trusts whose balance date is 31 March, the start date for interest will be: • • 29 August, if the taxable activity started before 30 July of the same year • • 16 January, if the taxable activity started between 31 July and 16 December of the previous year • • 8 May, if the taxable activity started on or after 17 December of the previous year. An estate or trust with a balance date other than 31 March generally pays provisional tax on the 28th day of the 5th, 9th and 13th months after the balance date, unless filing 6 monthly GST returns. If you need help to work out whether the estate or trust has an initial provisional tax liability, read our guide Provisional tax - IR289. Question 31 2021 provisional tax 2020 provisional tax is charged for income the estate or trust will earn in the 2020 income year. It is payable in two, three or six equal instalments. There are three options for paying provisional tax - standard, estimation and ratio. If the estate or trust's 2020 RIT is: • • $5,000 or less it doesn't have to pay provisional tax, although it can make voluntary payments • • more than $5,000 but expected to be $5,000 or less for 2021, it may estimate 2021 provisional tax at nil (read "Estimation option" on page 57) • • more than $5,000 and expected to be more than $5,000 for 2020, it must pay 2021 provisional tax. If you anticipate your RIT will exceed $5,000 for the 2021 year, see "Interest" on page 59. You may be liable for interest from your first provisional tax instalment date. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE56 Which option to use Estates or trusts can use either the standard or estimation options to pay their provisional tax. If they're registered for GST they may also be able to use the ratio option. Standard option Using the standard option, the estate or trust's 2021 provisional tax will be equal to its 2020 RIT plus 5%. If you use this option enter S in Box 31A on the return and the amount of 2021 provisional tax in Box 31B. • • If the estate or trust's 2020 return hasn't been filed by the first instalment date of 2021 provisional tax, the provisional tax instalments payable is based on 2019 RIT plus 10% (divided by 3 or 2, depending on how many instalments are payable). Estimation option Estates or trusts can estimate their 2021 provisional tax. Trustees must include distributions to minor beneficiaries in their estimate. They can re-estimate any number of times up to and including their final instalment due date. If the estate or trust's 2021 RIT is expected to be less than its 2020 RIT, estimating may prevent the estate or trust from paying more tax than it has to. Note An estimate must be "fair and reasonable" at each instalment it applies to. If you use this option, see page 59 on "Not taking reasonable care penalty" and "Interest". If you estimate your provisional tax, your instalments should be one-third of your estimation. Use the worksheet on page 58 to calculate provisional tax using the estimation option. If you use this option enter E in Box 29A and the amount of 2021 provisional tax in Box 31B. Estimating provisional tax on beneficiary income When working out the tax on estimated beneficiary income, calculate the tax separately for each beneficiary, including estimated tax credits where applicable. The table below shows the 2021 individual tax rates for provisional tax. ird.govt.nz 57 2021 annual tax rates income range Ta x r a t e Income to 14,00010.5% 14,001 - 48,00017.5% 48,001 - 70,00030.0% $70,001 and over33.0% When using these tax rates to calculate 2021 provisional tax, you'll also need to estimate the tax credits the beneficiary may be entitled to. Use this worksheet to calculate the estate or trust's 2021 provisional tax using the estimation option. Print the estate or trust's estimated 2021 income to be allocated in Box 1. 1 Estimated allocation of income: •• Beneficiary income 2 •• Trustee income 3 Work out the tax on the amount in Box 2, using the rates above. Print your answer in Box 4. 4 Multiply the amount in Box 3 by 0.33 (33%). Print your answer in Box 5. 5 If the estate or trust is non- complying, multiply the estimated taxable distributions, if any, by 0.45 (45%). Print your answer in Box 6. 6 Add Boxes 4, 5 and 6. Print your answer in Box 7. 7 Print the estimated 2021 credits (trustees' share only) in Box 8. 8 Subtract Box 8 from Box 7. Print your answer in Box 9. 9 Box 9 is the estate or trust's 2021 provisional tax. Copy it to Box 31B of the return and print E in Box 31A. Divide the amount in Box 9 by three to get the amount to pay for each instalment. If you need more help read our guide Provisional tax - IR289. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE58 Ratio option If the trust is GST registered you may qualify to use the ratio option to calculate your provisional tax. Only enter R at Box 31A if you've already elected to use the ratio option. Your application to use the ratio option must be made by phone or in writing before the beginning of the income year you want to use it in. If you've already elected to use the ratio option and want to continue using it, enter R at Box 31A. More information about the ratio option is in our guide Provisional tax - IR289. Not taking reasonable care penalty When you estimate the estate or trust's 2021 provisional tax, your estimate must be fair and reasonable. If the 2021 RIT is greater than the provisional tax paid, you may be liable for a not taking reasonable care penalty of 20% of the underpaid provisional tax. Interest If the estate or trust has paid too much provisional tax on trustee income we may pay interest, or if it hasn't paid enough, we may charge interest. Interest for estates or trusts is calculated only on the tax payable on trustee income. Interest isn't calculated if all income is distributed to the beneficiaries. Interest the estate or trust pays is generally tax-deductible, while interest we pay is taxable income. For more information about interest and penalties read our guide Penalties and interest - IR240. If we pay interest, it continues to accrue until the date we refund the overpaid tax, or apply it to another liability. ird.govt.nz 59 Election to be a provisional tax payer An estate or trust is a provisional tax payer for the 2020 year if its RIT for 2020 is more than $2,500. If the 2020 RIT is $2,500 or less, and • • the estate or trust made provisional tax payments for that tax year, and • • payments were made under the estimation method (other than using the estimation method for its final instalment only), It may elect to be a provisional tax payer for 2020. This may affect the interest it may be entitled to for that year. To elect to be a provisional tax payer for the 2020 year, attach a letter to the front of the return. Change in balance date There are special rules about when provisional tax is due and how interest is calculated if there has been a change in balance date. Read our Provisional tax - IR289 guide for more information. Tax pooling Tax pooling allows taxpayers to pool provisional tax payments, offsetting underpayments by overpayments within the same pool. This reduces their possible exposure to late payment penalties and use-of-money interest. The pooling arrangement is made through a commercial intermediary, who arranges for participating taxpayers to be charged or compensated for the offset. For more information about tax pooling, including a list of intermediaries, go to ird.govt.nz (search keywords: tax pooling). ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE60 Payment dates 2021 provisional tax Generally, an estate or trust with a 31 March balance date pays provisional tax by the following due dates: • • First instalment 28 August 2020 • • Second instalment 15 January 2021 • • Third instalment 7 May 2021 An estate or trust with a balance date other than 31 March pays provisional tax on the 28th day of the 5th, 9th and 13th months after the balance date. Where payments would otherwise be due on 28 December or 28 April the due date is extended to 15 January or 7 May. These dates will alter if: • • the estate or trust is registered for GST, and • • the GST filing frequency is six-monthly, or • • provisional tax is paid by the ratio option. If either of these situations apply to you, read our guide Provisional tax - IR289. 2020 end-of-year income tax Estates or trusts that have an agent and an extension of time may have until 7 April 2021 to pay their tax. If you think this applies to you contact your agent for more information. Otherwise, an estate or trust with a balance date between 1 March and 30 September must pay its end-of-year income tax and any interest by 7 February 2021. An estate or trust with a balance date between 1 October and 28 February must pay its end-of-year income tax by the 7th day of the month before the following year's balance date. ird.govt.nz 61 How to make payments You can make payments by: • • direct debit in myIR • • credit or debit card at ird.govt.nz/pay • • internet banking - most New Zealand banks have a pay tax option.

In this guide we use "trustee" or "you" to refer to the person or persons administering an estate or trust. The word trust also refers to estates unless we've stated otherwise. This guide provides general information about how to complete the IR6 return. There are references throughout the guide to our other publications which may help you. If you need more help please contact us or a tax advisor. How income of an estate or trust is taxed in general In general, income of an estate or trust will be subject to income tax in New Zealand if it has a source in New Zealand regardless of the residency of the trustee. The trustee is also liable for New Zealand income tax on income derived outside New Zealand where any settlor of the trust is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year, or if the estate has a New Zealand trustee and the deceased was resident in New Zealand. Allocations Income of a trust is either trustee or beneficiary income. The trustee can allocate income as beneficiary income, provided the income either: • • vests absolutely in the beneficiary in the income year, or • • is paid or applied for the benefit of the beneficiary during that income year or within a specified period from the end of the income year. For more information see Question 20A on page 37. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE6 Trust income allocated as beneficiary income is taxable income, except as covered below under the special rules for allocations to minor beneficiaries. Distributions In addition to allocating beneficiary income, a trustee can make distributions to beneficiaries. A distribution can be made up of: • • tax-paid profits (trustee income or beneficiary income) • • capital gains of the trust • • corpus of the trust (the capital contributed to set up the trust), and • • (for a foreign trust) non-taxed profits such as foreign- sourced income. The tax position of a distribution from a trust depends on the type of trust making the distribution and the residency of the beneficiary. See pages 11 to 13 of this guide. Generally, a distribution to a New Zealand resident beneficiary from: • • a complying trust is not taxable • • a foreign trust is taxable, to the extent it is not part of the corpus or capital gains, or • • a non-complying trust is taxable at 45 cents in the dollar, to the extent it is not part of the corpus. Allocations of beneficiary income to a minor A minor is defined as a New Zealand resident under the age of 16 years on the balance date of the trust. Allocations of beneficiary income that the minor beneficiary rule applies to are treated as trustee income. This means they are: • • taxed at 33% • • included in the trustee's tax calculation in the IR6 return, and • • included in the trustees' provisional tax calculations. ird.govt.nz 7 The minor beneficiary should not include this income in their Individual income tax return - IR3. Exceptions to the minor beneficiary rule The following exceptions allow income allocated to a minor beneficiary to be treated as beneficiary income if the income: • • is derived by a minor for whom a child disability allowance is paid under the Social Security Act 2018 • • is derived directly from either a group investment fund, the Māori trustee or a Māori authority, or • • the amount allocated to the minor from the trust is $1,000 or less in an income year. Note If the $1,000 threshold is exceeded, the total income allocated to the minor beneficiary is taxed as trustee income. For example, if a minor beneficiary is allocated $1,200, the total amount of $1,200 is taxed at 33%. The general anti-avoidance rule may apply if a person establishes multiple trusts to increase the number of exemptions. See Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 19, No 4 (May 2007) for further information. There are further exceptions to the minor beneficiary rule that relate to the nature of the settlements on the trust. For more information, please see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001). ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE8 Return due date If the estate or trust has a 31 March balance date, you have until 7 July 2021 to send in the return, unless you have been granted an extension of time. Contact us if you're not sure of the filing date. If the estate or trust is the client of an agent, it may have until 31 March 2022 to complete the return. If this applies, contact your agent. International obligations You may also need to provide information about a trust to comply with the following international obligations. The Common Reporting Standard (CRS) For more information see: • • IR Guidance on the CRS - IR1048 section 11 • • CRS: Is the Trust a Reporting Financial Institution - IR1052 • • Family Trust obligations under the CRS - IR1053 • • ird.govt.nz/crs Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) For more information see: • • FATCA Trusts Guidance - IR1087 • • FATCA status of NZ trusts that are not US person - IR1086 • • ird.govt.nz/fatca ird.govt.nz 9 Questions Questions 1 to 6 The information in Questions 1 to 6 of the return helps us to be sure that any correspondence we send goes to the right person at the right address. Fill in these questions only if the correct information is not printed on the return. Question 1 IRD number If the estate or trust does not have an IRD number, complete an IRD number application - resident non-individual - IR596 and send it in with the return. Question 2 Name of estate or trust If the estate or trust has changed its name since the last time a return was completed, please provide proof of the change so we can update our records, for example trustee resolution. Questions 3 and 4 Postal address and phone number If you have a new postal address, write the details at Question 3. If your new postal address is a PO Box number, show your box lobby if you have one. If you are unsure of your box lobby please contact New Zealand Post. If the estate or trust uses its tax preparer's postal address, leave this panel blank. The tax preparer will let us know if they change their address. We ask for your daytime phone number at Question 4 in case we need to call you with questions about the return. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE10 Question 5 Business industry classification (BIC) code We're required to supply the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) with a code for your business or trading activity, for levy classification and calculation. If your BIC code is not pre-printed on the return or is different from the pre-printed one, enter the correct code. To work out your main business or trading activity and its code, go to businessdescription.co.nz or call ACC on 0800 222 776. It's important that you choose the code which most accurately reflects your main business or trading activity. Note Please provide the code only. Do not provide a description. Question 6 Bank account number The fastest and safest way to get any refund is to have it direct credited to your New Zealand bank account or other deposit account, for example a building society account. If your bank account number is not preprinted on the return form, include it at Question 6. If your suffix has only 2 digits, enter them in the first 2 squares of the suffix box. Question 7A Has the estate or trust ceased? If the estate or trust has ceased, include accounts showing the distribution of all assets and liabilities to the date the estate or trust was finalised. If the estate or trust is registered for GST or as an employer, you'll need to complete a Business cessation - IR315 form to finalise your records. ird.govt.nz 11 Question 7B Nil trust returns If the trust receives any income, for example interest, the trustee must complete a return regardless of the amount of income derived. Where a trust has no prospect or intention of deriving any income in a given financial year, contact us with the trusts name and IRD number so we can record that a return is not required for that year. If the trust subsequently derives income in a future year, the trust must send in a return. Note This only applies to trust returns. Estates are still required to complete a return of income regardless of whether they have derived income. A complying trust that is non-active and does not want to complete an income tax return can complete and send the Non-active trust declaration - IR633: The complying trust needs to declare: • • it has not derived or been deemed to have derived any gross income from any source • • it has no deductions, and • • it has not been party to, or continued with, any transactions with assets of the trust that give rise to any of the following during the tax year: a. income or deemed income in any person's hand, or b. fringe benefits to any employee or former employee. Question 8 Types of trusts The type of trust determines the way certain distributions are taxed in the hands of beneficiaries. There are 3 types of estates or trusts for income tax purposes: • • complying • • foreign, and • • non-complying. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE12 Complying trust In general, a complying trust is one that has been taxed in New Zealand on all its trustee income since the date it began and the trustee has met all it's tax obligations. Complying trusts include: • • trusts settled by New Zealand residents with New Zealand trustees and New Zealand beneficiaries • • estates of people who were New Zealand residents when they died, and • • foreign trusts that have elected to become complying trusts. The trust can still be a complying trust if the trustee was not liable for New Zealand income tax because: • • the trust earned no income • • the income was exempt, or • • the trust was in a loss situation. Foreign trust A foreign trust is one where no settlor of the trust has been resident in New Zealand since 17 December 1987, or the date the trust was first settled, whichever is later, and on the date of distribution. Non-complying trust A trust that is not a complying trust or a foreign trust is a non-complying trust. Non-complying trusts include: • • trusts with a New Zealand-resident settlor, but non- resident trustees, that have not been liable for or have not paid New Zealand income tax on all trustee income since first being settled • • foreign trusts where the settlor has become a New Zealand resident and an election has not been made to be a complying trust, and • • trusts where all the beneficiaries are non-residents and all the income is passive income such as interest, dividends, and royalties. ird.govt.nz 13 Election to change category of trust for tax purposes New residents or former residents who have settled a trust before coming to New Zealand may elect to pay New Zealand tax on future trustee income. Making this election will mean the trust becomes a complying trust for income derived on or after the date on which the election is made. An election can be made by a settlor, trustee or beneficiary using an Election to pay income tax on trustee income - IR463 form. If an election is not made the trust will become a non- complying trust. Elections must be made within 12 months of a new resident ceasing to be a transitional resident and within 12 months of the arrival for a former resident. Unit trust A unit trust is treated as a company for tax purposes. If you're preparing a tax return for a unit trust, please complete a Companies income tax return - IR4. Group investment fund If the income is: • • solely from Category B income, an IR6 must be completed • • solely from Category A income, an IR4 must be completed, or • • a combination of both Category A and Category B income, an IR4 and IR44E must be completed. Please read the notes on the IR44E for more information. Superannuation schemes A superannuation scheme that is not registered with the Financial Markets Authority and does not allow investors to contribute will be treated as a trust for tax purposes and must complete an IR6 return. Income and credits section Income received by a trust retains its character as it passes through the trust. For this reason we ask that you return different types of income in certain boxes. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE14 Question 9 New Zealand interest Include interest from all New Zealand sources at Question 9. The interest payer will usually send you an RWT withholding certificate showing the gross interest paid and the amount of RWT deducted. Write the total of all RWT deducted in Box 9A. Add up all the gross interest amounts (before the deduction of any tax) and write the total in Box 9B. Note If expenses are deductible against the interest income (for example commission), claim them at Question 19. Read about expenses on page 39. Do not send us interest statements or IR15 certificates with the return. Keep these in case we ask for them later Interest on broken term deposits If you've broken a term deposit during the year, you may have to account for negative interest. This is interest repaid on a term deposit and may reduce the amount of interest to declare in your return. If the term deposit was broken in full, or it was business related, deduct the negative interest from the gross interest shown on the IR15 or equivalent statement. Deduct the allowable negative interest component, using the worksheet below, before entering the gross amount at Box 9B on your return. In all other cases, the negative interest is deductible in a future income year when the term deposit matures. Worksheet Copy your gross interest from your RWT withholding certificate to Box 1. 1 Print any negative interest you've paid in Box 2. 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the answer in Box 3. Copy this amount to Box 9B of your tax return. 3 ird.govt.nz 15 Interest paid or charged by Inland Revenue If we paid you interest, include it in Box 9B for the income year the trust received the interest. If the trust paid us interest, include it as a deduction in Box 21 of the return for the income year the interest is paid. Interest from overseas If the trust received interest from overseas, convert your overseas interest and tax credits to New Zealand dollars and show the amounts at Question 13. Read the notes about overseas income on pages 20 to 23. Income from financial arrangements The financial arrangement rules generally require income or expenditure from financial arrangements to be spread over the term of the arrangement. Financial arrangements include term deposits, government stock, local authority stock, mortgage bonds, futures contracts and deferred property settlements. Trustees are required to use a spreading method unless they are a cash basis person. A person is a cash basis person if: • • the value of all financial arrangements together is less than $1 million, or • • the value of the income or expenditure from the financial arrangement is less than $100,000, and • • the deferral of income or expenditure using the cash method rather than the actual method is less than $40,000. A special rule applies for deceased persons. If the deceased person was a cash basis person at the date of death, the concession applies in the year of death and up to 4 succeeding years. Any RWT from a financial arrangement will be deducted on a cash basis. Different rules apply for financial arrangements entered into prior to 20 May 1999. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE16 Sale or maturity of financial arrangements Whether or not the exemption from the spreading methods explained earlier applies, when a financial arrangement matures or is sold, remitted, or transferred, a "wash-up" calculation known as a base-price adjustment must be carried out. Cash basis persons can use the Sale or disposal of financial arrangements - IR3K to perform the calculation. This form could be used, for example, to calculate the amount you need to account for if you have broken a term deposit in full. For more information about the financial arrangements rules, please see Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 11, No 6 (July 1999), page 3. Any RWT will be deducted on a cash basis. Question 10 New Zealand dividends Dividends are the part of a company's profits that it passes on to its shareholders. Unit trusts are treated as companies for income tax purposes. Distributions from unit trusts will generally be taxable and are treated as dividends. Note All the trust's cash and taxable bonus issue dividends derived from a qualifying company must be distributed by the trustees as beneficiary income to the beneficiaries who are not trustees or companies that are not qualifying companies. Complete Question 10 if you received any New Zealand dividends, including dividends from your local electricity or gas supplier. Do not include a dividend that's a distribution of the trust's capital and is tax free. The company or unit trust that paid you the dividend will send you a dividend statement. Do not send us any dividend statements with the return, keep them in case we ask for them later. ird.govt.nz 17 Note If expenses are deductible against the dividend income, claim them at Question 21. Credits attached to dividends "Imputation credits" are credits for part of the tax the company has already paid on its profits, which means the dividends are not taxed twice. RWT is deducted from your dividend to bring the total credits withheld up to 33% of the gross dividend. What to show in your return Your dividend statements show the amount: • • you received (net dividend) • • of any imputation credits, and • • of any RWT credits. Add all these amounts together to work out your total gross dividends and enter this in Box 10B. Add up all the imputation credits and print the total in Box 10. Add any dividend RWT credits and print the total in Box 10A. Shares instead of dividends If the trust received shares instead of dividends, include them as income at Question 10B. Write the amount as if you received dividends instead of shares. Dividends from overseas Please read about overseas income on pages 20 to 23 of this guide. Question 11 Māori authority distributions Māori authorities can make various types of distributions. Fill in Question 11 if you received any taxable Māori authority distributions. The Māori authority that paid you the distribution will send you a Māori authority distribution statement. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE18 Credits attached to distributions The Māori authority may attach a credit to the distribution it makes to members. This credit will be classified as a Maori authority credit and is part of the tax the Maori authority has already paid on its profits, so the distributions are not taxed twice. What to show in your return Your Māori authority distribution statement shows the amount of: • • the distribution made to you, including the taxable portion and the non-taxable portion, and • • Māori authority credit. Transfer these amounts, leaving out any non-taxable distributions, to the relevant boxes at Question 11. Non-taxable distribution You do not need to include in the IR6 return any other distributions received from a Māori authority that are not taxable in the hands of a Māori authority member. These amounts are non-taxable distributions and cannot have credits attached. For more information read our Māori authorities guide - IR487. Question 12 Partnership, estate or trust income Partnership If the estate or trust received any income from a partnership, write the details at Question 12. Do not include: • • interest and RWT (include these at Question 9) • • any dividends, imputation credits or dividend RWT (include these at Question 10) • • any Māori authority dividends and Māori authority credits (include these at Question 11), or • • any overseas income and qualifying tax credits attached (include these at Question 13). ird.govt.nz 19 Estate or trust If the estate or trust has received income from a foreign or non-complying trust, complete a Schedule of beneficiary's estate or trust income - IR307 and attach it to the return. Add up all the other income from partnerships, complying and foreign trusts, and write the total in Box 12B. Add up any other tax credits and write the total in Box 12A. Do not include: • • interest and RWT (include these at Question 9) • • any dividends, imputation credits or dividend RWT (include these at Question 10) • • any Māori authority dividends and Māori authority credits (include these at Question 11), or • • any overseas income and qualifying tax credits attached (include these at Question 13). If the estate or trust has received a taxable distribution from a non-complying trust, do not include the amount as income. Calculate tax on the taxable distribution at 45 cents in the dollar and add it to the amount in Box 28B. You can use a loss to reduce the amount of the taxable distribution. Net losses brought forward from an earlier income year and losses incurred in the 2020 income year can be used to reduce the amount. If a loss is used in this way it is no longer available to offset other income. The reduction is calculated using the following formula: (Tax loss × 0.33) ÷ 0.45 Losses from limited partnerships If the estate or trust is claiming a loss from a limited partnership and you need help working out the amount that can be claimed, go to ird.govt.nz/index/calculators-and-tools ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE20 Question 13 Overseas income If the trust received overseas income, for example interest or financial arrangements, show this at Question 13. Convert all overseas income and qualifying overseas tax paid to New Zealand dollars. You can do this by: • • using the rates available on ird.govt.nz/managing-my-tax • • contacting the overseas section of a trading bank and asking for the exchange rate for the day you received your overseas income. Include any overseas income and credits which you received from a partnership, look-through company (LTC), estate or trust here. Include gross income before deducting any tax credits at Box 13B. Credit for tax paid overseas will be limited to the amount of New Zealand tax payable on that income. How overseas income of an estate or trust is taxed In New Zealand, overseas income is taxed according to the residency of the settlor. The rules for the 3 most common situations are described over the page. New Zealand resident trustees and income derived outside New Zealand As a general rule, where a trustee is resident in New Zealand, and the trustee derives an amount from outside New Zealand, that income will be income of the trustee. The amount will be exempt income of the trustee if: • • no settlor of the trust except a transitional resident is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year, or • • that trust is not a testamentary trust (trust created by a person under their will) or an inter vivos trust (trust created by the settlor during their lifetime) where any settlor of the trust died resident in New Zealand, whether in that income year or otherwise. ird.govt.nz 21 Non-resident trustees and income derived outside of New Zealand A non-resident trustee is also liable for New Zealand income tax on income derived from outside New Zealand where: • • any settlor is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year, or • • any settlor of an inter vivos or a testamentary trust died while they were resident in New Zealand, and a trustee is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year. Exceptions to the general rule for non-resident trustees and income derived outside New Zealand There are 2 situations in which a non-resident trustee is not liable for income tax on trustee income derived from outside New Zealand. These apply where the trustee is resident outside New Zealand at all times during the income year and either: • • no settlement has been made on the trust since 17 December 1987, or • • the only settlements made on the trust were by settlors who were not resident in New Zealand at the time of settlement and who have not been residents in New Zealand since 17 December 1987. Neither exception applies where an election to pay tax on trustee income has been made by the trustee. These exceptions do not affect the liability for income tax for any settlor of the trust, for example, where the settlor elects to pay tax on trustee income. The trustee income remains liable for income tax for the purpose of determining whether the trust is a complying trust (formerly qualifying trust). Overseas dividends If you are a New Zealand resident trustee and at any time during the 2021 income year you held rights such as shares, units or an entitlement to benefit in any foreign company, foreign trust, foreign superannuation scheme, or foreign life insurance policy, you may be required to calculate foreign investment fund (FIF) income or loss on those investments and include this amount in Box 13B. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE22 Generally, you will use the fair dividend rate to calculate FIF income. The trustees may also need to complete an additional FIF disclosure form. For more information read the guide to Question 25 on page 42. You will not need to do this if the investment is covered by an exclusion. The main exclusions from an interest in an FIF are: • • investments in certain Australian resident companies listed on approved indices on the Australian stock exchange, that maintain franking accounts. Investments covered in the list are available at ird.govt.nz (keyword: check FIF exemption) in the Australian share exemption list - IR871 • • interest in certain Australian units • • limited exemptions for interests in certain venture capital • • limited exemptions for interests in certain venture capital interests that move offshore (for 10 or more income years from the income year in which the company migrates from New Zealand), and • • a 10% or greater interest in a controlled foreign company (CFC). A limited number of trusts are also excluded from the rules if the attributing interests are below $50,000. These are: • • a testamentary trust • • a compensatory trust, or • • where the settlor of the trust is the Accident Compensation Corporation. If the exclusions apply and the trust is under the threshold, include dividends received in Box 13B and any qualifying overseas tax credits in Box 13A. Note If your dividend exceeds your FIF income, the amount of imputation credit you can claim is calculated on the basis of your FIF income. If your FIF income exceeds your dividend, you can claim the entire imputation credit attached to the dividend. Any excess imputation credit cannot be carried forward to the next year or coverted to a loss. ird.govt.nz 23 Please note you cannot claim Australian franking credits. For more information about the FIF rules read A guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate - IR461, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 19, No 3 (April 2007) page 28, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 20, No 3 (April 2008) page 110, or go to ird.govt.nz/fif CFC income or loss If at any time during the 2021 income year the trust has attributed CFC income or loss, the trustees or beneficiaries may be required to calculate this in their own income tax returns. A loss from a CFC cannot be used to offset domestic income or be included in domestic losses that are carried forward to the 2022 income year. Generally, these losses can only offset income or future income from CFCs that are resident in the same country as the CFC that incurred the loss. The trustees may also need to complete an additional CFC disclosure form. See Question 26 on page 43. Investments in portfolio investment entities (PIEs) and portfolio investor attributed income/loss If you receive dividends from a PIE that is a listed company and does not use your prescribed investor rate (PIR), you may choose whether to include the dividends in your return. The attributed PIE income/loss is included in the estate or trust's return for the period that includes the end of the PIE's income year. PIEs usually have a 31 March balance date. The amount of income derived by the estate or trust as a distribution by a PIE is excluded income of the estate or trust other than fully imputed dividends from a PIE that is a listed company and does not use your PIR. More information is available in our guide Information for trustees who invest in PIEs - IR856. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE24 Question 14 Look-through company (LTC) income If the estate or trust received any tax credits and/or income from an LTC write the details at Question 14. Do not include any of the following types of income received from an LTC at Question 14: • • interest and RWT (include these at Question 9) • • any dividends, imputation credits, and dividend RWT (include these at Question 10) • • Māori authority distributions and credits (include these at Question 11) • • any overseas income and qualifying tax credits attached (include these at Question 13), or • • residential rental income (include this at Question 15). The loss limitation rule limits the amount of deductions an LTC owner (shareholder) can claim if the amount exceeds the owner's "owner's basis" (equity) in the LTC. For the 2017-18 and later income years, the loss limitation rule only applies to an LTC which is in a partnership or joint venture which includes another LTC. The estate or trust can now claim the full amount of prior years' non-allowable deductions brought forward this year. This will not apply if the loss limitation rule continues to apply to limit the amount claimable. The LTC will normally supply information about the non- allowable deductions and any other information required to complete your return. ird.govt.nz 25 Example Trust A is an owner of an LTC which is not in a partnership or joint venture that includes another LTC. For the 2020 - 21 income year Trust A has a net loss of $4,000.00 from the LTC. Trust A also has prior years' non-allowable deductions brought forward of $5,000.00. Trust A had no tax credits from the LTC for the year. Trust A's tax return should show the following amounts in the following boxes: • • 14A: $0.00 • • 14B: $4,000.00 - • • 14C: $0.00 • • 14D: $5,000.00 • • 14E: $9,000.00 - What to show on your return Add up all other tax credits received from the LTC and print the total in Box 14A. Add up all LTC income, deduct expenses not already included elsewhere and print in Box 14B. If a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Add up all non-allowable deductions this year and print in Box 14C. There should not be non-allowable deductions this year unless the loss limitation rule applies. Add up all prior year non-allowable deductions claimable this year and print the amount in Box 14D. You'll be able to claim the full amount of non-allowable deductions brought forward from last year if the loss limitation rule no longer applies. If you have an amount in Box 14C, add this to Box 14B and put the total in Box 14E. If you have an amount in Box 14D, subtract this from Box 14B and put the total in Box 14E. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE26 If you do not have any amounts in Box 14C or Box 14D, copy the amount from Box 14B to 14E. Box 14E is your adjusted LTC income. You can find more information about LTCs in the Look- through companies - IR879 guide. Question 15 Income and expenditure from residential property This question applies to owners of residential rental property, including overseas property subject to the residential property deduction rules in subpart EL of the Income Tax Act 2007. Most residential rental properties are subject to the residential property deduction rules (also known as the ring-fencing rules). When they apply, your residential rental deductions generally cannot be more than your residential property income. If your deductions are more than your income, the difference must be carried forward to the next year you earn residential income, including income from properties held on revenue account. There are 2 levels of exclusions from the rules. Any rental income or loss and net income or loss from a taxable disposal is fully excluded from the new rules if the property is: • • the main home • • property subject to the mixed-use asset rules (for example, a holiday home rented out part-time and not used for some of the year) • • certain employee accommodation. For these types of property, the existing rules apply with the rental income or loss shown at box 16B and net income or net loss from a taxable disposal shown in box 17B. ird.govt.nz 27 Any rental net loss and net loss from a taxable disposal is partially excluded from the new rules if it is for: • • property that will always be taxed on sale, being revenue account property of a person in the business of building, developing or dealing in land, or • • other revenue account property the person has notified us they want the exclusion to apply to. For these types of property any rental net loss is shown at Box 16B and taxable disposal net loss shown at Box 17B. Net rental income and net income from a taxable disposal plus any depreciation recovered is shown as residential income Box 15A. All other residential property income is to be included in Box 16B. Income or loss from the sale/disposal of residential property that is outside the rules is included in Box 17B. Refer to the Rental income - IR264 guide for information on when the rules apply, how to calculate your income, the amount of deductions you can claim for this year, and the amount of any excess deductions that must be carried forward. The residential property deduction rules also apply to a trust that has borrowed money to acquire an interest in certain entities with significant rental property holdings - a residential land-rich entity and has interest expenditure on the borrowed money. Residential land-rich entity - a close company, partnership or look-through company that holds more than 50% of its assets by value in residential land directly or indirectly. They come under the interposed entities rules as part of the residential property deduction rules. For more information about the interposed entity rules, see page 60 of the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No.8 September 2019. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE28 Completing Question 15 in your return You will use this question to record residential income and deductions that are subject to the residential property deduction rules. Tick the method you have used to calculate your residential property income and deductions. You can use 1 of the following methods: • • Portfolio basis - combine the income and deductions for all rental properties in the portfolio. • • Individual, property-by-property basis - income and deductions of individual property calculated separately to other property. You need to maintain separate records for each property to choose this option. • • Combination of the property-by-property basis and portfolio basis - choose to apply different methods to different property. Some properties are held in a portfolio and others are held on property-by-property basis. If you are an owner of a look-through company (LTC) and have attributed residential income or residential rental deductions you need to use the same method the LTC used to attribute the income and deductions. Calculate and identify the amounts for Boxes 15A to 15F using your chosen method. Calculate your rental income and deductions as usual, as shown at boxes 4 and 14 on the Rental income - IR3R form. You can then enter these amounts in the Residential property deductions worksheets - IR1226 to help calculate the amounts required to be entered in your return. You can print a copy off our website ird.govt.nz Write the total residential income in Box 15A. This is the total of: (a) all rental income from the portfolio (and/or individual property) (b) all depreciation recovery income for assets disposed of from the portfolio (or individual property) (c) net income from the taxable sale/disposal of a property in your portfolio (or individual property), and ird.govt.nz 29 (d) all net rental income, depreciation recovery income and net income from the taxable disposal of the property from residential property excluded because it is held on revenue account. Only include the net income from a disposal once. If you are a partner in a partnership or owner of a look- through company and have been attributed residential income(Box 26G on the IR7P or IR7L), include that here. Write the total residential rental deductions for residential rental properties in Box 15B. This is the total deductions for the current year - Box 14 on the Rental income - R3R if completed. If you are a partner in a partnership or owner of a look- through company and have been attributed residential rental deductions (Box 26M on the IR7P or IR7L), include that here. Do not include purchase costs, capital improvements or costs incurred when disposing of the property here. They are included when calculating the net income for taxable disposals. Include the amount of any interest paid on an investment in a land rich entity that relates to the rental activity in Box 15B. Include the amount of interest paid that does not relate to the rental property in Box 16B. Calculate the amount of allowable deductions you can claim this year, adjusting for excess deductions. Write the total residential rental deductions claimed this year in Box 15D. This should equate to Box 15B plus Box 15C less the amount of excess deductions for each property and/or property portfolio calculations shown in Box 15F. The amount cannot exceed total residential income at Box 15A, unless there was a taxable sale/disposal of a rental property. Combine the net income results (after adjusting for any excess deductions) for each property and or property portfolio calculations in Box 15E. Your total Net residential income in Box 15E cannot be a loss, unless the rental property or all the properties in the portfolio have been disposed of as taxable sales. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE30 Any losses are counted as zero unless the loss is the result of either: • • excess deductions released as the result of either a taxable disposal of a property held on the property-by- property basis, or a taxable disposal of all properties or the last property held in a portfolio, or • • claimable interest paid on your investment in a residential land-rich entity. Refer to the Rental income - IR264 guide. Write the amount of all excess deductions for the year to be carried forward to next year in Box 15F. This is calculated as Residential rental deductions Box 15B plus 15C minus Residential rental deductions claimed this year Box 15D. Include the amount of any excess deductions to be carried forward for interest paid on an investment in a land rich entity in Box 15F. Note 1 If you sell/dispose of an individual property and the sale is not taxable, or you sell/dispose of the last property in a portfolio and at least 1 of the sales in the portfolio was not taxable, any excess deductions will transfer to another property or portfolio and carried forward to a future year in which you earn income from a residential rental property (including properties on revenue account). Note 2 If you sell/dispose of an individual property and the sale is taxable, or you sell/dispose of the last rental property in a portfolio, and the sale of all your rental properties in a portfolio were taxable, any remaining loss/excess deductions are released and can be offset against other income. However, this does not include any excess deductions transferred to the portfolio/property. ird.govt.nz 31 Note 3 If you want to claim that a property is held on revenue account where the sale may be taxable, you need to tell us the details of the property. You will be stating the sale will be a taxable sale when the property is disposed of. You must be able to separately identify the deductions relating to the property. Refer to the Rental income - IR264 guide. Question 16 Business or rental income If the estate or trust has business or rental income (other than residential rental income see question 15), you must attach either: • • a fully completed Financial statements summary - IR10 form, or • • a set of the estate or trust's financial accounts for the year. The IR10 summarises the information we need from the financial accounts. If you complete an IR10 you do not need to send us your financial accounts, but you still need to complete and keep them. Business income Write the net profit in Box 16B. This is the amount of income or net loss after all allowable business expenditure has been deducted. If the total is a loss, put a minus sign in the last box at Box 16B. When calculating business income, you can use the Schedule of business income - IR3B. Rental income If there is rental income other than residential rental income, print the net profit or loss (total rents minus expenses) in Box 16B. When calculating rental income you can use the Rental income - IR3R. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE32 Attribution rule Under the attribution rule, anyone whose actions cause an associated person (company, trust or partnership) to earn income, can be personally liable for tax on that income. If this rule applies to persons associated with your estate or trust, it will affect the amount of taxable income in this return. For more information read our Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 12 (December 2000) page 49 and TIB, Vol 13, No 11 (November 2001). Question 17 income from taxable sale/ disposals of property Income from the sale of land and/or buildings Include all income from land sales that are excluded from the residential property deduction rules. Tax losses from disposals of residential property (except a loss from a bright-line sale, as explained below ) are also included under this question. Net income from a bright-line sale is included under Residential income at Question 15. The sale of the main home and holiday home taxed under the mixed-use asset rules are also included here. The profits are taxable if you bought a property for the purpose of reselling it or are in the business of buying and selling land and/or buildings. If you purchased a residential property on or after 1 October 2015 and sold/disposed of it within a certain period of time, any profit will be taxable, even if you did not intend to sell when you purchased it. This is called the bright-line test. The bright-line test applies to: • • properties purchased/acquired on or after 1 October 2015 through to 28 March 2018 inclusive and sold/ disposed of within 2 years, and • • properties purchased/acquired on or after 29 March 2018 and sold within 5 years. ird.govt.nz 33 The profits may also be taxable if you: • • are a builder and improved a property before selling it • • developed or subdivided land and sold sections, or • • had a change of zoning on your property and sold it within 10 years of buying it. The bright-line test needs to be considered when none of the other land sale rules apply to the disposal of the property. Disposals by a beneficiary, executor or administrator of residential land transferred to them on the death of a person are specifically excluded from the bright-line test. However, the disposals may still be subject to tax under the current land sale rules. Show the total profit from other property in Box 17B. If the property was taxable under the bright-line test and made a loss, any excess deductions cannot be claimed unless they can be offset against net income from other residential property sales. A bright-line loss is not recorded in the tax return. Please keep your own record of any bright-line losses you have made. For more information on property sales see our guide Buying and selling residential property - IR313. Calculate your profit or loss by completing a Bright-line property sale information – IR833 form for each bright-line property you have sold or disposed of. Include the results of any profit in your return. You can download the IR833 from ird.govt.nz/forms-guides and put a space after the short URL and change the rest to Complete the form even if the details have been included in a Financial statements summary - IR10 or set of accounts, unless the income will be included in the company return as part of the business income as a property speculator, property dealer, developer or builder. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE34 Question 17A - Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) credit The estate or trust can claim a credit for RLWT deducted from the sale of a property. If more than 1 amount was deducted, show the combined amount. Show the amount of RLWT deducted, less any RLWT paid back to the estate or trust and/or transferred to outstanding amounts. Show the name of the the estate or trust's withholder in the "Name of payer" box. Question 18 Other income At Question 18 show any other income received by the estate or trust, for example income from: • • any undertaking or scheme • • sale of shares or other property • • sale or disposal of assets • • any schedular payments received by a trust • • certain settlements on a trust, or • • forgiveness of debt. Note If the estate or trust has a 2021 loss it wants to carry back to 2020, enter the loss amount in box 18B (Other income) in the 2020 income tax return. See 'Loss carry-back' at Question 23 on page 41. Read the following sections for more information on the above items. Income from any undertaking or scheme Profits made from any undertaking or scheme entered into for the purpose of making a profit, are taxable to the estate or trust. On a separate piece of paper include what the undertaking or scheme was and list the details of income and expenses from these undertakings and schemes. Attach it to page 3 of the return and include the total profit in Box 18B. ird.govt.nz 35 Income from sale of land and/or buildings other than residential The profits are taxable if the estate or trust purchased a property for the purpose of reselling it or are in the business of buying and selling land and/or buildings. If the estate or trust is a New Zealand tax resident it will need to pay tax on its worldwide income under New Zealand tax law. This includes any property sales worldwide. Calculate your profit or loss by completing a Bright-line property sale information – IR833 form for each bright-line property you have sold or disposed of. Include the results of any profit in your return. You can download the IR833 from ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Complete the form even if the details have been included in a Financial statements summary - IR10 or set of accounts. Include total profits in Box 16B. Income from sale of shares or other property Profits from the sale of shares or other property are taxable if the estate or trust: • • buys and sells shares or other property as a business • • buys shares or other property for the purpose of resale, or • • buys shares or property to make a profit. List the details of income and expenses from these sales on a sheet of paper and staple it to page 3 of the return. Include the total profit in Box 16B. Sale or disposal of assets There are a number of rules that apply to the sale or disposal of assets. For more information read Part 3 of our guide Depreciation - a guide for business - IR260. Losses from sale of land, buildings, shares that are not FIFs, or other property If the estate or trust has made a loss and can show that if it had made a profit it would have been taxable, it may be able to claim the loss as a deduction. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE36 If the property was purchased on or after 1 October 2015 with no intention to sell and it was sold/disposed of within 2 years, any excess deductions cannot be claimed unless they can be offset against net income from other property sales. Bright-line property sale information – IR833 form has more information on this. For more information on property sales see our guide Buying and selling residential property - IR313. Show the loss with a minus sign in the last box at Box 16B. PAYE income accrued to date of death The following types of PAYE income must be returned by the estate if it is accrued to the date of death and subsequently received by the estate: • • salary or wages • • holiday pay or other leave payments • • director's fees, and • • any other PAYE income (includes schedular payments). Include the total gross amount in Box 18B and any tax credits in Box 18A. This income is assessed as trustee income. Certain settlements on a trust The following settlements of property on a trust are deemed to be trustee income. This means that these settlements of property are excluded from the definition of corpus: • • property settled by a trustee of another trust, so long as it would have counted as income if that trust had distributed the property to 1 of its beneficiaries instead. • • a settlement of a property on a trust, which, if not for the settlement, would have constituted: - income of the settlor, or - a dividend for which the settlor would have been liable to deduct an FDP (foreign dividend payment), formerly dividend withholding payment, if the settlor is currently resident or had been resident in New Zealand and subject to income tax at that time. ird.govt.nz 37 Forgiveness of debt The financial arrangements rules treat debts that do not have to be repaid because they have been forgiven as income to the debtor. There is an exception in the case of trusts if the creditor is a natural person and forgives the debt: • • due to "natural love and affection" for natural persons who are beneficiaries of the trust, or • • of a trust that was established mainly for the benefit of charitable organisations. If the debt forgiven is distributed to a non-qualifying beneficiary, the trustee can be liable for tax. For more information, please see our Tax Information Bulletin Vol 11, No 6 (July 1999) page 20. Question 19 Add up Boxes 9B to 13B, 14E, 15E, and 16B to 18B. Write the total in Box 19B. Add up Boxes 9A to 14A, 17A and 18A. Write the total in Box 19A. Do not include Box 10 in this total. Question 20 Income allocation Income derived by a trustee must be allocated between beneficiary income and trustee income in boxes 20A and 20B respectively. Question 20A - Beneficiary income excluding minor beneficiaries Beneficiary income is income of an estate or trust that vests in a beneficiary during the year or is paid to a beneficiary (or credited to them or dealt with in their interest or on their behalf) during the year or within a certain period after the end of the year. The rest of the income generated by an estate or trust will be trustee income. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE38 The income available to allocate to beneficiaries may be the income in Box 19B but it is important to note that Box 19B is a total of various amounts of estate or trust income. Some of the amounts, such as income from rental activities, are net amounts, for example after deductions. Some of the deductions may be for non-cash outgoings, such as depreciation. This may result in there being income that can be distributed to beneficiaries despite Box 19 showing a loss, and providing the trust deed allows it. This means there may be amounts that vest in or are paid to beneficiaries that have to be treated as beneficiary income. Identify any such vesting or payment and include the amount in Box 20A. The total must reconcile with the combined totals of Boxes 27H on the IR6B after deducting any taxable distributions included in Box 27G. Timing of allocation of beneficiary income Allocation of income to a beneficiary must be made within the income year, or by the later of the following: • • 6 months after balance date, or • • the earlier of: - the date on which the trustee completes the return of income for the income year, or - the date by which the trustee must complete a return for the income year. Example A family trust is allocating income to beneficiaries for the year ended 31 March 2021. The trust return is due on 7 July 2021 and the trust plans to complete by 30 June. The income should be allocated by the later of the following: • • 30 September 2021, or • • the earlier of: - 30 June 2021, or - 7 July 2021. In this case the income must be allocated by September 2021. ird.govt.nz 39 If the trust has a tax preparer, the extension of time for completing income tax returns may apply. Question 20B - Trustee income including minor beneficiaries Trustee income is any income generated by an estate or trust that is not beneficiary income, see "Question 20A - Beneficiary income" on pages 37 and 38. It includes income accrued to date of death and received afterwards. Where Box 19B shows a loss, there will be no trustee income and Box 20B should be left blank. The loss in Box 19B will be taken into account by us in calculating the loss to carry forward. Accrued income and non-apportionment clauses As a general rule, accrued income to date of death is retained by the trustee and becomes part of the capital of the estate. This income is treated as trustee income. However, where the will of the deceased taxpayer contains a non-apportionment clause, the beneficiary is entitled to receive the income accrued to date of death. So, if the accrued income is paid to the beneficiary, it's treated as beneficiary income. Question 21 Expenses The estate or trust may have incurred expenses in generating its income, for example: • • commission deducted from interest or dividends • • expenses for return preparation • • deductible trustee charges, or • • interest paid to Inland Revenue. If these expenses have not been claimed elsewhere in the return, write the amount claimed in Box 21. Note Certain expenditure is not deductible and this includes: • • private expenditure, and • • capital expenditure. Penalties may apply if it is claimed incorrectly. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE40 Question 22 Net losses brought forward There are 2 types of losses the estate or trust can bring forward. Specified activity net losses These are net losses from specified activities incurred before the 1991 income year. Any loss balance in relation to a specified activity that remained at the end of the 2020 income year must be offset against net income for the 2021 income year, before taking into account other losses. The amount of this offset cannot exceed the net income. If the loss balance from specified activities incurred before the 1991 income year exceeds the net income for the 2021 income year, that excess amount is added to the tax loss for the year. Any remaining tax loss is then carried forward to further income years. Other net losses All losses incurred from the 1991 income year onwards and other net losses that were not limited before 1991 (including any net loss resulting from excess imputation credits) are "other net losses". Enter the total of all specified activity net losses and other net losses the estate or trust can bring forward to 2021 in Box 22A. Enter the amount the estate or trust has offset against 2021 income in Box 22B. Note You'll find the amount of net loss the estate or trust has to bring forward on the loss notice we sent you with the 2020 income tax assessment. If you do not have a loss notice, contact us to obtain the figure. Losses cannot be transferred from the deceased's return to the estate's return. Any such losses lapse. Trust losses cannot be passed to beneficiaries. They remain in the trust to be offset against future trustee income. If the estate or trust cannot offset any losses in 2021, enter "0.00" in Box 22B. ird.govt.nz 41 Question 23 Loss carry back Where on the estate or trust return to claim a loss carried back Enter the amount of any 2021 loss to carry back to 2020 in Box 23. You will need to amend your 2020 income tax return to include the amount loss you carry back if you have not already. In your myIR income tax account, select the 2020 income tax period. Go to I want to...> File or amend return. Choose the amendment reason 'Loss carry back'. Select the income type 'You are claiming net loss brought forward' and enter the amount 'Net losses claimed this year'. Questions 24 and 25 Distributions to beneficiaries by foreign and non- complying trusts Question 24 - Distributions At Question 24 print the total amount of distributions made to beneficiaries during the year. A distribution is any income or property of the trust that vests in the beneficiary or is paid or applied for a beneficiary's benefit. It includes any property or service disposed of or provided to: • • a beneficiary for less than market value, or • • the trust by a beneficiary for greater than market value. Attach a separate schedule to page 3 of the return showing the source and the amount of each distribution. Distributions are considered to have come from different sources in the following order: • • beneficiary income • • accumulated trustee income • • capital profits or gains realised in the current income year • • capital profits or gains realised in previous years that have been accumulated by the trust, and • • the corpus of the trust. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE42 The ordering establishes if the distribution is a taxable distribution - see Question 22. Capital gains and corpus distributed only after income derived by trustees in the year of distribution and in prior years has been distributed. More information about the ordering and taxability of distributions can be found in our Trusts' and estates' income tax rules - IR288 guide. Question 25 - Taxable distributions A taxable distribution is one made to a beneficiary by a foreign or non-complying trust that is not beneficiary income. For a foreign trust taxable distributions also do not include capital gains profits that are not counted as taxable income, except when derived from transactions with associated persons or a distribution from the corpus. For non-complying trusts they do not include distributions from the corpus. Write the total taxable distributions made to beneficiaries during the year in Box 25. Where to include taxable distributions Include the amount of the taxable distribution made to each beneficiary in the beneficiary's panel of the IR6B: • • in Box 27G if the trust is a foreign trust, or • • in Box 27J if the trust is a non-complying trust. For tax payable on taxable distributions see Question 27J on page 46. Schedule of beneficiary's estate or trust income Each beneficiary (excluding minor beneficiaries) must attach a completed Schedule of beneficiary's estate or trust income - IR307 to their individual tax return if they receive income from a foreign or non-complying trust. It's helpful if the trustee or tax preparer also provides a completed IR307 when advising beneficiaries of their share of trust income. Beneficiaries do not then need to contact the trustee or tax preparer when completing their own returns. ird.govt.nz 43 Question 26 Additional disclosure of foreign investments If you calculated CFC or FIF income at Question 13 you may be required to complete an additional disclosure form for that investment. If the trust is not widely held or a PIE, you may not require an additional disclosure if the investments are in countries New Zealand has a double tax agreement with as at 31 March 2013, and have used the fair dividend rate or comparative value method. If the trust is widely held or a PIE you are required to complete an additional disclosure. Go to ird.govt.nz/beps for full details of the disclosure requirements and the appropriate forms. Find out more about the base erosion profit shifting (BEPS) hybrid mismatch rules at ird.govt.nz/beps If you need help? making a CFC or FIF disclosure please call 0800 443 773. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE44 IR6B Estate or trust beneficiary details Question 27 Beneficiary income and calculation of tax, excluding minor beneficiaries See Question 20A on pages 37 to 38 for the definition of beneficiary income. Complete the details on the IR6B for each beneficiary and ensure an IRD number is shown for each. If you do not have the beneficiary's IRD number contact the beneficiary. Due to our privacy obligations under section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 we cannot provide it to you. Question 27B Non-resident beneficiaries Please make sure you answer Question 27B about residency. This lets us work out correctly how the beneficiary income should be taxed. Include all beneficiary income allocated to each non-resident beneficiary in Boxes 27C, 27D, 27E, 27F and 27G. Remember, the combined totals at Boxes 27H, less any taxable distributions from foreign trusts included at Box 27G must reconcile with the total of Box 20A. Non-resident passive income Non-resident passive income is interest, dividends and royalties for the supply of scientific, technical, industrial or commercial knowledge. These types of income are subject to non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) if the income has a New Zealand source. This tax is deducted when the non-resident passive income is paid or credited to a non-resident beneficiary. The rates and methods of calculating the tax on a non-resident beneficiary's share of income differ according to the type of income derived and the country the beneficiary is resident in. Include all income derived by each non-resident beneficiary in Boxes 27C, 27D, 27E, 27F and 27G. ird.govt.nz 45 Paying NRWT When paying non-resident passive income to a non-resident beneficiary, the trust must complete certain forms and pay N RW T. If you need more help, see our NRWT - payer's guide - IR291. When calculating the amount of income liable for income tax at the ordinary rates, do not include non-resident passive income or any overseas income in the taxable income figure in Box 27H for non-resident beneficiaries. Question 27C New Zealand interest If the allocation of beneficiary income includes any New Zealand interest, write the amount in Box 27C. Question 27D New Zealand dividends If the allocation of beneficiary income includes any New Zealand dividends, write the amount in Box 27D. Question 27E Māori authority distributions If the allocation of beneficiary income includes any Māori authority distributions, write the amount in Box 27E. Question 27F Overseas income If the allocation of beneficiary income includes any overseas income, write the amount in Box 27F. Question 27G Other income and taxable distributions from a foreign trust Add the remainder of any allocated beneficiary income to any taxable distributions from a foreign trust and write the total in Box 27G. Question 27H Beneficiary income from the estate or trust Add up boxes 27C to 27G and write the total in Box 27H. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE46 Question 27I Paying the tax on beneficiary income, excluding minor beneficiaries The trustee must pay tax on behalf of the beneficiary for all income allocated to the beneficiary. However, the trustee wand the beneficiary can agree not to have tax deducted from trust/estate income before the beneficiary receives it. This might be done where the beneficiary has losses available to offset income. Note The trustees will be liable if the beneficiary defaults on payment of the tax obligations on trust income. Tick 'Yes' if the estate or trust is paying the tax on behalf of beneficiaries, then complete all boxes 27A to 27S. 'Yes' means the trust/estate will retain any excess tax credits (except overseas credits and Imputation credits) for the trust/estate. The beneficiary must then show the gross income allocated to them as trust income and can only claim the amount of tax paid by the trust at key point 27K, in the key point for Tax Paid by Trustees of their own income tax return. Tick 'No' if the estate or trust is not paying the tax on behalf of beneficiaries. Then complete boxes 27A to 27J, and boxes 27L, 27N and 27P only. Question 27J Taxable distributions by non-complying trust Show taxable distributions to each beneficiary in Box 27J and the tax in Box 27R. Taxable distributions by a non-complying trust are taxable to the beneficiary at a flat rate of 45 cents in the dollar. ird.govt.nz 47 Question 27K Calculation of tax Note Do not fill out Box 27K if you ticked "No" in Box 27I. If the estate or trust is paying tax on behalf of the beneficiaries first calculate tax on total taxable income of beneficiary, including other income not received from the estate or trust, using the rates below. Then determine the portion of tax applicable to just beneficiary's income (see Trusts and estates income tax rules - IR288 and "Tax on beneficiary income"). 2021 annual tax rates income range Ta x r a t e Income to $14,00010.5% $14,001 - $48,00017.5% $48,001 - $70,00030.0% $70,001 and over33.0% Question 27L Beneficiary's share of overseas tax paid Allocate any tax paid overseas to beneficiaries on the same basis as the allocation of income. Minor beneficiaries' share of overseas tax is to be offset against tax payable on trustee income. A New Zealand resident who receives a taxable distribution is not allowed a tax credit in relation to any income tax paid unless the tax is the same as non-resident withholding tax (NRWT). The amount of any credit is equal to: taxable income × foreign tax paid total distribution ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE48 Question 27M Calculation Subtract Box 27L from Box 27K. Note Do not fill out Box 27M if you ticked "No" in Box 26M. Subtract Box 27L from Box 27K. If the overseas tax paid (Box 27L) allocated to a beneficiary is greater than the tax payable in Box 27K, print 0.00 at Box 27M. Question 27N Beneficiary's share of dividend imputation credits If dividends have been allocated to a beneficiary, use the following formula to work out the credits attached to those dividends: a × ( b ) c a is the total of all dividend imputation credits attached to all dividends distributed to beneficiaries during the income year b is the total distribution, including capital distributions made to the particular beneficiary during the year c is the total distribution, including capital distributions made to all beneficiaries during the year. Show the beneficiary's share of imputation credits in Box 27N. Question 27O Calculation Note Do not fill out Box 27O, if you ticked "No" in Box 27I. Subtract Box 27N from Box 27M. If the beneficiary's share of the imputation credits is larger than their tax payable in Box 27M, the excess credit cannot be refunded to the trust. Write 0.00 in Box 27O. The beneficiary should claim the balance of the unused imputation credits in their own tax return. ird.govt.nz 49 Minor beneficiaries' share of dividend imputation credits is to be offset against tax payable on trustee income in Box 28H of the IR6. Question 27P Beneficiary's allocation of RWT and other credits Minor beneficiaries' allocation of RWT and other credits is to be offset against tax payable on trustee income. Ensure that you include the following amounts in Box 27P for each beneficiary: • • allocation of RWT (Boxes 9A and 10A) including any RWT credits reallocated under the RWT substitution payment rules • • share of Māori authority credits (Box 11A) • • share of partnership, estate or trust tax credits (Box 12A) • • share of LTC tax credits (Box 14A) • • if income from a property sale is treated as beneficiary income, show their share of any residential land withholding tax credit (Box 17A), and • • share of other income credits (Box 18A). Note Do not include any amounts already shown in either Boxes 27L or 27N of the IR6B. Questions 27Q & 27S Note Do not fill out 27Q or 27S if you ticked 'No' in Box 27I. Question 27R Calculate tax on taxable distribution by non-complying trust in 27J at 45 cents in the dollar and print this in Box 27R. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE50 Trustee income and calculation of tax Question 28A Calculation of taxable income If the result is negative, the amount will be taken into account in the loss carried forward to the following year. Question 28B Calculation of tax and tax on taxable distributions If the trust has received a taxable distribution and tax has not been paid, calculate tax at 33 cents in the dollar and add it to the total. Question 28C Credit for tax paid overseas The amount of the credit for tax paid overseas on trustee income is limited to the amount of New Zealand tax on that income. Remember to attach evidence of payment to page 3 of your return. Question 28E Dividend imputation credits If the trustee's share of the imputation credit exceeds the tax on trustee income at Box 28D, the excess credit cannot be refunded. Write 0.00 in Box 28F. The excess credit is converted to a net loss to carry forward to the following year. To calculate the net loss to carry forward to 2022, use the worksheet on page 51. We'll send you a notice confirming the amount of loss to carry forward. ird.govt.nz 51 Example In this example the net loss to carry forward to the income year ending 31 March 2022 is $151.00 in Box 4. Trustee's share of imputation credits from Box 28E of the return. 1 350 00 Tax on trustee income from Box 28D of the return. 2 300 00 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1.

Print your answer here. 4 (151 00) Worksheet Trustee's share of imputation credits from Box 28E of the return. 1 Tax on trustee income from Box 28D of the return. 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1. Print your answer here. 3 Divide Box 3 by 0.33 (33%). Print your answer here. 4 The amount in Box 4 is the net loss to carry forward to 2022. Question 28G Trustee's share of RWT and other credits The following amounts should be added together and printed in Box 28G: • • the trustee's allocation of RWT (Boxes 9A and 10A) • • the trustee's share of Māori authority credits (Box 11A) • • the trustee's share of partnership, estate or trust tax credits (Box 12A) • • the trustee's share of LTC tax credits (Box 14A) • • the total from Box 18A, and • • the trustee's share of any RLWT credit (Box 17A). Do not include any amounts already shown in either Boxes 27L or 27N of the IR6B. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE52 Question 30 Refunds and/or transfers Please be careful to copy the amount from Box 29E to Box 30 correctly. Direct credit If you choose direct credit, you get your refund faster and you can withdraw your money as soon as it's credited because there's no clearance time. We pay any refund direct into your New Zealand bank account or other deposit account, for example a building society account, as soon as we've processed your return. Make sure your correct account number is printed at Question 6 on the front page of your return. Question 30A Overpaid provisional tax If you've made payments towards your 2022 provisional tax and, after completing this return, find you have less or no provisional tax to pay, the overpayment can be included in the amount we refund or transfer. Attach a separate note to your return to request this. Print the overpaid amount in Box 30A. Question 30C Transferring a refund to pay provisional tax If you're entitled to a refund you can transfer all or part of it to your 2022 provisional tax. If you want to do this print the amount of the transfer in Box 30C. Questions 30D to 30F Transfers to another taxpayer's income tax account If you'd like your refund transferred to another account you'll need to tell us what date you'd like it transferred. The date you choose depends on what tax has been overpaid and whose account you want the credit transferred to. Different rules apply if the other taxpayer is associated to you. ird.govt.nz 53 Associated taxpayers When transferring overpaid tax, associated taxpayers are: • • a company you're a shareholder-employee in • • a partner in the same partnership • • a relative (for example child, parent, spouse, or partner), or • • a trustee of a family trust you're a beneficiary of. You can ask for your credit to be transferred at any date as long as it's not before the relevant date shown below. Tick "Yes" or "No" at Box 30D to indicate whether the other taxpayer is associated and write their name in the boxes provided. Write the IRD number of the other taxpayer at Box 30E. Write the amount you wish to transfer at Box 30F. Transfer dates For refunds transferred to your account or an associated taxpayers account: • • If the credit is from excess tax deducted (for example PAYE deducted), it's the day after your balance date (or 1 April if your balance date is before 31 March). • • If the credit is from overpaid provisional tax, it's the day you overpaid it. Note Special rules apply if the return period has had tax pooling refunds transferred in. For credit transferred to a non-associated person's account, it's the later of the day you requested the transfer, or the day after you complete your return. Future transfer dates If you'd like your credit transferred at a date in the future, attach a note to the front of your return with details of: • • the amount you want transferred • • the account you want it transferred to, and if it's the account of the associated person, and • • the date you'd like it transferred. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE54 If you do not tell us the date you'd like your credit transferred, we'll transfer it at a date we think gives you the greatest advantage. Contact us if you'd like to change the transfer date and tell us if this transfer is to cover a debt. For more information on transfers, read Tax Information Bulletin Vol 14, No 11 (November 2002). Refunds of less than $1 If your refund is less than $1 it will be carried forward to your next tax assessment. We'll offset it against any amount you may owe us or add it to any refund. If you do not want it carried forward, please contact us. Question 31 Initial provisional tax liability If this is the first year the estate or trust started to derive gross income from a taxable activity, print the start date in Box 31. Provisional tax is not payable if the residual income tax (RIT) for the previous year was $5,000 or less. Most new businesses do not pay provisional tax in their first year of operation because there's no RIT from the previous year to base the calculation on. However, a special rule requires you to pay interest if you have an initial provisional tax liability. The estate or trust has an initial provisional tax liability if: • • it starts to derive gross income from a taxable activity, and • • it had not derived income from a taxable activity within the preceding 4 years, or • • you have RIT of $60,000 or more in the current year. The interest cost can be reduced or eliminated by making voluntary provisional tax payments on the instalment due dates. ird.govt.nz 55 Interest rules for taxpayers with an initial provisional tax liability Taxpayers with an initial provisional tax liability may be charged interest from the first, second or third instalment date. The instalment date that interest applies from is determined by the taxable activity's start date. For estates and trusts whose balance date is 31 March, the start date for interest will be: • • 29 August, if the taxable activity started before 30 July of the same year • • 16 January, if the taxable activity started between 31 July and 16 December of the previous year, or • • 8 May, if the taxable activity started on or after 17 December of the previous year. An estate or trust with a balance date other than 31 March generally pays provisional tax on the 28th day of the 5th, 9th and 13th months after the balance date, unless completing six-monthly GST returns. If you need help to work out whether the estate or trust has an initial provisional tax liability, read our guide Provisional tax - IR289. Question 32 2022 provisional tax 2022 provisional tax is charged for income the estate or trust will earn in the 2022 income year. It is payable in 2, 3 or 6 equal instalments. There are 3 options for paying provisional tax - standard, estimation and ratio. If the estate or trust's 2021 RIT is: • • $5,000 or less it does not have to pay provisional tax, although it can make voluntary payments • • more than $5,000 but expected to be $5,000 or less for 2022, it may estimate 2022 provisional tax at nil (read "Estimation option" on page 56), or • • more than $5,000 and expected to be more than $5,000 for 2021, it must pay 2022 provisional tax. If you anticipate your RIT will exceed $5,000 for the 2021 year, see "Interest" on page 58. You may be liable for interest from your first provisional tax instalment date. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE56 Which option to use Estates or trusts can use either the standard or estimation options to pay their provisional tax. If they're registered for GST they may also be able to use the ratio option. Standard option Using the standard option, the estate or trust's 2022 provisional tax will be equal to its 2021 RIT plus 5%. If you use this option enter S in Box 32A on the return and the amount of 2022 provisional tax in Box 32B. • • If the estate or trust's 2021 return has not been completed by the first instalment date of 2022 provisional tax, the provisional tax instalments payable is based on 2020 RIT plus 10% (divided by 3 or 2, depending on how many instalments are payable). Estimation option Estates or trusts can estimate their 2022 provisional tax. Trustees must include distributions to minor beneficiaries in their estimate. They can re-estimate any number of times up to and including their final instalment due date. If the estate or trust's 2022 RIT is expected to be less than its 2021 RIT, estimating may prevent the estate or trust from paying more tax than it has to. Note An estimate must be "fair and reasonable" at each instalment it applies to. If you use this option, see page 58 on "Not taking reasonable care penalty" and "Interest". If you estimate your provisional tax, your instalments should be one-third of your estimation. Use the worksheet on page 57 to calculate provisional tax using the estimation option. If you use this option enter E in Box 32A and the amount of 2022 provisional tax in Box 32B. Estimating provisional tax on beneficiary income When working out the tax on estimated beneficiary income, calculate the tax separately for each beneficiary, including estimated tax credits where applicable. The table on the following page shows the 2022 individual tax rates for provisional tax. ird.govt.nz 57 2022 annual tax rates income range Ta x r a t e Income to 14,00010.5% 14,001 - 48,00017.5% 48,001 - 70,00030.0% $70,001 - $180,00033.0% $180,001 and over39.0% When using these tax rates to calculate 2022 provisional tax, you'll also need to estimate the tax credits the beneficiary may be entitled to. Use this worksheet to calculate the estate or trust's 2022 provisional tax using the estimation option. Print the estate or trust's estimated 2022 income to be allocated in Box 1. 1 Estimated allocation of income: •• Beneficiary income 2 •• Trustee income 3 Work out the tax on the amount in Box 2, using the rates above. Print your answer in Box 4. 4 Multiply the amount in Box 3 by 0.33 (33%). Print your answer in Box 5. 5 If the estate or trust is non- complying, multiply the estimated taxable distributions, if any, by 0.45 (45%). Print your answer in Box 6. 6 Add Boxes 4, 5 and 6. Print your answer in Box 7. 7 Print the estimated 2022 credits (trustees' share only) in Box 8. 8 Subtract Box 8 from Box 7. Print your answer in Box 9. 9 Box 9 is the estate or trust's 2022 provisional tax. Copy it to Box 32B of the return and print E in Box 32A. Divide the amount in Box 9 by three to get the amount to pay for each instalment. If you need more help read our guide Provisional tax - IR289. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE58 Ratio option If the trust is GST registered you may qualify to use the ratio option to calculate your provisional tax. Only enter R at Box 32A if you've already elected to use the ratio option. Your application to use the ratio option must be made by phone or in writing before the beginning of the income year you want to use it in. If you've already elected to use the ratio option and want to continue using it, enter R at Box 32A. More information about the ratio option is in our guide Provisional tax - IR289. Not taking reasonable care penalty When you estimate the estate or trust's 2022 provisional tax, your estimate must be fair and reasonable. If the 2022 RIT is greater than the provisional tax paid, you may be liable for a not taking reasonable care penalty of 20% of the underpaid provisional tax. Interest If the estate or trust has paid too much provisional tax on trustee income we may pay interest, or if it has not paid enough, we may charge interest. Interest for estates or trusts is calculated only on the tax payable on trustee income. Interest is not calculated if all income is distributed to the beneficiaries. Interest the estate or trust pays is generally tax-deductible, while interest we pay is taxable income. For more information about interest and penalties read our guide Penalties and interest - IR240. If we pay interest, it continues to accrue until the date we refund the overpaid tax, or apply it to another liability. ird.govt.nz 59 Election to be a provisional tax payer An estate or trust is a provisional tax payer for the 2022 year if its RIT for 2021 is more than $5,000. If the 2021 RIT is $5,000 or less, and • • the estate or trust made provisional tax payments for that tax year, and • • payments were made under the estimation method (other than using the estimation method for its final instalment only), It may elect to be a provisional tax payer for 2022. This may affect the interest it may be entitled to for that year. To elect to be a provisional tax payer for the 2022 year, attach a letter to the front of the return. Change in balance date There are special rules about when provisional tax is due and how interest is calculated if there has been a change in balance date. Read our Provisional tax - IR289 guide for more information. Tax pooling Tax pooling allows taxpayers to pool provisional tax payments, offsetting underpayments by overpayments within the same pool. This reduces their possible exposure to late payment penalties and use-of-money interest. The pooling arrangement is made through a commercial intermediary, who arranges for participating taxpayers to be charged or compensated for the offset. For more information about tax pooling, including a list of intermediaries, go to ird.govt.nz/tax-pooling ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE60 Payment dates 2022 provisional tax Generally, an estate or trust with a 31 March balance date pays provisional tax by the following due dates: • • First instalment 28 August 2021 • • Second instalment 15 January 2022 • • Third instalment 7 May 2022 An estate or trust with a balance date other than 31 March pays provisional tax on the 28th day of the 5th, 9th and 13th months after the balance date. Where payments would otherwise be due on 28 December or 28 April the due date is extended to 15 January or 7 May. These dates will alter if: • • the estate or trust is registered for GST, and • • the GST filing frequency is six-monthly, or • • provisional tax is paid by the ratio option. If either of these situations apply to you, read our guide Provisional tax - IR289. 2021 end-of-year income tax Estates or trusts that have an agent and an extension of time may have until 7 April 2022 to pay their tax. If you think this applies to you contact your agent for more information. Otherwise, an estate or trust with a balance date between 1 March and 30 September must pay its end-of-year income tax and any interest by 7 February 2022. An estate or trust with a balance date between 1 October and 28 February must pay its end-of-year income tax by the 7th day of the month before the following year's balance date. ird.govt.nz 61 How to make payments You can make payments by: • • direct debit in myIR • • credit or debit card at ird.govt.nz/pay • • internet banking.

In this guide we use "trustee" or "you" to refer to the person or persons administering an estate or trust. The word trust also refers to estates unless we've stated otherwise. This guide provides general information about how to complete the IR6 return. There are references throughout the guide to our other publications which may help you. If you need more help please contact us or a tax advisor. Important changes from 1 April 2021 New disclosure requirements for NZ Domestic Trusts are effective for the income year beginning 1 April 2021 and subsequent income years. Refer to the checklist at Question 33 to see if your trust needs to comply. If you are required to comply you will need to provide additional disclosures with your 2022 return, including: • • The details of any person who is a settlor of the trust. Complete an IR6S to provide the details of any person who is a settlor of the trust and attach it to your return. • • The nature and amount of any settlement made on the trust during the year. Complete an IR6S to record any settlements made on the trust during the year and attach it to your return. • • The details of any person who received a distribution from the trust during the year, and information about the amount and nature of the distribution. Complete an IR6B for any beneficiary who received a distribution during the year and attach it to your return. • • The details of any person who has the power to appoint or dismiss a trustee, add or remove a beneficiary, or amend the trust deed. Log into myIR to provide us this information, or complete an IR6P and attach it to your return. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE7 IR6S: Settlements & settlors If you are required to comply with the new NZ Domestic Trust disclosure rules you will need to supply additional information with your 2022 income tax return: • • The details of any person who has made a settlement on the trust (at any point in time) if those details have not already been supplied. • • The nature and amount of any settlement made during the year, and the details of the person who made the settlement (the settlor). A settlor of the trust can include any person who at any time: • • transfers value -to a trust, or -for the benefit of the trust, or -on terms of the trust These are called settlements. A settlement is any action that makes a person a settlor of a trust and includes any of the following: • • disposal of any property to the trust for less than market value • • property or funds made available to the trust for less than market value • • services provided to the trust for less than market value, unless those services are incidental to the operation of the trust • • any property acquired from the trust or any service from the trustee for greater than market value. A settlement can also occur as a result of a transaction or series of transactions entered by a person that has the effect of making that person a settlor. In most cases settlements must be valued at market value, unless the settlement is something that cannot be later distributed to a beneficiary, in which case it must be valued at NIL. For example, • • If a person provides land and buildings or other assets to a trust they must be valued at market value; ird.govt.nz 8 • • If a person provides cash to a trust, it must be valued at market value (which is the face value of the currency, or NZ equivalent face value of foreign currency); • • If a person provides services to a trust those services have been consumed by the trust and can’t later be distributed so they must be valued at NIL; • • If a person is owed money by a trust and chooses not to charge interest, the non-charging of interest is a transfer of value and therefore a settlement, but the trust has not gained anything that it can later distribute to a beneficiary so the settlement must be valued at NIL. The value must be determined at the time the settlement is made. The total value of all settlements forms the corpus of the trust. The minimum details you must supply on the IR6S: • • The name of the settlor • • The date of birth or commencement date of the settlor • • The jurisdiction of tax residency of the settlor • • The tax identification number (TIN) of the settlor: -if they are not required to hold an IRD number in NZ or a TIN in another jurisdiction, or the jurisdiction doesn’t issue TINs tick the relevant box at question 1, leave boxes 2 and 3 blank; -if they are a NZ resident then enter their NZ IRD number in box 2; -if they are not a NZ resident enter their TIN in box 3; -if you do not hold the IRD number or TIN of the settlor: If a settlement was made by this settlor in the current year, then you must ask them to provide it to you If a settlement was not made by this settlor recently and you cannot reasonably obtain their IRD# or TIN (e.g. because they are deceased and the settlement was >7 years ago), leave boxes 2 and 3 blank. • • No settlement in the current year -If you are completing the IR6S in order to provide information about past settlors (who have not made a settlement this year) tick the box at question 4 ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE9 • • Settlement/s in the current year that are required to be valued at market value -Cash: if the settlor has provided one or more settlements of money during the year add them together and enter the amount at box 5 -Shares/ownership interests: if the settlor has provided one or more settlements of shares/ ownership interests during the year add them together and enter the amount at box 6 -Financial arrangements: if the settlor has provided one or more settlements of financial arrangements during the year add them together and enter the amount at box 7 -Services: if the settlor has provided one or more settlements of services during the year add them together and enter the amount at box 8 -Land: if the settlor has provided one or more settlements of land during the year add them together and enter the amount at box 9 -Buildings: if the settlor has provided one or more settlements of buildings during the year add them together and enter the amount at box 10 -Other: if the settlor has provided one or more settlements of any other type during the year add them together and enter the amount at box 11, enter a description of the nature of the settlement at box 12, if there are multiple ‘other’ settlements describe the one/s of the highest value. • • Settlement/s in the current year that are required to be valued at NIL -If a settlement has been made but the amount is required to be valued at nil, tick box 13. Complete as many IR6S forms as you need to provide all of the required details and staple these to the back page of your return. ird.govt.nz 10 IR6P: Powers of appointment If you are required to comply with the new NZ Domestic Trust disclosure rules you will need to supply additional information with your 2022 income tax return: • • The details of any person who has the power to appoint or dismiss a trustee, add or remove a beneficiary, or amend the trust deed (the appointer). You only need to tell us about people who have these powers in the current year, and then let us know in future if they cease to hold them. You can also keep these details up to date in myIR. The minimum details you must supply on the IR6P: • • The name of the appointer • • The date of birth or commencement date of the appointer • • The jurisdiction of tax residency of the appointer • • The tax identification number of the appointer: -if they are not required to hold an IRD number in NZ or a TIN in another jurisdiction, or the jurisdiction doesn’t issue TINs tick the relevant box at question 1, leave boxes 2 and 3 blank; -if they are a NZ resident then enter their NZ IRD number in box 2; -if they are not a NZ resident enter their TIN in box 3; -if you do not hold the IRD number or TIN of the appointer you must ask them to provide it to you • • Enter date that the appointer was given this power in box 4. If the date is unknown (e.g. because it was many years ago and records are not available), enter a date that reflects a reasonable estimate. • • Enter the date that the appointer ceased to hold this power at box 5, if they currently hold these powers leave this field blank. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE11 IR6B: Beneficiaries & distributions If you are required to comply with the new NZ Domestic Trust disclosure rules you will need to supply additional information with your 2022 income tax return: • • The details of any beneficiary who has received a distribution from the trust during the year, and the nature and amount of that distribution. This information should be included on the IR6B. Refer to question 27 for more information about how to complete the IR6B. Complete as many IR6Bs as you need to provide all the required details and staple them to your return. Distributions In addition to allocating beneficiary income, see page 12 for allocations, a trustee can make other distributions to beneficiaries. A distribution can include: • • tax-paid profits (trustee income or beneficiary income) • • capital gains of the trust • • corpus of the trust (the value of settlements made on the trust) • • the physical and intangible assets of the trust passing to beneficiaries • • the beneficiary using trust property for less than market value • • the beneficiary supplying goods or services to the trust and receiving more than market value in return (including charging a higher than market interest rate on loans to the trust) • • (for a foreign trust) non-taxed profits such as foreign sourced income. The tax position of a distribution from a trust depends on the type of trust making the distribution and the residency of the beneficiary. See pages 17 to 19 of this guide. Generally, a distribution, other than beneficiary income, to a New Zealand resident beneficiary from: • • a complying trust is not taxable • • a foreign trust is taxable, to the extent it is not part of the corpus or capital gains, or • • a non-complying trust is taxable at 45 cents in the dollar, to the extent it is not part of the corpus. ird.govt.nz 12 How income of an estate or trust is taxed in general In general, income of an estate or trust will be subject to income tax in New Zealand if it has a source in New Zealand regardless of the residency of the trustee. The trustee is also liable for New Zealand income tax on income derived outside New Zealand where any settlor of the trust is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year, or if the estate has a New Zealand trustee and the deceased was resident in New Zealand. Allocations Income of a trust is either trustee or beneficiary income. The trustee can allocate income as beneficiary income, provided the income either: • • vests absolutely in the beneficiary in the income year, or • • is paid or applied for the benefit of the beneficiary during that income year or within a specified period from the end of the income year. For more information see Question 21A on page 48. Trust income allocated as beneficiary income is taxable income, except as covered below under the special rules for allocations to minor beneficiaries. Allocations of beneficiary income to a minor A minor is defined as a New Zealand resident under the age of 16 years on the balance date of the trust. Allocations of beneficiary income that the minor beneficiary rule applies to are treated as trustee income. This means they are: • • taxed at 33% • • included in the trustee's tax calculation in the IR6 return, and • • included in the trustees' provisional tax calculations. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE13 As these amounts are distributions of the trust, those trusts that are required to comply with the NZ Domestic Trust disclosure rules will still need to complete an IR6B for the minor beneficiary to disclose the amount of the distribution. Refer to Question 33 of the guide to see if your trust needs to comply. The minor beneficiary should not include this income in their Individual income tax return - IR3. Exceptions to the minor beneficiary rule The following exceptions allow income allocated to a minor beneficiary to be treated as beneficiary income if the income: • • is derived by a minor for whom a child disability allowance is paid under the Social Security Act 2018 • • is derived directly from either a group investment fund, the Māori trustee or a Māori authority, or • • the amount allocated to the minor from the trust is $1,000 or less in an income year. Note If the $1,000 threshold is exceeded, the total income allocated to the minor beneficiary is taxed as trustee income. For example, if a minor beneficiary is allocated $1,200, the total amount of $1,200 is taxed at 33%. The general anti-avoidance rule may apply if a person establishes multiple trusts to increase the number of exemptions. See Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 19, No 4 (May 2007) for further information. There are further exceptions to the minor beneficiary rule that relate to the nature of the settlements on the trust. For more information, please see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 19, No 4 (May 2007) ird.govt.nz 14 Return due date If the estate or trust has a 31 March balance date, you have until 7 July 2022 to send in the return, unless you have been granted an extension of time. Contact us if you're not sure of the filing date. If the estate or trust is the client of an agent, it may have until 31 March 2023 to complete the return. If this applies, contact your agent. International obligations You may also need to provide information about a trust to comply with the following international obligations. The Common Reporting Standard (CRS) For more information see: • • IR Guidance on the CRS - IR1048 section 11 • • CRS: Is the Trust a Reporting Financial Institution - IR1052 • • Family Trust obligations under the CRS - IR1053 • • ird.govt.nz/crs Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) For more information see: • • FATCA Trusts Guidance - IR1087 • • FATCA status of NZ trusts that are not US person - IR1086 • • ird.govt.nz/fatca ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE15 Questions Questions 1 to 6 The information in Questions 1 to 6 of the return helps us to be sure that any correspondence we send goes to the right person at the right address. Fill in these questions only if the correct information is not printed on the return. Question 1 IRD number If the estate or trust does not have an IRD number, complete an IRD number application - resident non-individual - IR596 and send it in with the return. Question 2 Name of estate or trust If the estate or trust has changed its name since the last time a return was completed, please provide proof of the change so we can update our records, for example trustee resolution. Questions 3 and 4 Postal address and phone number If you have a new postal address, write the details at Question 3. If your new postal address is a PO Box number, show your box lobby if you have one. If you are unsure of your box lobby please contact New Zealand Post. If the estate or trust uses its tax preparer's postal address, leave this panel blank. The tax preparer will let us know if they change their address. We ask for your daytime phone number at Question 4 in case we need to call you with questions about the return. ird.govt.nz 16 Question 5 Business industry classification (BIC) code We're required to supply the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) with a code for your business or trading activity, for levy classification and calculation. If your BIC code is not pre-printed on the return or is different from the pre-printed one, enter the correct code. To work out your main business or trading activity and its code, go to businessdescription.co.nz or call ACC on 0800 222 776. It's important that you choose the code which most accurately reflects your main business or trading activity. Note Please provide the code only. Do not provide a description. Question 6 Bank account number The fastest and safest way to get any refund is to have it direct credited to your New Zealand bank account or other deposit account, for example a building society account. If your bank account number is not preprinted on the return form, include it at Question 6. If your suffix has only 2 digits, enter them in the first 2 squares of the suffix box. Question 7A Has the estate or trust ceased? If the estate or trust has ceased, include accounts showing the distribution of all assets and liabilities to the date the estate or trust was finalised. If the estate or trust is registered for GST or as an employer, you'll need to complete a Business cessation - IR315 form to finalise your records. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE17 Question 7B Nil trust or estate returns If the trust receives any income, for example interest, the trustee must complete a return regardless of the amount of income derived. Where a trust has no prospect or intention of deriving any income in a given financial year, contact us with the trust’s name and IRD number so we can record that a return is not required for that year. If the trust subsequently derives income in a future year, the trust must send in a return. A complying trust that is non-active and does not want to complete an income tax return can complete and send the Non-active trust declaration - IR633: The complying trust needs to declare: • • it has not derived or been deemed to have derived any gross income from any source • • it has no deductions, and • • it has not been party to, or continued with, any transactions with assets of the trust that give rise to any of the following during the tax year: a. income or deemed income in any person's hand, or b. fringe benefits to any employee or former employee. Question 8 Types of trusts The type of trust determines the way certain distributions are taxed in the hands of beneficiaries. There are 3 types of estates or trusts for income tax purposes: • • complying • • foreign, and • • non-complying. ird.govt.nz 18 Complying trust In general, a complying trust is one that has been taxed in New Zealand on all its trustee income since the date it began and the trustee has met all its tax obligations. Complying trusts include: • • trusts settled by New Zealand residents with New Zealand trustees and New Zealand beneficiaries • • estates of people who were New Zealand residents when they died, and • • foreign trusts that have elected to become complying trusts. The trust can still be a complying trust if the trustee was not liable for New Zealand income tax because: • • the trust earned no income • • the income was exempt, or • • the trust was in a loss situation. Foreign trust A foreign trust is one where no settlor of the trust has been resident in New Zealand since 17 December 1987, or the date the trust was first settled, whichever is later, and on the date of distribution. Non-complying trust A trust that is not a complying trust or a foreign trust is a non-complying trust. Non-complying trusts include: • • trusts with a New Zealand-resident settlor, but non- resident trustees, that have not been liable for or have not paid New Zealand income tax on all trustee income since first being settled • • foreign trusts where the settlor has become a New Zealand resident and an election has not been made to be a complying trust, and • • trusts where all the beneficiaries are non-residents and all the income is passive income such as interest, dividends, and royalties. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE19 Election to change category of trust for tax purposes New residents or former residents who have settled a trust before coming to New Zealand may elect to pay New Zealand tax on future trustee income. Making this election will mean the trust becomes a complying trust for income derived on or after the date on which the election is made. An election can be made by a settlor, trustee or beneficiary using an Election to pay income tax on trustee income - IR463 form. If an election is not made the trust will become a non- complying trust. Elections must be made within 12 months of a new resident ceasing to be a transitional resident and within 12 months of the arrival for a former resident. Unit trust A unit trust is treated as a company for tax purposes. If you're preparing a tax return for a unit trust, please complete a Companies income tax return - IR4. Group investment fund If the income is: • • solely from Category B income, an IR6 must be completed • • solely from Category A income, an IR4 must be completed, or • • a combination of both Category A and Category B income, an IR4 and IR44E must be completed. Please read the notes on the IR44E for more information. Superannuation schemes A superannuation scheme that is not registered with the Financial Markets Authority and does not allow investors to contribute will be treated as a trust for tax purposes and must complete an IR6 return. Income and credits section Income received by a trust retains its character as it passes through the trust. For this reason we ask that you return different types of income in certain boxes. ird.govt.nz 20 Question 9 New Zealand interest Include interest from all New Zealand sources at Question 9. The interest payer will usually send you an RWT withholding certificate showing the gross interest paid and the amount of RWT deducted. Write the total of all RWT deducted in Box 9A. Add up all the gross interest amounts (before the deduction of any tax) and write the total in Box 9B. Note If expenses are deductible against the interest income (for example commission), claim them at Question 22. Read about expenses on page 50. Do not send us interest statements or IR15 certificates with the return. Keep these in case we ask for them later Interest on broken term deposits If you've broken a term deposit during the year, you may have to account for negative interest. This is interest repaid on a term deposit and may reduce the amount of interest to declare in your return. If the term deposit was broken in full, or it was business related, deduct the negative interest from the gross interest shown on the IR15 or equivalent statement. Deduct the allowable negative interest component, using the worksheet below, before entering the gross amount at Box 9B on your return. In all other cases, the negative interest is deductible in a future income year when the term deposit matures. Worksheet Copy your gross interest from your RWT withholding certificate to Box 1. 1 Print any negative interest you've paid in Box 2. 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the answer in Box 3. Copy this amount to Box 9B of your tax return. 3 ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE21 Interest paid or charged by Inland Revenue If we paid you interest, include it in Box 9B for the income year the trust received the interest. If the trust paid us interest, include it as a deduction in Box 22 of the return for the income year the interest is paid. Interest from overseas If the trust received interest from overseas, convert your overseas interest and tax credits to New Zealand dollars and show the amounts at Question 13. Read the notes about overseas income on pages 26 to 29. Income from financial arrangements The financial arrangement rules generally require income or expenditure from financial arrangements to be spread over the term of the arrangement. Financial arrangements include term deposits, government stock, local authority stock, mortgage bonds, futures contracts and deferred property settlements. Trustees are required to use a spreading method unless they are a cash basis person. A person is a cash basis person if: • • the value of all financial arrangements together is less than $1 million, or • • the value of the income or expenditure from the financial arrangement is less than $100,000, and • • the deferral of income or expenditure using the cash method rather than the actual method is less than $40,000. A special rule applies for deceased persons. If the deceased person was a cash basis person at the date of death, the concession applies in the year of death and up to 4 succeeding years. Any RWT from a financial arrangement will be deducted on a cash basis. Different rules apply for financial arrangements entered into prior to 20 May 1999. ird.govt.nz 22 Sale or maturity of financial arrangements Whether or not the exemption from the spreading methods explained earlier applies, when a financial arrangement matures or is sold, remitted, or transferred, a "wash-up" calculation known as a base-price adjustment must be carried out. Cash basis persons can use the Sale or disposal of financial arrangements - IR3K to perform the calculation. This form could be used, for example, to calculate the amount you need to account for if you have broken a term deposit in full. For more information about the financial arrangements rules, please see Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 11, No 6 (July 1999), page 3. Any RWT will be deducted on a cash basis. Question 10 New Zealand dividends Dividends are the part of a company's profits that it passes on to its shareholders. Unit trusts are treated as companies for income tax purposes. Distributions from unit trusts will generally be taxable and are treated as dividends. Note All the trust's cash and taxable bonus issue dividends derived from a qualifying company must be distributed by the trustees as beneficiary income to the beneficiaries who are not trustees or companies that are not qualifying companies. Complete Question 10 if you received any New Zealand dividends, including dividends from your local electricity or gas supplier. Do not include a dividend that's a distribution of the trust's capital and is tax free. The company or unit trust that paid you the dividend will send you a dividend statement. Do not send us any dividend statements with the return, keep them in case we ask for them later. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE23 Note If expenses are deductible against the dividend income, claim them at Question 22. Credits attached to dividends "Imputation credits" are credits for part of the tax the company has already paid on its profits, which means the dividends are not taxed twice. RWT is deducted from your dividend to bring the total credits withheld up to 33% of the gross dividend. What to show in your return Your dividend statements show the amount: • • you received (net dividend) • • of any imputation credits, and • • of any RWT credits. Add all these amounts together to work out your total gross dividends and enter this in Box 10B. Add up all the imputation credits and print the total in Box 10. Add any dividend RWT credits and print the total in Box 10A. Shares instead of dividends If the trust received shares instead of dividends, include them as income at Question 10B. Write the amount as if you received dividends instead of shares. Dividends from overseas Please read about overseas income on pages 26 to 29 of this guide. Question 11 Māori authority distributions Māori authorities can make various types of distributions. Fill in Question 11 if you received any taxable Māori authority distributions. The Māori authority that paid you the distribution will send you a Māori authority distribution statement. ird.govt.nz 24 Credits attached to distributions The Māori authority may attach a credit to the distribution it makes to members. This credit will be classified as a Maori authority credit and is part of the tax the Maori authority has already paid on its profits, so the distributions are not taxed twice. What to show in your return Your Māori authority distribution statement shows the amount of: • • the distribution made to you, including the taxable portion and the non-taxable portion, and • • Māori authority credit. Transfer these amounts, leaving out any non-taxable distributions, to the relevant boxes at Question 11. Non-taxable distribution You do not need to include in the IR6 return any other distributions received from a Māori authority that are not taxable in the hands of a Māori authority member. These amounts are non-taxable distributions and cannot have credits attached. For more information read our Māori authorities guide - IR487. Question 12 Partnership, estate or trust income Partnership If the estate or trust received any income from a partnership, write the details at Question 12. Do not include: • • interest and RWT (include these at Question 9) • • any dividends, imputation credits or dividend RWT (include these at Question 10) • • any Māori authority dividends and Māori authority credits (include these at Question 11), or • • any overseas income and qualifying tax credits attached (include these at Question 13). ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE25 Estate or trust If the estate or trust has received income from a foreign or non-complying trust, complete a Schedule of beneficiary's estate or trust income - IR307 and attach it to the return. Add up all the other income from partnerships, complying and foreign trusts, and write the total in Box 12B. Add up any other tax credits and write the total in Box 12A. Do not include: • • interest and RWT (include these at Question 9) • • any dividends, imputation credits or dividend RWT (include these at Question 10) • • any Māori authority dividends and Māori authority credits (include these at Question 11), or • • any overseas income and qualifying tax credits attached (include these at Question 13). If the estate or trust has received a taxable distribution from a non-complying trust, do not include the amount as income. Calculate tax on the taxable distribution at 45 cents in the dollar and add it to the amount in Box 28B. You can use a loss to reduce the amount of the taxable distribution. Net losses brought forward from an earlier income year and losses incurred in the 2022 income year can be used to reduce the amount. If a loss is used in this way it is no longer available to offset other income. The reduction is calculated using the following formula: (Tax loss × 0.33) ÷ 0.45 Losses from limited partnerships If the estate or trust is claiming a loss from a limited partnership and you need help working out the amount that can be claimed, go to ird.govt.nz/index/calculators-and-tools ird.govt.nz 26 Question 13 Overseas income If the trust received overseas income, for example interest or financial arrangements, show this at Question 13. Convert all overseas income and qualifying overseas tax paid to New Zealand dollars. You can do this by: • • using the rates available on ird.govt.nz/managing-my-tax • • contacting the overseas section of a trading bank and asking for the exchange rate for the day you received your overseas income. Include any overseas income and credits which you received from a partnership, look-through company (LTC), estate or trust here. Include gross income before deducting any tax credits at Box 13B. Credit for tax paid overseas will be limited to the amount of New Zealand tax payable on that income. How overseas income of an estate or trust is taxed In New Zealand, overseas income is taxed according to the residency of the settlor. The rules for the 3 most common situations are described over the page. New Zealand resident trustees and income derived outside New Zealand As a general rule, where a trustee is resident in New Zealand, and the trustee derives an amount from outside New Zealand, that income will be income of the trustee. The amount will be exempt income of the trustee if: • • no settlor of the trust except a transitional resident is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year, or • • that trust is not a testamentary trust (trust created by a person under their will) or an inter vivos trust (trust created by the settlor during their lifetime) where any settlor of the trust died resident in New Zealand, whether in that income year or otherwise. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE27 Non-resident trustees and income derived outside of New Zealand A non-resident trustee is also liable for New Zealand income tax on income derived from outside New Zealand where: • • any settlor is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year, or • • any settlor of an inter vivos or a testamentary trust died while they were resident in New Zealand, and a trustee is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year. Exceptions to the general rule for non-resident trustees and income derived outside New Zealand There are 2 situations in which a non-resident trustee is not liable for income tax on trustee income derived from outside New Zealand. These apply where the trustee is resident outside New Zealand at all times during the income year and either: • • no settlement has been made on the trust since 17 December 1987, or • • the only settlements made on the trust were by settlors who were not resident in New Zealand at the time of settlement and who have not been residents in New Zealand since 17 December 1987. Neither exception applies where an election to pay tax on trustee income has been made by the trustee. These exceptions do not affect the liability for income tax for any settlor of the trust, for example, where the settlor elects to pay tax on trustee income. The trustee income remains liable for income tax for the purpose of determining whether the trust is a complying trust (formerly qualifying trust). Overseas dividends If you are a New Zealand resident trustee and at any time during the 2022 income year you held rights such as shares, units or an entitlement to benefit in any foreign company, foreign trust, foreign superannuation scheme, or foreign life insurance policy, you may be required to calculate foreign investment fund (FIF) income or loss on those investments and include this amount in Box 13B. ird.govt.nz 28 Generally, you will use the fair dividend rate to calculate FIF income. The trustees may also need to complete an additional FIF disclosure form. For more information read the guide to Question 26 on page 54. You will not need to do this if the investment is covered by an exclusion. The main exclusions from an interest in an FIF are: • • investments in certain Australian resident companies listed on approved indices on the Australian stock exchange, that maintain franking accounts. Investments covered in the list are available at ird.govt.nz/fif in the Australian share exemption list - IR871 • • interest in certain Australian units • • limited exemptions for interests in certain venture capital • • limited exemptions for interests in certain venture capital interests that move offshore (for 10 or more income years from the income year in which the company migrates from New Zealand), and • • a 10% or greater interest in a controlled foreign company (CFC). A limited number of trusts are also excluded from the rules if the attributing interests are below $50,000. These are: • • a testamentary trust • • a compensatory trust, or • • where the settlor of the trust is the Accident Compensation Corporation. If the exclusions apply and the trust is under the threshold, include dividends received in Box 13B and any qualifying overseas tax credits in Box 13A. Note If your dividend exceeds your FIF income, the amount of imputation credit you can claim is calculated on the basis of your FIF income. If your FIF income exceeds your dividend, you can claim the entire imputation credit attached to the dividend. Any excess imputation credit cannot be carried forward to the next year or converted to a loss. Please note you cannot claim Australian franking credits. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE29 For more information about the FIF rules read A guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate - IR461, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 19, No 3 (April 2007) page 28, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 20, No 3 (April 2008) page 110, or go to ird.govt.nz/fif CFC income or loss If at any time during the 2022 income year the trust has attributed CFC income or loss, the trustees or beneficiaries may be required to calculate this in their own income tax returns. A loss from a CFC cannot be used to offset domestic income or be included in domestic losses that are carried forward to the 2023 income year. Generally, these losses can only offset income or future income from CFCs that are resident in the same country as the CFC that incurred the loss. The trustees may also need to complete an additional CFC disclosure form. See Question 26 on page 54. Investments in portfolio investment entities (PIEs) and portfolio investor attributed income/loss If you receive dividends from a PIE that is a listed company and does not use your prescribed investor rate (PIR), you may choose whether to include the dividends in your return. The attributed PIE income/loss is included in the estate or trust's return for the period that includes the end of the PIE's income year. PIEs usually have a 31 March balance date. The amount of income derived by the estate or trust as a distribution by a PIE is excluded income of the estate or trust other than fully imputed dividends from a PIE that is a listed company and does not use your PIR. More information is available in our guide Information for trustees who invest in PIEs - IR856. ird.govt.nz 30 Question 14 Look-through company (LTC) income If the estate or trust received any tax credits and/or income from an LTC write the details at Question 14. Do not include any of the following types of income received from an LTC at Question 14: • • interest and RWT (include these at Question 9) • • any dividends, imputation credits, and dividend RWT (include these at Question 10) • • Māori authority distributions and credits (include these at Question 11) • • any overseas income and qualifying tax credits attached (include these at Question 13), or • • residential rental income (include this at Question 15). The loss limitation rule limits the amount of deductions an LTC owner (shareholder) can claim if the amount exceeds the owner's "owner's basis" (equity) in the LTC. For the 2017-18 and later income years, the loss limitation rule only applies to an LTC which is in a partnership or joint venture which includes another LTC. The estate or trust can now claim the full amount of prior years' non-allowable deductions brought forward this year. This will not apply if the loss limitation rule continues to apply to limit the amount claimable. The LTC will normally supply information about the non- allowable deductions and any other information required to complete your return. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE31 Example Trust A is an owner of an LTC which is not in a partnership or joint venture that includes another LTC. For the 2021 - 22 income year Trust A has a net loss of $4,000.00 from the LTC. Trust A also has prior years' non-allowable deductions brought forward of $5,000.00. Trust A had no tax credits from the LTC for the year. Trust A's tax return should show the following amounts in the following boxes: • • 14A: $0.00 • • 14B: $4,000.00 - • • 14C: $0.00 • • 14D: $5,000.00 • • 14E: $9,000.00 - What to show on your return Add up all other tax credits received from the LTC and print the total in Box 14A. Add up all LTC income, deduct expenses not already included elsewhere and print in Box 14B. If a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Add up all non-allowable deductions this year and print in Box 14C. There should not be non-allowable deductions this year unless the loss limitation rule applies. Add up all prior year non-allowable deductions claimable this year and print the amount in Box 14D. You'll be able to claim the full amount of non-allowable deductions brought forward from last year if the loss limitation rule no longer applies. If you have an amount in Box 14C, add this to Box 14B and put the total in Box 14E. If you have an amount in Box 14D, subtract this from Box 14B and put the total in Box 14E. ird.govt.nz 32 If you do not have any amounts in Box 14C or Box 14D, copy the amount from Box 14B to 14E. Box 14E is your adjusted LTC income. You can find more information about LTCs in the Look- through companies - IR879 guide. Question 15 Income and expenditure from residential property This question applies to owners of residential property, including overseas property, that gives rise to net income from a bright-line sale, and property subject to the residential property deduction rules. Bright-line property rule for residential property The bright-line property rule needs to be considered when none of the other land sale rules at Question 18 apply to the disposal of the property. This rule for residential property looks at the length of time a property is owned. If you sell or dispose of a residential property within a certain timeframe and no exclusion applies, then your profit on the sale will be taxable. This applies no matter what your reason was for buying the property or what kind of buyer you are. The bright-line property rule applies if you sell or dispose of a residential property you have owned for less than: • • 5 years for properties acquired between 29 March 2018 and 26 March 2021. • • 5 years for properties acquired as a result of an offer made on or before 23 March 2021 and that offer was not able to be revoked or withdrawn before 27 March 2021. • • 5 years for properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021 that qualify as a ‘new build’. • • 10 years for all other properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE33 For tax purposes, a property is generally acquired on the date a binding sale and purchase agreement is entered into (even if some standard conditions like getting finance or a building report still need to be met). This date will determine which bright-line period (5 or 10 years) applies for your property. For more information on when a property is acquired, see our Question we’ve been asked (QB) 17/02: Date of acquisition of land, and start date for 2-year bright-line test at taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz There are other dates that are relevant for figuring out whether your property sale is taxable under the bright- line property rule. Generally, your bright-line period starts when the legal title is transferred to you and ends when you enter into a binding sale and purchase agreement to sell the property. There are some different rules if you purchase “off the plan” in a new development, for example. The bright-line property rule does not tax any profit made while the property was your main home. It also does not apply to a sale of inherited property, if you’re the executor or administrator of a deceased estate, or if you transfer property to a partner or spouse under a relationship property agreement (however, for any subsequent sale the bright-line property rule will apply). You can use the property tax decision tool on our website to work out if you need to pay tax on the sale of your property. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/brightline Income and losses for property subject to the bright-line property rule are treated differently in the tax return. After a taxable bright-line sale: • • if you have net income from the sale of the property (a profit), the net income is included in Box 15A. Unless the property is part of a portfolio, expenses from other properties cannot be offset against the net income from the disposal. • • if you have made a net loss when the property is sold, the loss must be carried forward to a later income year when it can be used to offset net income from the land sale provisions, including from future disposals subject to the bright-line rule. A bright-line loss is not recorded in the tax return. Please keep your own record of any bright-line losses you have made. ird.govt.nz 34 Complete a Bright-line residential property sale information - IR833 form for each bright-line property sold or disposed of and include it with your return. The form explains how to calculate the resulting profit or loss. Complete the form even if the details have been included in a Financial statements summary - IR10 or set of accounts, unless the income will be included in your return as part of your business income as a property speculator, property dealer, developer or builder. If you sell/dispose of a residential property and the sale is taxable under the bright-line property rule, the amount of the previously denied interest under the interest limitation rules is treated as if it were part of the cost of the property in the year of disposal. If this results in a net loss, the deduction for the net loss is limited under the current rule that applies to losses from the disposal of bright-line property. If the disposal is not taxable, the interest previously denied a deduction remains non-deductible. If you are a New Zealand tax resident you’ll need to pay tax on your worldwide income under New Zealand tax law. This includes any property sales both in New Zealand and overseas subject to the bright-line property rule or the other land sale rules. For more information on the land sale rules, go to ird.govt.nz/buying-selling or read our guide Bright-line property tax - IR1227. You can find our forms and guides at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Residential property deduction rules Most residential rental properties are subject to the residential property deduction rules (also known as the ring-fencing rules). When they apply, your residential rental deductions generally cannot be more than your residential property income. If your deductions are more than your income, the difference must be carried forward to the next year you earn residential income, including income from properties held on revenue account. There are 2 levels of exclusions from the rules. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE35 Any rental income or loss and net income or loss from a taxable disposal is fully excluded from the new rules if the property is: • • the main home • • property subject to the mixed-use asset rules (for example, a holiday home rented out part-time and not used for some of the year) • • certain employee accommodation. For these types of property, the existing rules apply with the rental income or loss shown at box 17B and net income or net loss from a taxable disposal shown in box 18B. Any rental net loss and net loss from a taxable disposal is partially excluded from the new rules if it is for: • • property that will always be taxed on sale, being revenue account property of a person in the business of building, developing or dealing in land, or • • other revenue account property the person has notified us they want the exclusion to apply to. For these types of property any rental net loss is shown at Box 17B and taxable disposal net loss shown at Box 18B. Net rental income and net income from a taxable disposal plus any depreciation recovered is shown as residential income Box 15A. All other residential property income is to be included in Box 17B. Income or loss from the sale/disposal of residential property that is outside the rules is included in Box 18B. Refer to the Rental income - IR264 guide for information on when the rules apply, how to calculate your income, the amount of deductions you can claim for this year, and the amount of any excess deductions that must be carried forward. The residential property deduction rules also apply to a trust that has borrowed money to acquire an interest in certain entities with significant rental property holdings - a residential land-rich entity and has interest expenditure on the borrowed money. Residential land-rich entity - a close company, partnership ird.govt.nz 36 or look-through company that holds more than 50% of its assets by value in residential land directly or indirectly. They come under the interposed entities rules as part of the residential property deduction rules. For more information about the interposed entity rules, see page 60 of the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No.8 September 2019. Completing Question 15 in your return You will use this question to record residential income and deductions that are subject to the residential property deduction rules. Tick the method you have used to calculate your residential property income and deductions. You can use 1 of the following methods: • • Portfolio basis - combine the income and deductions for all rental properties in the portfolio. • • Individual, property-by-property basis - income and deductions of individual property calculated separately to other property. You need to maintain separate records for each property to choose this option. • • Combination of the property-by-property basis and portfolio basis - choose to apply different methods to different property. Some properties are held in a portfolio and others are held on property-by-property basis. If you are an owner of a look-through company (LTC) and have attributed residential income or residential rental deductions you need to use the same method the LTC used to attribute the income and deductions. Calculate and identify the amounts for Boxes 15A to 15F using your chosen method. Calculate your rental income and deductions as usual, as shown at boxes 4 and 14 on the Rental income - IR3R form. You can then enter these amounts in the Residential property deductions worksheets - IR1226 to help calculate the amounts required to be entered in your return. You can print a copy off our website ird.govt.nz ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE37 Write the total residential income in Box 15A. This is the total of: (a) all rental income from the portfolio (and/or individual property) (b) all depreciation recovery income for assets disposed of from the portfolio (or individual property) (c) net income from the taxable sale/disposal of a property in your portfolio (or individual property), and (d) all net rental income, depreciation recovery income and net income from the taxable disposal of the property from residential property excluded because it is held on revenue account. Only include the net income from a disposal once. If you are a partner in a partnership or owner of a look- through company and have been attributed residential income (Box 27G on the IR7P or IR7L), include that here. Write the total residential rental deductions for residential rental properties in Box 15B. This is the total deductions for the current year - Box 14 on the Rental income - IR3R if completed. If you are a partner in a partnership or owner of a look- through company and have been attributed residential rental deductions (Box 27M on the IR7P or IR7L), include that here. Do not include purchase costs, capital improvements or costs incurred when disposing of the property here. They are included when calculating the net income for taxable disposals. Include the amount of any interest paid on an investment in a land rich entity that relates to the rental activity in Box 15B. Include the amount of interest paid that does not relate to the rental property in Box 17B. Calculate the amount of allowable deductions you can claim this year, adjusting for excess deductions. Write the total residential rental deductions claimed this year in Box 15D. This should equate to Box 15B plus Box 15C less the amount of excess deductions for each property and/or property portfolio calculations shown in Box 15F. ird.govt.nz 38 The amount cannot exceed total residential income at Box 15A, unless there was a taxable sale/disposal of a rental property. Combine the net income results (after adjusting for any excess deductions) for each property and or property portfolio calculations in Box 15E. Your total Net residential income in Box 15E cannot be a loss, unless the rental property or all the properties in the portfolio have been disposed of as taxable sales. Any losses are counted as zero unless the loss is the result of either: • • excess deductions released as the result of either a taxable disposal of a property held on the property-by- property basis, or a taxable disposal of all properties or the last property held in a portfolio, or • • claimable interest paid on your investment in a residential land-rich entity. Refer to the Rental income - IR264 guide. Write the amount of all excess deductions for the year to be carried forward to next year in Box 15F. This is calculated as Residential rental deductions Box 15B plus 15C minus Residential rental deductions claimed this year Box 15D. Include the amount of any excess deductions to be carried forward for interest paid on an investment in a land rich entity in Box 15F. Note 1 If you sell/dispose of an individual property and the sale is not taxable, or you sell/dispose of the last property in a portfolio and at least 1 of the sales in the portfolio was not taxable, any excess deductions will transfer to another property or portfolio and carried forward to a future year in which you earn income from a residential rental property (including properties on revenue account). ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE39 Note 2 If you sell/dispose of an individual property and the sale is taxable, or you sell/dispose of the last rental property in a portfolio, and the sale of all your rental properties in a portfolio were taxable, any remaining loss/excess deductions are released and can be offset against other income. However, this does not include any excess deductions transferred to the portfolio/property. Note 3 If you want to claim that a property is held on revenue account where the sale may be taxable, you need to tell us the details of the property. You will be stating the sale will be a taxable sale when the property is disposed of. You must be able to separately identify the deductions relating to the property. Refer to the Rental income - IR264 guide. Question 16 Interest incurred from residential property This question applies to owners of residential property subject to the interest limitation rules. You do not need to complete this question for the following types of property: • • Farmland • • Hospitals, hospices, convalescent homes, nursing homes • • Rest homes and retirement villages • • Hotels, motels, inns, camping grounds, hostels. For interest to be deductible, the general deductibility rules must be met. The interest will also not be deductible to the extent to which it is of a private or domestic nature. From 1 October 2021, interest is not deductible for residential property in New Zealand acquired on or after 27 March 2021, unless an exclusion or exemption applies (see below). For properties acquired before 27 March 2021, the ability ird.govt.nz 40 to deduct interest on existing loans is being phased out between 1 October 2021 and 31 March 2025. For the 2022 tax year, you can claim: • • 100% of the interest incurred from 1 April 2021 to 30 September 2021 • • 75% of the interest incurred from 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2022. Interest on any new loans drawn down on or after 27 March 2021 is not deductible. Special rules also apply for refinanced loans and for interest on revolving credit and overdraft facilities. Any interest on borrowings above the closing balance on 26 March 2021 is not deductible. For more information, go to ird.govt.nz/property/renting-out-residential-property There are interposed entity rules to deny interest deductions for a customer who borrows to indirectly fund residential property through an interposed entity. If you sell/dispose of a residential property and the sale is taxable under the bright-line property rule, the amount of the previously denied interest under the interest limitation rules is treated as if it were part of the cost of the property in the year of disposal. If this results in a net loss, the deduction for the net loss is limited under the current rule that applies to losses from the disposal of bright-line property. If the disposal is not taxable, the interest previously denied a deduction remains non-deductible. Completing Question 16 in your return Complete this question for any interest expense you are claiming in this income tax return at Boxes 15B and 17B in relation to a house, apartment, flat or other structure that could be used for residential accommodation, either short- term or long-term. This includes if you have an arrangement to build such a structure, and bare land that could be used to build such a structure under the relevant district plan. Write the total interest on residential property in Box 16A. This is the total interest incurred on your borrowings for all your residential properties for this year. If you are using an IR3R form to prepare a summary for each rental property, ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE41 this is the total of all the 7A Boxes. Write the amount of interest expense claimed in Box 16B. If you are using an IR3R form to prepare a summary for each rental property, this is the total of all the 7B Boxes. Note If you are a partner in a partnership or owner of a look- through company that has incurred interest on residential property at Question 19 in the IR7, include your share of that here in proportion to your share in the partnership or effective look-through interest in the LTC. If you have claimed an interest expense in Box 16B, at Box 16C tick the reason(s) for the interest expense claimed: • • A Māori exempt company or not a residential land company – The interest limitation rules do not apply to non-close companies or groups if less than 50% of its total assets consist of residential property (excluding development property but including shares in other companies that exceed this 50% test) at all times during the income year. A close company that is a Māori authority, eligible to be a Māori authority, or wholly-owned by an entity that is a Māori authority or eligible to be one is an exempt Māori company if it passes this 50% test. • • Certain schedule 15 exclusions or property not in NZ – The interest limitation rules apply to land in New Zealand only. Schedule 15 of the Income Tax Act 2007 also allows you to claim interest for the following: • • main home – if a portion is used to earn income such as a flatting situation • • business premises (for example, a villa now used as a dental clinic) except if the business premises is used for providing accommodation and it’s not a person’s main home • • certain Māori land, papakāinga and kaumātua housing, and land transferred as part of settlement under Te Tiriti o Waitangi/Treaty of Waitangi • • employee accommodation • • student accommodation. ird.govt.nz 42 • • Loans drawn down prior to 27 March 2021 or interest incurred before 1 October 2021 – Interest incurred from 1 April 2021 to 30 September 2021 is fully deductible. From 1 October 2021, the ability to claim interest is being phased out for the following situations: • • loans drawn down prior to 27 March 2021 • • property acquired before 27 March 2021 but the loan for the settlement of the property was not drawn down until on or after 27 March 2021 • • loans that relate to the purchase of a property acquired as a result of an offer made on or before 23 March 2021 and that offer was not able to be revoked or withdrawn before 27 March 2021. In other situations where the property is acquired on or after 27 March 2021, interest cannot be claimed from 1 October 2021 onwards. • • Emergency, transitional, social or council housing – You can claim interest for loans if your property is used for emergency, transitional or social housing when leased to the Crown (for example, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development or Kāinga Ora) or to a registered community housing provider. • • New build exemption - the exemption generally applies to new build residential properties for 20 years from the date a new build’s Code Compliance Certificate (CCC) is issued under the Building Act 2004. A ‘new build’ includes a self-contained dwelling: • • that received a CCC on or after 27 March 2020. The dwelling can be made from new or existing materials and can be constructed onsite or relocated onto the land • • acquired off the plans that received a CCC on or after 27 March 2020 • • created by converting an existing dwelling into 2 or more dwellings, that received a CCC on or after 27 March 2020 • • converted from commercial premises that received a CCC on or after 27 March 2020 ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE43 • • converted from a hotel or motel and building consent authority records show that the conversion was completed on or after 27 March 2020 • • that has been removed from the earthquake prone buildings register on or after 27 March 2020, provided there is proof the remediation has been completed (either in the form of a CCC being issued, or local or building consent authority records showing the work has been completed and verified by a suitably qualified engineer) • • that was remediated because of weathertightness issues, provided more than 75% of the dwelling has been re-clad and a CCC was issued on or after 27 March 2020. • • Development or land business exemption – The land business exemption applies to land held as part of a developing, subdividing, or land-dealing business, or a business of erecting buildings on land. The development exemption does not require you to have a ‘land business’ and applies to land that you develop, subdivide, or build on to create a new build. The development may be a one-off.

If the property was purchased on or after 1 October 2015 with no intention to sell and it was sold/disposed of within 2 years, any excess deductions cannot be claimed unless they can be offset against net income from other property sales. Bright-line property sale information – IR833 form has more information on this. For more information on property sales see our guide Buying and selling residential property - IR313. Show the loss with a minus sign in the last box at Box 18B.

Include the total gross amount in Box 20B and any tax credits in Box 20A. This income is assessed as trustee income. Certain settlements on a trust The following settlements of property on a trust are deemed to be trustee income. This means that these settlements of property are excluded from the definition of corpus: • • property settled by a trustee of another trust, so long as it would have counted as income if that trust had distributed the property to 1 of its beneficiaries instead. • • a settlement of a property on a trust, which, if not for the settlement, would have constituted: - income of the settlor, or - a dividend for which the settlor would have been liable to deduct an FDP (foreign dividend payment), ird.govt.nz 48 formerly dividend withholding payment, if the settlor is currently resident or had been resident in New Zealand and subject to income tax at that time. Forgiveness of debt The financial arrangements rules treat debts that do not have to be repaid because they have been forgiven as income to the debtor. There is an exception in the case of trusts if the creditor is a natural person and forgives the debt: • • due to "natural love and affection" for natural persons who are beneficiaries of the trust, or • • of a trust that was established mainly for the benefit of charitable organisations. If the debt forgiven is distributed to a non-qualifying beneficiary, the trustee can be liable for tax. For more information, please see our Tax Information Bulletin Vol 11, No 6 (July 1999) page 20. Question 20 Total income & total tax credits Add up Boxes 9B to 13B, 14E, 15E, and 17B to 19B. Write the total in Box 20B. Add up Boxes 9A to 14A, 17A and 19A. Write the total in Box 20A. Do not include Box 10 in this total. Question 21 Income allocation Income derived by a trustee must be allocated between beneficiary income and trustee income in boxes 21A and 21B respectively. Question 21A - Beneficiary income excluding minor beneficiaries Beneficiary income is income of an estate or trust that vests in a beneficiary during the year or is paid to a beneficiary (or credited to them or dealt with in their interest or on their behalf) during the year or within a certain period after the end of the year. The rest of the income generated by an estate or trust will be trustee income. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE49 The income available to allocate to beneficiaries may be the income in Box 20B but it is important to note that Box 20B is a total of various amounts of estate or trust income. Some of the amounts, such as income from rental activities, are net amounts, for example after deductions. Some of the deductions may be for non-cash outgoings, such as depreciation. This may result in there being income that can be distributed to beneficiaries despite Box 20B showing a loss, and providing the trust deed allows it. This means there may be amounts that vest in or are paid to beneficiaries that have to be treated as beneficiary income. Identify any such vesting or payment and include the amount in Box 21A. The total must reconcile with the combined totals of Boxes 27I on the IR6B after deducting any taxable distributions included in Box 27H. Timing of allocation of beneficiary income Allocation of income to a beneficiary must be made within the income year, or by the later of the following: • • 6 months after balance date, or • • the earlier of: - the date on which the trustee completes the return of income for the income year, or - the date by which the trustee must complete a return for the income year. Example A family trust is allocating income to beneficiaries for the year ended 31 March 2022. The trust return is due on 7 July 2022 and the trust plans to complete by 30 June. The income should be allocated by the later of the following: • • 30 September 2022, or • • the earlier of: -30 June 2022, or -7 July 2022. In this case the income must be allocated by September 2022. ird.govt.nz 50 If the trust has a tax preparer, the extension of time for completing income tax returns may apply. Question 21B - Trustee income including minor beneficiaries Trustee income is any income generated by an estate or trust that is not beneficiary income, see "Question 21A - Beneficiary income" on pages 48 and 49. It includes income accrued to date of death and received afterwards. Where Box 20B shows a loss, there will be no trustee income and Box 21B should be left blank. The loss in Box 20B will be taken into account by us in calculating the loss to carry forward. Accrued income and non-apportionment clauses As a general rule, accrued income to date of death is retained by the trustee and becomes part of the capital of the estate. This income is treated as trustee income. However, where the will of the deceased taxpayer contains a non-apportionment clause, the beneficiary is entitled to receive the income accrued to date of death. So, if the accrued income is paid to the beneficiary, it's treated as beneficiary income. Question 22 Expenses The estate or trust may have incurred expenses in generating its income, for example: • • commission deducted from interest or dividends • • expenses for return preparation • • deductible trustee charges, or • • interest paid to Inland Revenue. If these expenses have not been claimed elsewhere in the return, write the amount claimed in Box 22. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE51 Note Certain expenditure is not deductible and this includes: • • private expenditure, and • • capital expenditure. Penalties may apply if it is claimed incorrectly. Question 23 Net losses brought forward There are 2 types of losses the estate or trust can bring forward. Specified activity net losses These are net losses from specified activities incurred before the 1991 income year. Any loss balance in relation to a specified activity that remained at the end of the 2021 income year must be offset against net income for the 2022 income year, before taking into account other losses. The amount of this offset cannot exceed the net income. If the loss balance from specified activities incurred before the 1991 income year exceeds the net income for the 2022 income year, that excess amount is added to the tax loss for the year. Any remaining tax loss is then carried forward to further income years. Other net losses All losses incurred from the 1991 income year onwards and other net losses that were not limited before 1991 (including any net loss resulting from excess imputation credits) are "other net losses". Enter the total of all specified activity net losses and other net losses the estate or trust can bring forward to 2022 in Box 23A. Enter the amount the estate or trust has offset against 2022 income in Box 23B. Note You'll find the amount of net loss the estate or trust has to bring forward on the loss notice we sent you with the 2021 income tax assessment. If you do not have a loss notice, contact us to obtain the figure. ird.govt.nz 52 Losses cannot be transferred from the deceased's return to the estate's return. Any such losses lapse. Trust losses cannot be passed to beneficiaries. They remain in the trust to be offset against future trustee income. If the estate or trust cannot offset any losses in 2022, enter "0.00" in Box 23B. Questions 24 and 25 Distributions to beneficiaries by foreign and non- complying trusts Question 24 - Distributions At Question 24 print the total amount of distributions made to beneficiaries during the year. A distribution is any income or property of the trust that vests in the beneficiary or is paid or applied for a beneficiary's benefit. It includes any property or service disposed of or provided to: • • a beneficiary for less than market value, or • • the trust by a beneficiary for greater than market value. Attach a separate schedule to page 3 of the return showing the source and the amount of each distribution. Distributions are considered to have come from different sources in the following order: • • beneficiary income • • accumulated trustee income • • capital profits or gains realised in the current income year • • capital profits or gains realised in previous years that have been accumulated by the trust, and • • the corpus of the trust. The ordering establishes if the distribution is a taxable distribution - see Question 23. Capital gains and corpus distributed only after income derived by trustees in the year of distribution and in prior years has been distributed. More information about the ordering and taxability of distributions can be found in our Trusts' and estates' income tax rules - IR288 guide. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE53 Question 25 - Taxable distributions A taxable distribution is one made to a beneficiary by a foreign or non-complying trust that is not beneficiary income. For a foreign trust taxable distributions also do not include capital gains profits that are not counted as taxable income, except when derived from transactions with associated persons or a distribution from the corpus. For non-complying trusts they do not include distributions from the corpus. Write the total taxable distributions made to beneficiaries during the year in Box 25. Where to include taxable distributions Include the amount of the taxable distribution made to each beneficiary in the beneficiary's panel of the IR6B: • • in Box 27H if the trust is a foreign trust, or • • in Box 27K if the trust is a non-complying trust. For tax payable on taxable distributions see Question 27K on page 59. Schedule of beneficiary's estate or trust income Each beneficiary (excluding minor beneficiaries) must attach a completed Schedule of beneficiary's estate or trust income - IR307 to their individual tax return if they receive income from a foreign or non-complying trust. It's helpful if the trustee or tax preparer also provides a completed IR307 when advising beneficiaries of their share of trust income. Beneficiaries do not then need to contact the trustee or tax preparer when completing their own returns. ird.govt.nz 54 Question 26 Additional disclosure of foreign investments If you calculated CFC or FIF income at Question 13 you may be required to complete an additional disclosure form for that investment. If the trust is not widely held or a PIE, you may not require an additional disclosure if the investments are in countries New Zealand has a double tax agreement with as at 31 March 2013, and have used the fair dividend rate or comparative value method. If the trust is widely held or a PIE you are required to complete an additional disclosure. Go to ird.govt.nz/beps for full details of the disclosure requirements and the appropriate forms.

Question 27 tax payable for beneficiaries Print the combined total from box 27T from all IR6B’s completed by the trust. Refer to the detail below on boxes 27A to 27AC for more information on how to complete the IR6B. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE55 IR6B Estate or trust beneficiary details Complete the details on the IR6B for each beneficiary who has received an income allocation from the trust. See Question 21A on pages 48 to 49 for the definition of beneficiary income. Complete boxes 27D to 27K to record any taxable income allocations made to the beneficiary. Complete boxes 27L to 27T to allocate tax credits and calculate tax payable. If the trust is required to comply with the NZ Domestic Trust disclosure rules (see question 33 to see if you need to comply) you must also complete an IR6B for any beneficiary who has received a distribution from the trust during the year. Complete boxes 27V to 27AA to record distributions made, and boxes 27U, 27AB and 27AC to record beneficiary account movements. Trusts required to comply with the NZ Domestic Trust Disclosure rules must supply each beneficiary’s: • • Full name • • Date of birth or commencement date • • IRD number or Tax identification number (refer question 27A, 27B and 27C) • • Jurisdiction of tax residency The question about jurisdiction of tax residency also lets us work out correctly how the beneficiary income should be taxed. Include all beneficiary income allocated to each non- resident beneficiary in Boxes 27D, 27E, 27F, 27G and 27H. Remember, the combined totals at Boxes 27I, less any taxable distributions from foreign trusts included at Box 27H must reconcile with the total of Box 21A. Non-resident passive income Non-resident passive income is interest, dividends and royalties for the supply of scientific, technical, industrial or commercial knowledge. These types of income are subject to non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) if the income has a New Zealand source. ird.govt.nz 56 This tax is deducted when the non-resident passive income is paid or credited to a non-resident beneficiary. The rates and methods of calculating the tax on a non-resident beneficiary’s share of income differ according to the type of income derived and the country the beneficiary is resident in. Include all income derived by each non-resident beneficiary in Boxes 27D, 27E, 27F, 27G and 27H. Paying NRWT When paying non-resident passive income to a non-resident beneficiary, the trust must complete certain forms and pay N RW T. If you need more help, see our NRWT - payer’s guide - IR291. When calculating the amount of income liable for income tax at the ordinary rates, do not include non-resident passive income or any overseas income in the taxable income figure in Box 27I for non-resident beneficiaries. Question 27A Beneficiary does not have a tax identification number (TIN) Tick one of these boxes to indicate why the beneficiary does not have a tax identification number. Question 27B Beneficiary’s IRD number Enter the beneficiary’s IRD number. If the beneficiary does not have an IRD number because, for example, they are a minor with no assessable income, tick the box at 27A to indicate “TIN not required in jurisdiction” and leave the field blank. If the beneficiary does not have an IRD number because they are not resident in NZ then leave this field blank and provide a TIN in box 27C. If you do not have the beneficiary’s IRD number contact the beneficiary. Due to our confidentiality obligations under section 18 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 we cannot provide it to you. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE57 Question 27C Beneficiary’s TIN If the beneficiary is not a tax resident in New Zealand, enter the beneficiary’s tax identification number from the tax jurisdiction they are resident in. If the beneficiary is not required to hold a TIN in that jurisdiction, or the jurisdiction does not issue TINS, tick one of the boxes at question 27A and leave this field blank. Questions 27D to 27T: Beneficiary income and calculation of tax, excluding minor beneficiaries See Question 21A on pages 48 to 49 for the definition of beneficiary income. Complete boxes 27D to 27K to record any taxable income allocations made to the beneficiary. Complete boxes 27L to 27T to allocate tax credits and calculate tax payable. Question 27D New Zealand interest If the allocation of beneficiary income includes any New Zealand interest, write the amount in Box 27D. Question 27E New Zealand dividends If the allocation of beneficiary income includes any New Zealand dividends, write the amount in Box 27E. Question 27F Māori authority distributions If the allocation of beneficiary income includes any Māori authority distributions, write the amount in Box 27F. Question 27G Overseas income If the allocation of beneficiary income includes any overseas income, write the amount in Box 27G. ird.govt.nz 58 Question 27H Other income and taxable distributions from a foreign trust Add the remainder of any allocated beneficiary income to any taxable distributions from a foreign trust and write the total in Box 27H. Question 27I Beneficiary income from the estate or trust Add up boxes 27D to 27H and write the total in Box 27I. Question 27J Paying the tax on beneficiary income, excluding minor beneficiaries The trustee must pay tax on behalf of the beneficiary for all income allocated to the beneficiary. However, the trustee and the beneficiary can agree not to have tax deducted from trust/estate income before the beneficiary receives it. This might be done where the beneficiary has losses available to offset income. Note The trustees will be liable if the beneficiary defaults on payment of the tax obligations on trust income. Tick ‘Yes’ if the estate or trust is paying the tax on behalf of beneficiaries, then complete all boxes 27D to 27T. ‘Yes’ means the trust/estate will retain any excess tax credits (except overseas credits and Imputation credits) for the trust/estate. The beneficiary must then show the gross income allocated to them as trust income and can only claim the amount of tax paid by the trust at key point 27L, in the key point for Tax Paid by Trustees of their own income tax return. Tick ‘No’ if the estate or trust is not paying the tax on behalf of beneficiaries. Then complete boxes 27D to 27K, and boxes 27M, 27O and 27Q only. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE59 Question 27K Taxable distributions by non-complying trust Show taxable distributions to each beneficiary in Box 27K and the tax in Box 27S. Taxable distributions by a non- complying trust are taxable to the beneficiary at a flat rate of 45 cents in the dollar. Question 27L Calculation of tax Do not fill out Box 27L if you ticked “No” in Box 27J. If the estate or trust is paying tax on behalf of the beneficiaries first calculate tax on the total taxable income of each beneficiary, including other income not received from the estate or trust, using the rates below. Then determine the portion of tax applicable to just beneficiary income (see Trusts and estates income tax rules - IR288 and “Tax on beneficiary income”). Income to $14,000 10.5% $14,001 - $48,000 17.5% $48,001 - $70,000 30.0% $70,001 - $180,000 33.0% $180,001 and over 39% Question 27M Beneficiary’s share of overseas tax paid Allocate any tax paid overseas to beneficiaries on the same basis as the allocation of income. Minor beneficiaries’ share of overseas tax is to be offset against tax payable on trustee income. A New Zealand resident who receives a taxable distribution is not allowed a tax credit in relation to any income tax paid unless the tax is the same as non-resident withholding tax (NRWT). The amount of any credit is equal to: taxable income ×foreign tax paid total distribution ird.govt.nz 60 Question 27N Calculation Do not fill out Box 27N if you ticked “No” in Box 26J. Subtract Box 27M from Box 27L. If the overseas tax paid (Box 27M) allocated to a beneficiary is greater than the tax payable in Box 27L, print 0.00 at Box 27N. Question 27O Beneficiary’s share of dividend imputation credits If dividends have been allocated to a beneficiary, use the following formula to work out the credits attached to those dividends: a×( b ) c a is the total of all dividend imputation credits attached to all dividends distributed to beneficiaries during the income year b is the total distribution, including capital distributions made to the particular beneficiary during the year c is the total distribution, including capital distributions made to all beneficiaries during the year. Show the beneficiary’s share of imputation credits in Box 27O. Question 27P Calculation Do not fill out Box 27P if you ticked “No” in Box 27J. Subtract Box 27O from Box 27N. If the beneficiary’s share of the imputation credits is larger than their tax payable in Box 27N, the excess credit cannot be refunded to the trust. Write 0.00 in Box 27P. The beneficiary should claim the balance of the unused imputation credits in their own tax return. Minor beneficiaries’ share of dividend imputation credits is to be offset against tax payable on trustee income in Box 28H of the IR6. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE61 Question 27Q Beneficiary’s allocation of RWT and other credits Minor beneficiaries’ allocation of RWT and other credits is to be offset against tax payable on trustee income. Ensure that you include the following amounts in Box 27Q for each beneficiary: • • allocation of RWT (Boxes 9A and 10A) including any RWT credits reallocated under the RWT substitution payment rules • • share of Māori authority credits (Box 11A) • • share of partnership, estate or trust tax credits (Box 12A) • • share of LTC tax credits (Box 14A) • • if income from a property sale is treated as beneficiary income, show their share of any residential land withholding tax credit (Box 18A), and • • share of other income credits (Box 19A). Note Do not include any amounts already shown in either Boxes 27M or 27O of the IR6B. Questions 27R & 27T Do not fill out 27R or 27T if you ticked ‘No’ in Box 27J. Question 27S Calculate tax on taxable distribution by non-complying trust in 27K at 45 cents in the dollar and print this in Box 27S. Questions 27U to 27AC: Distributions and beneficiary account movements If the trust is required to comply with the NZ Domestic Trust disclosure rules (see question 33 to see if you need to comply) you must disclose the details of any beneficiary who has received a distribution from the trust during the year, refer to page 11 of the guide to read more about distributions. Complete boxes 27V to 27AA to record distributions made, and boxes 27U, 27AB and 27AC to record beneficiary account movements. ird.govt.nz 62 Question 27U: Opening balance Enter the opening balance of any amount owing to the beneficiary from distributions made in prior years that have not been withdrawn or enjoyed by the beneficiary. Question 27V: Accounting income and other distributions Enter the total accounting income distributed to the beneficiary for the year. This may be different from the total income allocated at questions 27D to 27H because: • • Taxable income allocations can include amounts allocated within 6-months of the end of the tax year; • • Taxable income may be calculated using different rules from accounting income, such as the FIF or PIE rules. Include any other distributions that are not captured in questions 27W, 27X, 27Y and 27Z. An example of a distribution not captured below is where a beneficiary provides assets or services to a trust and receives higher than market value in return. Question 27W: Distribution of trust corpus Enter the total amount of trust corpus distributed to the beneficiary during the year. Trust corpus reflects amounts of any settlements made on the trust (less any distributions made). Question 27X: Distribution of trust capital Enter the total amount of trust capital distributed to the beneficiary during the year. Trust capital reflects tax paid profits and realised capital gains of the trust. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE63 Question 27Y: Distribution arising when property is used by a beneficiary for less than market value If a beneficiary enjoys the use of trust property for less than market value this is a distribution. If the cost of providing this to the beneficiary is NIL you can record zero at question 27Y, as long as this corresponds with the way it has been treated in the trust’s financial statements. Alternatively you can use a fair market value. Example The trust owns a holiday home at the beach, all beneficiaries have free use of the property at any time. Each time a beneficiary uses the property they are receiving a distribution from the trust. Provided the trust does not incur any holding costs on the property then the amount of the distribution can be recorded as nil. Question 27Z: Distribution of trust assets (other than cash) Record the value of any trust assets (excluding cash) distributed to the beneficiary during the year. The amount of the distribution should align with the asset value recorded in the financial statements of the trust, which may reflect historical cost, tax book value or market value. Question 27AA: Distribution arising from forgiveness of debt Enter the amount of any debt owing by the beneficiary that has been forgiven by the trust during the year. ird.govt.nz 64 Question 27AB: Withdrawals and amounts enjoyed during the year Record the total of: • • the value of assets used for less than market value (27Y) • • assets withdrawn (27Z) • • debt forgiven (27AA) and • • any cash withdrawals made by the beneficiary during the year Question 27AC: Closing balance Record the closing balance of amounts owed to the beneficiary at the end of the year. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE65 Trustee income and calculation of tax Question 28A Calculation of taxable income If the result is negative, the amount will be taken into account in the loss carried forward to the following year. Question 28B Calculation of tax and tax on taxable distributions If the trust has received a taxable distribution and tax has not been paid, calculate tax at 33 cents in the dollar and add it to the total. Question 28C Credit for tax paid overseas The amount of the credit for tax paid overseas on trustee income is limited to the amount of New Zealand tax on that income. Remember to attach evidence of payment to page 3 of your return. Question 28E Dividend imputation credits If the trustee's share of the imputation credit exceeds the tax on trustee income at Box 28D, the excess credit cannot be refunded. Write 0.00 in Box 28F. The excess credit is converted to a net loss to carry forward to the following year. To calculate the net loss to carry forward to 2023, use the worksheet on page 66. We'll send you a notice confirming the amount of loss to carry forward. ird.govt.nz 66 Example In this example the net loss to carry forward to the income year ending 31 March 2023 is $151.00 in Box 4. Trustee's share of imputation credits from Box 28E of the return. 1 350 00 Tax on trustee income from Box 28D of the return. 2 300 00 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1. Print your answer here. 3 50 00 Divide Box 3 by 0.33 (33%). Print your answer here. 4 (151 00) Worksheet Trustee's share of imputation credits from Box 28E of the return. 1 Tax on trustee income from Box 28D of the return. 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1. Print your answer here. 3 Divide Box 3 by 0.33 (33%). Print your answer here. 4 The amount in Box 4 is the net loss to carry forward to 2023. Question 28G Trustee's share of RWT and other credits The following amounts should be added together and printed in Box 28G: • • the trustee's allocation of RWT (Boxes 9A and 10A) • • the trustee's share of Māori authority credits (Box 11A) • • the trustee's share of partnership, estate or trust tax credits (Box 12A) • • the trustee's share of LTC tax credits (Box 14A) • • the total from Box 19A, and • • the trustee's share of any RLWT credit (Box 18A). Do not include any amounts already shown in either Boxes 27M or 27O of the IR6B. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE67 Question 30 Refunds and/or transfers Please be careful to copy the amount from Box 29E to Box 30 correctly. Direct credit If you choose direct credit, you get your refund faster and you can withdraw your money as soon as it's credited because there's no clearance time. We pay any refund direct into your New Zealand bank account or other deposit account, for example a building society account, as soon as we've processed your return. Make sure your correct account number is printed at Question 6 on the front page of your return. Question 30A Overpaid provisional tax If you’ve made payments towards your 2023 provisional tax and, after completing this return, find you have less or no provisional tax to pay, the overpayment can be included in the amount we refund or transfer. Attach a separate note to your return to request this. Question 30B Transferring a refund to pay provisional tax If you're entitled to a refund you can transfer all or part of it to your 2023 provisional tax. If you want to do this print the amount of the transfer in Box 30A. Questions 30C to 30D Transfers to another taxpayer's income tax account If you'd like your refund transferred to another account you'll need to tell us what date you'd like it transferred. The date you choose depends on what tax has been overpaid and whose account you want the credit transferred to. Different rules apply if the other taxpayer is associated to you. ird.govt.nz 68 Associated taxpayers When transferring overpaid tax, associated taxpayers are: • • a company you're a shareholder-employee in • • a partner in the same partnership • • a relative (for example child, parent, spouse, or partner), or • • a trustee of a family trust you're a beneficiary of. You can ask for your credit to be transferred at any date as long as it's not before the relevant date shown below. Tick "Yes" or "No" at Box 30B to indicate whether the other taxpayer is associated and write their name in the boxes provided. Write the IRD number of the other taxpayer at Box 30C. Write the amount you wish to transfer at Box 30D. Transfer dates For refunds transferred to your account or an associated taxpayers account: • • If the credit is from excess tax deducted (for example PAYE deducted), it's the day after your balance date (or 1 April if your balance date is before 31 March). • • If the credit is from overpaid provisional tax, it's the day you overpaid it. Note Special rules apply if the return period has had tax pooling refunds transferred in. For credit transferred to a non-associated person's account, it's the later of the day you requested the transfer, or the day after you complete your return. Future transfer dates If you'd like your credit transferred at a date in the future, attach a note to the front of your return with details of: • • the amount you want transferred • • the account you want it transferred to, and if it's the account of the associated person, and • • the date you'd like it transferred. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE69 If you do not tell us the date you'd like your credit transferred, we'll transfer it at a date we think gives you the greatest advantage. Contact us if you'd like to change the transfer date and tell us if this transfer is to cover a debt. For more information on transfers, read Tax Information Bulletin Vol 14, No 11 (November 2002). Refunds of less than $1 If your refund is less than $1 it will be carried forward to your next tax assessment. We'll offset it against any amount you may owe us or add it to any refund. If you do not want it carried forward, please contact us. Question 31 Initial provisional tax liability If this is the first year the estate or trust started to derive gross income from a taxable activity, print the start date in Box 31. Provisional tax is not payable if the residual income tax (RIT) for the previous year was $5,000 or less. Most new businesses do not pay provisional tax in their first year of operation because there's no RIT from the previous year to base the calculation on. However, a special rule requires you to pay interest if you have an initial provisional tax liability. The estate or trust has an initial provisional tax liability if: • • it starts to derive gross income from a taxable activity, and • • it had not derived income from a taxable activity within the preceding 4 years, or • • you have RIT of $60,000 or more in the current year. The interest cost can be reduced or eliminated by making voluntary provisional tax payments on the instalment due dates. ird.govt.nz 70 Interest rules for taxpayers with an initial provisional tax liability Taxpayers with an initial provisional tax liability may be charged interest from the first, second or third instalment date. The instalment date that interest applies from is determined by the taxable activity's start date. For estates and trusts whose balance date is 31 March, the start date for interest will be: • • 29 August, if the taxable activity started before 30 July of the same year • • 16 January, if the taxable activity started between 31 July and 16 December of the previous year, or • • 8 May, if the taxable activity started on or after 17 December of the previous year. An estate or trust with a balance date other than 31 March generally pays provisional tax on the 28th day of the 5th, 9th and 13th months after the balance date, unless completing six-monthly GST returns. If you need help to work out whether the estate or trust has an initial provisional tax liability, read our guide Provisional tax - IR289. Question 32 2023 provisional tax 2023 provisional tax is charged for income the estate or trust will earn in the 2023 income year. It is payable in 2, 3 or 6 equal instalments. There are 3 options for paying provisional tax - standard, estimation and ratio. If the estate or trust's 2022 RIT is: • • $5,000 or less it does not have to pay provisional tax, although it can make voluntary payments • • more than $5,000 but expected to be $5,000 or less for 2023, it may estimate 2023 provisional tax at nil (read "Estimation option" on page 71), or • • more than $5,000 and expected to be more than $5,000 for 2022, it must pay 2023 provisional tax. If you anticipate your RIT will exceed $5,000 for the 2022 year, see "Interest" on page 73. You may be liable for interest from your first provisional tax instalment date. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE71 Which option to use Estates or trusts can use either the standard or estimation options to pay their provisional tax. If they're registered for GST they may also be able to use the ratio option. Standard option Using the standard option, the estate or trust's 2023 provisional tax will be equal to its 2022 RIT plus 5%. If you use this option enter S in Box 32A on the return and the amount of 2023 provisional tax in Box 32B. • • If the estate or trust's 2022 return has not been completed by the first instalment date of 2023 provisional tax, the provisional tax instalments payable is based on 2021 RIT plus 10% (divided by 3 or 2, depending on how many instalments are payable). Estimation option Estates or trusts can estimate their 2023 provisional tax. Trustees must include distributions to minor beneficiaries in their estimate. They can re-estimate any number of times up to and including their final instalment due date. If the estate or trust's 2023 RIT is expected to be less than its 2022 RIT, estimating may prevent the estate or trust from paying more tax than it has to. Note An estimate must be "fair and reasonable" at each instalment it applies to. If you use this option, see page 73 on "Not taking reasonable care penalty" and "Interest". If you estimate your provisional tax, your instalments should be one-third of your estimation. Use the worksheet on page 72 to calculate provisional tax using the estimation option. If you use this option enter E in Box 32A and the amount of 2023 provisional tax in Box 32B. Estimating provisional tax on beneficiary income When working out the tax on estimated beneficiary income, calculate the tax separately for each beneficiary, including estimated tax credits where applicable. The table on the following page shows the 2023 individual tax rates for provisional tax. ird.govt.nz 72 2023 annual tax rates income range Ta x r a t e Income to $14,00010.5% $14,001 - $48,00017.5% $48,001 - $70,00030.0% $70,001 - $180,00033.0% $180,001 and over39.0% When using these tax rates to calculate 2023 provisional tax, you'll also need to estimate the tax credits the beneficiary may be entitled to. Use this worksheet to calculate the estate or trust's 2023 provisional tax using the estimation option. Print the estate or trust's estimated 2023 income to be allocated in Box 1. 1 Estimated allocation of income: •• Beneficiary income 2 •• Trustee income 3 Work out the tax on the amount in Box 2, using the rates above. Print your answer in Box 4. 4 Multiply the amount in Box 3 by 0.33 (33%). Print your answer in Box 5. 5 If the estate or trust is non- complying, multiply the estimated taxable distributions, if any, by 0.45 (45%). Print your answer in Box 6. 6 Add Boxes 4, 5 and 6. Print your answer in Box 7. 7 Print the estimated 2023 credits (trustees' share only) in Box 8. 8 Subtract Box 8 from Box 7. Print your answer in Box 9. 9 Box 9 is the estate or trust's 2023 provisional tax. Copy it to Box 32B of the return and print E in Box 32A. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE73 Divide the amount in Box 9 by three to get the amount to pay for each instalment. If you need more help read our guide Provisional tax - IR289. Ratio option If the trust is GST registered you may qualify to use the ratio option to calculate your provisional tax. Only enter R at Box 32A if you've already elected to use the ratio option. Your application to use the ratio option must be made by phone or in writing before the beginning of the income year you want to use it in. If you've already elected to use the ratio option and want to continue using it, enter R at Box 32A. More information about the ratio option is in our guide Provisional tax - IR289. Not taking reasonable care penalty When you estimate the estate or trust's 2023 provisional tax, your estimate must be fair and reasonable. If the 2023 RIT is greater than the provisional tax paid, you may be liable for a not taking reasonable care penalty of 20% of the underpaid provisional tax. Interest If the estate or trust has paid too much provisional tax on trustee income we may pay interest, or if it has not paid enough, we may charge interest. Interest for estates or trusts is calculated only on the tax payable on trustee income. Interest is not calculated if all income is distributed to the beneficiaries. Interest the estate or trust pays is generally tax-deductible, while interest we pay is taxable income. For more information about interest and penalties read our guide Penalties and interest - IR240. If we pay interest, it continues to accrue until the date we refund the overpaid tax, or apply it to another liability. ird.govt.nz 74 Election to be a provisional tax payer An estate or trust is a provisional tax payer for the 2023 year if its RIT for 2022 is more than $5,000. If the 2022 RIT is $5,000 or less, and • • the estate or trust made provisional tax payments for that tax year, and • • payments were made under the estimation method (other than using the estimation method for its final instalment only), It may elect to be a provisional tax payer for 2023. This may affect the interest it may be entitled to for that year. To elect to be a provisional tax payer for the 2023 year, attach a letter to the front of the return. Change in balance date There are special rules about when provisional tax is due and how interest is calculated if there has been a change in balance date. Read our Provisional tax - IR289 guide for more information. Tax pooling Tax pooling allows taxpayers to pool provisional tax payments, offsetting underpayments by overpayments within the same pool. This reduces their possible exposure to late payment penalties and use-of-money interest. The pooling arrangement is made through a commercial intermediary, who arranges for participating taxpayers to be charged or compensated for the offset. For more information about tax pooling, including a list of intermediaries, go to ird.govt.nz/tax-pooling ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE75 Payment dates 2023 provisional tax Generally, an estate or trust with a 31 March balance date pays provisional tax by the following due dates: • • First instalment 28 August 2022 • • Second instalment 15 January 2023 • • Third instalment 7 May 2023 An estate or trust with a balance date other than 31 March pays provisional tax on the 28th day of the 5th, 9th and 13th months after the balance date. Where payments would otherwise be due on 28 December or 28 April the due date is extended to 15 January or 7 May. These dates will alter if: • • the estate or trust is registered for GST, and • • the GST filing frequency is six-monthly, or • • provisional tax is paid by the ratio option. If either of these situations apply to you, read our guide Provisional tax - IR289. 2022 end-of-year income tax Estates or trusts that have an agent and an extension of time may have until 7 April 2023 to pay their tax. If you think this applies to you contact your agent for more information. Otherwise, an estate or trust with a balance date between 1 March and 30 September must pay its end-of-year income tax and any interest by 7 February 2023. An estate or trust with a balance date between 1 October and 28 February must pay its end-of-year income tax by the 7th day of the month before the following year's balance date. ird.govt.nz 76 Question 33 NZ Domestic Trust disclosure rules From the 2022 tax year onwards trusts are required to make additional disclosures with their annual returns. Tick box 33 if you answer yes to any of the below as your trust does not need to comply with the NZ Domestic Trust disclosure rules as the trust is: • • not active or has not derived any assessable income • • a foreign trust • • a registered charity • • eligible to be a Māori Authority • • a widely-held superannuation fund • • an exempt employee share scheme • • a debt funding special purpose vehicle • • an energy lines trust.

In this guide we use "trustee" or "you" to refer to the person or persons administering an estate or trust. The word trust also refers to estates unless we've stated otherwise. This guide provides general information about how to complete the IR6 return. There are references throughout the guide to our other publications which may help you. If you need more help please contact us or a tax advisor.

Income for deceased customers Reportable income received up to 28 days following a person’s death can either be included in the: • • Individual tax return – IR3 return to date of death, or • • Estate income tax return – IR6. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE7 Beneficiary’s share of dividend imputation credit If the amount of a beneficiary’s imputation credit allowed is limited, then the amount of the imputation credit included in the gross dividend as part of beneficiary’s assessable income should be a corresponding amount and included in the beneficiary’s income tax return. From 1 April 2021 New disclosure requirements for NZ Domestic Trusts are effective for the income year beginning 1 April 2021 and subsequent income years. Refer to the checklist at Question 33 to see if your trust needs to comply. If you are required to comply you will need to provide additional disclosures with your 2023 return, including: • • The details of any person who is a settlor of the trust. • • Complete an IR6S to provide the details of any person who is a settlor of the trust and attach it to your return. • • The nature and amount of any settlement made on the trust during the year. Complete an IR6S to record any settlements made on the trust during the year and attach it to your return. • • The details of any person who received a distribution from the trust during the year, and information about the amount and nature of the distribution. Complete an IR6B for any beneficiary who received a distribution during the year and attach it to your return. • • The details of any person who has the power to appoint or dismiss a trustee, add or remove a beneficiary, or amend the trust deed. Log into myIR to provide us this information, or complete an IR6P and attach it to your return. ird.govt.nz 8 IR6S: Settlements & settlors If you are required to comply with the new NZ Domestic Trust disclosure rules you will need to supply additional information with your 2023 income tax return: • • The details of any person who has made a settlement on the trust (at any point in time) if those details have not already been supplied. • • The nature and amount of any settlement made during the year, and the details of the person who made the settlement (the settlor). A settlor of the trust can include any person who at any time: • • transfers value -to a trust, or -for the benefit of the trust, or -on terms of the trust These are called settlements. A settlement is any action that makes a person a settlor of a trust and includes any of the following: • • disposal of any property to the trust for less than market value • • property or funds made available to the trust for less than market value • • services provided to the trust for less than market value, unless those services are incidental to the operation of the trust • • any property acquired from the trust or any service from the trustee for greater than market value. A settlement can also occur as a result of a transaction or series of transactions entered by a person that has the effect of making that person a settlor. In most cases settlements must be valued at market value, unless the settlement is something that cannot be later distributed to a beneficiary, in which case it must be valued at NIL. For example, • • If a person provides land and buildings or other assets to a trust they must be valued at market value; ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE9 • • If a person provides cash to a trust, it must be valued at market value (which is the face value of the currency, or NZ equivalent face value of foreign currency); • • If a person provides services to a trust those services have been consumed by the trust and can’t later be distributed so they must be valued at NIL; • • If a person is owed money by a trust and chooses not to charge interest, the non-charging of interest is a transfer of value and therefore a settlement, but the trust has not gained anything that it can later distribute to a beneficiary so the settlement must be valued at NIL. The value must be determined at the time the settlement is made. The total value of all settlements forms the corpus of the trust. The minimum details you must supply on the IR6S: • • The name of the settlor • • The date of birth or commencement date of the settlor • • The jurisdiction of tax residency of the settlor • • The tax identification number (TIN) of the settlor: -if they are not required to hold an IRD number in NZ or a TIN in another jurisdiction, or the jurisdiction doesn’t issue TINs tick the relevant box at question 1, leave boxes 2 and 3 blank; -if they are a NZ resident then enter their NZ IRD number in box 2; -if they are not a NZ resident enter their TIN in box 3; -if you do not hold the IRD number or TIN of the settlor: If a settlement was made by this settlor in the current year, then you must ask them to provide it to you If a settlement was not made by this settlor recently and you cannot reasonably obtain their IRD# or TIN (e.g. because they are deceased and the settlement was >7 years ago), leave boxes 2 and 3 blank. • • No settlement in the current year -If you are completing the IR6S in order to provide information about past settlors (who have not made a settlement this year) tick the box at question 4 ird.govt.nz 10 • • Settlement/s in the current year that are required to be valued at market value -Cash: if the settlor has provided one or more settlements of money during the year add them together and enter the amount at box 5 -Shares/ownership interests: if the settlor has provided one or more settlements of shares/ ownership interests during the year add them together and enter the amount at box 6 -Financial arrangements: if the settlor has provided one or more settlements of financial arrangements during the year add them together and enter the amount at box 7 -Services: if the settlor has provided one or more settlements of services during the year add them together and enter the amount at box 8 -Land: if the settlor has provided one or more settlements of land during the year add them together and enter the amount at box 9 -Buildings: if the settlor has provided one or more settlements of buildings during the year add them together and enter the amount at box 10 -Other: if the settlor has provided one or more settlements of any other type during the year add them together and enter the amount at box 11, enter a description of the nature of the settlement at box 12, if there are multiple ‘other’ settlements describe the one/s of the highest value. • • Settlement/s in the current year that are required to be valued at NIL -If a settlement has been made but the amount is required to be valued at nil, tick box 13. Complete as many IR6S forms as you need to provide all of the required details and staple these to the back page of your return. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE11 IR6P: Powers of appointment If you are required to comply with the new NZ Domestic Trust disclosure rules you will need to supply additional information with your 2023 income tax return: • • The details of any person who has the power to appoint or dismiss a trustee, add or remove a beneficiary, or amend the trust deed (the appointer). You only need to tell us about people who have these powers in the current year, and then let us know in future if they cease to hold them. You can also keep these details up to date in myIR. The minimum details you must supply on the IR6P: • • The name of the appointer • • The date of birth or commencement date of the appointer • • The jurisdiction of tax residency of the appointer • • The tax identification number of the appointer: -if they are not required to hold an IRD number in NZ or a TIN in another jurisdiction, or the jurisdiction doesn’t issue TINs tick the relevant box at question 1, leave boxes 2 and 3 blank; -if they are a NZ resident then enter their NZ IRD number in box 2; -if they are not a NZ resident enter their TIN in box 3; -if you do not hold the IRD number or TIN of the appointer you must ask them to provide it to you • • Enter date that the appointer was given this power in box 4. If the date is unknown (e.g. because it was many years ago and records are not available), enter a date that reflects a reasonable estimate. • • Enter the date that the appointer ceased to hold this power at box 5, if they currently hold these powers leave this field blank. ird.govt.nz 12 IR6B: Beneficiaries & distributions If you are required to comply with the new NZ Domestic Trust disclosure rules you will need to supply additional information with your 2023 income tax return: • • The details of any beneficiary who has received a distribution from the trust during the year, and the nature and amount of that distribution. This information should be included on the IR6B. Refer to question 27 for more information about how to complete the IR6B. Complete as many IR6Bs as you need to provide all the required details and staple them to your return. Distributions In addition to allocating beneficiary income, see page 13 for allocations, a trustee can make other distributions to beneficiaries. A distribution can include: • • tax-paid profits (trustee income or beneficiary income) • • capital gains of the trust • • corpus of the trust (the value of settlements made on the trust) • • the physical and intangible assets of the trust passing to beneficiaries • • the beneficiary using trust property for less than market value • • the beneficiary supplying goods or services to the trust and receiving more than market value in return (including charging a higher than market interest rate on loans to the trust) • • (for a foreign trust) non-taxed profits such as foreign sourced income. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE13 The tax position of a distribution from a trust depends on the type of trust making the distribution and the residency of the beneficiary. See pages 18 to 20 of this guide. Generally, a distribution, other than beneficiary income, to a New Zealand resident beneficiary from: • • a complying trust is not taxable • • a foreign trust is taxable, to the extent it is not part of the corpus or capital gains, or • • a non-complying trust is taxable at 45 cents in the dollar, to the extent it is not part of the corpus. How income of an estate or trust is taxed in general In general, income of an estate or trust will be subject to income tax in New Zealand if it has a source in New Zealand regardless of the residency of the trustee. The trustee is also liable for New Zealand income tax on income derived outside New Zealand where any settlor of the trust is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year, or if the estate has a New Zealand trustee and the deceased was resident in New Zealand. Allocations Income of a trust is either trustee or beneficiary income. The trustee can allocate income as beneficiary income, provided the income either: • • vests absolutely in the beneficiary in the income year, or • • is paid or applied for the benefit of the beneficiary during that income year or within a specified period from the end of the income year. For more information see Question 21A on page 49. Trust income allocated as beneficiary income is taxable income, except as covered below under the special rules for allocations to minor beneficiaries. Allocations of beneficiary income to a minor A minor is defined as a New Zealand resident under the age of 16 years on the balance date of the trust. ird.govt.nz 14 Allocations of beneficiary income that the minor beneficiary rule applies to are treated as trustee income. This means they are: • • taxed at 33% • • included in the trustee's tax calculation in the IR6 return, and • • included in the trustees' provisional tax calculations. As these amounts are distributions of the trust, those trusts that are required to comply with the NZ Domestic Trust disclosure rules will still need to complete an IR6B for the minor beneficiary to disclose the amount of the distribution. Refer to Question 33 of the guide to see if your trust needs to comply. The minor beneficiary should not include this income in their Individual income tax return - IR3. Exceptions to the minor beneficiary rule The following exceptions allow income allocated to a minor beneficiary to be treated as beneficiary income if the income: • • is derived by a minor for whom a child disability allowance is paid under the Social Security Act 2018 • • is derived directly from either a group investment fund, the Māori trustee or a Māori authority, or • • the amount allocated to the minor from the trust is $1,000 or less in an income year. Note If the $1,000 threshold is exceeded, the total income allocated to the minor beneficiary is taxed as trustee income. For example, if a minor beneficiary is allocated $1,200, the total amount of $1,200 is taxed at 33%. The general anti-avoidance rule may apply if a person establishes multiple trusts to increase the number of exemptions. See Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 19, No 4 (May 2007) for further information. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE15 There are further exceptions to the minor beneficiary rule that relate to the nature of the settlements on the trust. For more information, please see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 19, No 4 (May 2007) Return due date If the estate or trust has a 31 March balance date, you have until 7 July 2023 to send in the return, unless you have been granted an extension of time. Contact us if you're not sure of the filing date. If the estate or trust is the client of an agent, it may have until 31 March 2024 to complete the return. If this applies, contact your agent. International obligations You may also need to provide information about a trust to comply with the following international obligations. The Common Reporting Standard (CRS) For more information see: • • IR Guidance on the CRS - IR1048 section 11 • • CRS: Is the Trust a Reporting Financial Institution - IR1052 • • Family Trust obligations under the CRS - IR1053 • • ird.govt.nz/crs Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) For more information see: • • FATCA Trusts Guidance - IR1087 • • FATCA status of NZ trusts that are not US person - IR1086 • • ird.govt.nz/fatca ird.govt.nz 16 Questions Questions 1 to 6 The information in Questions 1 to 6 of the return helps us to be sure that any correspondence we send goes to the right person at the right address. Fill in these questions only if the correct information is not printed on the return. Question 1 IRD number If the estate or trust does not have an IRD number, complete an IRD number application - resident non-individual - IR596 and send it in with the return. Question 2 Name of estate or trust If the estate or trust has changed its name since the last time a return was completed, please provide proof of the change so we can update our records, for example trustee resolution. Questions 3 and 4 Postal address and phone number If you have a new postal address, write the details at Question 3. If your new postal address is a PO Box number, show your box lobby if you have one. If you are unsure of your box lobby please contact New Zealand Post. If the estate or trust uses its tax preparer's postal address, leave this panel blank. The tax preparer will let us know if they change their address. We ask for your daytime phone number at Question 4 in case we need to call you with questions about the return. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE17 Question 5 Business industry classification (BIC) code We're required to supply the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) with a code for your business or trading activity, for levy classification and calculation. If your BIC code is not pre-printed on the return or is different from the pre-printed one, enter the correct code. To work out your main business or trading activity and its code, go to businessdescription.co.nz or call ACC on 0800 222 776. It's important that you choose the code which most accurately reflects your main business or trading activity. Note Please provide the code only. Do not provide a description. Question 6 Bank account number The fastest and safest way to get any refund is to have it direct credited to your New Zealand bank account or other deposit account, for example a building society account. If your bank account number is not preprinted on the return form, include it at Question 6. If your suffix has only 2 digits, enter them in the first 2 squares of the suffix box. Question 7A Has the estate or trust ceased? If the estate or trust has ceased, include accounts showing the distribution of all assets and liabilities to the date the estate or trust was finalised. If the estate or trust is registered for GST or as an employer, you'll need to complete a Business cessation - IR315 form to finalise your records. ird.govt.nz 18 Question 7B Nil trust or estate returns If the trust, estate or testamentary trust (trust created by a person under their will) receives any income the trustee must complete a return and meet certain reporting obligations. However, if the income is below set thresholds and certain criteria are met, they can be excused from filing returns by completing the Non-active trust declaration – IR633. If the trust subsequently becomes active eg derives income in a future year, the trust must send in a return. Non active return filing and reporting thresholds and criteria are; Trust and Estates • • Reportable income of $1,000 or less, • • No deductions, • • Not involved in any transactions that give income to a related person or entity, • • No transactions that give a benefit subject to FBT to a current or former employee. Costs and payments that do not affect your trust’s non-active status: • • Reasonable fees for administering the trust • • Bank charges or minimal administrative costs that are $1,500 or less for the year • • Insurance, rates, interest, and other costs related to living in a house owned by the trust and incurred by the beneficiaries of the trust. Testamentary Trust • • Reportable income of $5,000 or less • • Non-reportable income of up to $1,000 with deductions that would reduce the net income to below $200. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE19 Question 8 Types of trusts The type of trust determines the way certain distributions are taxed in the hands of beneficiaries. There are 3 types of estates or trusts for income tax purposes: • • complying • • foreign, and • • non-complying. Complying trust In general, a complying trust is one that has been taxed in New Zealand on all its trustee income since the date it began and the trustee has met all its tax obligations. Complying trusts include: • • trusts settled by New Zealand residents with New Zealand trustees and New Zealand beneficiaries • • estates of people who were New Zealand residents when they died, and • • foreign trusts that have elected to become complying trusts. The trust can still be a complying trust if the trustee was not liable for New Zealand income tax because: • • the trust earned no income • • the income was exempt, or • • the trust was in a loss situation. Foreign trust A foreign trust is one where no settlor of the trust has been resident in New Zealand since 17 December 1987, or the date the trust was first settled, whichever is later, and on the date of distribution. Non-complying trust A trust that is not a complying trust or a foreign trust is a non-complying trust. Non-complying trusts include: • • trusts with a New Zealand-resident settlor, but non- resident trustees, that have not been liable for or have not paid New Zealand income tax on all trustee income since first being settled ird.govt.nz 20 • • foreign trusts where the settlor has become a New Zealand resident and an election has not been made to be a complying trust, and • • trusts where all the beneficiaries are non-residents and all the income is passive income such as interest, dividends, and royalties. Election to change category of trust for tax purposes New residents or former residents who have settled a trust before coming to New Zealand may elect to pay New Zealand tax on future trustee income. Making this election will mean the trust becomes a complying trust for income derived on or after the date on which the election is made. An election can be made by a settlor, trustee or beneficiary using an Election to pay income tax on trustee income - IR463 form. If an election is not made the trust will become a non- complying trust. Elections must be made within 12 months of a new resident ceasing to be a transitional resident and within 12 months of the arrival for a former resident. Unit trust A unit trust is treated as a company for tax purposes. If you're preparing a tax return for a unit trust, please complete a Companies income tax return - IR4. Group investment fund If the income is: • • solely from Category B income, an IR6 must be completed • • solely from Category A income, an IR4 must be completed, or • • a combination of both Category A and Category B income, an IR4 and IR44E must be completed. Please read the notes on the IR44E for more information. Superannuation schemes A superannuation scheme that is not registered with the Financial Markets Authority and does not allow investors to contribute will be treated as a trust for tax purposes and must complete an IR6 return. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE21 Income and credits section Income received by a trust retains its character as it passes through the trust. For this reason we ask that you return different types of income in certain boxes. Question 9 New Zealand interest Include interest from all New Zealand sources at Question 9. The interest payer will usually send you an RWT withholding certificate showing the gross interest paid and the amount of RWT deducted. Write the total of all RWT deducted in Box 9A. Add up all the gross interest amounts (before the deduction of any tax) and write the total in Box 9B. Note If expenses are deductible against the interest income (for example commission), claim them at Question 22. Read about expenses on page 51. Do not send us interest statements or IR15 certificates with the return. Keep these in case we ask for them later Interest on broken term deposits If you've broken a term deposit during the year, you may have to account for negative interest. This is interest repaid on a term deposit and may reduce the amount of interest to declare in your return. If the term deposit was broken in full, or it was business related, deduct the negative interest from the gross interest shown on the IR15 or equivalent statement. Deduct the allowable negative interest component, using the worksheet below, before entering the gross amount at Box 9B on your return. In all other cases, the negative interest is deductible in a future income year when the term deposit matures. ird.govt.nz 22 Worksheet Copy your gross interest from your RWT withholding certificate to Box 1. 1 Print any negative interest you've paid in Box 2. 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the answer in Box 3. Copy this amount to Box 9B of your tax return. 3 Interest paid or charged by Inland Revenue If we paid you interest, include it in Box 9B for the income year the trust received the interest. If the trust paid us interest, include it as a deduction in Box 22 of the return for the income year the interest is paid. Interest from overseas If the trust received interest from overseas, convert your overseas interest and tax credits to New Zealand dollars and show the amounts at Question 13. Read the notes about overseas income on pages 27 to 30. Income from financial arrangements The financial arrangement rules generally require income or expenditure from financial arrangements to be spread over the term of the arrangement. Financial arrangements include term deposits, government stock, local authority stock, mortgage bonds, futures contracts and deferred property settlements. Trustees are required to use a spreading method unless they are a cash basis person. A person is a cash basis person if: • • the value of all financial arrangements together is less than $1 million, or • • the value of the income or expenditure from the financial arrangement is less than $100,000, and • • the deferral of income or expenditure using the cash method rather than the actual method is less than $40,000. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE23 A special rule applies for deceased persons. If the deceased person was a cash basis person at the date of death, the concession applies in the year of death and up to 4 succeeding years. Any RWT from a financial arrangement will be deducted on a cash basis. Different rules apply for financial arrangements entered into prior to 20 May 1999. Sale or maturity of financial arrangements Whether or not the exemption from the spreading methods explained earlier applies, when a financial arrangement matures or is sold, remitted, or transferred, a "wash-up" calculation known as a base-price adjustment must be carried out. Cash basis persons can use the Sale or disposal of financial arrangements - IR3K to perform the calculation. This form could be used, for example, to calculate the amount you need to account for if you have broken a term deposit in full. For more information about the financial arrangements rules, please see Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 11, No 6 (July 1999), page 3. Any RWT will be deducted on a cash basis. Question 10 New Zealand dividends Dividends are the part of a company's profits that it passes on to its shareholders. Unit trusts are treated as companies for income tax purposes. Distributions from unit trusts will generally be taxable and are treated as dividends. Note All the trust's cash and taxable bonus issue dividends derived from a qualifying company must be distributed by the trustees as beneficiary income to the beneficiaries who are not trustees or companies that are not qualifying companies. ird.govt.nz 24 Complete Question 10 if you received any New Zealand dividends, including dividends from your local electricity or gas supplier. Do not include a dividend that's a distribution of the trust's capital and is tax free. The company or unit trust that paid you the dividend will send you a dividend statement. Do not send us any dividend statements with the return, keep them in case we ask for them later. Note If expenses are deductible against the dividend income, claim them at Question 22. Credits attached to dividends "Imputation credits" are credits for part of the tax the company has already paid on its profits, which means the dividends are not taxed twice. RWT is deducted from your dividend to bring the total credits withheld up to 33% of the gross dividend. What to show in your return Your dividend statements show the amount: • • you received (net dividend) • • of any imputation credits, and • • of any RWT credits. Add all these amounts together to work out your total gross dividends and enter this in Box 10B. Add up all the imputation credits and print the total in Box 10. Add any dividend RWT credits and print the total in Box 10A. Shares instead of dividends If the trust received shares instead of dividends, include them as income at Question 10B. Write the amount as if you received dividends instead of shares. Dividends from overseas Please read about overseas income on pages 27 to 30 of this guide. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE25 Question 11 Māori authority distributions Māori authorities can make various types of distributions. Fill in Question 11 if you received any taxable Māori authority distributions. The Māori authority that paid you the distribution will send you a Māori authority distribution statement. Credits attached to distributions The Māori authority may attach a credit to the distribution it makes to members. This credit will be classified as a Maori authority credit and is part of the tax the Maori authority has already paid on its profits, so the distributions are not taxed twice. What to show in your return Your Māori authority distribution statement shows the amount of: • • the distribution made to you, including the taxable portion and the non-taxable portion, and • • Māori authority credit. Transfer these amounts, leaving out any non-taxable distributions, to the relevant boxes at Question 11. Non-taxable distribution You do not need to include in the IR6 return any other distributions received from a Māori authority that are not taxable in the hands of a Māori authority member. These amounts are non-taxable distributions and cannot have credits attached. For more information read our Māori authorities guide - IR487. Question 12 Partnership, estate or trust income Partnership If the estate or trust received any income from a partnership, write the details at Question 12. ird.govt.nz 26 Do not include: • • interest and RWT (include these at Question 9) • • any dividends, imputation credits or dividend RWT (include these at Question 10) • • any Māori authority dividends and Māori authority credits (include these at Question 11) • • any overseas income and qualifying tax credits attached (include these at Question 13) or, • • income and expenses from residential property including rental income and net bright-line profit (include these at Question 15). Estate or trust If the estate or trust has received income from a foreign or non-complying trust, complete a Schedule of beneficiary's estate or trust income - IR307 and attach it to the return. Add up all the other income from partnerships, complying and foreign trusts, and write the total in Box 12B. Add up any other tax credits and write the total in Box 12A. Do not include: • • interest and RWT (include these at Question 9) • • any dividends, imputation credits or dividend RWT (include these at Question 10) • • any Māori authority dividends and Māori authority credits (include these at Question 11), or • • any overseas income and qualifying tax credits attached (include these at Question 13). If the estate or trust has received a taxable distribution from a non-complying trust, do not include the amount as income. Calculate tax on the taxable distribution at 45 cents in the dollar and add it to the amount in Box 28B. You can use a loss to reduce the amount of the taxable distribution. Net losses brought forward from an earlier income year and losses incurred in the 2023 income year can be used to reduce the amount. If a loss is used in this way it is no longer available to offset other income. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE27 The reduction is calculated using the following formula: (Tax loss × 0.33) ÷ 0.45 Losses from limited partnerships If the estate or trust is claiming a loss from a limited partnership and you need help working out the amount that can be claimed, go to ird.govt.nz/index/calculators-and-tools Question 13 Overseas income If the trust received overseas income, for example interest or financial arrangements, show this at Question 13. Convert all overseas income and qualifying overseas tax paid to New Zealand dollars. You can do this by: • • using the rates available on ird.govt.nz/managing-my-tax • • contacting the overseas section of a trading bank and asking for the exchange rate for the day you received your overseas income. Include any overseas income and credits which you received from a partnership, look-through company (LTC), estate or trust here. Include gross income before deducting any tax credits at Box 13B. Credit for tax paid overseas will be limited to the amount of New Zealand tax payable on that income. How overseas income of an estate or trust is taxed In New Zealand, overseas income is taxed according to the residency of the settlor. The rules for the 3 most common situations are described over the page. New Zealand resident trustees and income derived outside New Zealand As a general rule, where a trustee is resident in New Zealand, and the trustee derives an amount from outside New Zealand, that income will be income of the trustee. The amount will be exempt income of the trustee if: • • no settlor of the trust except a transitional resident is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year, or ird.govt.nz 28 • • that trust is not a testamentary trust (trust created by a person under their will) or an inter vivos trust (trust created by the settlor during their lifetime) where any settlor of the trust died resident in New Zealand, whether in that income year or otherwise. Non-resident trustees and income derived outside of New Zealand A non-resident trustee is also liable for New Zealand income tax on income derived from outside New Zealand where: • • any settlor is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year, or • • any settlor of an inter vivos or a testamentary trust died while they were resident in New Zealand, and a trustee is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year. Exceptions to the general rule for non-resident trustees and income derived outside New Zealand There are 2 situations in which a non-resident trustee is not liable for income tax on trustee income derived from outside New Zealand. These apply where the trustee is resident outside New Zealand at all times during the income year and either: • • no settlement has been made on the trust since 17 December 1987, or • • the only settlements made on the trust were by settlors who were not resident in New Zealand at the time of settlement and who have not been residents in New Zealand since 17 December 1987. Neither exception applies where an election to pay tax on trustee income has been made by the trustee. These exceptions do not affect the liability for income tax for any settlor of the trust, for example, where the settlor elects to pay tax on trustee income. The trustee income remains liable for income tax for the purpose of determining whether the trust is a complying trust (formerly qualifying trust). ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE29 Overseas dividends If you are a New Zealand resident trustee and at any time during the 2023 income year you held rights such as shares, units or an entitlement to benefit in any foreign company, foreign trust, foreign superannuation scheme, or foreign life insurance policy, you may be required to calculate foreign investment fund (FIF) income or loss on those investments and include this amount in Box 13B. Generally, you will use the fair dividend rate to calculate FIF income. The trustees may also need to complete an additional FIF disclosure form. For more information read the guide to Question 26 on page 55. You will not need to do this if the investment is covered by an exclusion. The main exclusions from an interest in an FIF are: • • investments in certain Australian resident companies listed on approved indices on the Australian stock exchange, that maintain franking accounts. Investments covered in the list are available at ird.govt.nz/fif in the Australian share exemption list - IR871 • • interest in certain Australian units • • limited exemptions for interests in certain venture capital • • limited exemptions for interests in certain venture capital interests that move offshore (for 10 or more income years from the income year in which the company migrates from New Zealand), and • • a 10% or greater interest in a controlled foreign company (CFC). A limited number of trusts are also excluded from the rules if the attributing interests are below $50,000. These are: • • a testamentary trust • • a compensatory trust, or • • where the settlor of the trust is the Accident Compensation Corporation. If the exclusions apply and the trust is under the threshold, include dividends received in Box 13B and any qualifying overseas tax credits in Box 13A. ird.govt.nz 30 Note If your dividend exceeds your FIF income, the amount of imputation credit you can claim is calculated on the basis of your FIF income. If your FIF income exceeds your dividend, you can claim the entire imputation credit attached to the dividend. Any excess imputation credit cannot be carried forward to the next year or converted to a loss. Please note you cannot claim Australian franking credits. For more information about the FIF rules read A guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate - IR461, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 19, No 3 (April 2007) page 28, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 20, No 3 (April 2008) page 110, or go to ird.govt.nz/fif CFC income or loss If at any time during the 2023 income year the trust has attributed CFC income or loss, the trustees or beneficiaries may be required to calculate this in their own income tax returns. A loss from a CFC cannot be used to offset domestic income or be included in domestic losses that are carried forward to the 2024 income year. Generally, these losses can only offset income or future income from CFCs that are resident in the same country as the CFC that incurred the loss. The trustees may also need to complete an additional CFC disclosure form. See Question 26 on page 55. Investments in portfolio investment entities (PIEs) and portfolio investor attributed income/loss If you receive dividends from a PIE that is a listed company and does not use your prescribed investor rate (PIR), you may choose whether to include the dividends in your return. The attributed PIE income/loss is included in the estate or trust's return for the period that includes the end of the PIE's income year. PIEs usually have a 31 March balance date. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE31 The amount of income derived by the estate or trust as a distribution by a PIE is excluded income of the estate or trust other than fully imputed dividends from a PIE that is a listed company and does not use your PIR. More information is available in our guide Information for trustees who invest in PIEs - IR856. Question 14 Look-through company (LTC) income If the estate or trust received any tax credits and/or income from an LTC write the details at Question 14. Do not include any of the following types of income received from an LTC at Question 14: • • interest and RWT (include these at Question 9) • • any dividends, imputation credits, and dividend RWT (include these at Question 10) • • Māori authority distributions and credits (include these at Question 11) • • any overseas income and qualifying tax credits attached (include these at Question 13), or • • income and expenses from residential property including rental income and net bright-line profit (include this at Question 15). The loss limitation rule limits the amount of deductions an LTC owner (shareholder) can claim if the amount exceeds the "owner's basis" (equity) in the LTC. For the 2017-18 and later income years, the loss limitation rule only applies to an LTC which is in a partnership or joint venture which includes another LTC. The estate or trust can now claim the full amount of prior years' non-allowable deductions brought forward this year. This will not apply if the loss limitation rule continues to apply to limit the amount claimable. The LTC will normally supply information about the non- allowable deductions and any other information required to complete your return. ird.govt.nz 32 Example Trust A is an owner of an LTC which is not in a partnership or joint venture that includes another LTC. For the 2022 - 23 income year Trust A has a net loss of $4,000.00 from the LTC. Trust A also has prior years' non-allowable deductions brought forward of $5,000.00. Trust A had no tax credits from the LTC for the year. Trust A's tax return should show the following amounts in the following boxes: • • 14A: $0.00 • • 14B: $4,000.00 - • • 14C: $0.00 • • 14D: $5,000.00 • • 14E: $9,000.00 - What to show on your return Add up all other tax credits received from the LTC and print the total in Box 14A. Add up all LTC income, deduct expenses not already included elsewhere and print in Box 14B. If a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Add up all non-allowable deductions this year and print in Box 14C. There should not be non-allowable deductions this year unless the loss limitation rule applies. Add up all prior year non-allowable deductions claimable this year and print the amount in Box 14D. You'll be able to claim the full amount of non-allowable deductions brought forward from last year if the loss limitation rule no longer applies. If you have an amount in Box 14C, add this to Box 14B and put the total in Box 14E. If you have an amount in Box 14D, subtract this from Box 14B and put the total in Box 14E. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE33 If you do not have any amounts in Box 14C or Box 14D, copy the amount from Box 14B to 14E. Box 14E is your adjusted LTC income. You can find more information about LTCs in the Look- through companies - IR879 guide. Question 15 Income and expenses from residential property This question applies to owners of residential property, including overseas property, that have: • • income subject to the residential property deduction rules • • net income from a bright-line sale • • income in relation to a loan in a foreign currency • • depreciation recovery income from disposed assets • • net income from the taxable disposal of a residential property outside the residential property deduction rules because it is held on revenue account. Residential property deduction rules Most residential rental properties are subject to the residential property deduction rules (also known as the ring-fencing rules). When they apply, your residential rental deductions generally cannot be more than your residential property income. If your deductions are more than your income, the difference must be carried forward to the next year you earn income from your residential property, including income from properties held on revenue account. Any rental income or loss and net income or loss from a taxable disposal is fully excluded from the rules if the property is: • • the main home • • property subject to the mixed-use asset rules (for example, a holiday home rented out part-time and not used for at least 62 days in the income year, or 62 working days in the income year if it’s usually only used on working days), or • • certain employee accommodation. ird.govt.nz 34 For these types of property, any rental income or loss is shown at Box 17B and net income or net loss from a taxable disposal shown at Box 18B. Any rental net loss and net loss from a taxable disposal is partially excluded from the rules if it is for: • • property that will always be taxed on sale, being revenue account property of a person in the business of building, developing or dealing in land, or • • other revenue account property the person has notified us they want the exclusion to apply to. For these types of property any rental net loss is shown at Box 17B and taxable disposal net loss shown at Box 18B. The residential property deduction rules also apply if you borrowed money to acquire an interest in certain entities that have significant rental property holdings - a residential land-rich entity - and you have interest expenditure on the borrowed money. Residential land-rich entity - a close company, partnership or look-through company that holds more than 50% of its assets by value in residential land, directly or indirectly. These entities come under the interposed entities rules as part of the residential property deduction rules. For more information about the interposed entity rules, see page 60 of the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No.8 September 2019. Read our Rental income - IR264 guide for more information on: • • when the rules apply • • how to calculate your income • • the amount of deductions you can claim this year, and • • the amount of any excess deductions that must be carried forward. Completing your return Tick the method you have used to calculate your residential property income and deductions. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE35 You can use 1 of the following methods: • • Portfolio basis - combine income and deductions for all rental properties in the portfolio. • • Individual, property-by-property basis - income and deductions of individual property calculated separately to other property. You need to maintain separate records for each property to choose this option. • • Combination of the individual basis and portfolio basis - choose to apply different methods to different property. Some properties are held in a portfolio and others are held on an individual basis. If you are an owner of a look-through company (LTC) and have attributed residential income and/or residential rental deductions, you need to use the same method the LTC uses (portfolio or individual property basis) for the residential properties owned by the LTC. If you are a partner in a partnership and have attributed residential income and/ or residential rental deductions, you do not need to use the same method the partnership uses. You need to calculate and identify the amounts for Boxes 15A to 15I using the method you have chosen for your rental properties. For the portfolio basis, the allowable deductions from all of the properties in your portfolio can be offset against income you earn from all of the properties in the portfolio. Calculate your rental income and deductions as usual, as shown at Boxes 4 and 14 on the Rental income - IR3R form. You can then enter these figures in the Residential property deductions worksheets - IR1226 to help calculate the figures required to be entered in your return. You can print a copy off our website ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Write the gross residential rental income from the portfolio and/or individual property in Box 15A. Do not include rental income or losses from properties excluded from the residential property deduction rules. Enter those amounts in Question 17 instead. ird.govt.nz 36 Box 15B Net bright-line profit The bright-line property rule needs to be considered when none of the other land sale rules at Question 18 apply to the disposal of the property. This rule for residential property looks at the length of time a property (including overseas property) is owned. If you sell or dispose of a residential property within a certain timeframe and no exclusion applies, then your profit on the sale will be taxable. This applies no matter what your reason was for buying or selling the property or what kind of buyer you are. The bright-line property rule applies if you sell or dispose of a residential property you have owned for less than: • • 5 years for properties acquired between 29 March 2018 and 26 March 2021. • • 5 years for properties acquired as a result of an offer made on or before 23 March 2021 and that offer was not able to be revoked or withdrawn before 27 March 2021. • • 5 years for properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021 that qualify as a ‘new build’. • • 10 years for all other properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021. For tax purposes, a property is generally acquired on the date a binding sale and purchase agreement is entered into (even if some standard conditions like getting finance or a building report still need to be met). This date will determine which bright-line period (5 or 10 years) applies for your property. For more information on when a property is acquired, see our Question we’ve been asked (QB) 17/02: Date of acquisition of land, and start date for 2-year bright-line test at taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz There are other dates that are relevant for figuring out whether your property sale is taxable under the bright- line property rule. Generally, your bright-line period starts when the legal title is transferred to you and ends when you enter into a binding sale and purchase agreement to sell the property. Where land is acquired or disposed of in a way that does not follow the standard land sale process, for example if you purchase “off the plan”, there are some different rules that apply to the bright-line period start and end dates. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE37 The bright-line property rule does not tax any profit made while the property was your main home and to some other specific situations. Relief is also available for certain ownership transfers. For more information on exclusions to the bright-line property rule, ownership transfers and rollover relief go to ird.govt.nz/brightline or our guide Bright-line property tax - IR1227. You can also use the property tax decision tool on our website to work out if you need to pay tax on the sale of your property. Go to ird.govt.nz/brightline If you sell or dispose of a residential property and the sale is taxable under the bright-line property rule, the amount of the previously denied interest under the interest limitation rules is treated as if it were part of the cost of the property in the year of disposal. If this results in a net loss, the deduction for the net loss is limited under the current rule that applies to losses from the disposal of bright-line property. If the disposal is not taxable, the interest previously denied a deduction remains non-deductible. For more information about the bright-line property rule, go to ird.govt.nz/brightline or our guide Bright-line property tax - IR1227. You can find our forms and guides at ird.govt. nz/forms-guides Completing your return Income and losses for property subject to the bright-line property rule are treated differently in the tax return. After a taxable bright-line sale: • • if you have net income from the sale of the property (a profit), the net income is included in Box 15B. Unless the property is part of a portfolio, expenses from other properties cannot be offset against the net income from the disposal. • • if you have made a net loss when the property is sold, the loss must be carried forward to a later income year when it can be used to offset net income from the land sale provisions, including from future disposals subject to the bright-line rule. A bright-line loss is not recorded in the tax return. Please keep your own record of any bright-line losses you have made. ird.govt.nz 38 Complete a Bright-line residential property sale information - IR833 form for each bright-line property sold or disposed of and include it with your return. The form explains how to calculate the resulting profit or loss. Complete the form even if the details have been included in a Financial statements summary - IR10 or set of accounts, unless the income will be included in your return as part of your business income as a property speculator, property dealer, developer or builder. Box 15C Other residential income Write the total other residential income in Box 15C. This includes the total from the following amounts: • • income in relation to a loan denominated in a foreign currency from the portfolio and/or individual property • • all depreciation recovery income from assets disposed of from the portfolio and/or individual property • • net income from the taxable disposal of a residential property outside the residential property deduction rules because it is held on revenue account. Write any net tax losses from disposals of rental properties that are excluded from the residential property deduction rules in Box 18B. Box 15D Total combined residential income The amount in Box 15D is the total amount of Box 15A, Box 15B and Box 15C. Note If you are a partner in a partnership or owner of a look- through company and have been attributed residential income at Box 27G on the IR7P or IR7L, include your share of that in proportion to your share in the partnership or effective look-through interest in the LTC in the following relevant boxes: • • Gross residential rental income Box 15A • • Net bright-line profit (excluding losses) Box 15B • • Other residential income Box 15C. The amount in Box 15D will then include the total of your attributed residential income at Box 27G on the IR7P or IR7L. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE39 Boxes 15E to 15I in your return Write the total eligible deductions for the year for all ring- fenced residential rental properties in Residential rental deductions Box 15E. If you are a partner in a partnership or owner of a look- through company and have been attributed residential rental deductions shown at Box 27M on the IR7P or IR7L, include that here at Box 15E. Do not include purchase costs, capital improvements or costs incurred when disposing of the property here. They are included when calculating the net income for taxable disposals. This is the total before adjusting for excess deductions. Note Do not include the amount of interest expense denied under the interest limitation rules in Box 15E. Write the total excess deductions brought forward from last year in Box 15F. Write the total residential rental deductions claimed this year in Box 15G. This amount cannot exceed the lesser of the following: • • Total combined residential income Box 15D • • Residential rental deduction Box 15E plus Excess residential rental deductions brought forward Box 15F. The amount cannot exceed the above unless you have sold an individual property or the last property in a residential portfolio and the sale was taxable. The amount in Box 15H should equal Total combined residential income Box 15D minus Residential rental deductions claimed this year Box 15G. Any losses are counted as zero unless the loss is the result of either: • • excess deductions released from either a taxable disposal of a property held on the individual property basis, or a taxable disposal of all properties or the last property held in a portfolio, or ird.govt.nz 40 • • claimable interest paid on your investment in a residential land-rich entity. Refer to the Rental income - IR264 guide. Write the amount of all excess deductions for the year to be carried forward to next year in Box 15I. Note 1 If you sell or dispose of an individual property and the sale is not taxable, or you sell or dispose of the last property in a portfolio and at least 1 of the sales in the portfolio was not taxable, any excess deductions will transfer to another property or portfolio and carried forward to a future year in which you earn income from a residential rental property (including properties on revenue account). Note 2 If you sell or dispose of an individual property and the sale is taxable, or you sell or dispose of the last rental property in a portfolio, and the sale of all your rental properties in a portfolio were taxable, any remaining loss/ excess deductions are released and can be offset against other income. However, this does not include any excess deductions transferred to the portfolio/property. Note 3 If you want to claim that a property is held on revenue account where the sale may be taxable, you need to tell us the details of the property. You will be stating the sale will be a taxable sale when the property is disposed of. You must be able to separately identify the deductions relating to the property. Refer to the Rental income - IR264 guide. Residential land-rich entities If you have an investment in a land rich entity, include: • • interest relating to the residential rental activity that is deductible under the interest limitation rules in Box 15E ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE41 • • interest relating to the residential rental activity you can claim this year under the residential property deduction rules in Box 15G and any remaining amount carried forward in Box 15I • • a note attached to your income tax return advising the above amounts relate to an investment in a land rich entity, to ensure quick processing of your return • • the amount of interest paid that does not relate to the residential rental property in Box 17B. Question 16 Interest incurred from residential property This question applies to owners of residential property subject to the interest limitation rules. You do not need to complete this question for the following types of property: • • farmland • • hospitals, hospices, convalescent homes, nursing homes • • rest homes and retirement villages • • hotels, motels, inns, camping grounds, hostels. For interest to be deductible, the general deductibility rules must be met. The interest will also not be deductible to the extent to which it is of a private or domestic nature. From 1 October 2021, interest is not deductible for residential property in New Zealand acquired on or after 27 March 2021, unless an exclusion or exemption applies (see below). For properties acquired before 27 March 2021, the ability to deduct interest on existing loans is being phased out between 1 October 2021 and 31 March 2025. For the 2023 tax year, you can claim 75% of the interest incurred from 1 October 2022 to 31 March 2023. Interest on any new loans drawn down on or after 27 March 2021 is not deductible. ird.govt.nz 42 Special rules also apply for refinanced loans and for interest on revolving credit and overdraft facilities. Any interest on borrowings above the closing balance on 26 March 2021 is not deductible. For more information, go to ird.govt.nz/property/renting-out-residential-property There are interposed entity rules to deny interest deductions for a customer who borrows to indirectly fund residential property through an interposed entity. What to show in your return Complete question 16 for any interest expense you are claiming in this income tax return at Boxes 15E and 17B in relation to a house, apartment, flat or other structure that could be used for residential accommodation, either short- term or long-term. This includes if you have an arrangement to build such a structure, and bare land that could be used to build such a structure under the relevant district plan. Write the total interest on residential property in Box 16A. This is the total interest incurred on your borrowings for all your residential properties for this year. If you are using an IR3R form to prepare a summary for each rental property, this is the total of all the 7A Boxes. Write the amount of interest expense claimed in Box 16B. If you are using an IR3R form to prepare a summary for each rental property, this is the total of all the 7B Boxes. Note If you are a partner in a partnership or owner of a look- through company that has incurred interest on residential property at Question 19 in the IR7, include your share of that here in proportion to your share in the partnership or effective look-through interest in the LTC. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE43 If you have claimed an interest expense in Box 16B, at Box 16C tick the reason(s) for the interest expense claimed: • • A Māori exempt company or not a residential land company - The interest limitation rules do not apply to non-close companies or groups if less than 50% of its total assets consist of residential property (excluding development property but including shares in other companies that exceed this 50% test) at all times during the income year. A close company that is a Māori authority, eligible to be a Māori authority, or wholly-owned by an entity that is a Māori authority or eligible to be one is an exempt Māori company if it passes this 50% test. • • Certain schedule 15 exclusions or property not in NZ - The interest limitation rules apply to land in New Zealand only. Schedule 15 of the Income Tax Act 2007 also allows you to claim interest for the following: • • main home – if a portion is used to earn income such as a flatting situation • • business premises (for example, a villa now used as a dental clinic) except if the business premises is used for providing accommodation and it’s not a person’s main home • • certain Māori land, papakāinga and kaumātua housing, and land transferred as part of settlement under Te Tiriti o Waitangi/Treaty of Waitangi • • employee accommodation • • student accommodation. • • Loans drawn down prior to 27 March 2021 - From 1 October 2021, the ability to claim interest is being phased out for the following situations: • • loans drawn down prior to 27 March 2021 • • property acquired before 27 March 2021 but the loan for the settlement of the property was not drawn down until on or after 27 March 2021 • • loans that relate to the purchase of a property acquired as a result of an offer made on or before 23 March 2021 and that offer was not able to be revoked or withdrawn before 27 March 2021. ird.govt.nz 44 In other situations where the property is acquired on or after 27 March 2021, interest cannot be claimed from 1 October 2021 onwards. • • Emergency, transitional, social or council housing - You can claim interest for loans if your property is used for emergency, transitional or social housing when leased to the Crown, for example to Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga - the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) or Kāinga Ora, or to a registered community housing provider. • • New build exemption - A ‘new build’ is a self-contained residence that is issued a Code Compliance Certificate (CCC) under the Building Act 2004, confirming the residence was added to the land on or after 27 March 2020. The exemption generally applies for 20 years. For more information about what qualifies as a new build go to ird.govt.nz/property/renting-out-residential- property or our guide Rental income - IR264. • • Development or land business exemption - The development exemption does not require you to have a ‘land business’ and applies to land that you develop, subdivide, or build on to create a new build. The development may be a one-off. The land business exemption applies to land held as part of a developing, subdividing, or land-dealing business, or a business of erecting buildings on land. • • Approved build-to-rent exclusion - This applies to land that meets the criteria of build-to-rent land and is approved by Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga - Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). You can claim interest for loans if your property is recorded on the build-to-rent asset register maintained by HUD. Existing build-to-rent land has until 1 July 2023 to meet the requirements and to apply. For more information about the interest limitation rules and how to calculate the amount of interest you can claim, go to ird.govt.nz/property/renting-out-residential-property or our guide Rental income - IR264. You can find our forms and guides at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE45 Question 17 Business or rental income If the estate or trust has business or rental income (other than residential rental income see question 15), you must attach either: • • a fully completed Financial statements summary - IR10 form, or • • a set of the estate or trust's financial accounts for the year. The IR10 summarises the information we need from the financial accounts. If you complete an IR10 you do not need to send us your financial accounts, but you still need to complete and keep them. Business income Write the net profit in Box 17B. This is the amount of income or net loss after all allowable business expenditure has been deducted. If the total is a loss, put a minus sign in the last box at Box 17B. When calculating business income, you can use the Schedule of business income - IR3B. Rental income If there is rental income other than residential rental income, print the net profit or loss (total rents minus expenses) in Box 17B. When calculating rental income you can use the Rental income - IR3R. Attribution rule Under the attribution rule, anyone whose actions cause an associated person (company, trust or partnership) to earn income, can be personally liable for tax on that income. If this rule applies to persons associated with your estate or trust, it will affect the amount of taxable income in this return. For more information read our Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 12 (December 2000) page 49 and TIB, Vol 13, No 11 (November 2001). ird.govt.nz 46 Question 18 Income from taxable property sales or disposals Include all income and tax losses from land sales or disposals of other property not included at Question 15. Profits from land sales are taxable if you bought a property (including an overseas property) for the purpose of reselling it or are in the business of buying and selling land and/or buildings. The profits may also be taxable if the estate or trust: • • is a builder and improved a property before selling it • • developed or subdivided land and sold sections, or • • had a change of zoning on the property and sold it within ten years of buying it. Write the total profit or loss from the sale or disposal of other property in Box 18B. Net profit from a bright-line sale is generally included in Box 15B. Only include in Box 18B the net profit from a bright-line sale excluded at Question 15, for example the bright-line sale of a mixed-use asset. Do not include any net loss from a bright-line sale. For more information on the land sale rules, go to ird.govt.nz/buying-selling or our guide Tax and your property transactions - IR361. You can find our forms and guides at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Box 18A Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) credit The estate or trust can claim a credit for RLWT deducted from the sale of a property. If more than 1 amount was deducted, show the combined amount. Show the amount of RLWT deducted, less any RLWT paid back to the estate or trust and/or transferred to outstanding amounts. Show the name of the estate or trust's withholder in the "Name of payer" box. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE47 Question 19 Other income At Question 19 show any other income received by the estate or trust, for example income from: • • any undertaking or scheme • • sale of non-FIF shares or other property • • sale or disposal of assets • • any schedular payments received by a trust • • certain settlements on a trust, or • • forgiveness of debt. Read the following sections for more information on the above items. Income from any undertaking or scheme Profits made from any undertaking or scheme entered into for the purpose of making a profit, are taxable to the estate or trust. On a separate piece of paper include what the undertaking or scheme was and list the details of income and expenses from these undertakings and schemes. Attach it to page 3 of the return and include the total profit in Box 20B. Income from sale of non-FIF shares or other property Profits from the sale of shares or other property are taxable if the estate or trust: • • buys and sells shares or other property as a business, or • • buys shares or other property for the purpose of resale. This does not apply if the shares are FIFs. List the details of income and expenses from these sales on a sheet of paper and staple it to page 3 of the return. Include the total profit in Box 18B. ird.govt.nz 48 Losses from shares or other property that are not a foreign investment fund (FIF) If the estate or trust has made a loss from the sale of an asset that was not a FIF and can show that any profit made would have been taxable, it may be able to claim the loss as a deduction. Sale or disposal of assets There are a number of rules that apply to the sale or disposal of assets. For more information read Part 3 of our guide Depreciation - a guide for business - IR260. PAYE income accrued to date of death The following types of PAYE income must be returned by the estate if it is accrued to the date of death and subsequently received by the estate: • • salary or wages • • holiday pay or other leave payments • • director's fees, and • • any other PAYE income (includes schedular payments). Include the total gross amount in Box 20B and any tax credits in Box 20A. This income is assessed as trustee income. Certain settlements on a trust The following settlements of property on a trust are deemed to be trustee income. This means that these settlements of property are excluded from the definition of corpus: • • property settled by a trustee of another trust, so long as it would have counted as income if that trust had distributed the property to 1 of its beneficiaries instead. • • a settlement of a property on a trust, which, if not for the settlement, would have constituted: - income of the settlor, or - a dividend for which the settlor would have been liable to deduct an FDP (foreign dividend payment), formerly dividend withholding payment, if the settlor is currently resident or had been resident in New Zealand and subject to income tax at that time. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE49 Forgiveness of debt The financial arrangements rules treat debts that do not have to be repaid because they have been forgiven as income to the debtor. There is an exception in the case of trusts if the creditor is a natural person and forgives the debt: • • due to "natural love and affection" for natural persons who are beneficiaries of the trust, or • • of a trust that was established mainly for the benefit of charitable organisations. If the debt forgiven is distributed to a non-qualifying beneficiary, the trustee can be liable for tax. For more information, please see our Tax Information Bulletin Vol 11, No 6 (July 1999) page 20. Question 20 Total income & total tax credits Add up Boxes 9B to 13B, 14E, 15H, and 17B to 19B. Write the total in Box 20B. Add up Boxes 9A to 14A, 17A and 19A. Write the total in Box 20A. Do not include Box 10 in this total. Question 21 Income allocation Income derived by a trustee must be allocated between beneficiary income and trustee income in boxes 21A and 21B respectively. Question 21A Beneficiary income excluding minor beneficiaries Beneficiary income is income of an estate or trust that vests in a beneficiary during the year or is paid to a beneficiary (or credited to them or dealt with in their interest or on their behalf) during the year or within a certain period after the end of the year. The rest of the income generated by an estate or trust will be trustee income. The income available to allocate to beneficiaries may be the income in Box 20B but it is important to note that Box 20B is a total of various amounts of estate or trust income. ird.govt.nz 50 Some of the amounts, such as income from rental activities, are net amounts, for example after deductions. Some of the deductions may be for non-cash outgoings, such as depreciation. This may result in there being income that can be distributed to beneficiaries despite Box 20B showing a loss, and providing the trust deed allows it. This means there may be amounts that vest in or are paid to beneficiaries that have to be treated as beneficiary income. Identify any such vesting or payment and include the amount in Box 21A. The total must reconcile with the combined totals of Boxes 27I on the IR6B after deducting any taxable distributions included in Box 27H. Timing of allocation of beneficiary income Allocation of income to a beneficiary must be made within the income year, or by the later of the following: • • 6 months after balance date, or • • the earlier of: - the date on which the trustee completes the return of income for the income year, or - the date by which the trustee must complete a return for the income year. Example A family trust is allocating income to beneficiaries for the year ended 31 March 2023. The trust return is due on 7 July 2023 and the trust plans to complete by 30 June. The income should be allocated by the later of the following: • • 30 September 2023, or • • the earlier of: -30 June 2023, or -7 July 2023. In this case the income must be allocated by September 2023. If the trust has a tax preparer, the extension of time for completing income tax returns may apply. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE51 Question 21B Trustee income including minor beneficiaries Trustee income is any income generated by an estate or trust that is not beneficiary income, see "Question 21A - Beneficiary income" on pages 49 and 50. It includes income accrued to date of death and received afterwards. Note From the 2022 - 2023 year a Trustee can choose whether to either include reportable income received up to 28 days following death in the Estate return, or in the Return to date of death. Where Box 20B shows a loss, there will be no trustee income and Box 21B should be left blank. The loss in Box 20B will be taken into account by us in calculating the loss to carry forward. Accrued income and non-apportionment clauses As a general rule, accrued income to date of death is retained by the trustee and becomes part of the capital of the estate. This income is treated as trustee income. However, where the will of the deceased taxpayer contains a non-apportionment clause, the beneficiary is entitled to receive the income accrued to date of death. So, if the accrued income is paid to the beneficiary, it's treated as beneficiary income. Question 22 Expenses The estate or trust may have incurred expenses in generating its income, for example: • • commission deducted from interest or dividends • • expenses for return preparation • • deductible trustee charges, or • • interest paid to Inland Revenue. If these expenses have not been claimed elsewhere in the return, write the amount claimed in Box 22. ird.govt.nz 52 Note Certain expenditure is not deductible and this includes: • • private expenditure, and • • capital expenditure. Penalties may apply if it is claimed incorrectly. Question 23 Net losses brought forward There are 2 types of losses the estate or trust can bring forward. Specified activity net losses These are net losses from specified activities incurred before the 1991 income year. Any loss balance in relation to a specified activity that remained at the end of the 2022 income year must be offset against net income for the 2023 income year, before taking into account other losses. The amount of this offset cannot exceed the net income. If the loss balance from specified activities incurred before the 1991 income year exceeds the net income for the 2023 income year, that excess amount is added to the tax loss for the year. Any remaining tax loss is then carried forward to further income years. Other net losses All losses incurred from the 1991 income year onwards and other net losses that were not limited before 1991 (including any net loss resulting from excess imputation credits) are "other net losses". Enter the total of all specified activity net losses and other net losses the estate or trust can bring forward to 2023 in Box 23A. Enter the amount the estate or trust has offset against 2023 income in Box 23B. Note You'll find the amount of net loss the estate or trust has to bring forward on the loss notice we sent you with the 2022 income tax assessment. If you do not have a loss notice, contact us to obtain the figure. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE53 Losses cannot be transferred from the deceased's return to the estate's return. Any such losses lapse. Trust losses cannot be passed to beneficiaries. They remain in the trust to be offset against future trustee income. If the estate or trust cannot offset any losses in 2023, enter "0.00" in Box 23B. Questions 24 and 25 Distributions to beneficiaries by foreign and non- complying trusts Question 24 Distributions At Question 24 print the total amount of distributions made to beneficiaries during the year. A distribution is any income or property of the trust that vests in the beneficiary or is paid or applied for a beneficiary's benefit. It includes any property or service disposed of or provided to: • • a beneficiary for less than market value, or • • the trust by a beneficiary for greater than market value. Attach a separate schedule to page 3 of the return showing the source and the amount of each distribution. Distributions are considered to have come from different sources in the following order: • • beneficiary income • • accumulated trustee income • • capital profits or gains realised in the current income year • • capital profits or gains realised in previous years that have been accumulated by the trust, and • • the corpus of the trust. The ordering establishes if the distribution is a taxable distribution - see Question 23. Capital gains and corpus distributed only after income derived by trustees in the year of distribution and in prior years has been distributed. More information about the ordering and taxability of distributions can be found in our Trusts' and estates' income tax rules - IR288 guide. ird.govt.nz 54 Question 25 Taxable distributions A taxable distribution is one made to a beneficiary by a foreign or non-complying trust that is not beneficiary income. For a foreign trust taxable distributions also do not include capital gains profits that are not counted as taxable income, except when derived from transactions with associated persons or a distribution from the corpus. For non-complying trusts they do not include distributions from the corpus. Write the total taxable distributions made to beneficiaries during the year in Box 25. Where to include taxable distributions Include the amount of the taxable distribution made to each beneficiary in the beneficiary's panel of the IR6B: • • in Box 27H if the trust is a foreign trust, or • • in Box 27K if the trust is a non-complying trust. For tax payable on taxable distributions see Question 27K on page 60. Schedule of beneficiary's estate or trust income Each beneficiary (excluding minor beneficiaries) must attach a completed Schedule of beneficiary's estate or trust income - IR307 to their individual tax return if they receive income from a foreign or non-complying trust. It's helpful if the trustee or tax preparer also provides a completed IR307 when advising beneficiaries of their share of trust income. Beneficiaries do not then need to contact the trustee or tax preparer when completing their own returns. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE55 Question 26 Additional disclosure of foreign investments If you calculated CFC or FIF income at Question 13 you may be required to complete an additional disclosure form for that investment. If the trust is not widely held or a PIE, you may not require an additional disclosure if the investments are in countries New Zealand has a double tax agreement with as at 31 March 2013, and have used the fair dividend rate or comparative value method. If the trust is widely held or a PIE you are required to complete an additional disclosure. Go to ird.govt.nz/beps for full details of the disclosure requirements and the appropriate forms. Find out more about the base erosion profit shifting (BEPS) hybrid mismatch rules at ird.govt.nz/beps If you need help? making a CFC or FIF disclosure please call 0800 443 773. Question 27 Tax payable for beneficiaries Print the combined total from box 27T from all IR6B’s completed by the trust. Refer to the detail below on boxes 27A to 27AC for more information on how to complete the IR6B. ird.govt.nz 56 IR6B Estate or trust beneficiary details Complete the details on the IR6B for each beneficiary who has received an income allocation from the trust. See Question 21A on pages 49 to 50 for the definition of beneficiary income. Complete boxes 27D to 27K to record any taxable income allocations made to the beneficiary. Complete boxes 27L to 27T to allocate tax credits and calculate tax payable. If the trust is required to comply with the NZ Domestic Trust disclosure rules (see question 33 to see if you need to comply) you must also complete an IR6B for any beneficiary who has received a distribution from the trust during the year. Complete boxes 27V to 27AA to record distributions made, and boxes 27U, 27AB and 27AC to record beneficiary account movements. Trusts required to comply with the NZ Domestic Trust Disclosure rules must supply each beneficiary’s: • • Full name • • Date of birth or commencement date • • IRD number or Tax identification number (refer question 27A, 27B and 27C) • • Jurisdiction of tax residency The question about jurisdiction of tax residency also lets us work out correctly how the beneficiary income should be taxed. Include all beneficiary income allocated to each non- resident beneficiary in Boxes 27D, 27E, 27F, 27G and 27H. Remember, the combined totals at Boxes 27I, less any taxable distributions from foreign trusts included at Box 27H must reconcile with the total of Box 21A. Non-resident passive income Non-resident passive income is interest, dividends and royalties for the supply of scientific, technical, industrial or commercial knowledge. These types of income are subject to non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) if the income has a New Zealand source. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE57 This tax is deducted when the non-resident passive income is paid or credited to a non-resident beneficiary. The rates and methods of calculating the tax on a non-resident beneficiary’s share of income differ according to the type of income derived and the country the beneficiary is resident in. Include all income derived by each non-resident beneficiary in Boxes 27D, 27E, 27F, 27G and 27H. Paying NRWT When paying non-resident passive income to a non-resident beneficiary, the trust must complete certain forms and pay N RW T. If you need more help, see our NRWT - payer’s guide - IR291. When calculating the amount of income liable for income tax at the ordinary rates, do not include non-resident passive income or any overseas income in the taxable income figure in Box 27I for non-resident beneficiaries. Question 27A Beneficiary does not have a tax identification number (TIN) Tick one of these boxes to indicate why the beneficiary does not have a tax identification number. Question 27B Beneficiary’s IRD number Enter the beneficiary’s IRD number. If the beneficiary does not have an IRD number because, for example, they are a minor with no assessable income, tick the box at 27A to indicate “TIN not required in jurisdiction” and leave the field blank. If the beneficiary does not have an IRD number because they are not resident in NZ then leave this field blank and provide a TIN in box 27C. If you do not have the beneficiary’s IRD number contact the beneficiary. Due to our confidentiality obligations under section 18 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 we cannot provide it to you. ird.govt.nz 58 Question 27C Beneficiary’s TIN If the beneficiary is not a tax resident in New Zealand, enter the beneficiary’s tax identification number from the tax jurisdiction they are resident in. If the beneficiary is not required to hold a TIN in that jurisdiction, or the jurisdiction does not issue TINs, tick one of the boxes at question 27A and leave this field blank. Questions 27D to 27T Beneficiary income and calculation of tax, excluding minor beneficiaries See Question 21A on pages 49 to 50 for the definition of beneficiary income. Complete boxes 27D to 27K to record any taxable income allocations made to the beneficiary. Complete boxes 27L to 27T to allocate tax credits and calculate tax payable. Question 27D New Zealand interest If the allocation of beneficiary income includes any New Zealand interest, write the amount in Box 27D. Question 27E New Zealand dividends If the allocation of beneficiary income includes any New Zealand dividends, write the amount in Box 27E. Question 27F Māori authority distributions If the allocation of beneficiary income includes any Māori authority distributions, write the amount in Box 27F. Question 27G Overseas income If the allocation of beneficiary income includes any overseas income, write the amount in Box 27G. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE59 Question 27H Other income and taxable distributions from a foreign trust Add the remainder of any allocated beneficiary income to any taxable distributions from a foreign trust and write the total in Box 27H. Question 27I Beneficiary income from the estate or trust Add up boxes 27D to 27H and write the total in Box 27I. Question 27J Paying the tax on beneficiary income, excluding minor beneficiaries The trustee must pay tax on behalf of the beneficiary for all income allocated to the beneficiary. However, the trustee and the beneficiary can agree not to have tax deducted from trust/estate income before the beneficiary receives it. This might be done where the beneficiary has losses available to offset income. Note The trustees will be liable if the beneficiary defaults on payment of the tax obligations on trust income. Tick ‘Yes’ if the estate or trust is paying the tax on behalf of beneficiaries, then complete all boxes 27D to 27T. ‘Yes’ means the trust/estate will retain any excess tax credits (except overseas credits and Imputation credits) for the trust/estate. The beneficiary must then show the gross income allocated to them as trust income and can only claim the amount of tax paid by the trust at key point 27L, in the key point for Tax Paid by Trustees of their own income tax return. Tick ‘No’ if the estate or trust is not paying the tax on behalf of beneficiaries. Then complete boxes 27D to 27I, and boxes 27K, 27M, 27O, 27Q, 27U, 27V, 27W, 27X, 27Y, 27Z, 27AA, 27AB & 27AC only. ird.govt.nz 60 Question 27K Taxable distributions by non-complying trust Show taxable distributions to each beneficiary in Box 27K and the tax in Box 27S. Taxable distributions by a non- complying trust are taxable to the beneficiary at a flat rate of 45 cents in the dollar. Question 27L Calculation of tax Do not fill out Box 27L if you ticked “No” in Box 27J. If the estate or trust is paying tax on behalf of the beneficiaries first calculate tax on the total taxable income of each beneficiary, including other income not received from the estate or trust, using the rates below. Then determine the portion of tax applicable to just beneficiary income (see Trusts and estates income tax rules - IR288 and “Tax on beneficiary income”). Income to $14,000 10.5% $14,001 - $48,000 17.5% $48,001 - $70,000 30.0% $70,001 - $180,000 33.0% $180,001 and over 39% Question 27M Beneficiary’s share of overseas tax paid Allocate any tax paid overseas to beneficiaries on the same basis as the allocation of income. Minor beneficiaries’ share of overseas tax is to be offset against tax payable on trustee income. A New Zealand resident who receives a taxable distribution is not allowed a tax credit in relation to any income tax paid unless the tax is the same as non-resident withholding tax (NRWT). The amount of any credit is equal to: taxable income × foreign tax paid total distribution ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE61 Question 27N Calculation Do not fill out Box 27N if you ticked “No” in Box 27J. Subtract Box 27M from Box 27L. If the overseas tax paid (Box 27M) allocated to a beneficiary is greater than the tax payable in Box 27L, print 0.00 at Box 27N. Question 27O Beneficiary’s share of dividend imputation credits If dividends have been allocated to a beneficiary, use the following formula to work out the credits attached to those dividends: a ×( b ) c a is the total of all dividend imputation credits attached to all dividends distributed to beneficiaries during the income year b is the total distribution, including capital distributions made to the particular beneficiary during the year c is the total distribution, including capital distributions made to all beneficiaries during the year. Show the beneficiary’s share of imputation credits in Box 27O. Note If the amount of a beneficiary’s tax credit is limited by the formula, then the amount of the imputation credit included in the gross dividend as part of beneficiary’s assessable income should be a corresponding amount and included in the beneficiary’s income tax return. Further information is available in the Imputation: A guide for New Zealand Companies - IR274. Question 27P Calculation Do not fill out Box 27P if you ticked “No” in Box 27J. Subtract Box 27O from Box 27N. If the beneficiary’s share of the imputation credits is larger than their tax payable in Box 27N, the excess credit cannot be refunded to the trust. Write 0.00 in Box 27P. ird.govt.nz 62 The beneficiary should claim the balance of the unused imputation credits in their own tax return. Minor beneficiaries’ share of dividend imputation credits is to be offset against tax payable on trustee income in Box 28H of the IR6. Question 27Q Beneficiary’s allocation of RWT and other credits Minor beneficiaries’ allocation of RWT and other credits is to be offset against tax payable on trustee income. Ensure that you include the following amounts in Box 27Q for each beneficiary: • • allocation of RWT (Boxes 9A and 10A) including any RWT credits reallocated under the RWT substitution payment rules • • share of Māori authority credits (Box 11A) • • share of partnership, estate or trust tax credits (Box 12A) • • share of LTC tax credits (Box 14A) • • if income from a property sale is treated as beneficiary income, show their share of any residential land withholding tax credit (Box 18A), and • • share of other income credits (Box 19A). Note Do not include any amounts already shown in either Boxes 27M or 27O of the IR6B. Questions 27R & 27T Do not fill out 27R or 27T if you ticked ‘No’ in Box 27J. Question 27S Calculate tax on taxable distribution by non-complying trust in 27K at 45 cents in the dollar and print this in Box 27S. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE63 Questions 27U to 27AC Distributions and beneficiary account movements If the trust is required to comply with the NZ Domestic Trust disclosure rules (see question 33 to see if you need to comply) you must disclose the details of any beneficiary who has received a distribution from the trust during the year, refer to page 12 of the guide to read more about distributions. Complete boxes 27V to 27AA to record distributions made, and boxes 27U, 27AB and 27AC to record beneficiary account movements. Question 27U Opening balance Enter the opening balance of any amount owing to the beneficiary from distributions made in prior years that have not been withdrawn or enjoyed by the beneficiary. Question 27V Accounting income and other distributions Enter the total accounting income distributed to the beneficiary for the year. This may be different from the total income allocated at questions 27D to 27H because: • • Taxable income allocations can include amounts allocated within 6-months of the end of the tax year; • • Taxable income may be calculated using different rules from accounting income, such as the FIF or PIE rules. Include any other distributions that are not captured in questions 27W, 27X, 27Y and 27Z. An example of a distribution not captured below is where a beneficiary provides assets or services to a trust and receives higher than market value in return. Question 27W Distribution of trust corpus Enter the total amount of trust corpus distributed to the beneficiary during the year. Trust corpus reflects amounts of any settlements made on the trust (less any distributions made). ird.govt.nz 64 Question 27X Distribution of trust capital Enter the total amount of trust capital distributed to the beneficiary during the year. Trust capital reflects tax paid profits and realised capital gains of the trust. Question 27Y Distribution arising when property is used by a beneficiary for less than market value If a beneficiary enjoys the use of trust property for less than market value this is a distribution. If the cost of providing this to the beneficiary is NIL you can record zero at question 27Y, as long as this corresponds with the way it has been treated in the trust’s financial statements. Alternatively you can use a fair market value. Example The trust owns a holiday home at the beach, all beneficiaries have free use of the property at any time. Each time a beneficiary uses the property they are receiving a distribution from the trust. Provided the trust does not incur any holding costs on the property then the amount of the distribution can be recorded as nil. Question 27Z Distribution of trust assets (other than cash) Record the value of any trust assets (excluding cash) distributed to the beneficiary during the year. The amount of the distribution should align with the asset value recorded in the financial statements of the trust, which may reflect historical cost, tax book value or market value. Question 27AA Distribution arising from forgiveness of debt Enter the amount of any debt owing by the beneficiary that has been forgiven by the trust during the year. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE65 Question 27AB Withdrawals and amounts enjoyed during the year Record the total of: • • the value of assets used for less than market value (27Y) • • assets withdrawn (27Z) • • debt forgiven (27AA) and • • any cash withdrawals made by the beneficiary during the year Question 27AC Closing balance Record the closing balance of amounts owed to the beneficiary at the end of the year. ird.govt.nz 66 Trustee income and calculation of tax Question 28A Calculation of taxable income If the result is negative, the amount will be taken into account in the loss carried forward to the following year. Question 28B Calculation of tax and tax on taxable distributions If the trust has received a taxable distribution and tax has not been paid, calculate tax at 33 cents in the dollar and add it to the total. Question 28C Credit for tax paid overseas The amount of the credit for tax paid overseas on trustee income is limited to the amount of New Zealand tax on that income. Remember to attach evidence of payment to page 3 of your return. Question 28E Dividend imputation credits If the trustee's share of the imputation credit exceeds the tax on trustee income at Box 28D, the excess credit cannot be refunded. Write 0.00 in Box 28F. The excess credit is converted to a net loss to carry forward to the following year. To calculate the net loss to carry forward to 2024, use the worksheet on page 67. We'll send you a notice confirming the amount of loss to carry forward. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE67 Example In this example the net loss to carry forward to the income year ending 31 March 2024 is $151.00 in Box 4. Trustee's share of imputation credits from Box 28E of the return. 1 350 00 Tax on trustee income from Box 28D of the return. 2 300 00 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1. Print your answer here. 3 50 00 Divide Box 3 by 0.33 (33%). Print your answer here. 4 (151 00) Worksheet Trustee's share of imputation credits from Box 28E of the return. 1 Tax on trustee income from Box 28D of the return. 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1. Print your answer here. 3 Divide Box 3 by 0.33 (33%). Print your answer here. 4 The amount in Box 4 is the net loss to carry forward to 2024. Question 28G Trustee's share of RWT and other credits The following amounts should be added together and printed in Box 28G: • • the trustee's allocation of RWT (Boxes 9A and 10A) • • the trustee's share of Māori authority credits (Box 11A) • • the trustee's share of partnership, estate or trust tax credits (Box 12A) • • the trustee's share of LTC tax credits (Box 14A) • • the total from Box 19A, and • • the trustee's share of any RLWT credit (Box 18A). Do not include any amounts already shown in either Boxes 27M or 27O of the IR6B. ird.govt.nz 68 Question 30 Refunds and/or transfers Please be careful to copy the amount from Box 29E to Box 30 correctly. Direct credit If you choose direct credit, you get your refund faster and you can withdraw your money as soon as it's credited because there's no clearance time. We pay any refund direct into your New Zealand bank account or other deposit account, for example a building society account, as soon as we've processed your return. Make sure your correct account number is printed at Question 6 on the front page of your return. Question 30A Overpaid provisional tax If you’ve made payments towards your 2024 provisional tax and, after completing this return, find you have less or no provisional tax to pay, the overpayment can be included in the amount we refund or transfer. Attach a separate note to your return to request this. Question 30B Transferring a refund to pay provisional tax If you're entitled to a refund you can transfer all or part of it to your 2024 provisional tax. If you want to do this print the amount of the transfer in Box 30A. Questions 30C to 30D Transfers to another taxpayer's income tax account If you'd like your refund transferred to another account you'll need to tell us what date you'd like it transferred. The date you choose depends on what tax has been overpaid and whose account you want the credit transferred to. Different rules apply if the other taxpayer is associated to you. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE69 Associated taxpayers When transferring overpaid tax, associated taxpayers are: • • a company you're a shareholder-employee in • • a partner in the same partnership • • a relative (for example child, parent, spouse, or partner), or • • a trustee of a family trust you're a beneficiary of. You can ask for your credit to be transferred at any date as long as it's not before the relevant date shown below. Tick "Yes" or "No" at Box 30B to indicate whether the other taxpayer is associated and write their name in the boxes provided. Write the IRD number of the other taxpayer at Box 30C. Write the amount you wish to transfer at Box 30D. Transfer dates For refunds transferred to your account or an associated taxpayers account: • • If the credit is from excess tax deducted (for example PAYE deducted), it's the day after your balance date (or 1 April if your balance date is before 31 March). • • If the credit is from overpaid provisional tax, it's the day you overpaid it. Note Special rules apply if the return period has had tax pooling refunds transferred in. For credit transferred to a non-associated person's account, it's the later of the day you requested the transfer, or the day after you complete your return. Future transfer dates If you'd like your credit transferred at a date in the future, attach a note to the front of your return with details of: • • the amount you want transferred • • the account you want it transferred to, and if it's the account of the associated person, and • • the date you'd like it transferred. ird.govt.nz 70 If you do not tell us the date you'd like your credit transferred, we'll transfer it at a date we think gives you the greatest advantage. Contact us if you'd like to change the transfer date and tell us if this transfer is to cover a debt. For more information on transfers, read Tax Information Bulletin Vol 14, No 11 (November 2002). Refunds of less than $1 If your refund is less than $1 it will be carried forward to your next tax assessment. We'll offset it against any amount you may owe us or add it to any refund. If you do not want it carried forward, please contact us. Question 31 Initial provisional tax liability If this is the first year the estate or trust started to derive gross income from a taxable activity, print the start date in Box 31. Provisional tax is not payable if the residual income tax (RIT) for the previous year was $5,000 or less. Most new businesses do not pay provisional tax in their first year of operation because there's no RIT from the previous year to base the calculation on. However, a special rule requires you to pay interest if you have an initial provisional tax liability. The estate or trust has an initial provisional tax liability if: • • it starts to derive gross income from a taxable activity, and • • it had not derived income from a taxable activity within the preceding 4 years, or • • you have RIT of $60,000 or more in the current year. The interest cost can be reduced or eliminated by making voluntary provisional tax payments on the instalment due dates. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE71 Interest rules for taxpayers with an initial provisional tax liability Taxpayers with an initial provisional tax liability may be charged interest from the first, second or third instalment date. The instalment date that interest applies from is determined by the taxable activity's start date. For estates and trusts whose balance date is 31 March, the start date for interest will be: • • 29 August, if the taxable activity started before 30 July of the same year • • 16 January, if the taxable activity started between 31 July and 16 December of the previous year, or • • 8 May, if the taxable activity started on or after 17 December of the previous year. An estate or trust with a balance date other than 31 March generally pays provisional tax on the 28th day of the 5th, 9th and 13th months after the balance date, unless completing six-monthly GST returns. If you need help to work out whether the estate or trust has an initial provisional tax liability, read our guide Provisional tax - IR289. Question 32 2024 provisional tax 2024 provisional tax is charged for income the estate or trust will earn in the 2024 income year. It is payable in 2, 3 or 6 equal instalments. There are 3 options for paying provisional tax - standard, estimation and ratio. If the estate or trust's 2023 RIT is: • • $5,000 or less it does not have to pay provisional tax, although it can make voluntary payments • • more than $5,000 but expected to be $5,000 or less for 2024, it may estimate 2024 provisional tax at nil (read "Estimation option" on page 72), or • • more than $5,000 and expected to be more than $5,000 for 2023, it must pay 2024 provisional tax. If you anticipate your RIT will exceed $5,000 for the 2023 year, see "Interest" on page 74. You may be liable for interest from your first provisional tax instalment date. ird.govt.nz 72 Which option to use Estates or trusts can use either the standard or estimation options to pay their provisional tax. If they're registered for GST they may also be able to use the ratio option. Standard option Using the standard option, the estate or trust's 2024 provisional tax will be equal to its 2023 RIT plus 5%. If you use this option enter S in Box 32A on the return and the amount of 2024 provisional tax in Box 32B. • • If the estate or trust's 2023 return has not been completed by the first instalment date of 2024 provisional tax, the provisional tax instalments payable is based on 2022 RIT plus 10% (divided by 3 or 2, depending on how many instalments are payable). Estimation option Estates or trusts can estimate their 2024 provisional tax. Trustees must include distributions to minor beneficiaries in their estimate. They can re-estimate any number of times up to and including their final instalment due date. If the estate or trust's 2024 RIT is expected to be less than its 2023 RIT, estimating may prevent the estate or trust from paying more tax than it has to. Note An estimate must be "fair and reasonable" at each instalment it applies to. If you use this option, see page 74 on "Not taking reasonable care penalty" and "Interest". If you estimate your provisional tax, your instalments should be one-third of your estimation. Use the worksheet on page 73 to calculate provisional tax using the estimation option. If you use this option enter E in Box 32A and the amount of 2024 provisional tax in Box 32B. Estimating provisional tax on beneficiary income When working out the tax on estimated beneficiary income, calculate the tax separately for each beneficiary, including estimated tax credits where applicable. The table on the following page shows the 2024 individual tax rates for provisional tax. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE73 2024 annual tax rates income range Ta x r a t e Income to $14,00010.5% $14,001 - $48,00017.5% $48,001 - $70,00030.0% $70,001 - $180,00033.0% $180,001 and over39.0% When using these tax rates to calculate 2024 provisional tax, you'll also need to estimate the tax credits the beneficiary may be entitled to. Use this worksheet to calculate the estate or trust's 2024 provisional tax using the estimation option. Print the estate or trust's estimated 2024 income to be allocated in Box 1. 1 Estimated allocation of income: •• Beneficiary income 2 •• Trustee income 3 Work out the tax on the amount in Box 2, using the rates above. Print your answer in Box 4. 4 Multiply the amount in Box 3 by 0.33 (33%). Print your answer in Box 5. 5 If the estate or trust is non- complying, multiply the estimated taxable distributions, if any, by 0.45 (45%). Print your answer in Box 6. 6 Add Boxes 4, 5 and 6. Print your answer in Box 7. 7 Print the estimated 2024 credits (trustees' share only) in Box 8. 8 Subtract Box 8 from Box 7. Print your answer in Box 9. 9 Box 9 is the estate or trust's 2024 provisional tax. Copy it to Box 32B of the return and print E in Box 32A. ird.govt.nz 74 Divide the amount in Box 9 by three to get the amount to pay for each instalment. If you need more help read our guide Provisional tax - IR289. Ratio option If the trust is GST registered you may qualify to use the ratio option to calculate your provisional tax. Only enter R at Box 32A if you've already elected to use the ratio option. Your application to use the ratio option must be made by phone or in writing before the beginning of the income year you want to use it in. If you've already elected to use the ratio option and want to continue using it, enter R at Box 32A. More information about the ratio option is in our guide Provisional tax - IR289. Not taking reasonable care penalty When you estimate the estate or trust's 2024 provisional tax, your estimate must be fair and reasonable. If the 2024 RIT is greater than the provisional tax paid, you may be liable for a not taking reasonable care penalty of 20% of the underpaid provisional tax. Interest If the estate or trust has paid too much provisional tax on trustee income we may pay interest, or if it has not paid enough, we may charge interest. Interest for estates or trusts is calculated only on the tax payable on trustee income. Interest is not calculated if all income is distributed to the beneficiaries. Interest the estate or trust pays is generally tax-deductible, while interest we pay is taxable income. For more information about interest and penalties read our guide Penalties and interest - IR240. If we pay interest, it continues to accrue until the date we refund the overpaid tax, or apply it to another liability. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE75 Election to be a provisional tax payer An estate or trust is a provisional tax payer for the 2024 year if its RIT for 2023 is more than $5,000. If the 2023 RIT is $5,000 or less, and • • the estate or trust made provisional tax payments for that tax year, and • • payments were made under the estimation method (other than using the estimation method for its final instalment only), It may elect to be a provisional tax payer for 2024. This may affect the interest it may be entitled to for that year. To elect to be a provisional tax payer for the 2024 year, attach a letter to the front of the return. Change in balance date There are special rules about when provisional tax is due and how interest is calculated if there has been a change in balance date. Read our Provisional tax - IR289 guide for more information. Tax pooling Tax pooling allows taxpayers to pool provisional tax payments, offsetting underpayments by overpayments within the same pool. This reduces their possible exposure to late payment penalties and use-of-money interest. The pooling arrangement is made through a commercial intermediary, who arranges for participating taxpayers to be charged or compensated for the offset. For more information about tax pooling, including a list of intermediaries, go to ird.govt.nz/tax-pooling ird.govt.nz 76 Payment dates 2024 provisional tax Generally, an estate or trust with a 31 March balance date pays provisional tax by the following due dates: • • First instalment 28 August 2023 • • Second instalment 15 January 2024 • • Third instalment 7 May 2024 An estate or trust with a balance date other than 31 March pays provisional tax on the 28th day of the 5th, 9th and 13th months after the balance date. Where payments would otherwise be due on 28 December or 28 April the due date is extended to 15 January or 7 May. These dates will alter if: • • the estate or trust is registered for GST, and • • the GST filing frequency is six-monthly, or • • provisional tax is paid by the ratio option. If either of these situations apply to you, read our guide Provisional tax - IR289. 2023 end-of-year income tax Estates or trusts that have an agent and an extension of time may have until 7 April 2024 to pay their tax. If you think this applies to you contact your agent for more information. Otherwise, an estate or trust with a balance date between 1 March and 30 September must pay its end-of-year income tax and any interest by 7 February 2024. An estate or trust with a balance date between 1 October and 28 February must pay its end-of-year income tax by the 7th day of the month before the following year's balance date.

In this guide we use "trustee" or "you" to refer to the person or persons administering an estate or trust. The word trust also refers to estates unless we've stated otherwise. This guide provides general information about how to complete the IR6 return. There are references throughout the guide to our other publications which may help you. If you need more help please contact us or a tax advisor. Income for deceased customers Reportable income received up to 28 days following a person’s death can either be included in the: Individual tax return – IR3 return to date of death, or Estate income tax return – IR6. Changes From 1 April 2024 Trust return changes Encompasses four changes for trust returns. These changes will be for the 2024 income year return. Layout of financial information in the trust return form to align with the standard layout of financial statements. Allocating distributions for nil value A new tick box on the IR6B to indicate where a beneficiary has received a distribution that has been valued at NIL. Allocating negative beneficiary income in the IR6B The IR6B – Estate or trust beneficiary income form has been amended so that negative values cannot be included in Box 27D to Box 27I. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE7 The change reflects that an estate or trust: • • cannot distribute a loss or a part of a loss to a beneficiary. • • cannot include a negative amount for an income type for example overseas income even where the overall allocation of all income types is positive. From 1 April 2022 ‘Total residential income’ has been separated into the following 3 boxes: • • Gross residential rental income Box 15A • • Net bright-line profit (excluding losses) Box 15B • • Other residential income Box 15C. For more information about how to complete these boxes, see Question 15 Income and expenses from residential property on page 34. Non active trusts, estates and testamentary trusts • • The thresholds at which a trust or estate may be excused from the requirement to file an IR6 Return, have increased. • • A threshold is introduced at which a Testamentary Trust may be excused the requirement to file an IR6 Return. Details and thresholds see Question 7B. Income for deceased customers Reportable income received up to 28 days following a person’s death can either be included in the: • • Individual tax return – IR3 return to date of death, or • • Estate income tax return – IR6. Beneficiary’s share of dividend imputation credit If the amount of a beneficiary’s imputation credit allowed is limited, then the amount of the imputation credit included in the gross dividend as part of beneficiary’s assessable income should be a corresponding amount and included in the beneficiary’s income tax return. ird.govt.nz 8 From 1 April 2021 New disclosure requirements for NZ Domestic Trusts are effective for the income year beginning 1 April 2021 and subsequent income years. Refer to the checklist at Question 33 to see if your trust needs to comply. If you are required to comply you will need to provide additional disclosures with your 2024 return, including: • • The details of any person who is a settlor of the trust. • • Complete an IR6S to provide the details of any person who is a settlor of the trust and attach it to your return. • • The nature and amount of any settlement made on the trust during the year. Complete an IR6S to record any settlements made on the trust during the year and attach it to your return. • • The details of any person who received a distribution from the trust during the year, and information about the amount and nature of the distribution. Complete an IR6B for any beneficiary who received a distribution during the year and attach it to your return. • • The details of any person who has the power to appoint or dismiss a trustee, add or remove a beneficiary, or amend the trust deed. Log into myIR to provide us this information, or complete an IR6P and attach it to your return. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE9 IR6S: Settlements & settlors If you are required to comply with the new NZ Domestic Trust disclosure rules you will need to supply additional information with your 2024 income tax return: • • The details of any person who has made a settlement on the trust (at any point in time) if those details have not already been supplied. • • The nature and amount of any settlement made during the year, and the details of the person who made the settlement (the settlor). A settlor of the trust can include any person who at any time: • • transfers value -to a trust, or -for the benefit of the trust, or -on terms of the trust These are called settlements. A settlement is any action that makes a person a settlor of a trust and includes any of the following: • • disposal of any property to the trust for less than market value • • property or funds made available to the trust for less than market value • • services provided to the trust for less than market value, unless those services are incidental to the operation of the trust • • any property acquired from the trust or any service from the trustee for greater than market value. A settlement can also occur as a result of a transaction or series of transactions entered by a person that has the effect of making that person a settlor. In most cases settlements must be valued at market value, unless the settlement is something that cannot be later distributed to a beneficiary, in which case it must be valued at NIL. For example, • • If a person provides land and buildings or other assets to a trust they must be valued at market value; ird.govt.nz 10 • • If a person provides cash to a trust, it must be valued at market value (which is the face value of the currency, or NZ equivalent face value of foreign currency); • • If a person provides services to a trust those services have been consumed by the trust and can’t later be distributed so they must be valued at NIL; • • If a person is owed money by a trust and chooses not to charge interest, the non-charging of interest is a transfer of value and therefore a settlement, but the trust has not gained anything that it can later distribute to a beneficiary so the settlement must be valued at NIL. The value must be determined at the time the settlement is made. The total value of all settlements forms the corpus of the trust. The minimum details you must supply on the IR6S: • • The name of the settlor • • The date of birth or commencement date of the settlor • • The jurisdiction of tax residency of the settlor • • The tax identification number (TIN) of the settlor: -if they are not required to hold an IRD number in NZ or a TIN in another jurisdiction, or the jurisdiction doesn’t issue TINs tick the relevant box at question 1, leave boxes 2 and 3 blank; -if they are a NZ resident then enter their NZ IRD number in box 2; -if they are not a NZ resident enter their TIN in box 3; -if you do not hold the IRD number or TIN of the settlor: If a settlement was made by this settlor in the current year, then you must ask them to provide it to you If a settlement was not made by this settlor recently and you cannot reasonably obtain their IRD# or TIN (e.g. because they are deceased and the settlement was >7 years ago), leave boxes 2 and 3 blank. • • No settlement in the current year -If you are completing the IR6S in order to provide information about past settlors (who have not made a settlement this year) tick the box at question 4 ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE11 • • Settlement/s in the current year that are required to be valued at market value -Cash: if the settlor has provided one or more settlements of money during the year add them together and enter the amount at box 5 -Shares/ownership interests: if the settlor has provided one or more settlements of shares/ ownership interests during the year add them together and enter the amount at box 6 -Financial arrangements: if the settlor has provided one or more settlements of financial arrangements during the year add them together and enter the amount at box 7 -Services: if the settlor has provided one or more settlements of services during the year add them together and enter the amount at box 8 -Land: if the settlor has provided one or more settlements of land during the year add them together and enter the amount at box 9 -Buildings: if the settlor has provided one or more settlements of buildings during the year add them together and enter the amount at box 10 -Other: if the settlor has provided one or more settlements of any other type during the year add them together and enter the amount at box 11, enter a description of the nature of the settlement at box 12, if there are multiple ‘other’ settlements describe the one/s of the highest value. • • Settlement/s in the current year that are required to be valued at NIL -If a settlement has been made but the amount is required to be valued at nil, tick box 13. Complete as many IR6S forms as you need to provide all of the required details and staple these to the back page of your return. ird.govt.nz 12 IR6P: Powers of appointment If you are required to comply with the new NZ Domestic Trust disclosure rules you will need to supply additional information with your 2024 income tax return: • • The details of any person who has the power to appoint or dismiss a trustee, add or remove a beneficiary, or amend the trust deed (the appointer). You only need to tell us about people who have these powers in the current year, and then let us know in future if they cease to hold them. You can also keep these details up to date in myIR. The minimum details you must supply on the IR6P: • • The name of the appointer • • The date of birth or commencement date of the appointer • • The jurisdiction of tax residency of the appointer • • The tax identification number of the appointer: -if they are not required to hold an IRD number in NZ or a TIN in another jurisdiction, or the jurisdiction doesn’t issue TINs tick the relevant box at question 1, leave boxes 2 and 3 blank; -if they are a NZ resident then enter their NZ IRD number in box 2; -if they are not a NZ resident enter their TIN in box 3; -if you do not hold the IRD number or TIN of the appointer you must ask them to provide it to you • • Enter date that the appointer was given this power in box 4. If the date is unknown (e.g. because it was many years ago and records are not available), enter a date that reflects a reasonable estimate. • • Enter the date that the appointer ceased to hold this power at box 5, if they currently hold these powers leave this field blank. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE13 IR6B: Beneficiaries & distributions If you are required to comply with the new NZ Domestic Trust disclosure rules you will need to supply additional information with your 2024 income tax return: • • The details of any beneficiary who has received a distribution from the trust during the year, and the nature and amount of that distribution. This information should be included on the IR6B. Refer to question 27 for more information about how to complete the IR6B. Complete as many IR6Bs as you need to provide all the required details and staple them to your return. Distributions In addition to allocating beneficiary income, see page 14 for allocations, a trustee can make other distributions to beneficiaries. A distribution can include: • • tax-paid profits (trustee income or beneficiary income) • • capital gains of the trust • • corpus of the trust (the value of settlements made on the trust) • • the physical and intangible assets of the trust passing to beneficiaries • • the beneficiary using trust property for less than market value • • the beneficiary supplying goods or services to the trust and receiving more than market value in return (including charging a higher than market interest rate on loans to the trust) • • (for a foreign trust) non-taxed profits such as foreign sourced income. The tax position of a distribution from a trust depends on the type of trust making the distribution and the residency of the beneficiary. See pages 19 and 20 of this guide. Generally, a distribution, other than beneficiary income, to a New Zealand resident beneficiary from: • • a complying trust is not taxable • • a foreign trust is taxable, to the extent it is not part of the corpus or capital gains, or ird.govt.nz 14 • • a non-complying trust is taxable at 45 cents in the dollar, to the extent it is not part of the corpus. How income of an estate or trust is taxed in general In general, income of an estate or trust will be subject to income tax in New Zealand if it has a source in New Zealand regardless of the residency of the trustee. The trustee is also liable for New Zealand income tax on income derived outside New Zealand where any settlor of the trust is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year, or if the estate has a New Zealand trustee and the deceased was resident in New Zealand. Allocations Income of a trust is either trustee or beneficiary income. The trustee can allocate income as beneficiary income, provided the income either: • • vests absolutely in the beneficiary in the income year, or • • is paid or applied for the benefit of the beneficiary during that income year or within a specified period from the end of the income year. For more information see Question 21A on page 50. Trust income allocated as beneficiary income is taxable income, except as covered below under the special rules for allocations to minor beneficiaries. Allocations of beneficiary income to a minor A minor is defined as a New Zealand resident under the age of 16 years on the balance date of the trust. Allocations of beneficiary income that the minor beneficiary rule applies to are treated as trustee income. This means they are: • • taxed at 33% • • included in the trustee's tax calculation in the IR6 return, and • • included in the trustees' provisional tax calculations. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE15 As these amounts are distributions of the trust, those trusts that are required to comply with the NZ Domestic Trust disclosure rules will still need to complete an IR6B for the minor beneficiary to disclose the amount of the distribution. Refer to Question 33 of the guide to see if your trust needs to comply. The minor beneficiary should not include this income in their Individual income tax return - IR3. Exceptions to the minor beneficiary rule The following exceptions allow income allocated to a minor beneficiary to be treated as beneficiary income if the income: • • is derived by a minor for whom a child disability allowance is paid under the Social Security Act 2018 • • is derived directly from either a group investment fund, the Māori trustee or a Māori authority, or • • the amount allocated to the minor from the trust is $1,000 or less in an income year. Note If the $1,000 threshold is exceeded, the total income allocated to the minor beneficiary is taxed as trustee income. For example, if a minor beneficiary is allocated $1,200, the total amount of $1,200 is taxed at 33%. The general anti-avoidance rule may apply if a person establishes multiple trusts to increase the number of exemptions. See Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 19, No 4 (May 2007) for further information. There are further exceptions to the minor beneficiary rule that relate to the nature of the settlements on the trust. For more information, please see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 19, No 4 (May 2007) ird.govt.nz 16 Return due date If the estate or trust has a 31 March balance date, you have until 7 July 2024 to send in the return, unless you have been granted an extension of time. Contact us if you're not sure of the filing date. If the estate or trust is the client of an agent, it may have until 31 March 2025 to complete the return. If this applies, contact your agent. International obligations You may also need to provide information about a trust to comply with the following international obligations. The Common Reporting Standard (CRS) For more information see: • • IR Guidance on the CRS - IR1048 section 11 • • CRS: Is the Trust a Reporting Financial Institution - IR1052 • • Family Trust obligations under the CRS - IR1053 • • ird.govt.nz/crs Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) For more information see: • • FATCA Trusts Guidance - IR1087 • • FATCA status of NZ trusts that are not US person - IR1086 • • ird.govt.nz/fatca ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE17 Questions Questions 1 to 6 The information in Questions 1 to 6 of the return helps us to be sure that any correspondence we send goes to the right person at the right address. Fill in these questions only if the correct information is not printed on the return. Question 1 IRD number If the estate or trust does not have an IRD number, complete an IRD number application - resident non-individual - IR596 and send it in with the return. Question 2 Name of estate or trust If the estate or trust has changed its name since the last time a return was completed, please provide proof of the change so we can update our records, for example trustee resolution. Questions 3 and 4 Postal address and phone number If you have a new postal address, write the details at Question 3. If your new postal address is a PO Box number, show your box lobby if you have one. If you are unsure of your box lobby please contact New Zealand Post. If the estate or trust uses its tax preparer's postal address, leave this panel blank. The tax preparer will let us know if they change their address. We ask for your daytime phone number at Question 4 in case we need to call you with questions about the return. ird.govt.nz 18 Question 5 Business industry classification (BIC) code We're required to supply the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) with a code for your business or trading activity, for levy classification and calculation. If your BIC code is not pre-printed on the return or is different from the pre-printed one, enter the correct code. To work out your main business or trading activity and its code, go to businessdescription.co.nz or call ACC on 0800 222 776. It's important that you choose the code which most accurately reflects your main business or trading activity. Note Please provide the code only. Do not provide a description. Question 6 Bank account number The fastest and safest way to get any refund is to have it direct credited to your New Zealand bank account or other deposit account, for example a building society account. If your bank account number is not preprinted on the return form, include it at Question 6. If your suffix has only 2 digits, enter them in the first 2 squares of the suffix box. Question 7A Has the estate or trust ceased? If the estate or trust has ceased, include the resolution of winding up or deed of distribution showing that assets have been distributed and the trust wound up. Ensure you include the final distributions to beneficiaries on the IR6B forms (see questions 27A to 27AD). If the estate or trust is registered for GST or as an employer, you'll need to complete a Business cessation - IR315 form to finalise your records. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE19 Question 7B Nil trust or estate returns If the trust, estate or testamentary trust (trust created by a person under their will) receives any income the trustee must complete a return and meet certain reporting obligations. However, if the income is below set thresholds and certain criteria are met, they can be excused from filing returns by completing the Non-active trust declaration – IR633. If the trust subsequently becomes active eg derives income in a future year, the trust must send in a return. Non active return filing and reporting thresholds and criteria are; Trust and Estates • • Reportable income of $1,000 or less, • • No deductions, • • Not involved in any transactions that give income to a related person or entity, • • No transactions that give a benefit subject to FBT to a current or former employee. Costs and payments that do not affect your trust’s non-active status: • • Reasonable fees for administering the trust • • Bank charges or minimal administrative costs that are $1,500 or less for the year • • Insurance, rates, interest, and other costs related to living in a house owned by the trust and incurred by the beneficiaries of the trust. Testamentary Trust • • Reportable income of $5,000 or less • • Non-reportable income of up to $1,000 with deductions that would reduce the net income to below $200. Question 8 Types of trusts The type of trust determines the way certain distributions are taxed in the hands of beneficiaries. There are 3 types of estates or trusts for income tax purposes: • • complying ird.govt.nz 20 • • foreign, and • • non-complying. Complying trust In general, a complying trust is one that has been taxed in New Zealand on all its trustee income since the date it began and the trustee has met all its tax obligations. Complying trusts include: • • trusts settled by New Zealand residents with New Zealand trustees and New Zealand beneficiaries • • estates of people who were New Zealand residents when they died, and • • foreign trusts that have elected to become complying trusts. The trust can still be a complying trust if the trustee was not liable for New Zealand income tax because: • • the trust earned no income • • the income was exempt, or • • the trust was in a loss situation. Foreign trust A foreign trust is one where no settlor of the trust has been resident in New Zealand since 17 December 1987, or the date the trust was first settled, whichever is later, and on the date of distribution. Non-complying trust A trust that is not a complying trust or a foreign trust is a non-complying trust. Non-complying trusts include: • • trusts with a New Zealand-resident settlor, but non- resident trustees, that have not been liable for or have not paid New Zealand income tax on all trustee income since first being settled • • foreign trusts where the settlor has become a New Zealand resident and an election has not been made to be a complying trust, and • • trusts where all the beneficiaries are non-residents and all the income is passive income such as interest, dividends, and royalties. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE21 Election to change category of trust for tax purposes New residents or former residents who have settled a trust before coming to New Zealand may elect to pay New Zealand tax on future trustee income. Making this election will mean the trust becomes a complying trust for income derived on or after the date on which the election is made. An election can be made by a settlor, trustee or beneficiary using an Election to pay income tax on trustee income - IR463 form. If an election is not made the trust will become a non- complying trust. Elections must be made within 12 months of a new resident ceasing to be a transitional resident and within 12 months of the arrival for a former resident. Unit trust A unit trust is treated as a company for tax purposes. If you're preparing a tax return for a unit trust, please complete a Companies income tax return - IR4. Group investment fund If the income is: • • solely from Category B income, an IR6 must be completed • • solely from Category A income, an IR4 must be completed, or • • a combination of both Category A and Category B income, an IR4 and IR44E must be completed. Please read the notes on the IR44E for more information. Superannuation schemes A superannuation scheme that is not registered with the Financial Markets Authority and does not allow investors to contribute will be treated as a trust for tax purposes and must complete an IR6 return. Income and credits section Income received by a trust retains its character as it passes through the trust. For this reason we ask that you return different types of income in certain boxes. ird.govt.nz 22 Question 9 New Zealand interest Include interest from all New Zealand sources at Question 9. The interest payer will usually send you an RWT withholding certificate showing the gross interest paid and the amount of RWT deducted. Write the total of all RWT deducted in Box 9A. Add up all the gross interest amounts (before the deduction of any tax) and write the total in Box 9B. Note If expenses are deductible against the interest income (for example commission), claim them at Question 22. Read about expenses on page 52. Do not send us interest statements or IR15 certificates with the return. Keep these in case we ask for them later Interest on broken term deposits If you've broken a term deposit during the year, you may have to account for negative interest. This is interest repaid on a term deposit and may reduce the amount of interest to declare in your return. If the term deposit was broken in full, or it was business related, deduct the negative interest from the gross interest shown on the IR15 or equivalent statement. Deduct the allowable negative interest component, using the worksheet below, before entering the gross amount at Box 9B on your return. In all other cases, the negative interest is deductible in a future income year when the term deposit matures. Worksheet Copy your gross interest from your RWT withholding certificate to Box 1. 1 Print any negative interest you've paid in Box 2. 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the answer in Box 3. Copy this amount to Box 9B of your tax return. 3 ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE23 Interest paid or charged by Inland Revenue If we paid you interest, include it in Box 9B for the income year the trust received the interest. If the trust paid us interest, include it as a deduction in Box 22 of the return for the income year the interest is paid. Interest from overseas If the trust received interest from overseas, convert your overseas interest and tax credits to New Zealand dollars and show the amounts at Question 13. Read the notes about overseas income on pages 27 to 30. Income from financial arrangements The financial arrangement rules generally require income or expenditure from financial arrangements to be spread over the term of the arrangement. Financial arrangements include term deposits, government stock, local authority stock, mortgage bonds, futures contracts and deferred property settlements. Trustees are required to use a spreading method unless they are a cash basis person. A person is a cash basis person if: • • the value of all financial arrangements together is less than $1 million, or • • the value of the income or expenditure from the financial arrangement is less than $100,000, and • • the deferral of income or expenditure using the cash method rather than the actual method is less than $40,000. A special rule applies for deceased persons. If the deceased person was a cash basis person at the date of death, the concession applies in the year of death and up to 4 succeeding years. Any RWT from a financial arrangement will be deducted on a cash basis. Different rules apply for financial arrangements entered into prior to 20 May 1999. ird.govt.nz 24 Sale or maturity of financial arrangements Whether or not the exemption from the spreading methods explained earlier applies, when a financial arrangement matures or is sold, remitted, or transferred, a "wash-up" calculation known as a base-price adjustment must be carried out. Cash basis persons can use the Sale or disposal of financial arrangements - IR3K to perform the calculation. This form could be used, for example, to calculate the amount you need to account for if you have broken a term deposit in full. For more information about the financial arrangements rules, please see Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 11, No 6 (July 1999), page 3. Any RWT will be deducted on a cash basis. Question 10 New Zealand dividends Dividends are the part of a company's profits that it passes on to its shareholders. Unit trusts are treated as companies for income tax purposes. Distributions from unit trusts will generally be taxable and are treated as dividends. Note All the trust's cash and taxable bonus issue dividends derived from a qualifying company must be distributed by the trustees as beneficiary income to the beneficiaries who are not trustees or companies that are not qualifying companies. Complete Question 10 if you received any New Zealand dividends, including dividends from your local electricity or gas supplier. Do not include a dividend that's a distribution of the trust's capital and is tax free. The company or unit trust that paid you the dividend will send you a dividend statement. Do not send us any dividend statements with the return, keep them in case we ask for them later. Note If expenses are deductible against the dividend income, claim them at Question 22. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE25 Credits attached to dividends "Imputation credits" are credits for part of the tax the company has already paid on its profits, which means the dividends are not taxed twice. RWT is deducted from your dividend to bring the total credits withheld up to 33% of the gross dividend. What to show in your return Your dividend statements show the amount: • • you received (net dividend) • • of any imputation credits, and • • of any RWT credits. Add all these amounts together to work out your total gross dividends and enter this in Box 10B. Add up all the imputation credits and print the total in Box 10. Add any dividend RWT credits and print the total in Box 10A. Shares instead of dividends If the trust received shares instead of dividends, include them as income at Question 10B. Write the amount as if you received dividends instead of shares. Dividends from overseas Please read about overseas income on pages 27 to 30 of this guide. Question 11 Māori authority distributions Māori authorities can make various types of distributions. Fill in Question 11 if you received any taxable Māori authority distributions. The Māori authority that paid you the distribution will send you a Māori authority distribution statement. Credits attached to distributions The Māori authority may attach a credit to the distribution it makes to members. This credit will be classified as a Maori authority credit and is part of the tax the Maori authority has ird.govt.nz 26 already paid on its profits, so the distributions are not taxed twice. What to show in your return Your Māori authority distribution statement shows the amount of: • • the distribution made to you, including the taxable portion and the non-taxable portion, and • • Māori authority credit. Transfer these amounts, leaving out any non-taxable distributions, to the relevant boxes at Question 11. Non-taxable distribution You do not need to include in the IR6 return any other distributions received from a Māori authority that are not taxable in the hands of a Māori authority member. These amounts are non-taxable distributions and cannot have credits attached. For more information read our Māori authorities guide - IR487. Question 12 Partnership, estate or trust income Partnership If the estate or trust received any income from a partnership, write the details at Question 12. Do not include: • • interest and RWT (include these at Question 9) • • any dividends, imputation credits or dividend RWT (include these at Question 10) • • any Māori authority dividends and Māori authority credits (include these at Question 11) • • any overseas income and qualifying tax credits attached (include these at Question 13) or, • • income and expenses from residential property including rental income and net bright-line profit (include these at Question 15). ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE27 Estate or trust If the estate or trust has received income from a foreign or non-complying trust, complete a Schedule of beneficiary's estate or trust income - IR307 and attach it to the return. Add up all the other income from partnerships, complying and foreign trusts, and write the total in Box 12B. Add up any other tax credits and write the total in Box 12A. Do not include: • • interest and RWT (include these at Question 9) • • any dividends, imputation credits or dividend RWT (include these at Question 10) • • any Māori authority dividends and Māori authority credits (include these at Question 11), or • • any overseas income and qualifying tax credits attached (include these at Question 13). If the estate or trust has received a taxable distribution from a non-complying trust, do not include the amount as income. Calculate tax on the taxable distribution at 45 cents in the dollar and add it to the amount in Box 28B. You can use a loss to reduce the amount of the taxable distribution. Net losses brought forward from an earlier income year and losses incurred in the 2024 income year can be used to reduce the amount. If a loss is used in this way it is no longer available to offset other income. The reduction is calculated using the following formula: (Tax loss × 0.33) ÷ 0.45 Losses from limited partnerships If the estate or trust is claiming a loss from a limited partnership and you need help working out the amount that can be claimed, go to ird.govt.nz/index/calculators-and-tools Question 13 Overseas income If the trust received overseas income, for example interest or financial arrangements, show this at Question 13. Convert all overseas income and qualifying overseas tax paid to New Zealand dollars. You can do this by: ird.govt.nz 28 • • using the rates available on ird.govt.nz/managing-my-tax • • contacting the overseas section of a trading bank and asking for the exchange rate for the day you received your overseas income. Include any overseas income and credits which you received from a partnership, look-through company (LTC), estate or trust here. Include gross income before deducting any tax credits at Box 13B. Credit for tax paid overseas will be limited to the amount of New Zealand tax payable on that income. How overseas income of an estate or trust is taxed In New Zealand, overseas income is taxed according to the residency of the settlor. The rules for the 3 most common situations are described over the page. New Zealand resident trustees and income derived outside New Zealand As a general rule, where a trustee is resident in New Zealand, and the trustee derives an amount from outside New Zealand, that income will be income of the trustee. The amount will be exempt income of the trustee if: • • no settlor of the trust except a transitional resident is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year, or • • that trust is not a testamentary trust (trust created by a person under their will) or an inter vivos trust (trust created by the settlor during their lifetime) where any settlor of the trust died resident in New Zealand, whether in that income year or otherwise. Non-resident trustees and income derived outside of New Zealand A non-resident trustee is also liable for New Zealand income tax on income derived from outside New Zealand where: • • any settlor is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year, or ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE29 • • any settlor of an inter vivos or a testamentary trust died while they were resident in New Zealand, and a trustee is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year. Exceptions to the general rule for non-resident trustees and income derived outside New Zealand There are 2 situations in which a non-resident trustee is not liable for income tax on trustee income derived from outside New Zealand. These apply where the trustee is resident outside New Zealand at all times during the income year and either: • • no settlement has been made on the trust since 17 December 1987, or • • the only settlements made on the trust were by settlors who were not resident in New Zealand at the time of settlement and who have not been residents in New Zealand since 17 December 1987. Neither exception applies where an election to pay tax on trustee income has been made by the trustee. These exceptions do not affect the liability for income tax for any settlor of the trust, for example, where the settlor elects to pay tax on trustee income. The trustee income remains liable for income tax for the purpose of determining whether the trust is a complying trust (formerly qualifying trust). Overseas dividends If you are a New Zealand resident trustee and at any time during the 2024 income year you held rights such as shares, units or an entitlement to benefit in any foreign company, foreign trust, foreign superannuation scheme, or foreign life insurance policy, you may be required to calculate foreign investment fund (FIF) income or loss on those investments and include this amount in Box 13B. Generally, you will use the fair dividend rate to calculate FIF income. The trustees may also need to complete an additional FIF disclosure form. For more information read the guide to Question 26 on page 56. ird.govt.nz 30 You will not need to do this if the investment is covered by an exclusion. The main exclusions from an interest in an FIF are: • • investments in certain Australian resident companies listed on approved indices on the Australian stock exchange, that maintain franking accounts. Investments covered in the list are available at ird.govt.nz/fif in the Australian share exemption list - IR871 • • interest in certain Australian units • • limited exemptions for interests in certain venture capital • • limited exemptions for interests in certain venture capital interests that move offshore (for 10 or more income years from the income year in which the company migrates from New Zealand), and • • a 10% or greater interest in a controlled foreign company (CFC). A limited number of trusts are also excluded from the rules if the attributing interests are below $50,000. These are: • • a testamentary trust • • a compensatory trust, or • • where the settlor of the trust is the Accident Compensation Corporation. If the exclusions apply and the trust is under the threshold, include dividends received in Box 13B and any qualifying overseas tax credits in Box 13A. Note If your dividend exceeds your FIF income, the amount of imputation credit you can claim is calculated on the basis of your FIF income. If your FIF income exceeds your dividend, you can claim the entire imputation credit attached to the dividend. Any excess imputation credit cannot be carried forward to the next year or converted to a loss. Please note you cannot claim Australian franking credits. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE31 For more information about the FIF rules read A guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate - IR461, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 19, No 3 (April 2007) page 28, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 20, No 3 (April 2008) page 110, or go to ird.govt.nz/fif CFC income or loss If at any time during the 2024 income year the trust has attributed CFC income or loss, the trustees or beneficiaries may be required to calculate this in their own income tax returns. A loss from a CFC cannot be used to offset domestic income or be included in domestic losses that are carried forward to the 2025 income year. Generally, these losses can only offset income or future income from CFCs that are resident in the same country as the CFC that incurred the loss. The trustees may also need to complete an additional CFC disclosure form. See Question 26 on page 56. Investments in portfolio investment entities (PIEs) and portfolio investor attributed income/loss If you have chosen a prescribed investor rate (PIR) of 28% the income or loss attributed by a multi-rate PIE is not included in the estate or trust’s return. If you chose a PIR of 10.5% or 17.5% the attributed income is included in the return but you cannot include an attributed loss. If you chose a PIR of 0% the attributed income or loss is included in the trust’s return. The attributed PIE income/loss is included in the estate or trust’s return for the period that includes the end of the PIE’s income year. PIEs usually have a 31 March balance date. If you receive dividends from a listed PIE that does not use your PIR, you may choose whether to include the dividends in your return. Distributions by a multi-rate PIE are excluded income of the estate or trust and are not included in the return. More information is available in our guide Information for trustees who invest in PIEs - IR856. ird.govt.nz 32 Question 14 Look-through company (LTC) income If the estate or trust received any tax credits and/or income from an LTC write the details at Question 14. Do not include any of the following types of income received from an LTC at Question 14: • • interest and RWT (include these at Question 9) • • any dividends, imputation credits, and dividend RWT (include these at Question 10) • • Māori authority distributions and credits (include these at Question 11) • • any overseas income and qualifying tax credits attached (include these at Question 13), or • • income and expenses from residential property including rental income and net bright-line profit (include this at Question 15). The loss limitation rule limits the amount of deductions an LTC owner (shareholder) can claim if the amount exceeds the "owner's basis" (equity) in the LTC. For the 2017-18 and later income years, the loss limitation rule only applies to an LTC which is in a partnership or joint venture which includes another LTC. The estate or trust can now claim the full amount of prior years' non-allowable deductions brought forward this year. This will not apply if the loss limitation rule continues to apply to limit the amount claimable. The LTC will normally supply information about the non- allowable deductions and any other information required to complete your return. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE33 Example Trust A is an owner of an LTC which is not in a partnership or joint venture that includes another LTC. For the 2022 - 23 income year Trust A has a net loss of $4,000.00 from the LTC. Trust A also has prior years' non-allowable deductions brought forward of $5,000.00. Trust A had no tax credits from the LTC for the year. Trust A's tax return should show the following amounts in the following boxes: • • 14A: $0.00 • • 14B: $4,000.00 - • • 14C: $0.00 • • 14D: $5,000.00 • • 14E: $9,000.00 - What to show on your return Add up all other tax credits received from the LTC and print the total in Box 14A. Add up all LTC income, deduct expenses not already included elsewhere and print in Box 14B. If a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Add up all non-allowable deductions this year and print in Box 14C. There should not be non-allowable deductions this year unless the loss limitation rule applies. Add up all prior year non-allowable deductions claimable this year and print the amount in Box 14D. You'll be able to claim the full amount of non-allowable deductions brought forward from last year if the loss limitation rule no longer applies. If you have an amount in Box 14C, add this to Box 14B and put the total in Box 14E. If you have an amount in Box 14D, subtract this from Box 14B and put the total in Box 14E. ird.govt.nz 34 If you do not have any amounts in Box 14C or Box 14D, copy the amount from Box 14B to 14E. Box 14E is your adjusted LTC income. You can find more information about LTCs in the Look- through companies - IR879 guide. Question 15 Income and expenses from residential property This question applies to owners of residential property, including overseas property, that have: • • income subject to the residential property deduction rules • • net income from a bright-line sale • • income in relation to a loan in a foreign currency • • depreciation recovery income from disposed assets • • net income from the taxable disposal of a residential property outside the residential property deduction rules because it is held on revenue account. Residential property deduction rules Most residential rental properties are subject to the residential property deduction rules (also known as the ring-fencing rules). When they apply, your residential rental deductions generally cannot be more than your residential property income. If your deductions are more than your income, the difference must be carried forward to the next year you earn income from your residential property, including income from properties held on revenue account. Any rental income or loss and net income or loss from a taxable disposal is fully excluded from the rules if the property is: • • the main home • • property subject to the mixed-use asset rules (for example, a holiday home rented out part-time and not used for at least 62 days in the income year, or 62 working days in the income year if it’s usually only used on working days), or • • certain employee accommodation. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE35 For these types of property, any rental income or loss is shown at Box 17B and net income or net loss from a taxable disposal shown at Box 18B. Any rental net loss and net loss from a taxable disposal is partially excluded from the rules if it is for: • • property that will always be taxed on sale, being revenue account property of a person in the business of building, developing or dealing in land, or • • other revenue account property the person has notified us they want the exclusion to apply to. For these types of property any rental net loss is shown at Box 17B and taxable disposal net loss shown at Box 18B. The residential property deduction rules also apply if you borrowed money to acquire an interest in certain entities that have significant rental property holdings - a residential land-rich entity - and you have interest expenditure on the borrowed money. Residential land-rich entity - a close company, partnership or look-through company that holds more than 50% of its assets by value in residential land, directly or indirectly. These entities come under the interposed entities rules as part of the residential property deduction rules. For more information about the interposed entity rules, see page 60 of the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No.8 September 2019. Read our Rental income - IR264 guide for more information on: • • when the rules apply • • how to calculate your income • • the amount of deductions you can claim this year, and • • the amount of any excess deductions that must be carried forward. Completing your return Tick the method you have used to calculate your residential property income and deductions. ird.govt.nz 36 You can use 1 of the following methods: • • Portfolio basis - combine income and deductions for all rental properties in the portfolio. • • Individual, property-by-property basis - income and deductions of individual property calculated separately to other property. You need to maintain separate records for each property to choose this option. • • Combination of the individual basis and portfolio basis - choose to apply different methods to different property. Some properties are held in a portfolio and others are held on an individual basis. If you are an owner of a look-through company (LTC) and have attributed residential income and/or residential rental deductions, you need to use the same method the LTC uses (portfolio or individual property basis) for the residential properties owned by the LTC. If you are a partner in a partnership and have attributed residential income and/ or residential rental deductions, you do not need to use the same method the partnership uses. You need to calculate and identify the amounts for Boxes 15A to 15I using the method you have chosen for your rental properties. For the portfolio basis, the allowable deductions from all of the properties in your portfolio can be offset against income you earn from all of the properties in the portfolio. Calculate your rental income and deductions as usual, as shown at Boxes 4 and 14 on the Rental income - IR3R form. You can then enter these figures in the Residential property deductions worksheets - IR1226 to help calculate the figures required to be entered in your return. You can print a copy off our website ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Write the gross residential rental income from the portfolio and/or individual property in Box 15A. Do not include rental income or losses from properties excluded from the residential property deduction rules. Enter those amounts in Question 17 instead. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE37 Box 15B Net bright-line profit The bright-line property rule needs to be considered when none of the other land sale rules at Question 18 apply to the disposal of the property. This rule for residential property looks at the length of time a property (including overseas property) is owned. If you sell or dispose of a residential property within a certain timeframe and no exclusion applies, then your profit on the sale will be taxable. This applies no matter what your reason was for buying or selling the property or what kind of buyer you are. The bright-line property rule applies if you sell or dispose of a residential property you have owned for less than: • • 5 years for properties acquired between 29 March 2018 and 26 March 2021. • • 5 years for properties acquired as a result of an offer made on or before 23 March 2021 and that offer was not able to be revoked or withdrawn before 27 March 2021. • • 5 years for properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021 that qualify as a ‘new build’. • • 10 years for all other properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021. For tax purposes, a property is generally acquired on the date a binding sale and purchase agreement is entered into (even if some standard conditions like getting finance or a building report still need to be met). This date will determine which bright-line period (5 or 10 years) applies for your property. For more information on when a property is acquired, see our Question we’ve been asked (QB) 17/02: Date of acquisition of land, and start date for 2-year bright-line test at taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz There are other dates that are relevant for figuring out whether your property sale is taxable under the bright- line property rule. Generally, your bright-line period starts when the legal title is transferred to you and ends when you enter into a binding sale and purchase agreement to sell the property. Where land is acquired or disposed of in a way that does not follow the standard land sale process, for example if you purchase “off the plan”, there are some different rules that apply to the bright-line period start and end dates. ird.govt.nz 38 The bright-line property rule does not tax any profit made while the property was your main home and to some other specific situations. Relief is also available for certain ownership transfers. For more information on exclusions to the bright-line property rule, ownership transfers and rollover relief go to ird.govt.nz/brightline or our guide Bright-line property tax - IR1227. You can also use the property tax decision tool on our website to work out if you need to pay tax on the sale of your property. Go to ird.govt.nz/brightline If you sell or dispose of a residential property and the sale is taxable under the bright-line property rule, the amount of the previously denied interest under the interest limitation rules is treated as if it were part of the cost of the property in the year of disposal. If this results in a net loss, the deduction for the net loss is limited under the current rule that applies to losses from the disposal of bright-line property. If the disposal is not taxable, the interest previously denied a deduction remains non-deductible. For more information about the bright-line property rule, go to ird.govt.nz/brightline or our guide Bright-line property tax - IR1227. You can find our forms and guides at ird.govt. nz/forms-guides Completing your return Income and losses for property subject to the bright-line property rule are treated differently in the tax return. After a taxable bright-line sale: • • if you have net income from the sale of the property (a profit), the net income is included in Box 15B. Unless the property is part of a portfolio, expenses from other properties cannot be offset against the net income from the disposal. • • if you have made a net loss when the property is sold, the loss must be carried forward to a later income year when it can be used to offset net income from the land sale provisions, including from future disposals subject to the bright-line rule. A bright-line loss is not recorded in the tax return. Please keep your own record of any bright-line losses you have made. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE39 Complete a Bright-line residential property sale information - IR833 form for each bright-line property sold or disposed of and include it with your return. The form explains how to calculate the resulting profit or loss. Complete the form even if the details have been included in a Financial statements summary - IR10 or set of accounts, unless the income will be included in your return as part of your business income as a property speculator, property dealer, developer or builder. Box 15C Other residential income Write the total other residential income in Box 15C. This includes the total from the following amounts: • • income in relation to a loan denominated in a foreign currency from the portfolio and/or individual property • • all depreciation recovery income from assets disposed of from the portfolio and/or individual property • • net income from the taxable disposal of a residential property outside the residential property deduction rules because it is held on revenue account. Write any net tax losses from disposals of rental properties that are excluded from the residential property deduction rules in Box 18B. Box 15D Total combined residential income The amount in Box 15D is the total amount of Box 15A, Box 15B and Box 15C. Note If you are a partner in a partnership or owner of a look- through company and have been attributed residential income at Box 27G on the IR7P or IR7L, include your share of that in proportion to your share in the partnership or effective look-through interest in the LTC in the following relevant boxes: • • Gross residential rental income Box 15A • • Net bright-line profit (excluding losses) Box 15B • • Other residential income Box 15C. The amount in Box 15D will then include the total of your attributed residential income at Box 27G on the IR7P or IR7L. ird.govt.nz 40 Boxes 15E to 15I in your return Write the total eligible deductions for the year for all ring- fenced residential rental properties in Residential rental deductions Box 15E. If you are a partner in a partnership or owner of a look- through company and have been attributed residential rental deductions shown at Box 27M on the IR7P or IR7L, include that here at Box 15E. Do not include purchase costs, capital improvements or costs incurred when disposing of the property here. They are included when calculating the net income for taxable disposals. This is the total before adjusting for excess deductions. Note Do not include the amount of interest expense denied under the interest limitation rules in Box 15E. Write the total excess deductions brought forward from last year in Box 15F. Write the total residential rental deductions claimed this year in Box 15G. This amount cannot exceed the lesser of the following: • • Total combined residential income Box 15D • • Residential rental deduction Box 15E plus Excess residential rental deductions brought forward Box 15F. The amount cannot exceed the above unless you have sold an individual property or the last property in a residential portfolio and the sale was taxable. The amount in Box 15H should equal Total combined residential income Box 15D minus Residential rental deductions claimed this year Box 15G. Any losses are counted as zero unless the loss is the result of either: • • excess deductions released from either a taxable disposal of a property held on the individual property basis, or a taxable disposal of all properties or the last property held in a portfolio, or ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE41 • • claimable interest paid on your investment in a residential land-rich entity. Refer to the Rental income - IR264 guide. Write the amount of all excess deductions for the year to be carried forward to next year in Box 15I. Note 1 If you sell or dispose of an individual property and the sale is not taxable, or you sell or dispose of the last property in a portfolio and at least 1 of the sales in the portfolio was not taxable, any excess deductions will transfer to another property or portfolio and carried forward to a future year in which you earn income from a residential rental property (including properties on revenue account). Note 2 If you sell or dispose of an individual property and the sale is taxable, or you sell or dispose of the last rental property in a portfolio, and the sale of all your rental properties in a portfolio were taxable, any remaining loss/ excess deductions are released and can be offset against other income. However, this does not include any excess deductions transferred to the portfolio/property. Note 3 If you want to claim that a property is held on revenue account where the sale may be taxable, you need to tell us the details of the property. You will be stating the sale will be a taxable sale when the property is disposed of. You must be able to separately identify the deductions relating to the property. Refer to the Rental income - IR264 guide. Residential land-rich entities If you have an investment in a land rich entity, include: • • interest relating to the residential rental activity that is deductible under the interest limitation rules in Box 15E ird.govt.nz 42 • • interest relating to the residential rental activity you can claim this year under the residential property deduction rules in Box 15G and any remaining amount carried forward in Box 15I • • a note attached to your income tax return advising the above amounts relate to an investment in a land rich entity, to ensure quick processing of your return • • the amount of interest paid that does not relate to the residential rental property in Box 17B. Question 16 Interest incurred from residential property This question applies to owners of residential property subject to the interest limitation rules. You do not need to complete this question for the following types of property: • • farmland • • hospitals, hospices, convalescent homes, nursing homes • • rest homes and retirement villages • • hotels, motels, inns, camping grounds, hostels. For interest to be deductible, the general deductibility rules must be met. The interest will also not be deductible to the extent it is of a private or domestic nature. Since 1 October 2021, interest is not deductible for residential property in New Zealand acquired on or after 27 March 2021, unless an exclusion or exemption applies (see below). For property acquired before 27 March 2021, the ability to deduct interest on existing loans is limited to a percentage of the interest incurred. For the 2024 tax year, you can claim 50% of the interest incurred from 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024. Interest on any new loans drawn down on or after 27 March 2021 is not deductible. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE43 Special rules also apply for refinanced loans and for interest on revolving credit and overdraft facilities. Any interest on borrowings above the closing balance on 26 March 2021 is not deductible. For more information, go to ird.govt.nz/property-interest-rules There are interposed entity rules to deny interest deductions for a customer who borrows to indirectly fund residential property through an interposed entity. What to show in your return Complete question 16 for any interest expense you are claiming in this income tax return at Boxes 15E and 17B in relation to a house, apartment, flat or other structure that could be used for residential accommodation, either short stays or long term. This includes if you have an arrangement to build such a structure, and bare land that could be used to build such a structure under the relevant district plan. Write the total interest on residential property in Box 16A. This is the total interest incurred on your borrowings for all your residential properties for this year. If you are using an IR3R form to prepare a summary for each rental property, this is the total of all the 7A Boxes. Write the amount of interest expense claimed in Box 16B. If you are using an IR3R form to prepare a summary for each rental property, this is the total of all the 7B Boxes. Note If you are a partner in a partnership or owner of a look- through company that has incurred interest on residential property at Question 19 in the IR7, include your share of that here in proportion to your share in the partnership or effective look-through interest in the LTC. If you have claimed an interest expense in Box 16B, at Box 16C tick the reason(s) for the interest expense claimed: • • A Māori exempt company or not a residential land company - The interest limitation rules do not apply to non-close companies or groups if less than 50% of its total assets consist of residential property (excluding development property but including shares in other ird.govt.nz 44 companies that exceed this 50% test) at all times during the income year. A close company that is a Māori authority, eligible to be a Māori authority, or wholly-owned by an entity that is a Māori authority or eligible to be one is an exempt Māori company if it passes this 50% test. • • Certain schedule 15 exclusions or property not in NZ - The interest limitation rules apply to land in New Zealand only. Schedule 15 of the Income Tax Act 2007 also allows you to claim interest for the following: • • main home – if a portion is used to earn income such as a flatting situation • • business premises (for example, a villa now used as a dental clinic) except if the business premises is used for providing accommodation and it’s not a person’s main home • • certain Māori land, papakāinga and kaumātua housing, and land transferred as part of settlement under Te Tiriti o Waitangi/Treaty of Waitangi • • employee accommodation • • student accommodation. • • Loans drawn down prior to 27 March 2021 - When an exclusion or exemption does not apply, you can claim 50% of the interest incurred for the following situations: • • loans drawn down prior to 27 March 2021 • • property acquired before 27 March 2021 but the loan for the settlement of the property was not drawn down until on or after 27 March 2021 • • loans that relate to the purchase of a property acquired as a result of an offer made on or before 23 March 2021 and that offer was not able to be revoked or withdrawn before 27 March 2021. In other situations where the property is acquired on or after 27 March 2021, interest cannot be claimed. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE45 • • Emergency, transitional, social or council housing - You can claim interest for loans if your property is used for emergency, transitional or social housing when leased or contracted (directly or indirectly) to the Crown, for example to Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga - the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) or Kāinga Ora, or to a registered community housing provider. • • New build exemption - A ‘new build’ is a self-contained residence that is issued a Code Compliance Certificate (CCC) under the Building Act 2004, confirming the residence was added to the land on or after 27 March 2020. The exemption generally applies for 20 years. For more information about what qualifies as a new build go to ird.govt.nz/property/renting-out-residential- property or our guide Rental income - IR264. • • Development or land business exemption - The development exemption does not require you to have a ‘land business’ and applies to land that you develop, subdivide, or build on to create a new build. The development may be a one-off. The land business exemption applies to land held as part of a developing, subdividing, or land-dealing business, or a business of erecting buildings on land. • • Approved build-to-rent exclusion - This applies to land that meets the criteria of build-to-rent land and is approved by Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga - Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). You can claim interest for loans if your property is recorded on the build-to-rent asset register maintained by HUD. Existing build-to-rent land has until 1 July 2023 to meet the requirements and to apply. For more information about the interest limitation rules and how to calculate the amount of interest you can claim, go to ird.govt.nz/property-interest-rules or our guide Rental income - IR264. You can find our forms and guides at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides ird.govt.nz 46 Question 17 Business or rental income If the estate or trust has business or rental income (other than residential rental income see question 15), you must attach either: • • a fully completed Financial statements summary - IR10 form, or • • a set of the estate or trust's financial accounts for the year. The IR10 summarises the information we need from the financial accounts. If you complete an IR10 you do not need to send us your financial accounts, but you still need to complete and keep them. Business income Write the net profit in Box 17B. This is the amount of income or net loss after all allowable business expenditure has been deducted. If the total is a loss, put a minus sign in the last box at Box 17B. When calculating business income, you can use the Schedule of business income - IR3B. Rental income If there is rental income other than residential rental income, print the net profit or loss (total rents minus expenses) in Box 17B. When calculating rental income you can use the Rental income - IR3R. Attribution rule Under the attribution rule, anyone whose actions cause an associated person (company, trust or partnership) to earn income, can be personally liable for tax on that income. If this rule applies to persons associated with your estate or trust, it will affect the amount of taxable income in this return. For more information read our Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 12 (December 2000) page 49 and TIB, Vol 13, No 11 (November 2001). ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE47 Question 18 Income from taxable property sales or disposals Include all income and tax losses from land sales or disposals of other property not included at Question 15. Profits from land sales are taxable if you bought a property (including an overseas property) for the purpose of reselling it or are in the business of buying and selling land and/or buildings. The profits may also be taxable if the estate or trust: • • is a builder and improved a property before selling it • • developed or subdivided land and sold sections, or • • had a change of zoning on the property and sold it within ten years of buying it. Write the total profit or loss from the sale or disposal of other property in Box 18B. Net profit from a bright-line sale is generally included in Box 15B. Only include in Box 18B the net profit from a bright-line sale excluded at Question 15, for example the bright-line sale of a mixed-use asset. Do not include any net loss from a bright-line sale. For more information on the land sale rules, go to ird.govt.nz/buying-selling or our guide Tax and your property transactions - IR361. You can find our forms and guides at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Box 18A Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) credit The estate or trust can claim a credit for RLWT deducted from the sale of a property. If more than 1 amount was deducted, show the combined amount. Show the amount of RLWT deducted, less any RLWT paid back to the estate or trust and/or transferred to outstanding amounts. Show the name of the estate or trust's withholder in the "Name of payer" box. ird.govt.nz 48 Question 19 Other income At Question 19 show any other income received by the estate or trust, for example income from: • • any undertaking or scheme • • sale of non-FIF shares or other property • • sale or disposal of assets • • any schedular payments received by a trust • • certain settlements on a trust, or • • forgiveness of debt. Read the following sections for more information on the above items. Income from any undertaking or scheme Profits made from any undertaking or scheme entered into for the purpose of making a profit, are taxable to the estate or trust. On a separate piece of paper include what the undertaking or scheme was and list the details of income and expenses from these undertakings and schemes. Attach it to page 3 of the return and include the total profit in Box 20B. Income from sale of non-FIF shares or other property Profits from the sale of shares or other property are taxable if the estate or trust: • • buys and sells shares or other property as a business, or • • buys shares or other property for the purpose of resale. This does not apply if the shares are FIFs. List the details of income and expenses from these sales on a sheet of paper and staple it to page 3 of the return. Include the total profit in Box 18B. Losses from shares or other property that are not a foreign investment fund (FIF) If the estate or trust has made a loss from the sale of an asset that was not a FIF and can show that any profit made would have been taxable, it may be able to claim the loss as a deduction. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE49 Sale or disposal of assets There are a number of rules that apply to the sale or disposal of assets. For more information read Part 3 of our guide Depreciation - a guide for business - IR260. PAYE income accrued to date of death The following types of PAYE income must be returned by the estate if it is accrued to the date of death and subsequently received by the estate: • • salary or wages • • holiday pay or other leave payments • • director's fees, and • • any other PAYE income (includes schedular payments). Include the total gross amount in Box 20B and any tax credits in Box 20A. This income is assessed as trustee income. Certain settlements on a trust The following settlements of property on a trust are deemed to be trustee income. This means that these settlements of property are excluded from the definition of corpus: • • property settled by a trustee of another trust, so long as it would have counted as income if that trust had distributed the property to 1 of its beneficiaries instead. • • a settlement of a property on a trust, which, if not for the settlement, would have constituted: - income of the settlor, or - a dividend for which the settlor would have been liable to deduct an FDP (foreign dividend payment), formerly dividend withholding payment, if the settlor is currently resident or had been resident in New Zealand and subject to income tax at that time. Forgiveness of debt The financial arrangements rules treat debts that do not have to be repaid because they have been forgiven as income to the debtor. There is an exception in the case of trusts if the creditor is a natural person and forgives the debt: • • due to "natural love and affection" for natural persons who are beneficiaries of the trust, or ird.govt.nz 50 • • of a trust that was established mainly for the benefit of charitable organisations. If the debt forgiven is distributed to a non-qualifying beneficiary, the trustee can be liable for tax. For more information, please see our Tax Information Bulletin Vol 11, No 6 (July 1999) page 20. Question 20 Total income & total tax credits Add up Boxes 9B to 13B, 14E, 15H, and 17B to 19B. Write the total in Box 20B. Add up Boxes 9A to 14A, 17A and 19A. Write the total in Box 20A. Do not include Box 10 in this total. Question 21 Income allocation Income derived by a trustee must be allocated between beneficiary income and trustee income in boxes 21A and 21B respectively. Question 21A Beneficiary income excluding minor beneficiaries Beneficiary income is income of an estate or trust that vests in a beneficiary during the year or is paid to a beneficiary (or credited to them or dealt with in their interest or on their behalf) during the year or within a certain period after the end of the year. The rest of the income generated by an estate or trust will be trustee income. The income available to allocate to beneficiaries may be the income in Box 20B but it is important to note that Box 20B is a total of various amounts of estate or trust income. Some of the amounts, such as income from rental activities, are net amounts, for example after deductions. Some of the deductions may be for non-cash outgoings, such as depreciation. This may result in there being income that can be distributed to beneficiaries despite Box 20B showing a loss, and providing the trust deed allows it. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE51 This means there may be amounts that vest in or are paid to beneficiaries that have to be treated as beneficiary income. Identify any such vesting or payment and include the amount in Box 21A. The total must reconcile with the combined totals of Boxes 27I on the IR6B after deducting any taxable distributions included in Box 27H. Timing of allocation of beneficiary income Allocation of income to a beneficiary must be made within the income year, or by the later of the following: • • 6 months after balance date, or • • the earlier of: - the date on which the trustee completes the return of income for the income year, or - the date by which the trustee must complete a return for the income year. Example A family trust is allocating income to beneficiaries for the year ended 31 March 2024. The trust return is due on 7 July 2024 and the trust plans to complete by 30 June. The income should be allocated by the later of the following: • • 30 September 2024, or • • the earlier of: -30 June 2024, or -7 July 2024. In this case the income must be allocated by September 2024. If the trust has a tax preparer, the extension of time for completing income tax returns may apply. Question 21B Trustee income including minor beneficiaries Trustee income is any income generated by an estate or trust that is not beneficiary income, see "Question 21A - Beneficiary income" on pages 50 and 51. It includes income accrued to date of death and received afterwards. ird.govt.nz 52 Note From the 2022 - 2023 year a Trustee can choose whether to either include reportable income received up to 28 days following death in the Estate return, or in the Return to date of death. Where Box 20B shows a loss, there will be no trustee income and Box 21B should be left blank. The loss in Box 20B will be taken into account by us in calculating the loss to carry forward. Accrued income and non-apportionment clauses As a general rule, accrued income to date of death is retained by the trustee and becomes part of the capital of the estate. This income is treated as trustee income. However, where the will of the deceased taxpayer contains a non-apportionment clause, the beneficiary is entitled to receive the income accrued to date of death. So, if the accrued income is paid to the beneficiary, it's treated as beneficiary income. Question 22 Expenses The estate or trust may have incurred expenses in generating its income, for example: • • commission deducted from interest or dividends • • expenses for return preparation • • deductible trustee charges, or • • interest paid to Inland Revenue. If these expenses have not been claimed elsewhere in the return, write the amount claimed in Box 22. Note Certain expenditure is not deductible and this includes: • • private expenditure, and • • capital expenditure. Penalties may apply if it is claimed incorrectly. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE53 Question 23 Net losses brought forward There are 2 types of losses the estate or trust can bring forward. Specified activity net losses These are net losses from specified activities incurred before the 1991 income year. Any loss balance in relation to a specified activity that remained at the end of the 2023 income year must be offset against net income for the 2024 income year, before taking into account other losses. The amount of this offset cannot exceed the net income. If the loss balance from specified activities incurred before the 1991 income year exceeds the net income for the 2024 income year, that excess amount is added to the tax loss for the year. Any remaining tax loss is then carried forward to further income years. Other net losses All losses incurred from the 1991 income year onwards and other net losses that were not limited before 1991 (including any net loss resulting from excess imputation credits) are "other net losses". Enter the total of all specified activity net losses and other net losses the estate or trust can bring forward to 2024 in Box 23A. Enter the amount the estate or trust has offset against 2024 income in Box 23B. Note You'll find the amount of net loss the estate or trust has to bring forward on the loss notice we sent you with the 2023 income tax assessment. If you do not have a loss notice, contact us to obtain the figure. Losses cannot be transferred from the deceased's return to the estate's return. Any such losses lapse. Trust losses cannot be passed to beneficiaries. They remain in the trust to be offset against future trustee income. If the estate or trust cannot offset any losses in 2024, enter "0.00" in Box 23B. ird.govt.nz 54 Questions 24 and 25 Distributions to beneficiaries by foreign and non- complying trusts Question 24 Distributions At Question 24 print the total amount of distributions made to beneficiaries during the year. A distribution is any income or property of the trust that vests in the beneficiary or is paid or applied for a beneficiary's benefit. It includes any property or service disposed of or provided to: • • a beneficiary for less than market value, or • • the trust by a beneficiary for greater than market value. Attach a separate schedule to page 3 of the return showing the source and the amount of each distribution. Distributions are considered to have come from different sources in the following order: • • beneficiary income • • accumulated trustee income • • capital profits or gains realised in the current income year • • capital profits or gains realised in previous years that have been accumulated by the trust, and • • the corpus of the trust. The ordering establishes if the distribution is a taxable distribution - see Question 23. Capital gains and corpus distributed only after income derived by trustees in the year of distribution and in prior years has been distributed. More information about the ordering and taxability of distributions can be found in our Trusts' and estates' income tax rules - IR288 guide. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE55 Question 25 Taxable distributions A taxable distribution is one made to a beneficiary by a foreign or non-complying trust that is not beneficiary income. For a foreign trust taxable distributions also do not include capital gains profits that are not counted as taxable income, except when derived from transactions with associated persons or a distribution from the corpus. For non-complying trusts they do not include distributions from the corpus. Write the total taxable distributions made to beneficiaries during the year in Box 25. Where to include taxable distributions Include the amount of the taxable distribution made to each beneficiary in the beneficiary's panel of the IR6B: • • in Box 27H if the trust is a foreign trust, or • • in Box 27K if the trust is a non-complying trust. For tax payable on taxable distributions see Question 27K on page 61. Schedule of beneficiary's estate or trust income Each beneficiary (excluding minor beneficiaries) must attach a completed Schedule of beneficiary's estate or trust income - IR307 to their individual tax return if they receive income from a foreign or non-complying trust. It's helpful if the trustee or tax preparer also provides a completed IR307 when advising beneficiaries of their share of trust income. Beneficiaries do not then need to contact the trustee or tax preparer when completing their own returns. ird.govt.nz 56 Question 26 Additional disclosure of foreign investments If you calculated CFC or FIF income at Question 13 you may be required to complete an additional disclosure form for that investment. If the trust is not widely held or a PIE, you may not require an additional disclosure if the investments are in countries New Zealand has a double tax agreement with as at 31 March 2013, and have used the fair dividend rate or comparative value method. If the trust is widely held or a PIE you are required to complete an additional disclosure. Go to ird.govt.nz/beps for full details of the disclosure requirements and the appropriate forms. Find out more about the base erosion profit shifting (BEPS) hybrid mismatch rules at ird.govt.nz/beps If you need help? making a CFC or FIF disclosure please call 0800 443 773. Question 27 Tax payable for beneficiaries Print the combined total from box 27T from all IR6B’s completed by the trust. Refer to the detail below on boxes 27A to 27AC for more information on how to complete the IR6B. Tax paid on behalf of the beneficiary is not a final tax, the beneficiary will still need to include the income and tax paid on their behalf in their own income tax return to ensure the income is taxed at the correct marginal rate. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE57 IR6B Estate or trust beneficiary details Complete the details on the IR6B for each beneficiary who has received an income allocation from the trust. See Question 21A on pages 50 and 51 for the definition of beneficiary income. Complete boxes 27D to 27K to record any taxable income allocations made to the beneficiary. Complete boxes 27L to 27T to allocate tax credits and calculate tax payable. If the trust is required to comply with the NZ Domestic Trust disclosure rules (see question 33 to see if you need to comply) you must also complete an IR6B for any beneficiary who has received a distribution from the trust during the year. Complete boxes 27V to 27AA to record distributions made, and boxes 27U, 27AB and 27AC to record beneficiary account movements. Trusts required to comply with the NZ Domestic Trust Disclosure rules must supply each beneficiary’s: • • Full name • • Date of birth or commencement date • • IRD number or Tax identification number (refer question 27A, 27B and 27C) • • Jurisdiction of tax residency The question about jurisdiction of tax residency also lets us work out correctly how the beneficiary income should be taxed. Include all beneficiary income allocated to each non- resident beneficiary in Boxes 27D, 27E, 27F, 27G and 27H. Remember, the combined totals at Boxes 27I, less any taxable distributions from foreign trusts included at Box 27H must reconcile with the total of Box 21A. Non-resident passive income Non-resident passive income is interest, dividends and royalties for the supply of scientific, technical, industrial or commercial knowledge. These types of income are subject to non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) if the income has a New Zealand source. ird.govt.nz 58 This tax is deducted when the non-resident passive income is paid or credited to a non-resident beneficiary. The rates and methods of calculating the tax on a non-resident beneficiary’s share of income differ according to the type of income derived and the country the beneficiary is resident in. Include all income derived by each non-resident beneficiary in Boxes 27D, 27E, 27F, 27G and 27H. Paying NRWT When paying non-resident passive income to a non-resident beneficiary, the trust must complete certain forms and pay N RW T. If you need more help, see our NRWT - payer’s guide - IR291. When calculating the amount of income liable for income tax at the ordinary rates, do not include non-resident passive income or any overseas income in the taxable income figure in Box 27I for non-resident beneficiaries. Question 27A Beneficiary does not have a tax identification number (TIN) Tick one of these boxes to indicate why the beneficiary does not have a tax identification number. Question 27B Beneficiary’s IRD number Enter the beneficiary’s IRD number. If the beneficiary does not have an IRD number because, for example, they are a minor with no assessable income, tick the box at 27A to indicate “TIN not required in jurisdiction” and leave the field blank. If the beneficiary does not have an IRD number because they are not resident in NZ then leave this field blank and provide a TIN in box 27C. If you do not have the beneficiary’s IRD number contact the beneficiary. Due to our confidentiality obligations under section 18 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 we cannot provide it to you. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE59 Question 27C Beneficiary’s TIN If the beneficiary is not a tax resident in New Zealand, enter the beneficiary’s tax identification number from the tax jurisdiction they are resident in. If the beneficiary is not required to hold a TIN in that jurisdiction, or the jurisdiction does not issue TINs, tick one of the boxes at question 27A and leave this field blank. Questions 27D to 27T Beneficiary income and calculation of tax, excluding minor beneficiaries See Question 21A on pages 50 and 51 for the definition of beneficiary income. Complete boxes 27D to 27K to record any taxable income allocations made to the beneficiary, as the trust is not permitted to pass losses to beneficiaries, boxes 27D to 27K must be positive values. Complete boxes 27L to 27T to allocate tax credits and calculate tax payable. Question 27D New Zealand interest If the allocation of beneficiary income includes any New Zealand interest, write the amount in Box 27D. Question 27E New Zealand dividends If the allocation of beneficiary income includes any New Zealand dividends, write the amount in Box 27E. Question 27F Māori authority distributions If the allocation of beneficiary income includes any Māori authority distributions, write the amount in Box 27F. Question 27G Overseas income If the allocation of beneficiary income includes any overseas income, write the amount in Box 27G. ird.govt.nz 60 Question 27H Other income and taxable distributions from a foreign trust Add the remainder of any allocated beneficiary income to any taxable distributions from a foreign trust and write the total in Box 27H. Question 27I Beneficiary income from the estate or trust Add up boxes 27D to 27H and write the total in Box 27I. Question 27J Paying the tax on beneficiary income, excluding minor beneficiaries The trustee must pay tax on behalf of the beneficiary for all income allocated to the beneficiary. However, the trustee and the beneficiary can agree not to have tax deducted from trust/estate income before the beneficiary receives it. This might be done where the beneficiary has losses available to offset income. Note The trustees will be liable if the beneficiary defaults on payment of the tax obligations on trust income. Tick ‘Yes’ if the estate or trust is paying the tax on behalf of beneficiaries, then complete all boxes 27D to 27T. ‘Yes’ means the trust/estate will retain any excess tax credits (except overseas credits and Imputation credits) for the trust/estate. The beneficiary must then show the gross income allocated to them as trust income and can only claim the amount of tax paid by the trust at key point 27L, in the key point for Tax Paid by Trustees of their own income tax return. Tick ‘No’ if the estate or trust is not paying the tax on behalf of beneficiaries. Then complete boxes 27D to 27I, and boxes 27K, 27M, 27O, 27Q, 27U, 27V, 27W, 27X, 27Y, 27Z, 27AA, 27AB & 27AC only. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE61 Question 27K Taxable distributions by non-complying trust Show taxable distributions to each beneficiary in Box 27K and the tax in Box 27S. Taxable distributions by a non- complying trust are taxable to the beneficiary at a flat rate of 45 cents in the dollar. Question 27L Calculation of tax Do not fill out Box 27L if you ticked “No” in Box 27J. If the estate or trust is paying tax on behalf of the beneficiaries first calculate tax on the total taxable income of each beneficiary, including other income not received from the estate or trust, using the rates below. Then determine the portion of tax applicable to just beneficiary income (see Trusts and estates income tax rules - IR288 and “Tax on beneficiary income”). Income to $14,000 10.5% $14,001 - $48,000 17.5% $48,001 - $70,000 30.0% $70,001 - $180,000 33.0% $180,001 and over 39% Tax paid on behalf of the beneficiary is not a final tax, the beneficiary will still need to include the income and tax paid on their behalf in their own income tax return to ensure the income is taxed at the correct marginal rate. Question 27M Beneficiary’s share of overseas tax paid Allocate any tax paid overseas to beneficiaries on the same basis as the allocation of income. Minor beneficiaries’ share of overseas tax is to be offset against tax payable on trustee income. A New Zealand resident who receives a taxable distribution is not allowed a tax credit in relation to any income tax paid unless the tax is the same as non-resident withholding tax (NRWT). The amount of any credit is equal to: ird.govt.nz 62 taxable income × foreign tax paid total distribution Question 27N Calculation Do not fill out Box 27N if you ticked “No” in Box 27J. Subtract Box 27M from Box 27L. If the overseas tax paid (Box 27M) allocated to a beneficiary is greater than the tax payable in Box 27L, print 0.00 at Box 27N. Question 27O Beneficiary’s share of dividend imputation credits If dividends have been allocated to a beneficiary, use the following formula to work out the credits attached to those dividends: a ×( b ) c a is the total of all dividend imputation credits attached to all dividends distributed to beneficiaries during the income year b is the total distribution, including capital distributions made to the particular beneficiary during the year c is the total distribution, including capital distributions made to all beneficiaries during the year. Show the beneficiary’s share of imputation credits in Box 27O. Note If the amount of a beneficiary’s tax credit is limited by the formula, then the amount of the imputation credit included in the gross dividend as part of beneficiary’s assessable income should be a corresponding amount and included in the beneficiary’s income tax return. Further information is available in the Imputation: A guide for New Zealand Companies - IR274. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE63 Question 27P Calculation Do not fill out Box 27P if you ticked “No” in Box 27J. Subtract Box 27O from Box 27N. If the beneficiary’s share of the imputation credits is larger than their tax payable in Box 27N, the excess credit cannot be refunded to the trust. Write 0.00 in Box 27P. The beneficiary should claim the balance of the unused imputation credits in their own tax return. Minor beneficiaries’ share of dividend imputation credits is to be offset against tax payable on trustee income in Box 28H of the IR6. Question 27Q Beneficiary’s allocation of RWT and other credits Generally any RWT or other credits will be allocated to beneficiaries on the same basis as the allocation of the income. Minor beneficiaries’ allocation of RWT and other credits is to be offset against tax payable on trustee income. Ensure that you include the following amounts in Box 27Q for each beneficiary: • • allocation of RWT (Boxes 9A and 10A) including any RWT credits reallocated under the RWT substitution payment rules • • share of Māori authority credits (Box 11A) • • share of partnership, estate or trust tax credits (Box 12A) • • share of LTC tax credits (Box 14A) • • if income from a property sale is treated as beneficiary income, show their share of any residential land withholding tax credit (Box 18A), and • • share of other income credits (Box 19A). Note Do not include any amounts already shown in either Boxes 27M or 27O of the IR6B. ird.govt.nz 64 Questions 27R & 27T Do not fill out 27R or 27T if you ticked ‘No’ in Box 27J. Question 27S Calculate tax on taxable distribution by non-complying trust in 27K at 45 cents in the dollar and print this in Box 27S. Questions 27U to 27AC Distributions and beneficiary account movements If the trust is required to comply with the NZ Domestic Trust disclosure rules (see question 33 to see if you need to comply) you must disclose the details of any beneficiary who has received a distribution from the trust during the year, refer to page 13 of the guide to read more about distributions. Complete boxes 27V to 27AA to record distributions made, and boxes 27U, 27AB and 27AC to record beneficiary account movements. Distributions valued at NIL Tick the box below question 27T if the beneficiary has received a distribution that has been valued at NIL. An example of a distribution that might be valued at NIL is minor services provided to the beneficiary that are incidental to the operation or activities of the trust, or where the beneficiary has enjoyed the use of trust property but there were no costs incurred by the trust in making the property available. Question 27U Opening balance Enter the opening balance of any amount owing to the beneficiary from distributions made in prior years that have not been withdrawn or enjoyed by the beneficiary. Question 27V Accounting income and other distributions Enter the total accounting income distributed to the beneficiary for the year. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE65 This may be different from the total income allocated at questions 27D to 27H because: • • Taxable income allocations can include amounts allocated within 6-months of the end of the tax year; • • Taxable income may be calculated using different rules from accounting income, such as the FIF or PIE rules. Include any other distributions that are not captured in questions 27W, 27X, 27Y and 27Z. An example of a distribution not captured below is where a beneficiary provides assets or services to a trust and receives higher than market value in return. Question 27W Distribution of trust corpus Enter the total amount of trust corpus distributed to the beneficiary during the year. Trust corpus reflects amounts of any settlements made on the trust (less any distributions made). Question 27X Distribution of trust capital Enter the total amount of trust capital distributed to the beneficiary during the year. Trust capital reflects tax paid profits and realised capital gains of the trust. Question 27Y Distribution arising when property is used by a beneficiary for less than market value If a beneficiary enjoys the use of trust property for less than market value this is a distribution. If the cost of providing this to the beneficiary is NIL you can record zero at question 27Y, as long as this corresponds with the way it has been treated in the trust’s financial statements. Tick the box after question 27T to indicate that the beneficiary received a distribution valued at NIL. Alternatively, you can use a fair market value. If the beneficiary pays the trust to cover some or all of the costs incurred in relation to their use of the property, net the amounts off to reduce the value of the distribution recorded at question 27Y. ird.govt.nz 66 Example The trust owns a holiday home at the beach, all beneficiaries have free use of the property at any time. Each time a beneficiary uses the property they are receiving a distribution from the trust. Provided the trust does not incur any holding costs on the property then the amount of the distribution can be recorded as nil. Question 27Z Distribution of trust assets (other than cash) Record the value of any trust assets (excluding cash) distributed to the beneficiary during the year. The amount of the distribution should align with the asset value recorded in the financial statements of the trust, which may reflect historical cost, tax book value or market value.

Do not include any amounts already shown in either Boxes 27M or 27O of the IR6B. ird.govt.nz 70 Question 30 Refunds and/or transfers Please be careful to copy the amount from Box 29E to Box 30 correctly. Direct credit If you choose direct credit, you get your refund faster and you can withdraw your money as soon as it's credited because there's no clearance time. We pay any refund direct into your New Zealand bank account or other deposit account, for example a building society account, as soon as we've processed your return. Make sure your correct account number is printed at Question 6 on the front page of your return. Question 30A Overpaid provisional tax If you’ve made payments towards your 2025 provisional tax and, after completing this return, find you have less or no provisional tax to pay, the overpayment can be included in the amount we refund or transfer. Attach a separate note to your return to request this. Question 30B Transferring a refund to pay provisional tax If you're entitled to a refund you can transfer all or part of it to your 2025 provisional tax. If you want to do this print the amount of the transfer in Box 30A. Questions 30C to 30D Transfers to another taxpayer's income tax account If you'd like your refund transferred to another account you'll need to tell us what date you'd like it transferred. The date you choose depends on what tax has been overpaid and whose account you want the credit transferred to. Different rules apply if the other taxpayer is associated to you. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE71 Associated taxpayers When transferring overpaid tax, associated taxpayers are: • • a company you're a shareholder-employee in • • a partner in the same partnership • • a relative (for example child, parent, spouse, or partner), or • • a trustee of a family trust you're a beneficiary of. You can ask for your credit to be transferred at any date as long as it's not before the relevant date shown below. Tick "Yes" or "No" at Box 30B to indicate whether the other taxpayer is associated and write their name in the boxes provided. Write the IRD number of the other taxpayer at Box 30C. Write the amount you wish to transfer at Box 30D. Transfer dates For refunds transferred to your account or an associated taxpayers account: • • If the credit is from excess tax deducted (for example PAYE deducted), it's the day after your balance date (or 1 April if your balance date is before 31 March). • • If the credit is from overpaid provisional tax, it's the day you overpaid it. Note Special rules apply if the return period has had tax pooling refunds transferred in. For credit transferred to a non-associated person's account, it's the later of the day you requested the transfer, or the day after you complete your return. Future transfer dates If you'd like your credit transferred at a date in the future, attach a note to the front of your return with details of: • • the amount you want transferred • • the account you want it transferred to, and if it's the account of the associated person, and • • the date you'd like it transferred. ird.govt.nz 72 If you do not tell us the date you'd like your credit transferred, we'll transfer it at a date we think gives you the greatest advantage. Contact us if you'd like to change the transfer date and tell us if this transfer is to cover a debt. For more information on transfers, read Tax Information Bulletin Vol 14, No 11 (November 2002). Refunds of less than $1 If your refund is less than $1 it will be carried forward to your next tax assessment. We'll offset it against any amount you may owe us or add it to any refund. If you do not want it carried forward, please contact us. Question 31 Initial provisional tax liability If this is the first year the estate or trust started to derive gross income from a taxable activity, print the start date in Box 31. Provisional tax is not payable if the residual income tax (RIT) for the previous year was $5,000 or less. Most new businesses do not pay provisional tax in their first year of operation because there's no RIT from the previous year to base the calculation on. However, a special rule requires you to pay interest if you have an initial provisional tax liability. The estate or trust has an initial provisional tax liability if: • • it starts to derive gross income from a taxable activity, and • • it had not derived income from a taxable activity within the preceding 4 years, or • • you have RIT of $60,000 or more in the current year. The interest cost can be reduced or eliminated by making voluntary provisional tax payments on the instalment due dates. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE73 Interest rules for taxpayers with an initial provisional tax liability Taxpayers with an initial provisional tax liability may be charged interest from the first, second or third instalment date. The instalment date that interest applies from is determined by the taxable activity's start date. For estates and trusts whose balance date is 31 March, the start date for interest will be: • • 29 August, if the taxable activity started before 30 July of the same year • • 16 January, if the taxable activity started between 31 July and 16 December of the previous year, or • • 8 May, if the taxable activity started on or after 17 December of the previous year. An estate or trust with a balance date other than 31 March generally pays provisional tax on the 28th day of the 5th, 9th and 13th months after the balance date, unless completing six-monthly GST returns. If you need help to work out whether the estate or trust has an initial provisional tax liability, read our guide Provisional tax - IR289. Question 32 2025 provisional tax 2025 provisional tax is charged for income the estate or trust will earn in the 2025 income year. It is payable in 2, 3 or 6 equal instalments. There are 3 options for paying provisional tax - standard, estimation and ratio. If the estate or trust's 2024 RIT is: • • $5,000 or less it does not have to pay provisional tax, although it can make voluntary payments • • more than $5,000 but expected to be $5,000 or less for 2025, it may estimate 2025 provisional tax at nil (read "Estimation option" on page 74), or • • more than $5,000 and expected to be more than $5,000 for 2024, it must pay 2025 provisional tax. If you anticipate your RIT will exceed $5,000 for the 2024 year, see "Interest" on page 76. You may be liable for interest from your first provisional tax instalment date. ird.govt.nz 74 Which option to use Estates or trusts can use either the standard or estimation options to pay their provisional tax. If they're registered for GST they may also be able to use the ratio option. Standard option Using the standard option, the estate or trust's 2025 provisional tax will be equal to its 2024 RIT plus 5%. If you use this option enter S in Box 32A on the return and the amount of 2025 provisional tax in Box 32B. • • If the estate or trust's 2024 return has not been completed by the first instalment date of 2025 provisional tax, the provisional tax instalments payable is based on 2023 RIT plus 10% (divided by 3 or 2, depending on how many instalments are payable). Estimation option Estates or trusts can estimate their 2025 provisional tax. Trustees must include distributions to minor beneficiaries in their estimate. They can re-estimate any number of times up to and including their final instalment due date. If the estate or trust's 2025 RIT is expected to be less than its 2024 RIT, estimating may prevent the estate or trust from paying more tax than it has to. Note An estimate must be "fair and reasonable" at each instalment it applies to. If you use this option, see page 76 on "Not taking reasonable care penalty" and "Interest". If you estimate your provisional tax, your instalments should be one-third of your estimation. Use the worksheet on page 75 to calculate provisional tax using the estimation option. If you use this option enter E in Box 32A and the amount of 2025 provisional tax in Box 32B. Estimating provisional tax on beneficiary income When working out the tax on estimated beneficiary income, calculate the tax separately for each beneficiary, including estimated tax credits where applicable. The table on the following page shows the 2025 individual tax rates for provisional tax. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE75 2025 annual tax rates income range Ta x r a t e Income to $14,00010.5% $14,001 - $48,00017.5% $48,001 - $70,00030.0% $70,001 - $180,00033.0% $180,001 and over39.0% When using these tax rates to calculate 2025 provisional tax, you'll also need to estimate the tax credits the beneficiary may be entitled to. Use this worksheet to calculate the estate or trust's 2025 provisional tax using the estimation option. Print the estate or trust's estimated 2025 income to be allocated in Box 1. 1 Estimated allocation of income: •• Beneficiary income 2 •• Trustee income 3 Work out the tax on the amount in Box 2, using the rates above. Print your answer in Box 4. 4 Multiply the amount in Box 3 by 0.33 (33%). Print your answer in Box 5. 5 If the estate or trust is non- complying, multiply the estimated taxable distributions, if any, by 0.45 (45%). Print your answer in Box 6. 6 Add Boxes 4, 5 and 6. Print your answer in Box 7. 7 Print the estimated 2025 credits (trustees' share only) in Box 8. 8 Subtract Box 8 from Box 7. Print your answer in Box 9. 9 Box 9 is the estate or trust's 2025 provisional tax. Copy it to Box 32B of the return and print E in Box 32A. ird.govt.nz 76 Divide the amount in Box 9 by three to get the amount to pay for each instalment. If you need more help read our guide Provisional tax - IR289. Ratio option If the trust is GST registered you may qualify to use the ratio option to calculate your provisional tax. Only enter R at Box 32A if you've already elected to use the ratio option. Your application to use the ratio option must be made by phone or in writing before the beginning of the income year you want to use it in. If you've already elected to use the ratio option and want to continue using it, enter R at Box 32A. More information about the ratio option is in our guide Provisional tax - IR289. Not taking reasonable care penalty When you estimate the estate or trust's 2025 provisional tax, your estimate must be fair and reasonable. If the 2025 RIT is greater than the provisional tax paid, you may be liable for a not taking reasonable care penalty of 20% of the underpaid provisional tax. Interest If the estate or trust has paid too much provisional tax on trustee income we may pay interest, or if it has not paid enough, we may charge interest. Interest for estates or trusts is calculated only on the tax payable on trustee income. Interest is not calculated if all income is distributed to the beneficiaries. Interest the estate or trust pays is generally tax-deductible, while interest we pay is taxable income. For more information about interest and penalties read our guide Penalties and interest - IR240. If we pay interest, it continues to accrue until the date we refund the overpaid tax, or apply it to another liability. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE77 Election to be a provisional tax payer An estate or trust is a provisional tax payer for the 2025 year if its RIT for 2024 is more than $5,000. If the 2024 RIT is $5,000 or less, and • • the estate or trust made provisional tax payments for that tax year, and • • payments were made under the estimation method (other than using the estimation method for its final instalment only), It may elect to be a provisional tax payer for 2025. This may affect the interest it may be entitled to for that year. To elect to be a provisional tax payer for the 2025 year, attach a letter to the front of the return. Change in balance date There are special rules about when provisional tax is due and how interest is calculated if there has been a change in balance date. Read our Provisional tax - IR289 guide for more information. Tax pooling Tax pooling allows taxpayers to pool provisional tax payments, offsetting underpayments by overpayments within the same pool. This reduces their possible exposure to late payment penalties and use-of-money interest. The pooling arrangement is made through a commercial intermediary, who arranges for participating taxpayers to be charged or compensated for the offset. For more information about tax pooling, including a list of intermediaries, go to ird.govt.nz/tax-pooling ird.govt.nz 78 Payment dates 2025 provisional tax Generally, an estate or trust with a 31 March balance date pays provisional tax by the following due dates: • • First instalment 28 August 2024 • • Second instalment 15 January 2025 • • Third instalment 7 May 2025 An estate or trust with a balance date other than 31 March pays provisional tax on the 28th day of the 5th, 9th and 13th months after the balance date. Where payments would otherwise be due on 28 December or 28 April the due date is extended to 15 January or 7 May. These dates will alter if: • • the estate or trust is registered for GST, and • • the GST filing frequency is six-monthly, or • • provisional tax is paid by the ratio option. If either of these situations apply to you, read our guide Provisional tax - IR289. 2024 end-of-year income tax Estates or trusts that have an agent and an extension of time may have until 7 April 2025 to pay their tax. If you think this applies to you contact your agent for more information. Otherwise, an estate or trust with a balance date between 1 March and 30 September must pay its end-of-year income tax and any interest by 7 February 2025. An estate or trust with a balance date between 1 October and 28 February must pay its end-of-year income tax by the 7th day of the month before the following year's balance date.

In this guide we use "trustee" or "you" to refer to the person or persons administering an estate or trust. The word trust also refers to estates unless we've stated otherwise. This guide provides general information about how to complete the IR6 return. There are references throughout the guide to our other publications which may help you. If you need more help please contact us or a tax advisor. Important changes from 1 April 2021 New disclosure requirements for NZ Domestic Trusts are effective for the income year beginning 1 April 2021 and subsequent income years. Refer to the checklist at Question 33 to see if your trust needs to comply. If you are required to comply you will need to provide additional disclosures with your 2022 return, including: • • The details of any person who is a settlor of the trust. Complete an IR6S to provide the details of any person who is a settlor of the trust and attach it to your return. • • The nature and amount of any settlement made on the trust during the year. Complete an IR6S to record any settlements made on the trust during the year and attach it to your return. • • The details of any person who received a distribution from the trust during the year, and information about the amount and nature of the distribution. Complete an IR6B for any beneficiary who received a distribution during the year and attach it to your return. • • The details of any person who has the power to appoint or dismiss a trustee, add or remove a beneficiary, or amend the trust deed. Log into myIR to provide us this information, or complete an IR6P and attach it to your return. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE7 IR6S: Settlements & settlors If you are required to comply with the new NZ Domestic Trust disclosure rules you will need to supply additional information with your 2022 income tax return: • • The details of any person who has made a settlement on the trust (at any point in time) if those details have not already been supplied. • • The nature and amount of any settlement made during the year, and the details of the person who made the settlement (the settlor). A settlor of the trust can include any person who at any time: • • transfers value -to a trust, or -for the benefit of the trust, or -on terms of the trust These are called settlements. A settlement is any action that makes a person a settlor of a trust and includes any of the following: • • disposal of any property to the trust for less than market value • • property or funds made available to the trust for less than market value • • services provided to the trust for less than market value, unless those services are incidental to the operation of the trust • • any property acquired from the trust or any service from the trustee for greater than market value. A settlement can also occur as a result of a transaction or series of transactions entered by a person that has the effect of making that person a settlor. In most cases settlements must be valued at market value, unless the settlement is something that cannot be later distributed to a beneficiary, in which case it must be valued at NIL. For example, • • If a person provides land and buildings or other assets to a trust they must be valued at market value; ird.govt.nz 8 • • If a person provides cash to a trust, it must be valued at market value (which is the face value of the currency, or NZ equivalent face value of foreign currency); • • If a person provides services to a trust those services have been consumed by the trust and can’t later be distributed so they must be valued at NIL; • • If a person is owed money by a trust and chooses not to charge interest, the non-charging of interest is a transfer of value and therefore a settlement, but the trust has not gained anything that it can later distribute to a beneficiary so the settlement must be valued at NIL. The value must be determined at the time the settlement is made. The total value of all settlements forms the corpus of the trust. The minimum details you must supply on the IR6S: • • The name of the settlor • • The date of birth or commencement date of the settlor • • The jurisdiction of tax residency of the settlor • • The tax identification number (TIN) of the settlor: -if they are not required to hold an IRD number in NZ or a TIN in another jurisdiction, or the jurisdiction doesn’t issue TINs tick the relevant box at question 1, leave boxes 2 and 3 blank; -if they are a NZ resident then enter their NZ IRD number in box 2; -if they are not a NZ resident enter their TIN in box 3; -if you do not hold the IRD number or TIN of the settlor: If a settlement was made by this settlor in the current year, then you must ask them to provide it to you If a settlement was not made by this settlor recently and you cannot reasonably obtain their IRD# or TIN (e.g. because they are deceased and the settlement was >7 years ago), leave boxes 2 and 3 blank. • • No settlement in the current year -If you are completing the IR6S in order to provide information about past settlors (who have not made a settlement this year) tick the box at question 4 ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE9 • • Settlement/s in the current year that are required to be valued at market value -Cash: if the settlor has provided one or more settlements of money during the year add them together and enter the amount at box 5 -Shares/ownership interests: if the settlor has provided one or more settlements of shares/ ownership interests during the year add them together and enter the amount at box 6 -Financial arrangements: if the settlor has provided one or more settlements of financial arrangements during the year add them together and enter the amount at box 7 -Services: if the settlor has provided one or more settlements of services during the year add them together and enter the amount at box 8 -Land: if the settlor has provided one or more settlements of land during the year add them together and enter the amount at box 9 -Buildings: if the settlor has provided one or more settlements of buildings during the year add them together and enter the amount at box 10 -Other: if the settlor has provided one or more settlements of any other type during the year add them together and enter the amount at box 11, enter a description of the nature of the settlement at box 12, if there are multiple ‘other’ settlements describe the one/s of the highest value. • • Settlement/s in the current year that are required to be valued at NIL -If a settlement has been made but the amount is required to be valued at nil, tick box 13. Complete as many IR6S forms as you need to provide all of the required details and staple these to the back page of your return. ird.govt.nz 10 IR6P: Powers of appointment If you are required to comply with the new NZ Domestic Trust disclosure rules you will need to supply additional information with your 2022 income tax return: • • The details of any person who has the power to appoint or dismiss a trustee, add or remove a beneficiary, or amend the trust deed (the appointer). You only need to tell us about people who have these powers in the current year, and then let us know in future if they cease to hold them. You can also keep these details up to date in myIR. The minimum details you must supply on the IR6P: • • The name of the appointer • • The date of birth or commencement date of the appointer • • The jurisdiction of tax residency of the appointer • • The tax identification number of the appointer: -if they are not required to hold an IRD number in NZ or a TIN in another jurisdiction, or the jurisdiction doesn’t issue TINs tick the relevant box at question 1, leave boxes 2 and 3 blank; -if they are a NZ resident then enter their NZ IRD number in box 2; -if they are not a NZ resident enter their TIN in box 3; -if you do not hold the IRD number or TIN of the appointer you must ask them to provide it to you • • Enter date that the appointer was given this power in box 4. If the date is unknown (e.g. because it was many years ago and records are not available), enter a date that reflects a reasonable estimate. • • Enter the date that the appointer ceased to hold this power at box 5, if they currently hold these powers leave this field blank. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE11 IR6B: Beneficiaries & distributions If you are required to comply with the new NZ Domestic Trust disclosure rules you will need to supply additional information with your 2022 income tax return: • • The details of any beneficiary who has received a distribution from the trust during the year, and the nature and amount of that distribution. This information should be included on the IR6B. Refer to question 27 for more information about how to complete the IR6B. Complete as many IR6Bs as you need to provide all the required details and staple them to your return. Distributions In addition to allocating beneficiary income, see page 12 for allocations, a trustee can make other distributions to beneficiaries. A distribution can include: • • tax-paid profits (trustee income or beneficiary income) • • capital gains of the trust • • corpus of the trust (the value of settlements made on the trust) • • the physical and intangible assets of the trust passing to beneficiaries • • the beneficiary using trust property for less than market value • • the beneficiary supplying goods or services to the trust and receiving more than market value in return (including charging a higher than market interest rate on loans to the trust) • • (for a foreign trust) non-taxed profits such as foreign sourced income. The tax position of a distribution from a trust depends on the type of trust making the distribution and the residency of the beneficiary. See pages 17 to 19 of this guide. Generally, a distribution, other than beneficiary income, to a New Zealand resident beneficiary from: • • a complying trust is not taxable • • a foreign trust is taxable, to the extent it is not part of the corpus or capital gains, or • • a non-complying trust is taxable at 45 cents in the dollar, to the extent it is not part of the corpus. ird.govt.nz 12 How income of an estate or trust is taxed in general In general, income of an estate or trust will be subject to income tax in New Zealand if it has a source in New Zealand regardless of the residency of the trustee. The trustee is also liable for New Zealand income tax on income derived outside New Zealand where any settlor of the trust is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year, or if the estate has a New Zealand trustee and the deceased was resident in New Zealand. Allocations Income of a trust is either trustee or beneficiary income. The trustee can allocate income as beneficiary income, provided the income either: • • vests absolutely in the beneficiary in the income year, or • • is paid or applied for the benefit of the beneficiary during that income year or within a specified period from the end of the income year. For more information see Question 21A on page 48. Trust income allocated as beneficiary income is taxable income, except as covered below under the special rules for allocations to minor beneficiaries. Allocations of beneficiary income to a minor A minor is defined as a New Zealand resident under the age of 16 years on the balance date of the trust. Allocations of beneficiary income that the minor beneficiary rule applies to are treated as trustee income. This means they are: • • taxed at 33% • • included in the trustee's tax calculation in the IR6 return, and • • included in the trustees' provisional tax calculations. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE13 As these amounts are distributions of the trust, those trusts that are required to comply with the NZ Domestic Trust disclosure rules will still need to complete an IR6B for the minor beneficiary to disclose the amount of the distribution. Refer to Question 33 of the guide to see if your trust needs to comply. The minor beneficiary should not include this income in their Individual income tax return - IR3. Exceptions to the minor beneficiary rule The following exceptions allow income allocated to a minor beneficiary to be treated as beneficiary income if the income: • • is derived by a minor for whom a child disability allowance is paid under the Social Security Act 2018 • • is derived directly from either a group investment fund, the Māori trustee or a Māori authority, or • • the amount allocated to the minor from the trust is $1,000 or less in an income year. Note If the $1,000 threshold is exceeded, the total income allocated to the minor beneficiary is taxed as trustee income. For example, if a minor beneficiary is allocated $1,200, the total amount of $1,200 is taxed at 33%. The general anti-avoidance rule may apply if a person establishes multiple trusts to increase the number of exemptions. See Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 19, No 4 (May 2007) for further information. There are further exceptions to the minor beneficiary rule that relate to the nature of the settlements on the trust. For more information, please see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 19, No 4 (May 2007) ird.govt.nz 14 Return due date If the estate or trust has a 31 March balance date, you have until 7 July 2022 to send in the return, unless you have been granted an extension of time. Contact us if you're not sure of the filing date. If the estate or trust is the client of an agent, it may have until 31 March 2023 to complete the return. If this applies, contact your agent. International obligations You may also need to provide information about a trust to comply with the following international obligations. The Common Reporting Standard (CRS) For more information see: • • IR Guidance on the CRS - IR1048 section 11 • • CRS: Is the Trust a Reporting Financial Institution - IR1052 • • Family Trust obligations under the CRS - IR1053 • • ird.govt.nz/crs Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) For more information see: • • FATCA Trusts Guidance - IR1087 • • FATCA status of NZ trusts that are not US person - IR1086 • • ird.govt.nz/fatca ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE15 Questions Questions 1 to 6 The information in Questions 1 to 6 of the return helps us to be sure that any correspondence we send goes to the right person at the right address. Fill in these questions only if the correct information is not printed on the return. Question 1 IRD number If the estate or trust does not have an IRD number, complete an IRD number application - resident non-individual - IR596 and send it in with the return. Question 2 Name of estate or trust If the estate or trust has changed its name since the last time a return was completed, please provide proof of the change so we can update our records, for example trustee resolution. Questions 3 and 4 Postal address and phone number If you have a new postal address, write the details at Question 3. If your new postal address is a PO Box number, show your box lobby if you have one. If you are unsure of your box lobby please contact New Zealand Post. If the estate or trust uses its tax preparer's postal address, leave this panel blank. The tax preparer will let us know if they change their address. We ask for your daytime phone number at Question 4 in case we need to call you with questions about the return. ird.govt.nz 16 Question 5 Business industry classification (BIC) code We're required to supply the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) with a code for your business or trading activity, for levy classification and calculation. If your BIC code is not pre-printed on the return or is different from the pre-printed one, enter the correct code. To work out your main business or trading activity and its code, go to businessdescription.co.nz or call ACC on 0800 222 776. It's important that you choose the code which most accurately reflects your main business or trading activity. Note Please provide the code only. Do not provide a description. Question 6 Bank account number The fastest and safest way to get any refund is to have it direct credited to your New Zealand bank account or other deposit account, for example a building society account. If your bank account number is not preprinted on the return form, include it at Question 6. If your suffix has only 2 digits, enter them in the first 2 squares of the suffix box. Question 7A Has the estate or trust ceased? If the estate or trust has ceased, include accounts showing the distribution of all assets and liabilities to the date the estate or trust was finalised. If the estate or trust is registered for GST or as an employer, you'll need to complete a Business cessation - IR315 form to finalise your records. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE17 Question 7B Nil trust or estate returns If the trust receives any income, for example interest, the trustee must complete a return regardless of the amount of income derived. Where a trust has no prospect or intention of deriving any income in a given financial year, contact us with the trust’s name and IRD number so we can record that a return is not required for that year. If the trust subsequently derives income in a future year, the trust must send in a return. A complying trust that is non-active and does not want to complete an income tax return can complete and send the Non-active trust declaration - IR633: The complying trust needs to declare: • • it has not derived or been deemed to have derived any gross income from any source • • it has no deductions, and • • it has not been party to, or continued with, any transactions with assets of the trust that give rise to any of the following during the tax year: a. income or deemed income in any person's hand, or b. fringe benefits to any employee or former employee. Question 8 Types of trusts The type of trust determines the way certain distributions are taxed in the hands of beneficiaries. There are 3 types of estates or trusts for income tax purposes: • • complying • • foreign, and • • non-complying. ird.govt.nz 18 Complying trust In general, a complying trust is one that has been taxed in New Zealand on all its trustee income since the date it began and the trustee has met all its tax obligations. Complying trusts include: • • trusts settled by New Zealand residents with New Zealand trustees and New Zealand beneficiaries • • estates of people who were New Zealand residents when they died, and • • foreign trusts that have elected to become complying trusts. The trust can still be a complying trust if the trustee was not liable for New Zealand income tax because: • • the trust earned no income • • the income was exempt, or • • the trust was in a loss situation. Foreign trust A foreign trust is one where no settlor of the trust has been resident in New Zealand since 17 December 1987, or the date the trust was first settled, whichever is later, and on the date of distribution. Non-complying trust A trust that is not a complying trust or a foreign trust is a non-complying trust. Non-complying trusts include: • • trusts with a New Zealand-resident settlor, but non- resident trustees, that have not been liable for or have not paid New Zealand income tax on all trustee income since first being settled • • foreign trusts where the settlor has become a New Zealand resident and an election has not been made to be a complying trust, and • • trusts where all the beneficiaries are non-residents and all the income is passive income such as interest, dividends, and royalties. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE19 Election to change category of trust for tax purposes New residents or former residents who have settled a trust before coming to New Zealand may elect to pay New Zealand tax on future trustee income. Making this election will mean the trust becomes a complying trust for income derived on or after the date on which the election is made. An election can be made by a settlor, trustee or beneficiary using an Election to pay income tax on trustee income - IR463 form. If an election is not made the trust will become a non- complying trust. Elections must be made within 12 months of a new resident ceasing to be a transitional resident and within 12 months of the arrival for a former resident. Unit trust A unit trust is treated as a company for tax purposes. If you're preparing a tax return for a unit trust, please complete a Companies income tax return - IR4. Group investment fund If the income is: • • solely from Category B income, an IR6 must be completed • • solely from Category A income, an IR4 must be completed, or • • a combination of both Category A and Category B income, an IR4 and IR44E must be completed. Please read the notes on the IR44E for more information. Superannuation schemes A superannuation scheme that is not registered with the Financial Markets Authority and does not allow investors to contribute will be treated as a trust for tax purposes and must complete an IR6 return. Income and credits section Income received by a trust retains its character as it passes through the trust. For this reason we ask that you return different types of income in certain boxes. ird.govt.nz 20 Question 9 New Zealand interest Include interest from all New Zealand sources at Question 9. The interest payer will usually send you an RWT withholding certificate showing the gross interest paid and the amount of RWT deducted. Write the total of all RWT deducted in Box 9A. Add up all the gross interest amounts (before the deduction of any tax) and write the total in Box 9B. Note If expenses are deductible against the interest income (for example commission), claim them at Question 22. Read about expenses on page 50. Do not send us interest statements or IR15 certificates with the return. Keep these in case we ask for them later Interest on broken term deposits If you've broken a term deposit during the year, you may have to account for negative interest. This is interest repaid on a term deposit and may reduce the amount of interest to declare in your return. If the term deposit was broken in full, or it was business related, deduct the negative interest from the gross interest shown on the IR15 or equivalent statement. Deduct the allowable negative interest component, using the worksheet below, before entering the gross amount at Box 9B on your return. In all other cases, the negative interest is deductible in a future income year when the term deposit matures. Worksheet Copy your gross interest from your RWT withholding certificate to Box 1. 1 Print any negative interest you've paid in Box 2. 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1 and print the answer in Box 3. Copy this amount to Box 9B of your tax return. 3 ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE21 Interest paid or charged by Inland Revenue If we paid you interest, include it in Box 9B for the income year the trust received the interest. If the trust paid us interest, include it as a deduction in Box 22 of the return for the income year the interest is paid. Interest from overseas If the trust received interest from overseas, convert your overseas interest and tax credits to New Zealand dollars and show the amounts at Question 13. Read the notes about overseas income on pages 26 to 29. Income from financial arrangements The financial arrangement rules generally require income or expenditure from financial arrangements to be spread over the term of the arrangement. Financial arrangements include term deposits, government stock, local authority stock, mortgage bonds, futures contracts and deferred property settlements. Trustees are required to use a spreading method unless they are a cash basis person. A person is a cash basis person if: • • the value of all financial arrangements together is less than $1 million, or • • the value of the income or expenditure from the financial arrangement is less than $100,000, and • • the deferral of income or expenditure using the cash method rather than the actual method is less than $40,000. A special rule applies for deceased persons. If the deceased person was a cash basis person at the date of death, the concession applies in the year of death and up to 4 succeeding years. Any RWT from a financial arrangement will be deducted on a cash basis. Different rules apply for financial arrangements entered into prior to 20 May 1999. ird.govt.nz 22 Sale or maturity of financial arrangements Whether or not the exemption from the spreading methods explained earlier applies, when a financial arrangement matures or is sold, remitted, or transferred, a "wash-up" calculation known as a base-price adjustment must be carried out. Cash basis persons can use the Sale or disposal of financial arrangements - IR3K to perform the calculation. This form could be used, for example, to calculate the amount you need to account for if you have broken a term deposit in full. For more information about the financial arrangements rules, please see Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) Vol 11, No 6 (July 1999), page 3. Any RWT will be deducted on a cash basis. Question 10 New Zealand dividends Dividends are the part of a company's profits that it passes on to its shareholders. Unit trusts are treated as companies for income tax purposes. Distributions from unit trusts will generally be taxable and are treated as dividends. Note All the trust's cash and taxable bonus issue dividends derived from a qualifying company must be distributed by the trustees as beneficiary income to the beneficiaries who are not trustees or companies that are not qualifying companies. Complete Question 10 if you received any New Zealand dividends, including dividends from your local electricity or gas supplier. Do not include a dividend that's a distribution of the trust's capital and is tax free. The company or unit trust that paid you the dividend will send you a dividend statement. Do not send us any dividend statements with the return, keep them in case we ask for them later. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE23 Note If expenses are deductible against the dividend income, claim them at Question 22. Credits attached to dividends "Imputation credits" are credits for part of the tax the company has already paid on its profits, which means the dividends are not taxed twice. RWT is deducted from your dividend to bring the total credits withheld up to 33% of the gross dividend. What to show in your return Your dividend statements show the amount: • • you received (net dividend) • • of any imputation credits, and • • of any RWT credits. Add all these amounts together to work out your total gross dividends and enter this in Box 10B. Add up all the imputation credits and print the total in Box 10. Add any dividend RWT credits and print the total in Box 10A. Shares instead of dividends If the trust received shares instead of dividends, include them as income at Question 10B. Write the amount as if you received dividends instead of shares. Dividends from overseas Please read about overseas income on pages 26 to 29 of this guide. Question 11 Māori authority distributions Māori authorities can make various types of distributions. Fill in Question 11 if you received any taxable Māori authority distributions. The Māori authority that paid you the distribution will send you a Māori authority distribution statement. ird.govt.nz 24 Credits attached to distributions The Māori authority may attach a credit to the distribution it makes to members. This credit will be classified as a Maori authority credit and is part of the tax the Maori authority has already paid on its profits, so the distributions are not taxed twice. What to show in your return Your Māori authority distribution statement shows the amount of: • • the distribution made to you, including the taxable portion and the non-taxable portion, and • • Māori authority credit. Transfer these amounts, leaving out any non-taxable distributions, to the relevant boxes at Question 11. Non-taxable distribution You do not need to include in the IR6 return any other distributions received from a Māori authority that are not taxable in the hands of a Māori authority member. These amounts are non-taxable distributions and cannot have credits attached. For more information read our Māori authorities guide - IR487. Question 12 Partnership, estate or trust income Partnership If the estate or trust received any income from a partnership, write the details at Question 12. Do not include: • • interest and RWT (include these at Question 9) • • any dividends, imputation credits or dividend RWT (include these at Question 10) • • any Māori authority dividends and Māori authority credits (include these at Question 11), or • • any overseas income and qualifying tax credits attached (include these at Question 13). ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE25 Estate or trust If the estate or trust has received income from a foreign or non-complying trust, complete a Schedule of beneficiary's estate or trust income - IR307 and attach it to the return. Add up all the other income from partnerships, complying and foreign trusts, and write the total in Box 12B. Add up any other tax credits and write the total in Box 12A. Do not include: • • interest and RWT (include these at Question 9) • • any dividends, imputation credits or dividend RWT (include these at Question 10) • • any Māori authority dividends and Māori authority credits (include these at Question 11), or • • any overseas income and qualifying tax credits attached (include these at Question 13). If the estate or trust has received a taxable distribution from a non-complying trust, do not include the amount as income. Calculate tax on the taxable distribution at 45 cents in the dollar and add it to the amount in Box 28B. You can use a loss to reduce the amount of the taxable distribution. Net losses brought forward from an earlier income year and losses incurred in the 2022 income year can be used to reduce the amount. If a loss is used in this way it is no longer available to offset other income. The reduction is calculated using the following formula: (Tax loss × 0.33) ÷ 0.45 Losses from limited partnerships If the estate or trust is claiming a loss from a limited partnership and you need help working out the amount that can be claimed, go to ird.govt.nz/index/calculators-and-tools ird.govt.nz 26 Question 13 Overseas income If the trust received overseas income, for example interest or financial arrangements, show this at Question 13. Convert all overseas income and qualifying overseas tax paid to New Zealand dollars. You can do this by: • • using the rates available on ird.govt.nz/managing-my-tax • • contacting the overseas section of a trading bank and asking for the exchange rate for the day you received your overseas income. Include any overseas income and credits which you received from a partnership, look-through company (LTC), estate or trust here. Include gross income before deducting any tax credits at Box 13B. Credit for tax paid overseas will be limited to the amount of New Zealand tax payable on that income. How overseas income of an estate or trust is taxed In New Zealand, overseas income is taxed according to the residency of the settlor. The rules for the 3 most common situations are described over the page. New Zealand resident trustees and income derived outside New Zealand As a general rule, where a trustee is resident in New Zealand, and the trustee derives an amount from outside New Zealand, that income will be income of the trustee. The amount will be exempt income of the trustee if: • • no settlor of the trust except a transitional resident is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year, or • • that trust is not a testamentary trust (trust created by a person under their will) or an inter vivos trust (trust created by the settlor during their lifetime) where any settlor of the trust died resident in New Zealand, whether in that income year or otherwise. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE27 Non-resident trustees and income derived outside of New Zealand A non-resident trustee is also liable for New Zealand income tax on income derived from outside New Zealand where: • • any settlor is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year, or • • any settlor of an inter vivos or a testamentary trust died while they were resident in New Zealand, and a trustee is resident in New Zealand at any time during the income year. Exceptions to the general rule for non-resident trustees and income derived outside New Zealand There are 2 situations in which a non-resident trustee is not liable for income tax on trustee income derived from outside New Zealand. These apply where the trustee is resident outside New Zealand at all times during the income year and either: • • no settlement has been made on the trust since 17 December 1987, or • • the only settlements made on the trust were by settlors who were not resident in New Zealand at the time of settlement and who have not been residents in New Zealand since 17 December 1987. Neither exception applies where an election to pay tax on trustee income has been made by the trustee. These exceptions do not affect the liability for income tax for any settlor of the trust, for example, where the settlor elects to pay tax on trustee income. The trustee income remains liable for income tax for the purpose of determining whether the trust is a complying trust (formerly qualifying trust). Overseas dividends If you are a New Zealand resident trustee and at any time during the 2022 income year you held rights such as shares, units or an entitlement to benefit in any foreign company, foreign trust, foreign superannuation scheme, or foreign life insurance policy, you may be required to calculate foreign investment fund (FIF) income or loss on those investments and include this amount in Box 13B. ird.govt.nz 28 Generally, you will use the fair dividend rate to calculate FIF income. The trustees may also need to complete an additional FIF disclosure form. For more information read the guide to Question 26 on page 54. You will not need to do this if the investment is covered by an exclusion. The main exclusions from an interest in an FIF are: • • investments in certain Australian resident companies listed on approved indices on the Australian stock exchange, that maintain franking accounts. Investments covered in the list are available at ird.govt.nz/fif in the Australian share exemption list - IR871 • • interest in certain Australian units • • limited exemptions for interests in certain venture capital • • limited exemptions for interests in certain venture capital interests that move offshore (for 10 or more income years from the income year in which the company migrates from New Zealand), and • • a 10% or greater interest in a controlled foreign company (CFC). A limited number of trusts are also excluded from the rules if the attributing interests are below $50,000. These are: • • a testamentary trust • • a compensatory trust, or • • where the settlor of the trust is the Accident Compensation Corporation. If the exclusions apply and the trust is under the threshold, include dividends received in Box 13B and any qualifying overseas tax credits in Box 13A. Note If your dividend exceeds your FIF income, the amount of imputation credit you can claim is calculated on the basis of your FIF income. If your FIF income exceeds your dividend, you can claim the entire imputation credit attached to the dividend. Any excess imputation credit cannot be carried forward to the next year or converted to a loss. Please note you cannot claim Australian franking credits. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE29 For more information about the FIF rules read A guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate - IR461, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 19, No 3 (April 2007) page 28, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 20, No 3 (April 2008) page 110, or go to ird.govt.nz/fif CFC income or loss If at any time during the 2022 income year the trust has attributed CFC income or loss, the trustees or beneficiaries may be required to calculate this in their own income tax returns. A loss from a CFC cannot be used to offset domestic income or be included in domestic losses that are carried forward to the 2023 income year. Generally, these losses can only offset income or future income from CFCs that are resident in the same country as the CFC that incurred the loss. The trustees may also need to complete an additional CFC disclosure form. See Question 26 on page 54. Investments in portfolio investment entities (PIEs) and portfolio investor attributed income/loss If you receive dividends from a PIE that is a listed company and does not use your prescribed investor rate (PIR), you may choose whether to include the dividends in your return. The attributed PIE income/loss is included in the estate or trust's return for the period that includes the end of the PIE's income year. PIEs usually have a 31 March balance date. The amount of income derived by the estate or trust as a distribution by a PIE is excluded income of the estate or trust other than fully imputed dividends from a PIE that is a listed company and does not use your PIR. More information is available in our guide Information for trustees who invest in PIEs - IR856. ird.govt.nz 30 Question 14 Look-through company (LTC) income If the estate or trust received any tax credits and/or income from an LTC write the details at Question 14. Do not include any of the following types of income received from an LTC at Question 14: • • interest and RWT (include these at Question 9) • • any dividends, imputation credits, and dividend RWT (include these at Question 10) • • Māori authority distributions and credits (include these at Question 11) • • any overseas income and qualifying tax credits attached (include these at Question 13), or • • residential rental income (include this at Question 15). The loss limitation rule limits the amount of deductions an LTC owner (shareholder) can claim if the amount exceeds the owner's "owner's basis" (equity) in the LTC. For the 2017-18 and later income years, the loss limitation rule only applies to an LTC which is in a partnership or joint venture which includes another LTC. The estate or trust can now claim the full amount of prior years' non-allowable deductions brought forward this year. This will not apply if the loss limitation rule continues to apply to limit the amount claimable. The LTC will normally supply information about the non- allowable deductions and any other information required to complete your return. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE31 Example Trust A is an owner of an LTC which is not in a partnership or joint venture that includes another LTC. For the 2021 - 22 income year Trust A has a net loss of $4,000.00 from the LTC. Trust A also has prior years' non-allowable deductions brought forward of $5,000.00. Trust A had no tax credits from the LTC for the year. Trust A's tax return should show the following amounts in the following boxes: • • 14A: $0.00 • • 14B: $4,000.00 - • • 14C: $0.00 • • 14D: $5,000.00 • • 14E: $9,000.00 - What to show on your return Add up all other tax credits received from the LTC and print the total in Box 14A. Add up all LTC income, deduct expenses not already included elsewhere and print in Box 14B. If a loss, put a minus sign in the last box. Add up all non-allowable deductions this year and print in Box 14C. There should not be non-allowable deductions this year unless the loss limitation rule applies. Add up all prior year non-allowable deductions claimable this year and print the amount in Box 14D. You'll be able to claim the full amount of non-allowable deductions brought forward from last year if the loss limitation rule no longer applies. If you have an amount in Box 14C, add this to Box 14B and put the total in Box 14E. If you have an amount in Box 14D, subtract this from Box 14B and put the total in Box 14E. ird.govt.nz 32 If you do not have any amounts in Box 14C or Box 14D, copy the amount from Box 14B to 14E. Box 14E is your adjusted LTC income. You can find more information about LTCs in the Look- through companies - IR879 guide. Question 15 Income and expenditure from residential property This question applies to owners of residential property, including overseas property, that gives rise to net income from a bright-line sale, and property subject to the residential property deduction rules. Bright-line property rule for residential property The bright-line property rule needs to be considered when none of the other land sale rules at Question 18 apply to the disposal of the property. This rule for residential property looks at the length of time a property is owned. If you sell or dispose of a residential property within a certain timeframe and no exclusion applies, then your profit on the sale will be taxable. This applies no matter what your reason was for buying the property or what kind of buyer you are. The bright-line property rule applies if you sell or dispose of a residential property you have owned for less than: • • 5 years for properties acquired between 29 March 2018 and 26 March 2021. • • 5 years for properties acquired as a result of an offer made on or before 23 March 2021 and that offer was not able to be revoked or withdrawn before 27 March 2021. • • 5 years for properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021 that qualify as a ‘new build’. • • 10 years for all other properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE33 For tax purposes, a property is generally acquired on the date a binding sale and purchase agreement is entered into (even if some standard conditions like getting finance or a building report still need to be met). This date will determine which bright-line period (5 or 10 years) applies for your property. For more information on when a property is acquired, see our Question we’ve been asked (QB) 17/02: Date of acquisition of land, and start date for 2-year bright-line test at taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz There are other dates that are relevant for figuring out whether your property sale is taxable under the bright- line property rule. Generally, your bright-line period starts when the legal title is transferred to you and ends when you enter into a binding sale and purchase agreement to sell the property. There are some different rules if you purchase “off the plan” in a new development, for example. The bright-line property rule does not tax any profit made while the property was your main home. It also does not apply to a sale of inherited property, if you’re the executor or administrator of a deceased estate, or if you transfer property to a partner or spouse under a relationship property agreement (however, for any subsequent sale the bright-line property rule will apply). You can use the property tax decision tool on our website to work out if you need to pay tax on the sale of your property. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/brightline Income and losses for property subject to the bright-line property rule are treated differently in the tax return. After a taxable bright-line sale: • • if you have net income from the sale of the property (a profit), the net income is included in Box 15A. Unless the property is part of a portfolio, expenses from other properties cannot be offset against the net income from the disposal. • • if you have made a net loss when the property is sold, the loss must be carried forward to a later income year when it can be used to offset net income from the land sale provisions, including from future disposals subject to the bright-line rule. A bright-line loss is not recorded in the tax return. Please keep your own record of any bright-line losses you have made. ird.govt.nz 34 Complete a Bright-line residential property sale information - IR833 form for each bright-line property sold or disposed of and include it with your return. The form explains how to calculate the resulting profit or loss. Complete the form even if the details have been included in a Financial statements summary - IR10 or set of accounts, unless the income will be included in your return as part of your business income as a property speculator, property dealer, developer or builder. If you sell/dispose of a residential property and the sale is taxable under the bright-line property rule, the amount of the previously denied interest under the interest limitation rules is treated as if it were part of the cost of the property in the year of disposal. If this results in a net loss, the deduction for the net loss is limited under the current rule that applies to losses from the disposal of bright-line property. If the disposal is not taxable, the interest previously denied a deduction remains non-deductible. If you are a New Zealand tax resident you’ll need to pay tax on your worldwide income under New Zealand tax law. This includes any property sales both in New Zealand and overseas subject to the bright-line property rule or the other land sale rules. For more information on the land sale rules, go to ird.govt.nz/buying-selling or read our guide Bright-line property tax - IR1227. You can find our forms and guides at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Residential property deduction rules Most residential rental properties are subject to the residential property deduction rules (also known as the ring-fencing rules). When they apply, your residential rental deductions generally cannot be more than your residential property income. If your deductions are more than your income, the difference must be carried forward to the next year you earn residential income, including income from properties held on revenue account. There are 2 levels of exclusions from the rules. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE35 Any rental income or loss and net income or loss from a taxable disposal is fully excluded from the new rules if the property is: • • the main home • • property subject to the mixed-use asset rules (for example, a holiday home rented out part-time and not used for some of the year) • • certain employee accommodation. For these types of property, the existing rules apply with the rental income or loss shown at box 17B and net income or net loss from a taxable disposal shown in box 18B. Any rental net loss and net loss from a taxable disposal is partially excluded from the new rules if it is for: • • property that will always be taxed on sale, being revenue account property of a person in the business of building, developing or dealing in land, or • • other revenue account property the person has notified us they want the exclusion to apply to. For these types of property any rental net loss is shown at Box 17B and taxable disposal net loss shown at Box 18B. Net rental income and net income from a taxable disposal plus any depreciation recovered is shown as residential income Box 15A. All other residential property income is to be included in Box 17B. Income or loss from the sale/disposal of residential property that is outside the rules is included in Box 18B. Refer to the Rental income - IR264 guide for information on when the rules apply, how to calculate your income, the amount of deductions you can claim for this year, and the amount of any excess deductions that must be carried forward. The residential property deduction rules also apply to a trust that has borrowed money to acquire an interest in certain entities with significant rental property holdings - a residential land-rich entity and has interest expenditure on the borrowed money. Residential land-rich entity - a close company, partnership ird.govt.nz 36 or look-through company that holds more than 50% of its assets by value in residential land directly or indirectly. They come under the interposed entities rules as part of the residential property deduction rules. For more information about the interposed entity rules, see page 60 of the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 31 No.8 September 2019. Completing Question 15 in your return You will use this question to record residential income and deductions that are subject to the residential property deduction rules. Tick the method you have used to calculate your residential property income and deductions. You can use 1 of the following methods: • • Portfolio basis - combine the income and deductions for all rental properties in the portfolio. • • Individual, property-by-property basis - income and deductions of individual property calculated separately to other property. You need to maintain separate records for each property to choose this option. • • Combination of the property-by-property basis and portfolio basis - choose to apply different methods to different property. Some properties are held in a portfolio and others are held on property-by-property basis. If you are an owner of a look-through company (LTC) and have attributed residential income or residential rental deductions you need to use the same method the LTC used to attribute the income and deductions. Calculate and identify the amounts for Boxes 15A to 15F using your chosen method. Calculate your rental income and deductions as usual, as shown at boxes 4 and 14 on the Rental income - IR3R form. You can then enter these amounts in the Residential property deductions worksheets - IR1226 to help calculate the amounts required to be entered in your return. You can print a copy off our website ird.govt.nz ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE37 Write the total residential income in Box 15A. This is the total of: (a) all rental income from the portfolio (and/or individual property) (b) all depreciation recovery income for assets disposed of from the portfolio (or individual property) (c) net income from the taxable sale/disposal of a property in your portfolio (or individual property), and (d) all net rental income, depreciation recovery income and net income from the taxable disposal of the property from residential property excluded because it is held on revenue account. Only include the net income from a disposal once. If you are a partner in a partnership or owner of a look- through company and have been attributed residential income (Box 27G on the IR7P or IR7L), include that here. Write the total residential rental deductions for residential rental properties in Box 15B. This is the total deductions for the current year - Box 14 on the Rental income - IR3R if completed. If you are a partner in a partnership or owner of a look- through company and have been attributed residential rental deductions (Box 27M on the IR7P or IR7L), include that here. Do not include purchase costs, capital improvements or costs incurred when disposing of the property here. They are included when calculating the net income for taxable disposals. Include the amount of any interest paid on an investment in a land rich entity that relates to the rental activity in Box 15B. Include the amount of interest paid that does not relate to the rental property in Box 17B. Calculate the amount of allowable deductions you can claim this year, adjusting for excess deductions. Write the total residential rental deductions claimed this year in Box 15D. This should equate to Box 15B plus Box 15C less the amount of excess deductions for each property and/or property portfolio calculations shown in Box 15F. ird.govt.nz 38 The amount cannot exceed total residential income at Box 15A, unless there was a taxable sale/disposal of a rental property. Combine the net income results (after adjusting for any excess deductions) for each property and or property portfolio calculations in Box 15E. Your total Net residential income in Box 15E cannot be a loss, unless the rental property or all the properties in the portfolio have been disposed of as taxable sales. Any losses are counted as zero unless the loss is the result of either: • • excess deductions released as the result of either a taxable disposal of a property held on the property-by- property basis, or a taxable disposal of all properties or the last property held in a portfolio, or • • claimable interest paid on your investment in a residential land-rich entity. Refer to the Rental income - IR264 guide. Write the amount of all excess deductions for the year to be carried forward to next year in Box 15F. This is calculated as Residential rental deductions Box 15B plus 15C minus Residential rental deductions claimed this year Box 15D. Include the amount of any excess deductions to be carried forward for interest paid on an investment in a land rich entity in Box 15F. Note 1 If you sell/dispose of an individual property and the sale is not taxable, or you sell/dispose of the last property in a portfolio and at least 1 of the sales in the portfolio was not taxable, any excess deductions will transfer to another property or portfolio and carried forward to a future year in which you earn income from a residential rental property (including properties on revenue account). ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE39 Note 2 If you sell/dispose of an individual property and the sale is taxable, or you sell/dispose of the last rental property in a portfolio, and the sale of all your rental properties in a portfolio were taxable, any remaining loss/excess deductions are released and can be offset against other income. However, this does not include any excess deductions transferred to the portfolio/property. Note 3 If you want to claim that a property is held on revenue account where the sale may be taxable, you need to tell us the details of the property. You will be stating the sale will be a taxable sale when the property is disposed of. You must be able to separately identify the deductions relating to the property. Refer to the Rental income - IR264 guide. Question 16 Interest incurred from residential property This question applies to owners of residential property subject to the interest limitation rules. You do not need to complete this question for the following types of property: • • Farmland • • Hospitals, hospices, convalescent homes, nursing homes • • Rest homes and retirement villages • • Hotels, motels, inns, camping grounds, hostels. For interest to be deductible, the general deductibility rules must be met. The interest will also not be deductible to the extent to which it is of a private or domestic nature. From 1 October 2021, interest is not deductible for residential property in New Zealand acquired on or after 27 March 2021, unless an exclusion or exemption applies (see below). For properties acquired before 27 March 2021, the ability ird.govt.nz 40 to deduct interest on existing loans is being phased out between 1 October 2021 and 31 March 2025. For the 2022 tax year, you can claim: • • 100% of the interest incurred from 1 April 2021 to 30 September 2021 • • 75% of the interest incurred from 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2022. Interest on any new loans drawn down on or after 27 March 2021 is not deductible. Special rules also apply for refinanced loans and for interest on revolving credit and overdraft facilities. Any interest on borrowings above the closing balance on 26 March 2021 is not deductible. For more information, go to ird.govt.nz/property/renting-out-residential-property There are interposed entity rules to deny interest deductions for a customer who borrows to indirectly fund residential property through an interposed entity. If you sell/dispose of a residential property and the sale is taxable under the bright-line property rule, the amount of the previously denied interest under the interest limitation rules is treated as if it were part of the cost of the property in the year of disposal. If this results in a net loss, the deduction for the net loss is limited under the current rule that applies to losses from the disposal of bright-line property. If the disposal is not taxable, the interest previously denied a deduction remains non-deductible. Completing Question 16 in your return Complete this question for any interest expense you are claiming in this income tax return at Boxes 15B and 17B in relation to a house, apartment, flat or other structure that could be used for residential accommodation, either short- term or long-term. This includes if you have an arrangement to build such a structure, and bare land that could be used to build such a structure under the relevant district plan. Write the total interest on residential property in Box 16A. This is the total interest incurred on your borrowings for all your residential properties for this year. If you are using an IR3R form to prepare a summary for each rental property, ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE41 this is the total of all the 7A Boxes. Write the amount of interest expense claimed in Box 16B. If you are using an IR3R form to prepare a summary for each rental property, this is the total of all the 7B Boxes. Note If you are a partner in a partnership or owner of a look- through company that has incurred interest on residential property at Question 19 in the IR7, include your share of that here in proportion to your share in the partnership or effective look-through interest in the LTC. If you have claimed an interest expense in Box 16B, at Box 16C tick the reason(s) for the interest expense claimed: • • A Māori exempt company or not a residential land company – The interest limitation rules do not apply to non-close companies or groups if less than 50% of its total assets consist of residential property (excluding development property but including shares in other companies that exceed this 50% test) at all times during the income year. A close company that is a Māori authority, eligible to be a Māori authority, or wholly-owned by an entity that is a Māori authority or eligible to be one is an exempt Māori company if it passes this 50% test. • • Certain schedule 15 exclusions or property not in NZ – The interest limitation rules apply to land in New Zealand only. Schedule 15 of the Income Tax Act 2007 also allows you to claim interest for the following: • • main home – if a portion is used to earn income such as a flatting situation • • business premises (for example, a villa now used as a dental clinic) except if the business premises is used for providing accommodation and it’s not a person’s main home • • certain Māori land, papakāinga and kaumātua housing, and land transferred as part of settlement under Te Tiriti o Waitangi/Treaty of Waitangi • • employee accommodation • • student accommodation. ird.govt.nz 42 • • Loans drawn down prior to 27 March 2021 or interest incurred before 1 October 2021 – Interest incurred from 1 April 2021 to 30 September 2021 is fully deductible. From 1 October 2021, the ability to claim interest is being phased out for the following situations: • • loans drawn down prior to 27 March 2021 • • property acquired before 27 March 2021 but the loan for the settlement of the property was not drawn down until on or after 27 March 2021 • • loans that relate to the purchase of a property acquired as a result of an offer made on or before 23 March 2021 and that offer was not able to be revoked or withdrawn before 27 March 2021. In other situations where the property is acquired on or after 27 March 2021, interest cannot be claimed from 1 October 2021 onwards. • • Emergency, transitional, social or council housing – You can claim interest for loans if your property is used for emergency, transitional or social housing when leased to the Crown (for example, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development or Kāinga Ora) or to a registered community housing provider. • • New build exemption - the exemption generally applies to new build residential properties for 20 years from the date a new build’s Code Compliance Certificate (CCC) is issued under the Building Act 2004. A ‘new build’ includes a self-contained dwelling: • • that received a CCC on or after 27 March 2020. The dwelling can be made from new or existing materials and can be constructed onsite or relocated onto the land • • acquired off the plans that received a CCC on or after 27 March 2020 • • created by converting an existing dwelling into 2 or more dwellings, that received a CCC on or after 27 March 2020 • • converted from commercial premises that received a CCC on or after 27 March 2020 ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE43 • • converted from a hotel or motel and building consent authority records show that the conversion was completed on or after 27 March 2020 • • that has been removed from the earthquake prone buildings register on or after 27 March 2020, provided there is proof the remediation has been completed (either in the form of a CCC being issued, or local or building consent authority records showing the work has been completed and verified by a suitably qualified engineer) • • that was remediated because of weathertightness issues, provided more than 75% of the dwelling has been re-clad and a CCC was issued on or after 27 March 2020. • • Development or land business exemption – The land business exemption applies to land held as part of a developing, subdividing, or land-dealing business, or a business of erecting buildings on land. The development exemption does not require you to have a ‘land business’ and applies to land that you develop, subdivide, or build on to create a new build. The development may be a one-off. For more information about the interest limitation rules and how to calculate the amount of interest you can claim, go to ird.govt.nz/property/renting-out-residential-property or read our guide Rental income - IR264. You can find our forms and guides at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Question 17 Business or rental income If the estate or trust has business or rental income (other than residential rental income see question 15), you must attach either: • • a fully completed Financial statements summary - IR10 form, or • • a set of the estate or trust's financial accounts for the year. The IR10 summarises the information we need from the financial accounts. If you complete an IR10 you do not need to send us your financial accounts, but you still need to complete and keep them. ird.govt.nz 44 Business income Write the net profit in Box 17B. This is the amount of income or net loss after all allowable business expenditure has been deducted. If the total is a loss, put a minus sign in the last box at Box 17B. When calculating business income, you can use the Schedule of business income - IR3B. Rental income If there is rental income other than residential rental income, print the net profit or loss (total rents minus expenses) in Box 17B. When calculating rental income you can use the Rental income - IR3R. Attribution rule Under the attribution rule, anyone whose actions cause an associated person (company, trust or partnership) to earn income, can be personally liable for tax on that income. If this rule applies to persons associated with your estate or trust, it will affect the amount of taxable income in this return. For more information read our Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 12 (December 2000) page 49 and TIB, Vol 13, No 11 (November 2001). Question 18 Income from taxable property sales/disposals Include the total net income or loss from land. Do not include net income or loss from a bright-line sale at Box 18B. Bright-line sales are included under residential income at Question 15.

Attach it to page 3 of the return and include the total profit in Box 20B. Income from sale of land and/or buildings other than residential The profits are taxable if the estate or trust purchased a property for the purpose of reselling it or are in the business of buying and selling land and/or buildings. If the estate or trust is a New Zealand tax resident it will need to pay tax on its worldwide income under New Zealand tax law. This includes any property sales worldwide.

You can download the IR833 from ird.govt.nz/forms-guides Complete the form even if the details have been included in a Financial statements summary - IR10 or set of accounts. Include total profits in Box 18B. Income from sale of shares or other property Profits from the sale of shares or other property are taxable if the estate or trust: • • buys and sells shares or other property as a business • • buys shares or other property for the purpose of resale, or • • buys shares or property to make a profit. List the details of income and expenses from these sales on a sheet of paper and staple it to page 3 of the return. Include the total profit in Box 18B. Sale or disposal of assets There are a number of rules that apply to the sale or disposal of assets. For more information read Part 3 of our guide Depreciation - a guide for business - IR260. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE47 Losses from sale of land, buildings, shares that are not FIFs, or other property If the estate or trust has made a loss and can show that if it had made a profit it would have been taxable, it may be able to claim the loss as a deduction. If the property was purchased on or after 1 October 2015 with no intention to sell and it was sold/disposed of within 2 years, any excess deductions cannot be claimed unless they can be offset against net income from other property sales. Bright-line property sale information – IR833 form has more information on this. For more information on property sales see our guide Buying and selling residential property - IR313. Show the loss with a minus sign in the last box at Box 18B. PAYE income accrued to date of death The following types of PAYE income must be returned by the estate if it is accrued to the date of death and subsequently received by the estate: • • salary or wages • • holiday pay or other leave payments • • director's fees, and • • any other PAYE income (includes schedular payments). Include the total gross amount in Box 20B and any tax credits in Box 20A. This income is assessed as trustee income. Certain settlements on a trust The following settlements of property on a trust are deemed to be trustee income. This means that these settlements of property are excluded from the definition of corpus: • • property settled by a trustee of another trust, so long as it would have counted as income if that trust had distributed the property to 1 of its beneficiaries instead. • • a settlement of a property on a trust, which, if not for the settlement, would have constituted: - income of the settlor, or - a dividend for which the settlor would have been liable to deduct an FDP (foreign dividend payment), ird.govt.nz 48 formerly dividend withholding payment, if the settlor is currently resident or had been resident in New Zealand and subject to income tax at that time. Forgiveness of debt The financial arrangements rules treat debts that do not have to be repaid because they have been forgiven as income to the debtor. There is an exception in the case of trusts if the creditor is a natural person and forgives the debt: • • due to "natural love and affection" for natural persons who are beneficiaries of the trust, or • • of a trust that was established mainly for the benefit of charitable organisations. If the debt forgiven is distributed to a non-qualifying beneficiary, the trustee can be liable for tax. For more information, please see our Tax Information Bulletin Vol 11, No 6 (July 1999) page 20. Question 20 Total income & total tax credits Add up Boxes 9B to 13B, 14E, 15E, and 17B to 19B. Write the total in Box 20B. Add up Boxes 9A to 14A, 17A and 19A. Write the total in Box 20A. Do not include Box 10 in this total. Question 21 Income allocation Income derived by a trustee must be allocated between beneficiary income and trustee income in boxes 21A and 21B respectively. Question 21A - Beneficiary income excluding minor beneficiaries Beneficiary income is income of an estate or trust that vests in a beneficiary during the year or is paid to a beneficiary (or credited to them or dealt with in their interest or on their behalf) during the year or within a certain period after the end of the year. The rest of the income generated by an estate or trust will be trustee income. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE49 The income available to allocate to beneficiaries may be the income in Box 20B but it is important to note that Box 20B is a total of various amounts of estate or trust income. Some of the amounts, such as income from rental activities, are net amounts, for example after deductions. Some of the deductions may be for non-cash outgoings, such as depreciation. This may result in there being income that can be distributed to beneficiaries despite Box 20B showing a loss, and providing the trust deed allows it. This means there may be amounts that vest in or are paid to beneficiaries that have to be treated as beneficiary income. Identify any such vesting or payment and include the amount in Box 21A. The total must reconcile with the combined totals of Boxes 27I on the IR6B after deducting any taxable distributions included in Box 27H. Timing of allocation of beneficiary income Allocation of income to a beneficiary must be made within the income year, or by the later of the following: • • 6 months after balance date, or • • the earlier of: - the date on which the trustee completes the return of income for the income year, or - the date by which the trustee must complete a return for the income year. Example A family trust is allocating income to beneficiaries for the year ended 31 March 2022. The trust return is due on 7 July 2022 and the trust plans to complete by 30 June. The income should be allocated by the later of the following: • • 30 September 2022, or • • the earlier of: -30 June 2022, or -7 July 2022. In this case the income must be allocated by September 2022. ird.govt.nz 50 If the trust has a tax preparer, the extension of time for completing income tax returns may apply. Question 21B - Trustee income including minor beneficiaries Trustee income is any income generated by an estate or trust that is not beneficiary income, see "Question 21A - Beneficiary income" on pages 48 and 49. It includes income accrued to date of death and received afterwards. Where Box 20B shows a loss, there will be no trustee income and Box 21B should be left blank. The loss in Box 20B will be taken into account by us in calculating the loss to carry forward. Accrued income and non-apportionment clauses As a general rule, accrued income to date of death is retained by the trustee and becomes part of the capital of the estate. This income is treated as trustee income. However, where the will of the deceased taxpayer contains a non-apportionment clause, the beneficiary is entitled to receive the income accrued to date of death. So, if the accrued income is paid to the beneficiary, it's treated as beneficiary income. Question 22 Expenses The estate or trust may have incurred expenses in generating its income, for example: • • commission deducted from interest or dividends • • expenses for return preparation • • deductible trustee charges, or • • interest paid to Inland Revenue. If these expenses have not been claimed elsewhere in the return, write the amount claimed in Box 22. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE51 Note Certain expenditure is not deductible and this includes: • • private expenditure, and • • capital expenditure. Penalties may apply if it is claimed incorrectly. Question 23 Net losses brought forward There are 2 types of losses the estate or trust can bring forward. Specified activity net losses These are net losses from specified activities incurred before the 1991 income year. Any loss balance in relation to a specified activity that remained at the end of the 2021 income year must be offset against net income for the 2022 income year, before taking into account other losses. The amount of this offset cannot exceed the net income. If the loss balance from specified activities incurred before the 1991 income year exceeds the net income for the 2022 income year, that excess amount is added to the tax loss for the year. Any remaining tax loss is then carried forward to further income years. Other net losses All losses incurred from the 1991 income year onwards and other net losses that were not limited before 1991 (including any net loss resulting from excess imputation credits) are "other net losses". Enter the total of all specified activity net losses and other net losses the estate or trust can bring forward to 2022 in Box 23A. Enter the amount the estate or trust has offset against 2022 income in Box 23B. Note You'll find the amount of net loss the estate or trust has to bring forward on the loss notice we sent you with the 2021 income tax assessment. If you do not have a loss notice, contact us to obtain the figure. ird.govt.nz 52 Losses cannot be transferred from the deceased's return to the estate's return. Any such losses lapse. Trust losses cannot be passed to beneficiaries. They remain in the trust to be offset against future trustee income. If the estate or trust cannot offset any losses in 2022, enter "0.00" in Box 23B. Questions 24 and 25 Distributions to beneficiaries by foreign and non- complying trusts Question 24 - Distributions At Question 24 print the total amount of distributions made to beneficiaries during the year. A distribution is any income or property of the trust that vests in the beneficiary or is paid or applied for a beneficiary's benefit. It includes any property or service disposed of or provided to: • • a beneficiary for less than market value, or • • the trust by a beneficiary for greater than market value. Attach a separate schedule to page 3 of the return showing the source and the amount of each distribution. Distributions are considered to have come from different sources in the following order: • • beneficiary income • • accumulated trustee income • • capital profits or gains realised in the current income year • • capital profits or gains realised in previous years that have been accumulated by the trust, and • • the corpus of the trust. The ordering establishes if the distribution is a taxable distribution - see Question 23. Capital gains and corpus distributed only after income derived by trustees in the year of distribution and in prior years has been distributed. More information about the ordering and taxability of distributions can be found in our Trusts' and estates' income tax rules - IR288 guide. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE53 Question 25 - Taxable distributions A taxable distribution is one made to a beneficiary by a foreign or non-complying trust that is not beneficiary income. For a foreign trust taxable distributions also do not include capital gains profits that are not counted as taxable income, except when derived from transactions with associated persons or a distribution from the corpus. For non-complying trusts they do not include distributions from the corpus. Write the total taxable distributions made to beneficiaries during the year in Box 25. Where to include taxable distributions Include the amount of the taxable distribution made to each beneficiary in the beneficiary's panel of the IR6B: • • in Box 27H if the trust is a foreign trust, or • • in Box 27K if the trust is a non-complying trust. For tax payable on taxable distributions see Question 27K on page 59. Schedule of beneficiary's estate or trust income Each beneficiary (excluding minor beneficiaries) must attach a completed Schedule of beneficiary's estate or trust income - IR307 to their individual tax return if they receive income from a foreign or non-complying trust. It's helpful if the trustee or tax preparer also provides a completed IR307 when advising beneficiaries of their share of trust income. Beneficiaries do not then need to contact the trustee or tax preparer when completing their own returns. ird.govt.nz 54 Question 26 Additional disclosure of foreign investments If you calculated CFC or FIF income at Question 13 you may be required to complete an additional disclosure form for that investment. If the trust is not widely held or a PIE, you may not require an additional disclosure if the investments are in countries New Zealand has a double tax agreement with as at 31 March 2013, and have used the fair dividend rate or comparative value method. If the trust is widely held or a PIE you are required to complete an additional disclosure. Go to ird.govt.nz/beps for full details of the disclosure requirements and the appropriate forms. Find out more about the base erosion profit shifting (BEPS) hybrid mismatch rules at ird.govt.nz/beps If you need help? making a CFC or FIF disclosure please call 0800 443 773. Question 27 tax payable for beneficiaries Print the combined total from box 27T from all IR6B’s completed by the trust. Refer to the detail below on boxes 27A to 27AC for more information on how to complete the IR6B. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE55 IR6B Estate or trust beneficiary details Complete the details on the IR6B for each beneficiary who has received an income allocation from the trust. See Question 21A on pages 48 to 49 for the definition of beneficiary income. Complete boxes 27D to 27K to record any taxable income allocations made to the beneficiary. Complete boxes 27L to 27T to allocate tax credits and calculate tax payable. If the trust is required to comply with the NZ Domestic Trust disclosure rules (see question 33 to see if you need to comply) you must also complete an IR6B for any beneficiary who has received a distribution from the trust during the year. Complete boxes 27V to 27AA to record distributions made, and boxes 27U, 27AB and 27AC to record beneficiary account movements. Trusts required to comply with the NZ Domestic Trust Disclosure rules must supply each beneficiary’s: • • Full name • • Date of birth or commencement date • • IRD number or Tax identification number (refer question 27A, 27B and 27C) • • Jurisdiction of tax residency The question about jurisdiction of tax residency also lets us work out correctly how the beneficiary income should be taxed. Include all beneficiary income allocated to each non- resident beneficiary in Boxes 27D, 27E, 27F, 27G and 27H. Remember, the combined totals at Boxes 27I, less any taxable distributions from foreign trusts included at Box 27H must reconcile with the total of Box 21A. Non-resident passive income Non-resident passive income is interest, dividends and royalties for the supply of scientific, technical, industrial or commercial knowledge. These types of income are subject to non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) if the income has a New Zealand source. ird.govt.nz 56 This tax is deducted when the non-resident passive income is paid or credited to a non-resident beneficiary. The rates and methods of calculating the tax on a non-resident beneficiary’s share of income differ according to the type of income derived and the country the beneficiary is resident in. Include all income derived by each non-resident beneficiary in Boxes 27D, 27E, 27F, 27G and 27H. Paying NRWT When paying non-resident passive income to a non-resident beneficiary, the trust must complete certain forms and pay N RW T. If you need more help, see our NRWT - payer’s guide - IR291. When calculating the amount of income liable for income tax at the ordinary rates, do not include non-resident passive income or any overseas income in the taxable income figure in Box 27I for non-resident beneficiaries. Question 27A Beneficiary does not have a tax identification number (TIN) Tick one of these boxes to indicate why the beneficiary does not have a tax identification number. Question 27B Beneficiary’s IRD number Enter the beneficiary’s IRD number. If the beneficiary does not have an IRD number because, for example, they are a minor with no assessable income, tick the box at 27A to indicate “TIN not required in jurisdiction” and leave the field blank. If the beneficiary does not have an IRD number because they are not resident in NZ then leave this field blank and provide a TIN in box 27C. If you do not have the beneficiary’s IRD number contact the beneficiary. Due to our confidentiality obligations under section 18 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 we cannot provide it to you. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE57 Question 27C Beneficiary’s TIN If the beneficiary is not a tax resident in New Zealand, enter the beneficiary’s tax identification number from the tax jurisdiction they are resident in. If the beneficiary is not required to hold a TIN in that jurisdiction, or the jurisdiction does not issue TINS, tick one of the boxes at question 27A and leave this field blank. Questions 27D to 27T: Beneficiary income and calculation of tax, excluding minor beneficiaries See Question 21A on pages 48 to 49 for the definition of beneficiary income. Complete boxes 27D to 27K to record any taxable income allocations made to the beneficiary. Complete boxes 27L to 27T to allocate tax credits and calculate tax payable. Question 27D New Zealand interest If the allocation of beneficiary income includes any New Zealand interest, write the amount in Box 27D. Question 27E New Zealand dividends If the allocation of beneficiary income includes any New Zealand dividends, write the amount in Box 27E. Question 27F Māori authority distributions If the allocation of beneficiary income includes any Māori authority distributions, write the amount in Box 27F. Question 27G Overseas income If the allocation of beneficiary income includes any overseas income, write the amount in Box 27G. ird.govt.nz 58 Question 27H Other income and taxable distributions from a foreign trust Add the remainder of any allocated beneficiary income to any taxable distributions from a foreign trust and write the total in Box 27H. Question 27I Beneficiary income from the estate or trust Add up boxes 27D to 27H and write the total in Box 27I. Question 27J Paying the tax on beneficiary income, excluding minor beneficiaries The trustee must pay tax on behalf of the beneficiary for all income allocated to the beneficiary. However, the trustee and the beneficiary can agree not to have tax deducted from trust/estate income before the beneficiary receives it. This might be done where the beneficiary has losses available to offset income. Note The trustees will be liable if the beneficiary defaults on payment of the tax obligations on trust income. Tick ‘Yes’ if the estate or trust is paying the tax on behalf of beneficiaries, then complete all boxes 27D to 27T. ‘Yes’ means the trust/estate will retain any excess tax credits (except overseas credits and Imputation credits) for the trust/estate. The beneficiary must then show the gross income allocated to them as trust income and can only claim the amount of tax paid by the trust at key point 27L, in the key point for Tax Paid by Trustees of their own income tax return. Tick ‘No’ if the estate or trust is not paying the tax on behalf of beneficiaries. Then complete boxes 27D to 27I, and boxes 27K, 27M, 27O, 27Q, 27U, 27V, 27W, 27X, 27Y, 27Z, 27AA, 27AB & 27AC only. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE59 Question 27K Taxable distributions by non-complying trust Show taxable distributions to each beneficiary in Box 27K and the tax in Box 27S. Taxable distributions by a non- complying trust are taxable to the beneficiary at a flat rate of 45 cents in the dollar. Question 27L Calculation of tax Do not fill out Box 27L if you ticked “No” in Box 27J. If the estate or trust is paying tax on behalf of the beneficiaries first calculate tax on the total taxable income of each beneficiary, including other income not received from the estate or trust, using the rates below. Then determine the portion of tax applicable to just beneficiary income (see Trusts and estates income tax rules - IR288 and “Tax on beneficiary income”). Income to $14,000 10.5% $14,001 - $48,000 17.5% $48,001 - $70,000 30.0% $70,001 - $180,000 33.0% $180,001 and over 39% Question 27M Beneficiary’s share of overseas tax paid Allocate any tax paid overseas to beneficiaries on the same basis as the allocation of income. Minor beneficiaries’ share of overseas tax is to be offset against tax payable on trustee income. A New Zealand resident who receives a taxable distribution is not allowed a tax credit in relation to any income tax paid unless the tax is the same as non-resident withholding tax (NRWT). The amount of any credit is equal to: taxable income × foreign tax paid total distribution ird.govt.nz 60 Question 27N Calculation Do not fill out Box 27N if you ticked “No” in Box 27J. Subtract Box 27M from Box 27L. If the overseas tax paid (Box 27M) allocated to a beneficiary is greater than the tax payable in Box 27L, print 0.00 at Box 27N. Question 27O Beneficiary’s share of dividend imputation credits If dividends have been allocated to a beneficiary, use the following formula to work out the credits attached to those dividends: a ×( b ) c a is the total of all dividend imputation credits attached to all dividends distributed to beneficiaries during the income year b is the total distribution, including capital distributions made to the particular beneficiary during the year c is the total distribution, including capital distributions made to all beneficiaries during the year. Show the beneficiary’s share of imputation credits in Box 27O. Question 27P Calculation Do not fill out Box 27P if you ticked “No” in Box 27J. Subtract Box 27O from Box 27N. If the beneficiary’s share of the imputation credits is larger than their tax payable in Box 27N, the excess credit cannot be refunded to the trust. Write 0.00 in Box 27P. The beneficiary should claim the balance of the unused imputation credits in their own tax return. Minor beneficiaries’ share of dividend imputation credits is to be offset against tax payable on trustee income in Box 28H of the IR6. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE61 Question 27Q Beneficiary’s allocation of RWT and other credits Minor beneficiaries’ allocation of RWT and other credits is to be offset against tax payable on trustee income. Ensure that you include the following amounts in Box 27Q for each beneficiary: • • allocation of RWT (Boxes 9A and 10A) including any RWT credits reallocated under the RWT substitution payment rules • • share of Māori authority credits (Box 11A) • • share of partnership, estate or trust tax credits (Box 12A) • • share of LTC tax credits (Box 14A) • • if income from a property sale is treated as beneficiary income, show their share of any residential land withholding tax credit (Box 18A), and • • share of other income credits (Box 19A). Note Do not include any amounts already shown in either Boxes 27M or 27O of the IR6B. Questions 27R & 27T Do not fill out 27R or 27T if you ticked ‘No’ in Box 27J. Question 27S Calculate tax on taxable distribution by non-complying trust in 27K at 45 cents in the dollar and print this in Box 27S. Questions 27U to 27AC: Distributions and beneficiary account movements If the trust is required to comply with the NZ Domestic Trust disclosure rules (see question 33 to see if you need to comply) you must disclose the details of any beneficiary who has received a distribution from the trust during the year, refer to page 11 of the guide to read more about distributions. Complete boxes 27V to 27AA to record distributions made, and boxes 27U, 27AB and 27AC to record beneficiary account movements. ird.govt.nz 62 Question 27U: Opening balance Enter the opening balance of any amount owing to the beneficiary from distributions made in prior years that have not been withdrawn or enjoyed by the beneficiary. Question 27V: Accounting income and other distributions Enter the total accounting income distributed to the beneficiary for the year. This may be different from the total income allocated at questions 27D to 27H because: • • Taxable income allocations can include amounts allocated within 6-months of the end of the tax year; • • Taxable income may be calculated using different rules from accounting income, such as the FIF or PIE rules. Include any other distributions that are not captured in questions 27W, 27X, 27Y and 27Z. An example of a distribution not captured below is where a beneficiary provides assets or services to a trust and receives higher than market value in return. Question 27W: Distribution of trust corpus Enter the total amount of trust corpus distributed to the beneficiary during the year. Trust corpus reflects amounts of any settlements made on the trust (less any distributions made). Question 27X: Distribution of trust capital Enter the total amount of trust capital distributed to the beneficiary during the year. Trust capital reflects tax paid profits and realised capital gains of the trust. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE63 Question 27Y: Distribution arising when property is used by a beneficiary for less than market value If a beneficiary enjoys the use of trust property for less than market value this is a distribution. If the cost of providing this to the beneficiary is NIL you can record zero at question 27Y, as long as this corresponds with the way it has been treated in the trust’s financial statements. Alternatively you can use a fair market value. Example The trust owns a holiday home at the beach, all beneficiaries have free use of the property at any time. Each time a beneficiary uses the property they are receiving a distribution from the trust. Provided the trust does not incur any holding costs on the property then the amount of the distribution can be recorded as nil. Question 27Z: Distribution of trust assets (other than cash) Record the value of any trust assets (excluding cash) distributed to the beneficiary during the year. The amount of the distribution should align with the asset value recorded in the financial statements of the trust, which may reflect historical cost, tax book value or market value. Question 27AA: Distribution arising from forgiveness of debt Enter the amount of any debt owing by the beneficiary that has been forgiven by the trust during the year. ird.govt.nz 64 Question 27AB: Withdrawals and amounts enjoyed during the year Record the total of: • • the value of assets used for less than market value (27Y) • • assets withdrawn (27Z) • • debt forgiven (27AA) and • • any cash withdrawals made by the beneficiary during the year Question 27AC: Closing balance Record the closing balance of amounts owed to the beneficiary at the end of the year. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE65 Trustee income and calculation of tax Question 28A Calculation of taxable income If the result is negative, the amount will be taken into account in the loss carried forward to the following year. Question 28B Calculation of tax and tax on taxable distributions If the trust has received a taxable distribution and tax has not been paid, calculate tax at 33 cents in the dollar and add it to the total. Question 28C Credit for tax paid overseas The amount of the credit for tax paid overseas on trustee income is limited to the amount of New Zealand tax on that income. Remember to attach evidence of payment to page 3 of your return. Question 28E Dividend imputation credits If the trustee's share of the imputation credit exceeds the tax on trustee income at Box 28D, the excess credit cannot be refunded. Write 0.00 in Box 28F. The excess credit is converted to a net loss to carry forward to the following year. To calculate the net loss to carry forward to 2023, use the worksheet on page 66. We'll send you a notice confirming the amount of loss to carry forward. ird.govt.nz 66 Example In this example the net loss to carry forward to the income year ending 31 March 2023 is $151.00 in Box 4. Trustee's share of imputation credits from Box 28E of the return. 1 350 00 Tax on trustee income from Box 28D of the return. 2 300 00 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1. Print your answer here. 3 50 00 Divide Box 3 by 0.33 (33%). Print your answer here. 4 (151 00) Worksheet Trustee's share of imputation credits from Box 28E of the return. 1 Tax on trustee income from Box 28D of the return. 2 Subtract Box 2 from Box 1. Print your answer here. 3 Divide Box 3 by 0.33 (33%). Print your answer here. 4 The amount in Box 4 is the net loss to carry forward to 2023. Question 28G Trustee's share of RWT and other credits The following amounts should be added together and printed in Box 28G: • • the trustee's allocation of RWT (Boxes 9A and 10A) • • the trustee's share of Māori authority credits (Box 11A) • • the trustee's share of partnership, estate or trust tax credits (Box 12A) • • the trustee's share of LTC tax credits (Box 14A) • • the total from Box 19A, and • • the trustee's share of any RLWT credit (Box 18A). Do not include any amounts already shown in either Boxes 27M or 27O of the IR6B. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE67 Question 30 Refunds and/or transfers Please be careful to copy the amount from Box 29E to Box 30 correctly. Direct credit If you choose direct credit, you get your refund faster and you can withdraw your money as soon as it's credited because there's no clearance time. We pay any refund direct into your New Zealand bank account or other deposit account, for example a building society account, as soon as we've processed your return. Make sure your correct account number is printed at Question 6 on the front page of your return. Question 30A Overpaid provisional tax If you’ve made payments towards your 2023 provisional tax and, after completing this return, find you have less or no provisional tax to pay, the overpayment can be included in the amount we refund or transfer. Attach a separate note to your return to request this. Question 30B Transferring a refund to pay provisional tax If you're entitled to a refund you can transfer all or part of it to your 2023 provisional tax. If you want to do this print the amount of the transfer in Box 30A. Questions 30C to 30D Transfers to another taxpayer's income tax account If you'd like your refund transferred to another account you'll need to tell us what date you'd like it transferred. The date you choose depends on what tax has been overpaid and whose account you want the credit transferred to. Different rules apply if the other taxpayer is associated to you. ird.govt.nz 68 Associated taxpayers When transferring overpaid tax, associated taxpayers are: • • a company you're a shareholder-employee in • • a partner in the same partnership • • a relative (for example child, parent, spouse, or partner), or • • a trustee of a family trust you're a beneficiary of. You can ask for your credit to be transferred at any date as long as it's not before the relevant date shown below. Tick "Yes" or "No" at Box 30B to indicate whether the other taxpayer is associated and write their name in the boxes provided. Write the IRD number of the other taxpayer at Box 30C. Write the amount you wish to transfer at Box 30D. Transfer dates For refunds transferred to your account or an associated taxpayers account: • • If the credit is from excess tax deducted (for example PAYE deducted), it's the day after your balance date (or 1 April if your balance date is before 31 March). • • If the credit is from overpaid provisional tax, it's the day you overpaid it. Note Special rules apply if the return period has had tax pooling refunds transferred in. For credit transferred to a non-associated person's account, it's the later of the day you requested the transfer, or the day after you complete your return. Future transfer dates If you'd like your credit transferred at a date in the future, attach a note to the front of your return with details of: • • the amount you want transferred • • the account you want it transferred to, and if it's the account of the associated person, and • • the date you'd like it transferred. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE69 If you do not tell us the date you'd like your credit transferred, we'll transfer it at a date we think gives you the greatest advantage. Contact us if you'd like to change the transfer date and tell us if this transfer is to cover a debt. For more information on transfers, read Tax Information Bulletin Vol 14, No 11 (November 2002). Refunds of less than $1 If your refund is less than $1 it will be carried forward to your next tax assessment. We'll offset it against any amount you may owe us or add it to any refund. If you do not want it carried forward, please contact us. Question 31 Initial provisional tax liability If this is the first year the estate or trust started to derive gross income from a taxable activity, print the start date in Box 31. Provisional tax is not payable if the residual income tax (RIT) for the previous year was $5,000 or less. Most new businesses do not pay provisional tax in their first year of operation because there's no RIT from the previous year to base the calculation on. However, a special rule requires you to pay interest if you have an initial provisional tax liability. The estate or trust has an initial provisional tax liability if: • • it starts to derive gross income from a taxable activity, and • • it had not derived income from a taxable activity within the preceding 4 years, or • • you have RIT of $60,000 or more in the current year. The interest cost can be reduced or eliminated by making voluntary provisional tax payments on the instalment due dates. ird.govt.nz 70 Interest rules for taxpayers with an initial provisional tax liability Taxpayers with an initial provisional tax liability may be charged interest from the first, second or third instalment date. The instalment date that interest applies from is determined by the taxable activity's start date. For estates and trusts whose balance date is 31 March, the start date for interest will be: • • 29 August, if the taxable activity started before 30 July of the same year • • 16 January, if the taxable activity started between 31 July and 16 December of the previous year, or • • 8 May, if the taxable activity started on or after 17 December of the previous year. An estate or trust with a balance date other than 31 March generally pays provisional tax on the 28th day of the 5th, 9th and 13th months after the balance date, unless completing six-monthly GST returns. If you need help to work out whether the estate or trust has an initial provisional tax liability, read our guide Provisional tax - IR289. Question 32 2023 provisional tax 2023 provisional tax is charged for income the estate or trust will earn in the 2023 income year. It is payable in 2, 3 or 6 equal instalments. There are 3 options for paying provisional tax - standard, estimation and ratio. If the estate or trust's 2022 RIT is: • • $5,000 or less it does not have to pay provisional tax, although it can make voluntary payments • • more than $5,000 but expected to be $5,000 or less for 2023, it may estimate 2023 provisional tax at nil (read "Estimation option" on page 71), or • • more than $5,000 and expected to be more than $5,000 for 2022, it must pay 2023 provisional tax. If you anticipate your RIT will exceed $5,000 for the 2022 year, see "Interest" on page 73. You may be liable for interest from your first provisional tax instalment date. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE71 Which option to use Estates or trusts can use either the standard or estimation options to pay their provisional tax. If they're registered for GST they may also be able to use the ratio option. Standard option Using the standard option, the estate or trust's 2023 provisional tax will be equal to its 2022 RIT plus 5%. If you use this option enter S in Box 32A on the return and the amount of 2023 provisional tax in Box 32B. • • If the estate or trust's 2022 return has not been completed by the first instalment date of 2023 provisional tax, the provisional tax instalments payable is based on 2021 RIT plus 10% (divided by 3 or 2, depending on how many instalments are payable). Estimation option Estates or trusts can estimate their 2023 provisional tax. Trustees must include distributions to minor beneficiaries in their estimate. They can re-estimate any number of times up to and including their final instalment due date. If the estate or trust's 2023 RIT is expected to be less than its 2022 RIT, estimating may prevent the estate or trust from paying more tax than it has to. Note An estimate must be "fair and reasonable" at each instalment it applies to. If you use this option, see page 73 on "Not taking reasonable care penalty" and "Interest". If you estimate your provisional tax, your instalments should be one-third of your estimation. Use the worksheet on page 72 to calculate provisional tax using the estimation option. If you use this option enter E in Box 32A and the amount of 2023 provisional tax in Box 32B. Estimating provisional tax on beneficiary income When working out the tax on estimated beneficiary income, calculate the tax separately for each beneficiary, including estimated tax credits where applicable. The table on the following page shows the 2023 individual tax rates for provisional tax. ird.govt.nz 72 2023 annual tax rates income range Ta x r a t e Income to $14,00010.5% $14,001 - $48,00017.5% $48,001 - $70,00030.0% $70,001 - $180,00033.0% $180,001 and over39.0% When using these tax rates to calculate 2023 provisional tax, you'll also need to estimate the tax credits the beneficiary may be entitled to. Use this worksheet to calculate the estate or trust's 2023 provisional tax using the estimation option. Print the estate or trust's estimated 2023 income to be allocated in Box 1. 1 Estimated allocation of income: •• Beneficiary income 2 •• Trustee income 3 Work out the tax on the amount in Box 2, using the rates above. Print your answer in Box 4. 4 Multiply the amount in Box 3 by 0.33 (33%). Print your answer in Box 5. 5 If the estate or trust is non- complying, multiply the estimated taxable distributions, if any, by 0.45 (45%). Print your answer in Box 6. 6 Add Boxes 4, 5 and 6. Print your answer in Box 7. 7 Print the estimated 2023 credits (trustees' share only) in Box 8. 8 Subtract Box 8 from Box 7. Print your answer in Box 9. 9 Box 9 is the estate or trust's 2023 provisional tax. Copy it to Box 32B of the return and print E in Box 32A. ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE73 Divide the amount in Box 9 by three to get the amount to pay for each instalment. If you need more help read our guide Provisional tax - IR289. Ratio option If the trust is GST registered you may qualify to use the ratio option to calculate your provisional tax. Only enter R at Box 32A if you've already elected to use the ratio option. Your application to use the ratio option must be made by phone or in writing before the beginning of the income year you want to use it in. If you've already elected to use the ratio option and want to continue using it, enter R at Box 32A. More information about the ratio option is in our guide Provisional tax - IR289. Not taking reasonable care penalty When you estimate the estate or trust's 2023 provisional tax, your estimate must be fair and reasonable. If the 2023 RIT is greater than the provisional tax paid, you may be liable for a not taking reasonable care penalty of 20% of the underpaid provisional tax. Interest If the estate or trust has paid too much provisional tax on trustee income we may pay interest, or if it has not paid enough, we may charge interest. Interest for estates or trusts is calculated only on the tax payable on trustee income. Interest is not calculated if all income is distributed to the beneficiaries. Interest the estate or trust pays is generally tax-deductible, while interest we pay is taxable income. For more information about interest and penalties read our guide Penalties and interest - IR240. If we pay interest, it continues to accrue until the date we refund the overpaid tax, or apply it to another liability. ird.govt.nz 74 Election to be a provisional tax payer An estate or trust is a provisional tax payer for the 2023 year if its RIT for 2022 is more than $5,000. If the 2022 RIT is $5,000 or less, and • • the estate or trust made provisional tax payments for that tax year, and • • payments were made under the estimation method (other than using the estimation method for its final instalment only), It may elect to be a provisional tax payer for 2023. This may affect the interest it may be entitled to for that year. To elect to be a provisional tax payer for the 2023 year, attach a letter to the front of the return. Change in balance date There are special rules about when provisional tax is due and how interest is calculated if there has been a change in balance date. Read our Provisional tax - IR289 guide for more information. Tax pooling Tax pooling allows taxpayers to pool provisional tax payments, offsetting underpayments by overpayments within the same pool. This reduces their possible exposure to late payment penalties and use-of-money interest. The pooling arrangement is made through a commercial intermediary, who arranges for participating taxpayers to be charged or compensated for the offset. For more information about tax pooling, including a list of intermediaries, go to ird.govt.nz/tax-pooling ESTATE OR TRUST RETURN GUIDE75 Payment dates 2023 provisional tax Generally, an estate or trust with a 31 March balance date pays provisional tax by the following due dates: • • First instalment 28 August 2022 • • Second instalment 15 January 2023 • • Third instalment 7 May 2023 An estate or trust with a balance date other than 31 March pays provisional tax on the 28th day of the 5th, 9th and 13th months after the balance date. Where payments would otherwise be due on 28 December or 28 April the due date is extended to 15 January or 7 May. These dates will alter if: • • the estate or trust is registered for GST, and • • the GST filing frequency is six-monthly, or • • provisional tax is paid by the ratio option. If either of these situations apply to you, read our guide Provisional tax - IR289. 2022 end-of-year income tax Estates or trusts that have an agent and an extension of time may have until 7 April 2023 to pay their tax. If you think this applies to you contact your agent for more information. Otherwise, an estate or trust with a balance date between 1 March and 30 September must pay its end-of-year income tax and any interest by 7 February 2023. An estate or trust with a balance date between 1 October and 28 February must pay its end-of-year income tax by the 7th day of the month before the following year's balance date. ird.govt.nz 76 Question 33 NZ Domestic Trust disclosure rules From the 2022 tax year onwards trusts are required to make additional disclosures with their annual returns.

Application for private ruling on transfer pricing arrangement – additional declaration IR713A January 2023 This declaration is for completion by all taxpayers applying for a ruling on a proposed, current or completed transfer pricing arrangement, and should be completed by the applicant, NOT a tax agent or accountant outside the applicant’s business. This form should always be completed in conjunction with and accompany the IR713 Application for Private Ruling form. Contact a Transfer Pricing Specialist at transfer.pricing@ird.govt.nz to discuss requirements and necessary information for the advance pricing agreement process before completing the application and this form. Please read the information on the back before completing this form. Applicant details Complete the details of the person to whom this ruling will apply. If this is a joint application, please ensure each applicant has completed a separate additional declaration form. IRD number of applicant (8 digit numbers start in the second box. ) Full name of applicant Address of applicant Street address/PO Box number Town/city Name of person signing this declaration Position/role held in applicant’s business Daytime phone number ( ) Declaration The person signing this declaration should be fully aware of the applicant’s transfer pricing arrangement, and hold a role in the applicant’s business with sufficient authority to make the declaration. I have fully examined the attached application and information and documents provided in connection with the application. To the best of my knowledge and belief, the information disclosed for the application is comprehensive. Signature of applicant(s) Date / / Transfer pricing agreement information Introduction: Transfer pricing is the setting of prices for the international transfer of goods, services and intangibles between associated parties \[one of whom is a New Zealand taxpayer\]. If these are manipulated profits may be shifted out of New Zealand. The purpose of New Zealand’s transfer pricing rules is to ensure that for tax purposes taxpayers price their international related- party dealings as truly independent parties would have done in the same situation, i.e. on an arm’s length basis. To provide certainty for taxpayers in relation to these international related-party dealings, New Zealand’s tax law provides for the issuing, upon application, of unilateral Advance Pricing Agreements (“APAs”) in the form of binding rulings. Bilateral and multilateral APAs may also be entered into in line with New Zealand’s double tax treaties. A unilateral APA is a ruling binding the Commissioner of Inland Revenue on an appropriate transfer pricing methodology to be applied to the taxpayer’s specified international related-party transactions over a fixed period. The legislation governing transfer pricing arrangements is contained in sections GC 6 - 13 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The legislation governing interest limitation rules related to transfer pricing arrangements is contained in sections GC 13 - 19 of the Income Tax Act 2007. In respect of Branches any allocations of income and expenditure are made in terms of section YD 5 of the Act. Issuing an APA: Inland Revenue will issue an APA when it is satisfied that the transfer pricing methodology to be used by the taxpayer results in an arm’s length price for the international related-party transactions. Further information on Inland Revenue’s approach can be found on our website ird.govt.nz/international-tax/business/transfer-pricing/practice-issues/advance-pricing-agreements Applying for an APA: The transfer pricing documentation and information provided by a taxpayer in connection with its application for a unilateral APA is central to the process of explaining and justifying the pricing methodology for its cross-border transactions. A taxpayer should be able to readily demonstrate to Inland Revenue that its transfer prices are consistent with the arm’s length principle. For this reason a taxpayer considering an application for an APA should contact a Transfer Pricing Specialist at transfer.pricing@ird.govt.nz to discuss the requirements and necessary information for the advance pricing agreement process before making the application. An application for an APA is made on Form IR713 and is to be accompanied by this additional declaration. Additional declaration: Section 91ED(1B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires an applicant for a private ruling on how sections GC 6 - 13 or YD 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007 applies, to state, in a notice signed by them and sent to the Commissioner at the same time as the application, that they have examined the application and to the best of their knowledge and belief the information disclosed for the application is comprehensive. Declaration explained: The additional declaration requires applicants for private rulings relating to advance pricing agreements to be more explicitly involved in the application process compared with other private ruling applications. This additional declaration is to ensure that a person holding a role in the applicant’s business with sufficient knowledge of the applicant’s international related-party transactions and transfer pricing methodology and having the necessary authority to make the declaration, is able to declare that the information provided to Inland Revenue in connection with the application is sufficiently expansive and complete.
Binding rulings How to get certainty on a tax position IR715 February 2020 BINDING RULINGS 2 This guide tells you what binding rulings are and the process for applying for one. It also gives some detail about when we can and can't give rulings. The information in this guide is based on Part 5A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Tax Administration (Binding Rulings) Regulations 1999. About this guide 3 ird.govt.nz About this guide 2 What is a binding ruling? 4 Why apply for a binding ruling? 4 Types of binding rulings 4 What you need to know 6 Who can apply for a ruling 6 Arrangements 6 Pre-lodgement meetings 6 When private and product rulings are not binding 7 How long it takes to consider a ruling application 7 How long a ruling applies for 7 Fees 8 How to apply for a private or product ruling 9 Application form 9 What to include in your application 9 What happens when we receive an application? 11 Draft ruling 11 Contrary view 11 Consultation 11 Publication of rulings 11 OECD information sharing 12 Withdrawing an application 12 Withdrawing a ruling 12 Correcting a ruling 12 What we can rule on 13 When we cannot rule 13 Determinations 16 Contact us 17 Appendix: Templates for private or product rulings 18 Contents BINDING RULINGS 4 A binding ruling is Inland Revenue's interpretation of how a tax law applies to a particular arrangement, person or item of property. This can be on any agreement, contract, plan or understanding (whether enforceable or not), including any steps and transactions that carry it into effect or it can be whether a person or item of property meets the requirements of the tax law. Binding rulings can provide certainty on the tax position for a wide range of transactions, from complex financing transactions to land subdivisions. Anyone can apply for a binding ruling on a transaction, but there are some restrictions on our ability to provide a binding ruling, as described on page 13. If a binding ruling applies to a taxpayer and they follow it, Inland Revenue is bound by it (provided that the facts are exactly as described in the ruling, and that the stipulated conditions are satisfied). A taxpayer is not required to follow the approach in the ruling. A binding ruling does not remove the requirement to file an income tax return and pay any taxes. We are required by law to charge a fee for preparing a private or product ruling. For questions concerning binding rulings email rulings@ird.govt.nz What is the purpose of a binding ruling? Binding rulings help taxpayers comply with the law and to meet their obligations under the law. They provide certainty about how Inland Revenue will interpret how the law applies to a specific transaction, person or item of property. They are especially useful where: • the law is unclear and there is more than one possible interpretation • new legislation applies to the transaction • the transaction is novel, sensitive or controversial • significant issues arise or may have a wide impact • the arrangement is a complex financing transaction. What is a binding ruling? Types of binding rulings There are five types of binding rulings: • public rulings • private rulings (including advance pricing agreements) • short-process rulings • product rulings • status rulings. We publish product and public rulings at IR’s website www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords Published Statements then select from your search results “How tax laws affect you”). Public rulings Public rulings interpret how a tax law applies to a specific type of arrangement that has a wide general application. If your circumstances match those in a public ruling and you meet any requirements in the ruling, Inland Revenue is bound to follow it. You may apply it, but you are not required to. You can suggest tax interpretation topic of broad interest, by email to public.consultation@ird.govt.nz Private rulings A private ruling gives a single taxpayer or group of taxpayers an interpretation of how the tax law applies to a particular arrangement, person or item of property. You must apply for a private ruling, and it is confidential to you and any other applicants. A private ruling only applies to the person(s) named in the ruling. The facts must be exactly as described in the ruling and the person must satisfy any stated conditions. Short-process rulings A short-process ruling is a quicker, less expensive way for individuals and organisations, with an annual gross income of $20 million or less, to apply for a binding ruling. The tax amount relating to the ruling application must be less than $1 million. A short-process ruling only applies to the person(s) named in the ruling. The facts must be exactly as described in the ruling and the person must satisfy any stated conditions. Short-process rulings have an online application process. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/spr 5 ird.govt.nz Product rulings A product ruling is an interpretation of how the tax law applies to a particular “product” or "consumers" of a "product" that is entered into by several people on identical terms. For example, a product ruling could be given on whether delivery drivers are employees or independent contractors. Product rulings can only be made where it isn't practicable to identify the relevant taxpayers, and whose characteristics will not affect the content of the ruling. A product ruling only applies to persons who transact as described in the ruling, and satisfy all stated conditions. Status rulings If a relevant tax law is amended or repealed, the person who applied for an existing private or product ruling can apply for a status ruling on whether that amendment or repeal changes the way that the law applies in the private or product ruling. Advance pricing agreements (APAs) APAs represent a cooperative approach to addressing transfer pricing compliance. They can produce significant time and cost savings for both tax authorities and multinationals in comparison with an audit. APAs encourage upfront taxpayer compliance and early resolution of potential disputes. They offer a practical solution to complex cases with difficult facts and circumstances. APAs are ideally suited to issues involving intangibles and specialised services which can result in a wide range of opinions as to pricing. Unilateral APAs can be issued in the form of a private ruling. Applicants for APAs must complete an Application for private ruling on transfer pricing arrangement - additional declaration (IR713A) form as well as an Application for private ruling (IR713) form. You can request assistance by sending an email to transfer.pricing@ird.govt.nz An application fee of $322 is payable for a private ruling. If any overseas travel is involved in completing an APA, we will provide an estimate of such costs prior to travel being undertaken and seek to recover "out of pocket" costs (transport, accommodation and meals) on an actual and reasonable basis from the taxpayer. BINDING RULINGS 6 Who can apply for a ruling Any person (including a company, trust and other unincorporated body) in their own right, or on behalf of a person who is yet to come into legal existence (like a company yet to be incorporated), can apply for a private or product ruling. The person must legally exist before the ruling can be issued. An agent can apply on behalf of a person(s), provided the agent has the written consent of the applicant(s). For private rulings, the applicant must be, or intend to be, a party to the arrangement or be the person affected, and can apply either individually or jointly with other persons who are parties to the arrangement. For product rulings, the applicant must be, or intend to be, a party to the arrangement or be a promoter of the proposed arrangement. What does it encompass? Most binding rulings apply to "arrangements" (although some situations may not require there to be an arrangement). An "arrangement" is any agreement, contract, plan or understanding (whether enforceable or not), and includes any steps and transactions that carry it into effect. It also includes background information Inland Revenue considers necessary or relevant for a private or product ruling. A private ruling may be made on either a single arrangement, person or item of property or a recurring arrangement. A recurring arrangement is a series of identical transactions the applicant enters into with any number of other parties, eg, selling TVs on hire purchase. We can issue private or product rulings on transactions that have been entered into, or proposed arrangements that are "seriously contemplated". We issue rulings on the basis of the information and facts provided to us. We may ask questions to clarify and confirm the facts provided. Inland Revenue can inquire into the correctness of the facts either before or after making the ruling. If the facts are incorrect, the ruling may not be binding. Pre-lodgement meetings The purpose of a pre-lodgement meeting (PLM) is to help you decide whether you want to apply for a ruling, and if so, to submit the best application possible. If you want a draft ruling within three months, you (or your agent) must contact us to arrange a PLM. In this discussion the requirement for a PLM may be waived, for example, if your application is a straightforward reissue of an existing ruling The PLM typically involves: • gaining a preliminary understanding of the issues • discussing the scope of the ruling you're looking for (which could help you to focus on the most important issues) • letting you know what information you'll need to supply with your application (eg, relevant documents, specific areas of analysis or transaction pre-tax and post-tax cash flows) • discussing our timeframes • telling you about our fees, that are payable irrespective of the outcome of your application. A PLM can help you decide whether you want to go ahead and apply for a ruling and help you submit the best application possible. Additional meetings We may have additional meetings with you while we consider an application, to help us understand and clarify factual matters, or to discuss any concerns we may have. What you need to know 7 ird.govt.nz When private and product rulings are not binding The main advantage of a private or product ruling is that it is binding on Inland Revenue. If a taxpayer applies the tax law in the way stated in the ruling, Inland Revenue must follow the ruling, provided the taxpayer satisfies all stipulated conditions. The applicant, however, is not required to follow the ruling. It is very important to note that a private or product ruling will not be binding on Inland Revenue if: • there's a material difference between the facts identified in the ruling and what is actually entered into or • the applicant materially omits or misrepresents information or • a stipulated condition in the ruling is not satisfied. Private and product rulings are only binding on the person(s) stated in the ruling. They are not binding for any other person or situation, no matter how similar the facts may be. If you need certainty on how the tax laws apply to a transaction, you will need a ruling on that specific transaction. Tax law changes A private or product ruling does not apply from the date a tax law is repealed or amended, if it changes the way the law applies in the ruling. If a relevant tax law changes and you have a private or product ruling, you can apply for a status ruling to determine the effect of the law change. How long it takes to consider a ruling application Private and product rulings Generally, we'll complete our consideration of your application and send you a draft ruling (or contrary view) within 10 weeks of receiving a complete application. However, the timeframe for delivering a draft ruling (or contrary view) becomes six months from the date we receive your application if: • it has more than eight legal issues or • we haven't had a PLM with you (unless we've waived that requirement) or • it's an APA. A contrary view will set out our conclusions and reasoning if we cannot make the ruling as requested. These timeframes exclude the time where we are waiting for: • confirmation of our estimated costs or • any information we've requested where we can’t progress the application without the information, and we’ve advised you or your agent that we’ve put the project on hold. If you have a genuine pressing need for your ruling more quickly than 10 weeks, we strongly recommend you tell us (and why). We will do our best to meet your timeframes, but we still need to be satisfied that the interpretation in a ruling is correct, so a shorter timeframe will not always be possible. Short-process rulings Generally, we'll complete our consideration of your application and send you a draft ruling (or contrary view) within 6 weeks of receiving a complete application. However, the timeframe for delivering a draft ruling (or contrary view) may take longer if it: • does not have enough information • requires consideration of several issues • is sent to us around the holiday period. If you have a genuine pressing need for a short-process ruling more quickly than 6 weeks, we strongly recommend you tell us (and why). We will do our best to meet your timeframes, but we still need to be satisfied that the interpretation in a ruling is correct, so a shorter timeframe will not always be possible. How long a ruling applies for Each private, product or short-process ruling specifies the period or tax year(s) it applies for, and only binds Inland Revenue for that period or tax year. In practice, we ordinarily issue private or product rulings for a period of three years. For information on when we will rule for a period other than three years, see QB 17/03: Tax Administration Act 1994 – the period for which a private or product ruling applies. BINDING RULINGS 8 Fees We are required by law to charge an application fee and an hourly fee for preparing private and product rulings. All fees quoted include GST. • The application fee of $322 covers the cost of reviewing your application to establish whether it is valid and complete and the first two hours working on your application. • Thereafter a fee of $161 per hour or part- hour for all applications is applied • For APAs, you are required to pay the application fee of $322 but no further fee is payable other than overseas travel costs if required (refer to APA pg 5). We will send you a written estimate of the likely cost of your ruling, usually within two weeks of receiving your application. We will not do any work on your application until we receive written confirmation approving our estimate. We can only provide an estimate of our fees, and not a guaranteed "price". If we find the complexity of the issues requires further time, we may increase our estimate and seek your approval to continue. The cost of a private or product ruling can vary significantly. As a guide, the cost for rulings ranges between $5,000 and $45,000. The average fee was approximately $15,000, reflecting the fact that many binding rulings relate to substantial commercial transactions. The fee for a short-process ruling application is $2,000 (GST inclusive). This is a flat fee, and must be paid in full at the time the application is submitted. Waivers of part of the fee The general principle is that fees are chargeable for private or product binding rulings based on the time it takes us to consider the application. However, we can waive part or all of the fee payable for a private or product ruling application if it is fair and reasonable to do so in the circumstances. In practice, we will only waive fees in limited circumstances. Ways to pay the fee You can pay your application fee electronically using your banks internet facility. If your bank does not yet have this facility you can still make internet payments through your bank using the following details: Bank Account Number Particulars (IRD #) Reference Payee Code Westpac Inland Revenue 03 0049 0001100 027 123-456-789 or 012-345-678 RUL blank 9 ird.govt.nz It is important you provide all relevant information as part of your ruling application, due to the binding nature of private and product rulings. We need to fully understand what is going on, how you consider the tax laws apply, and why you hold that view. Because private and product rulings are often about complex issues, and submissions need to be made on how the tax laws apply, your should consider using a professional tax advisor to help prepare your application. Short-process rulings have a simpler, online application process. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/spr Application form To apply for a private or product ruling, you need to complete one of the following application forms: • Application for private ruling (IR713) • Application for product ruling (IR714) An applicant for an APA must also complete an Application for private ruling on transfer pricing arrangement - additional declaration (IR713A) form. You can get these forms from our website or by calling 0800 257 773. What to include in your application We need all the relevant details and information. If we request further information, this could delay the time required to complete the ruling. If you don't give us sufficient information, we may decline to make a ruling. Remember that a ruling will not be binding on Inland Revenue if information has been omitted or misrepresented in some way in the application. By law, you must include the following in your application: • the identity of the person(s) who are applying for the ruling (the applicant(s)) • all relevant facts and documents • the tax laws you want a ruling on (see page 13 for the tax laws we can rule on) • the propositions of law (or legal arguments) relevant to the issues raised (see page 10) • a draft ruling (see example template in Appendix one). You also need to tell us: • the period(s) or tax year(s) which the application relates to, and • details of any ruling application that has been lodged about the arrangement for another period(s) or tax year(s). If you are an agent or applying on behalf of more of one person, you also need to have the written consent of the applicant(s) to apply on their behalf. If you're applying for a product ruling, you need to tell us why it isn't practicable to identify the other parties and why the characteristics of the taxpayers who may enter into the transaction will not affect the content of the ruling. If you are a promoter applying for a product ruling, you also need to provide us with a statutory declaration that you have disclosed all relevant facts, and that the facts are correct. Facts and documents You must give details of all the relevant facts and send copies of all documents relevant to the ruling, including: • the names of all of the parties to the arrangement (in addition to the applicant(s)), including the counterparties involved in any steps or transactions • a detailed description of the transactions and steps involved, including an explanation of what the arrangement is intended to achieve • copies of relevant legal documents or draft documents • recent financial statements for the applicant(s) (in some applications). Each different arrangement or fact situation requires a separate application. If you want a binding ruling on any alternatives, you must make separate applications and show you are "seriously contemplating" each one. We can ask you for further information at any time during the process. If, after a reasonable period, you don't provide this information, we may decline to make a ruling, and charge you for the time we've already spent on the application. You can decide to go ahead with the ruling at a later date, but you will have to apply again and provide us with the information we requested. Where the application of the tax laws depends on certain facts being true or certain events occurring, we may decide to include conditions in a ruling. The ruling will not be binding on Inland Revenue if you don't satisfy these conditions, and we can check whether this is the case after we've issued a ruling. How to apply for a private or product ruling BINDING RULINGS 10 Propositions of law (legal arguments) It is important that your application fully discusses any legal arguments that relate to the issues raised by your application. If you do not provide sufficient analysis, we might ask you for further submissions, or we might need to do additional research, which could add to our fees and the time taken. For an application for a private or product ruling, relevant propositions of law include: • sections of any legislation that are relevant to the application (including any relevant non-tax legislation, eg, the Companies Act 1993) • legal reasons and appropriate case law that support the interpretation of the section(s) you have adopted • possible arguments contrary to the interpretation you are seeking and legal reasons and authoritative support for these • other material or relevant matters or sources of information that Inland Revenue should know about. Draft ruling You need to include a draft ruling with your application. This helps us understand exactly what you want the ruling to cover and focuses our consideration on the key issues. See page 18 for a template to use in preparing your draft ruling. 11 ird.govt.nz Applications will be assigned to relevant business units within Inland Revenue based on the nature of the technical issues raised. If you are interested in how we allocate issues, see our allocation guidelines. Inland Revenue will: • do the legal analysis required within the agreed timeframe • contact you if there are questions or we need more information, • send you a draft ruling or a contrary view. Draft ruling If we agree in principle with the legal arguments and conclusions in your application, we'll send you a draft ruling for comment. The draft ruling will include a detailed description of the facts including any specified conditions we consider are necessary and set out our conclusions on how the tax laws apply. Contrary view If we consider that we cannot make the ruling as requested in your application, we will write to you, setting out our initial contrary views and their legal basis. This could happen if: • we do not agree with the legal arguments and conclusions in your ruling application • significant changes to your arrangement would be necessary for us to conclude that we can rule as requested • we would need to include significant conditions to rule favourably. Consultation Once you receive a draft ruling or contrary view, you will have the opportunity to provide us with comments. For draft rulings, you can comment on any factual matters, the wording of any specified conditions or our conclusions. We'll consider your comments and (if we agree) make any relevant changes to the draft ruling. When you have approved the content of the draft ruling, we will finalise it. If you receive a letter advising you of a contrary view, you will have one opportunity to make further arguments or submissions in response to our letter. We will also offer to meet you to discuss our views, either before or after sending the letter. We aim to respond to any substantive comments or submissions you make (about either a draft ruling or contrary view) within one month of receiving them. What happens when we receive an application? Publication of rulings We do not publish private rulings in any form. They are confidential between the applicant(s) and Inland Revenue. If a private ruling raises a topic of general interest, we may subsequently develop and issue a public ruling on that topic without referring to the details of the applicant(s). We are required by law to publish product rulings two months after the ruling has been made (signed) on Inland Revenue's website and in our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB). If you ask us to, we can publish it before the two months have passed. You may have a business reason for doing this, eg, you might want to refer to the product ruling in your advertising material. OECD information sharing Under Action 5 of the OECD’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action Plan, OECD and G20 countries, including New Zealand, are required to exchange information about taxpayer-specific rulings issued on cross-border activities. This will cover six categories of rulings as follows: (a) Taxpayer-specific rulings related to preferential regimes (although New Zealand does not have any preferential regimes). (b) Cross-border unilateral APAs and any other cross-border unilateral tax rulings covering transfer pricing or the application of transfer pricing principles. (c) Cross-border rulings providing for a unilateral downward adjustment to the taxpayer’s taxable profits that is not directly reflected in the taxpayer’s financial/commercial accounts. (d) Permanent establishment rulings, ie rulings concerning the existence or absence of, and/or the attribution of profits to, a permanent establishment by the country giving the ruling. (e) Related party conduit rulings. (f) Any other type of ruling that, in the absence of spontaneous information exchange, gives rise to BEPS concerns. This requirement covers all private and product rulings, APAs and financial arrangement determinations that come within the above criteria. The Commissioner is required to ensure that information regarding the relevant rulings is exchanged within three months of the ruling being issued. To protect the secrecy of taxpayer information, information will only be shared with countries where New Zealand has a double tax agreement in place, and with parties to the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters. BINDING RULINGS 12 Withdrawing an application You may withdraw your application at any time, for any reason, before a ruling is issued, by giving notice in writing. For example, you may want to withdraw your application if you decide not to proceed with the transaction, or if you receive a contrary view from us. You must pay any fees incurred up to the date we receive your written withdrawal. If one party withdraws from a joint application for a private or product ruling, we will not treat this as a withdrawal by all the applicants, unless it: • clearly affects the arrangement identified in the application, or • results in insufficient information being provided about the application. Withdrawing a ruling We can withdraw a product or private ruling at any time. We may do this if our interpretation of the law alters, if the courts reach a different conclusion about its meaning or to allow us to replace the ruling. We will notify the person who applied for the ruling that we have withdrawn it and give them details of what that means. For product rulings, we also publish a notice of withdrawal of product rulings on our website and in the TIB. Correcting a ruling If a private or product ruling has a typographical or minor error that doesn't change the ruling's meaning, we can correct it without having to withdraw the ruling. 13 ird.govt.nz What we can rule on Inland Revenue can make binding rulings on most provisions of the following Acts and regulations: • The Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 • The Gaming Duties Act 1971 • The Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 • The Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (except ss 12 and 13 of that Act) • The Income Tax Act 2007, except to the extent that the matter in question is or could be the subject of a determination of Inland Revenue in relation to: − a financial arrangement (other than as permitted by s91CC) − petroleum mining − accrual expenditure − depreciable property − specified livestock. • The Tax Administration Act 1994 (at s91CB and s91CC) sets out further situations where Inland Revenue may provide binding rulings in relation to the status of a person or item of property • An Order in Council or regulations made under any of the Acts listed above, including double tax agreements (unless the matter is or should be dealt with by the competent authority), except: − where the relevant provision is or could be the subject of one of the determinations referred to above; or − section RD 24 of the Income Tax Act 2007. When we cannot rule Inland Revenue cannot make binding rulings on the Tax Administration Act 1994, or any matter relating to the administration of the tax system, including Inland Revenue's rights or obligation to exercise its powers in any of the following areas: • imposing or remitting penalties • inquiring into the correctness of any return or other information supplied by any person • prosecuting, or • recovering debt owing by any person. Further, in some situations Inland Revenue is unable to issue a private or product ruling, as set out in the table on pages 14 and 15. If we determine that we are unable to rule because of one of these situations, we will treat the application as though it had been withdrawn. In some of these situations, although we are unable to give a binding ruling, we may be able to assist by providing a non-binding indicative view. BINDING RULINGS 14 Situations where we cannot or may not rule SituationDescription Not seriously contemplatedWe cannot make a private or product ruling if, at the time the application is made or at any time before the ruling is issued, we consider that the taxpayer is not "seriously contemplating" entering into the arrangement. Application contains insufficient information We cannot make a private or product ruling if the applicant does not give us sufficient information. We will ask for additional information if necessary, and if the information is not provided, we can decline to make a ruling. Facts and factual mattersExcept in the international transfer pricing context (ie, where the ruling is an APA), we cannot make a private or product ruling determining a "proscribed question". "Proscribed question" is defined as meaning: (a) whether facts are correct or exist: (b) what is a person's purpose or intention, for the purposes of any provision of the Income Tax Act 2007, that expressly refers to a person's purpose or intention, other than as permitted by s 91CB of the Tax Administration Act 1994: (c) what is the value of a thing: (d) what is commercially acceptable practice, for the purposes of any provision of that Act that expressly refers to commercially acceptable practice. As part of your application, you must provide all material facts. Where this is not possible, we can make conditions or statements of fact as to future facts in the ruling itself. If the Commissioner issues you with a draft ruling containing a specified condition or material fact, you may be able to obtain a level of certainty through the factual review process (see page 16). Generally accepted accounting practice We cannot make a private or product ruling if the application would require us to form an opinion on the application of generally accepted accounting practice. Frivolous or vexatious applications We cannot make a private or product ruling if the application is "frivolous or vexatious". "Frivolous" applications are not just ones that are "trifling" or "silly"; they include requests which could not possibly succeed, or which no reasonable person could treat as genuine. Private or product ruling already exists If a private or product ruling already exists on the application of a specific tax law to a particular arrangement, we cannot give another ruling on the same tax law for the same period covered by the existing ruling. However, a further ruling can be issued for subsequent periods or tax years if the arrangement continues after the duration of the previous ruling or is in relation to a different tax law. Double tax agreement procedures An arrangement may have tax implications in another country with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement (DTA). We are able to rule on DTAs, unless the matter is (or should be) dealt with by the competent authority under a DTA. We will consult with the competent authority before issuing a ruling concerning a DTA. We are unable to rule on an issue that is within the scope of a mutual agreement made under a DTA, or on the interpretation of a mutual agreement. Go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword: QB 08/03 then tick "Technical Tax only"). The tax, duty, or levy is due and payable We cannot issue a private ruling if the matter on which the ruling is sought concerns a tax (excluding provisional tax), duty, or levy that is due and payable, unless we receive the application before the tax (excluding provisional tax), duty, or levy is due and payable. The correct way to challenge any tax assessed is through the disputes resolution and/or challenge process. 15 ird.govt.nz SituationDescription Assessment already madeWe cannot make a private ruling if an assessment relating to the person, the arrangement, and a period or a tax year to which the proposed ruling would apply, has been made. This includes where a taxpayer has filed a return, due to this being a self-assessment. See www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword: QB 08/01 then tick "Technical Tax only"). Again, in such cases, the disputes resolution process is the correct avenue to follow. The only exception to this is if Inland Revenue received the application before the assessment was made. Subject to an audit or investigation We cannot issue a private ruling if we are auditing or investigating how the taxation law applies to the person and to the arrangement for a period or for a tax year to which the proposed ruling would apply. See www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword: QB 07/05 then tick "Technical Tax only"). Any disputes about subsequent assessments can be challenged through the disputes resolution process. Notice of proposed adjustmentWe are unable to issue a private ruling if the application relates to a person, an arrangement, and a tax type or separately identifiable issue that is the subject of a notice of proposed adjustment under the tax dispute resolution process Arrangement subject to an objection, challenge or appeal If the arrangement on which the ruling is sought, or a separately identifiable part of the arrangement, is substantially the same as an arrangement that is subject to an objection, challenge or appeal, whether in relation to the applicant or any other person, we can decline to make a private or product ruling. Debt exists for previous rulingWe can refuse to issue a private or product ruling to an applicant with an outstanding debt for a past ruling application. An applicant has an outstanding debt if they have not paid the amount stated on an invoice for an earlier binding ruling, on or before 60 days after the date stated on the invoice. Resource constraintsWe can decline to make a private or product ruling if we do not have sufficient resources to do so. This would normally only happen if a particular application required very extensive resources, or highly specialised expertise that was unavailable at the time of the application or in the foreseeable future. ReconstructionWe can decide not to make a private ruling on how sGA1 (Commissioner's power to adjust) of the Income Tax Act 2007 applies or would apply to an arrangement. BINDING RULINGS 16 Determinations Generally, we are unable to rule if an issue is or could be the subject of a determination in relation to a financial arrangement, petroleum mining, accrual expenditure, depreciable property, livestock or record keeping. In relation to the financial arrangements rules, we can issue taxpayer specific determinations on certain matters set out in the legislation (provided no general determination applies). The matters that can be determined include: • how a spreading method applies to a financial arrangement • the method for determining what portion of the income or loss is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement • the method for determining the future value of property. We may also be able to rule on some of these situations under s91CC of the Tax Administration Act 1994. We treat applications for determinations in the same way as private rulings, except that they are published. Please contact us for details on how to apply for a determination. Factual review The factual review has been established to enhance the utility of binding rulings in situations where a ruling is, or is likely to be, issued subject to a critical factual condition. The process will give taxpayers an opportunity to obtain a level of certainty from Inland Revenue about the likelihood that the condition will be satisfied. Find out more about the factual review process at www.ird.govt.nz (keywords: "factual review" then tick "Technical Tax only"). 17 ird.govt.nz For more information or to apply for a ruling (except for short-process rulings), please contact: Tax Counsel Office Inland Revenue PO Box 2198 Wellington Email: rulings@ird.govt.nz You can get application forms for private or product rulings from our website, or by calling 0800 257 773.
